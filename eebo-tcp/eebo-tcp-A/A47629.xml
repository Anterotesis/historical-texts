            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

did any Parliament enter into so solemne a

That was a worthy Speech of a Germane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
writing to <hi>Oecolampadius, Veniat verbum

colla:</hi> As Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> passed in Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall
State through the Streets of <hi>London</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her Coronation, when the Bible was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

her hands, and kissing it laid it to her breast,
saying, <hi>that the same had ever beene her chiefest
delight, and should be the rule by which She meant
to frame her Government.</hi> You have likewise
covenanted to reforme the Church accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word of God, the best Rule both
for a Personall and Ecclesiasticall Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There is a double generall subject of
reformation. 1. Corrupt persons, 2. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
things. You have cast out a scandalous
Ministry; labour to settle (I beseech you) in
all the three kingdoms Pious &amp; able Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Christ (the great Reformer of his Church
<hi>Mal. 3. 2 Matth.</hi> 3. 12.) specially purgeth


<pb facs="tcp:107075:5"/>
the Sonnes of <hi>Levi Mal.</hi> 3. 1. because he hath
appointed them the office of purging others.
secondly the ordinances of God must be both
Pure and Perfect in a compleate Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
You have cast out a great deale of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish;
O that the House of God might be
built. It was a blemish upon some of those
reformations mentioned in Scripture, that
the high places were not taken away, and
that their reformation needed a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
God did much honour King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
a Childe, and Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in making them the beginners of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
reformation. O that the Lord would be
pleased by you to perfect what they begun,
that Christs government, worship, and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
might be set up in the three Kingdoms.
In the times of our troubles, peace and truth
have beene joyned together in our Prayers
and Capitulations; O let them never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,
<hi>I will reveale unto them the abundance
of peace and truth</hi> Jer. 33. 6. and the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 9. 3.</note>complaines, that there <hi>were none valiant

You have covenanted to <hi>extirpate heresies
and whatsoever is contrary to sound doctrine.</hi> In
your first Declaration, there is this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
passage, It is farre from our purpose or
desire, to let loose the golden reines of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and government in the Church, to
leave private persons or particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
to take up what forme of divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they please; for we hold it requisite that
there should be through-out the whole
Realme a conformity to that order which
the Lawes enjoyne according to the word of
God. God hath done great things for you
and by you, and therefore he expects great
things from you. It was a noble resolution
in our <hi>Josiah, Edward</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, when he was
pressed by Bishop <hi>Ridly</hi> and others to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
his Sister <hi>Masse</hi> in her owne Chapell, he
would not (though importuned) yeeld there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
saying, He should dishonour God in it;
but being much pressed by them he burst into
teares, and they thence concluded, that he
had more divinity in his little finger then


<pb facs="tcp:107075:6"/>
they in all their bodies; O that you would
study to premote Gods glory, and be zealous

unhappily plundered of my Bookes and Manuscripts,
(which I esteemed as a precious treasure) recovering
this twice with some others, I did resolve (for preventing
any future dammages in that kind) to transcribe it faire
for the Presse, which was the worke of a whole yeere. I
know first the subject is very necessary for all Christians
to search into, and I have perused all the best writers I
could find, that I might handle it fully common-place wise,
according to the excellency of the Theme. I have made
use also of some Manuscrips of three<note n="*" place="margin">M. <hi>Pemble</hi> my learned Tutor, Master <hi>Wheattly</hi> my Reverend Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, M. <hi>Ball</hi> my worthy friend.</note> worthy men, now
with God, (whose memory I shall ever honour) for the
compleating of the worke. I have gleaned a few obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
from some of the worthy Lecturers in Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
from M. <hi>Ley</hi> of Budworth in his Lectures in the
City, and from divers others of the Assembly, in their
printed Sermons. This worke I conceive may be
beneficiall for these purposes: Chiefly for setling and
establishing of Christians in some maine principles of
Divinity, <hi>viz. that there is a God,</hi> against the Atheists
of these times; <hi>that the Scripture is the Word of
God,</hi> against the Anti-Scripturists; <hi>that Christ is God,</hi>
against all Arrians, Socinians, and other Heretickes

(without this, preaching is to no purpose)
which though it makes the least shew, yet it is of
greatest use; it establisheth men, and keepes them
firme from wavering.</p>

they are compared to Nurses, wise Stewards, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

of Families also must instruct their servants
which are ungrounded as children. Christ instructed
his Apostles, he taught them how to pray, he being
the Master of the family, and they his family, as
appeareth, because he did eate the Passeover toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with them; and the Law appoints that every
family should celebrate that feast together. The
reason why God specifieth not this point in the
masters duty, is, because if it be performed by the
father, it shall be needlesse, seeing it is done to the
masters hand; but if the father neglect it, surely


<pb facs="tcp:107075:14"/>
the master which succeeds in the fathers roome,
and hath his authority, must see it done. For as a
father in <hi>Israel</hi> was bound to see his owne sonne cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 12, 13.</note>so he was bound to see his servant cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised;

            <p>The exercise of catechizing hath been proved
to be most ancient, and very necessary and usefull;
and therefore it should be alwaies continued in the

thereof.</p>

in the preface to the catechisme of the Councell of

them is by catechizing, and let us looke that we
loose not our ground againe for want of it. <hi>Julian</hi>

            <p>These points (said a reverend Divine now with
God) are twelve; three concerning God, three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
man, three concerning the Redeemer, three
concerning the meanes of attaining good by this
Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Concerning God.</p>
            <p>1 There is one God which is an Infinite, Perfect,
and Spirituall essence.</p>
            <p>2 This one God is distinguished into three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
or manners of subsistence after an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
way, which we believe but cannot perfectly
understand. The Father begetting, the Sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and the holy Ghost proceeding.</p>
            <p>3 This one God, the Father, Sonne, and Holy
Ghost, is the maker, preserver, and governour of all
things, by his wisdome, power, justice, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Concerning man.</p>
            <p>1 That he was made by God of a visible body,
and an immortall and spirituall soule, both so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and good in their kinds<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that he was perfectly
able to have attained eternall life for himselfe, which
was provided as a reward of his obedience.</p>
            <p>2 That being thus made he yeelded to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Devill and did voluntarily sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God in eating of the Tree forbidden, and so
became a child of wrath and heire of cursing, an
enemy to God, and slave to the devill, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able


<pb facs="tcp:107075:17"/>
to escape eternall death, which was provided as
a recompence of his disobedience.</p>
            <p>3 That he doth propagate this his sinfulnesse and
misery to all his posterity.</p>
            <p>Concerning Christ.</p>
            <p>1 That he is perfect God, and perfect man, the
second Person in the Trinity, who tooke the nature
of man from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and united it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in one personall subsistence, by an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
union.</p>
            <p>2 That in mans nature he did die and suffer in
his life and death, sufficient to satisfie Gods justice,
which man had offended, and to deserve for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
remission of sinnes, and life everlasting; and
that in the same nature he rose againe from the
dead, and shall also raise up all men to receive
judgement from him at the last day, according to
their deeds.</p>
            <p>3 That he is the onely sufficient and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and no other merit must be added unto
this, either in whole or part.</p>
            <p>Lastly, concerning the meanes of applying the
Redeemer, they are three.</p>
            <p>1 That all men shall not be saved by Christ, but
onely those that are brought to such a sight and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their owne sinfulnesse and misery, that with
sorrow of heart they doe bewaile their sinnes, and
renouncing all merits of their owne, or any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
cast themselves upon the mercy of God, and
the onely merits of Jesus Christ, which to doe is to
repent and believe, and in this hope live holily all
the remainder of their life.</p>
            <p>2 That no man is able thus to see his sinnes by


<pb facs="tcp:107075:18"/>
his owne power, renounce himselfe, and rest upon
Christ, but God must worke it in whom he pleaseth
by the cooperation of his Spirit regenerating and
renewing them.</p>
            <p>3 That for the working of this faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and direction of them in a holy life, he hath
left in writing by the Prophets and Apostles infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
guided to all truth by his Spirit, all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be done or believed to salvation, and
hath continued these writings to his people in all
ages.</p>
            <p>Observe those places <hi>Acts 15. 11. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Let
a man hold this, that there was nothing but death
in the world till Christ came, and that he is come
to save horrible sinners, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. Secondly,
there is a practicall place,<note place="margin">As there are in points of <hi>faith, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> so there are in points of <hi>practice fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall duties.</hi> M. <hi>Raynolds</hi> on 14 of Hos. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 8. Let us 1. See
our selves dead without Christ, and wholy trust in
him. 2. Let us be exemplary in our lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations.
There are other Fundamentals which
are onely comparatively necessary, that is expected
from one man which is not expected from another;
and more from those that live in the Church. Have
these six principles of the Apostle not onely in your
heads, but hearts. 1. That a man is dead in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
2. That his remedy lies out of himselfe.
3. Know the doctrine of the Sacraments. 4. The
Word of God. 5. Have some apprehension of the
life to come. 1. That there is a passage from death
to life. 2. That there is a fixed and irrevokable
estate after this life. Hold the doctrine of faith so,
that Christ may live in you, and you be delivered
up into that forme of doctrine, lay hold on life
eternall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107075:18"/>
Secondly, there are some particular principles.
There is a naturall light and supernaturall. The
light of nature teacheth some principles: That,
<hi>you must doe as you would be done by,</hi> that <hi>no man hates
his owne flesh,</hi> that <hi>one must provide for his family,</hi>
that <hi>there is a God,</hi> and <hi>one God,</hi> that <hi>he is to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and reverenced above all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Supernaturall, Let all our actions be done, 1. in
love, 2. in humility, 3. in faith, 4. in God; this the
Gospell teacheth.</p>
            <p>Shew your selves Christians in power,<note place="margin">Corrolaries.</note> go beyond
the Heathen in practising the good rules of nature.
1. Be carefull to make a wise choice of principles;
one false principle admitted, will let in many errors;
and erroneous principles will lead men into errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practises.</p>
            <p>2. Labour to act your principles, if you captivate
the light, God wil put it out.</p>
            <p>3. Be sure you worke according to your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
we pitty another in an errour when he follows
his principles.</p>
            <p>Here is an apology for those teachers which tread
in <hi>Pauls</hi> steps, are carefull to lay the foundation
well. It was the observation of our most judicious
King JAMES, <hi>That the cause why so many fell to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and other errours, was their ungroundednesse in
points of Catechisme.</hi>

Heresie is not every errour, but errour in matter of
Faith; nor every errour in matter of Faith; (for
neither Jewes nor Pagans are said to be Hereticks,
though they erre most damnably in those things
which every one that will be saved must believe;
and with all the malice, fury and rage that can be
imagined, impugne the Christian faith and verity)
but it is the errour of such as by some kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
have been Christians; so that onely such as by
profession being Christians, depart from the truth of
Christian Religion, are named Heretickes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the danger of Heresie. Heresie is a
fruit of the flesh,<note place="margin">Errours are practicall or doctrinall onely, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall or circa-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or neither of the two.</note>

               <pb facs="tcp:107075:20"/>
which erreth in those things which every one is
bound particularly to believe, because such things
doe essentially and directly concerne the matter of
of our salvation, and he is without any further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
to be pronounced an Hereticke, and the very
errour it selfe is damnable; as if a man (saith he) shall
deny Christ to be the Sonne of God, coessentiall,
coequall, and coeternall with his Father; or that
we have remission of sinnes by the effusion of his

them, and in the manner before mentioned; such
are and ought (say some worthy Protestants)
to be punished by the Christian Magistrate with
death.</p>
            <p>They reason thus from the Office of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
Every Magistrate may and ought to punish
offenders; and the more pernicious the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are, the more hainous ought the punishment
to be.</p>
            <p>That the Magistrate is both <hi>custos ac vindex

either that Heretickes doe not doe ill; or, that

            <p>From the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. both <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>
collect, that the Magistrate is constituted by God,
not onely a preserver of the second Table, but also

            <p>For the inforceing of this Argument from these

               <p>The fourth and last thing in the definition is the end of
Divinity, which is, 1. chiefest, the glory of God, 2. next, a good
and blessed life, or eternall salvation, begun in this life by
the communion of grace and holinesse, but perfected in the
life to come by the fruition of glory. This end hath divers
names in Scripture, it is called <hi>the knowledge of God, John</hi> 17.
3. <hi>partaking of the Divine nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Pet. 1. 4. Likenesse to God,
1 John 3. 2. Eternall salvation,</hi> the vision and fruition of God,

               <p>The next end of Divinity in respect of man is eternal life or
salvation, of which there are two degrees, 1. more imperfect &amp;
begun in this life, which is called consolation, the chiefest joy
and peace of conscience arising, 1. from a confidence of the
pardon of sinnes and the punishments due to sinnes. 2. From
the beginning of our sanctification and conformity with God,
with a hope and taste of future perfection in both. 2. More
perfect and consummate after this life, arising from a full
fruition of God, when the soule and body shall be perfectly
united with God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the generall it is to be handled methodically. There is
a great necessity of methode in Divinity, that being usefull
both to enlighten the understanding with the clearnesse of

memory more weake in retaining. There is a different way of
handling Divinity, according to the severall kinds of it. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
is threefold.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Succinct</hi> and briefe, when Divine truth is summarily
explained and confirmed by reasons, and this Divinity is called
Catecheticall, Systematicall.</p>

                  <p>That the Scriptures were from God, may appeare by reasons
contained in or cleaving to the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>1. From the excellency of their matter, which is Heavenly,
the divine and supernaturall matter contained in it. It telleth
us of such things as doe farre exceed the reach of mans reason,
and which it was impossible for any man to counterfeit and
faine, and which being told are so correspondent to reason,
that no man can see just cause to call them into question; as
the doctrine of creation of all things in six daies; the doctrin
of the fall of our first parents; the story of the delivering <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the delivering of the Law and ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;
the doctrine of the incarnation of Christ Jesus,
of the resurrection of the dead, of the last judgement, of the
life to come, and of the immortality of the soule; for though
this last was taught also by Philosophers, yet it is so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and unperfectly handled by them in comparison of the
delivering thereof in Scripture, that it is apparent, it was
another Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which guided the teachers of it here, then they
were guided withall. What Angell could ever have found out
such an admirable temper and mixture of mercy and justice
together, as the Gospel revealeth in the reconciliation of God
with man? God in giving and establishing his law useth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
preface but <hi>I am the Lord, Exod.</hi> 20. nor conclusion but <hi>I the
Lord have spoken it;</hi> upon his absolute authority without other
reasons to perswade, commanding what is to be done, though


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107075:28"/>
it be contrary to our natures; forbidding what is to be left
undone, though pleasing to us; he promiseth things incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible,
requiring faith; he relateth and teacheth things
strange, above likelihood, above mans capacity; and yet will
have them to be believed, to be understood. There is nothing
in the Law against reason or common equity. A Jesuit reports
in his History, that when his fellows came first to preach in the
East-Indies, the Gentiles and Indies there hearing the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
did much commend the equity of them. See Sir
<hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> History.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth the nature and excellency of God, and the works
of God, more clearly and distinctly than any other writings,
nay, then any without God could have contrived, <hi>viz.</hi> That
there are three persons and one God; that God is infinite,
omniscient, omnipotent, most holy; that he created all things,
that he doth by a particular providence rule all things; that
he observes all mens actions, and will call them to account,
and give every man according to his works; that he alone is to
be worshipped, and that he must be obeyed in his word above all
creatures.</p>

4. The end of the Scripture is Divine,<note place="margin">John 7. 18. &amp; 5. 41. &amp; 8. 50, 54.

                     <hi>viz,</hi> the glory of God,
shining in every syllable thereof, and the salvation of man,
not temporall, but eternall. These writings lead a man wholy
out of himselfe, and out of the whole world, &amp; from and above
all the creatures to the Creator alone, to give him the glory
of all victories: therefore they are from him, and not from
any creature; for he that is the Authour of any writing will
surely have most respect of himselfe in that writing. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

                  <p>5. Another reason is from the difference of these writings
from all other whatsoever, in regard of their phrase and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of writing. All other writings use perswasive and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing

all other religions, all other writings, and command these
onely to be had in request and esteem, and acknowledged as

every conscience to be subject to them, and to prepare himself
to obedience, without any further objecting or gainsaying, and

is generally confessed, that onely the Divine essence can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

we must confesse to have their birth from Heaven and
from God. Now in the Scripture we have divers such predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
The two principall and clearest which are most obvious
and evident, are, 1. the conversion of the Gentiles to the God
of Israel by meanes of Christ. For that was foretold exceeding
often, and plainly, <hi>in him shall the Gentiles trust, and he shall be
a light to the Gentiles. Jacob</hi> lying on his death-bed said, <hi>the
obedience of the Gentiles shall be to him;</hi> and <hi>David, all the ends of

Gentiles trust;</hi> and <hi>Malachy, my name shall be great to the ends of
the earth.</hi> See <hi>Esay 49. 6. &amp;</hi> 60. 3, 5. Scarce one of the Prophets
but have spoken of the conversion of the Gentiles. Now we
see the Gentiles turned from their Idols a great number of
them, and embracing the God of the Jewes, and the Scriptures
of the Jewes by means of Christ,<note place="margin">Veritas vati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Experience teacheth, that all heresies either began or
increased from the misunderstanding of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Scripture it selfe doth give testimony to it selfe,
that it is divine; it is called a light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. because it
discovers it selfe; <hi>the testimony,</hi> and <hi>the testimony of the Lord:</hi>
because it beares witnesse to it selfe. The Prophets give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

as appeares, Chap. 4. v. 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, none of all these arguments can undoubtedly
perswade the heart <hi>certitudine fidei,</hi> that the holy Scripture,
or any doctrine contained in it is the word of God, till we

Other arguments may convince, but this is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
this is alsufficient to perswade certainly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 25.
The Holy Ghost is the authour of light, by which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Scripture, and the perswader of the heart, by which
we believe the things therein to be truly divine, 1 <hi>John 5. 6.
It is the Spirit that beareth witnesse, because the Spirit, (i.</hi> metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically
the doctrine delivered by the Spirit) <hi>is truth.</hi> So to
prove that there is a God, reasons may be brought from nature
and the testimony of the Church, but no man can believe it
savingly, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to carry the matter even between the Socinians
reason, and the Famalists spirit. Socinians wil have nothing but
reason, no infused habits, &amp; so they destroy the testimony of the
spirit; the Familists wil have nothing but Spirit they rest wholy
in an immediate private spirit,<note place="margin">1 John 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>There are three that bear witnesse in

                     <hi>But ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all
things.</hi> That is, ye have received from Christ the Holy Ghost
the Comforter, and he hath taught and instructed you in all
things which are necessary to the salvation of your soules, for
you to know and be instructed in, see V. 27. The testimony
is made up by arguing, whosoever believeth, and is sanctified
shall be saved. So the antiquity, efficacy, and Majesty of the
Scripture, the fidelity of the Penmen, and its wonderfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
prove it to be the word of God. The Spirit of God
witnesseth, that this word which hath these remarkable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
above all other writings, is the word of God. The
Spirit doth neither witnesse concerning my salvation, nor
that the Scripture is the word of God immediately but ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately.
Because I am a believer, and my faith is sound, it assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
me that I am in the state of salvation, and so he maketh
use of the excellencies in the word to irradiate my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

                  <p>Nothing is more repugnant to prudence and policy. What

to cut a poore child as soon as he came into the world. Two

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107075:35"/>
now God is the authour of these writings, <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi>
therefore such authority as he hath, such must they have, a

is subject to none. So this acknowledgement of their originall
teacheth that we must not believe them for the authority sake
of any man or men, for Gods word can borrow no authority

the Papists that one can hardly exchange three words with
them, but they will produce them. It is true indeed, that we
may at the first be much moved to receive and hearken to the
Scriptures, because the Church gives testimony of them, as the
woman of Samaria by her speeches of Christ was a meanes of
moving the Samaritans to believe, but when the men of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria
had heard Christ himselfe speake, they believed in him
more for his own words then the womans, <hi>John</hi> 4. 39, 41. In
which sence those words of <hi>Austin</hi> (so frequently quoted by
the Papists) are to be interpreted. <hi>Austin</hi> spake this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
being a Manichee<note n="*" place="margin">So <hi>Musculus, Calvin, Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Whitaker</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound those words; observe the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to more with other things.</note>; when he was a Manichee he was first
moved by the authority of the Church to believe the Gospell.
His meaning is, that he had never believed the Gospell, if the
authority of the Church had not been an introduction unto
him, not that his faith rested upon it as a finall stay, but that
it caused him so farre to respect the word of the Gospell to
listen unto it, and with a kind of acquisite and humane faith
to believe it, that he was thereby fitted<note n="a" place="margin">

in a matter of such consequence, should be of that force, it is
strange.</p>
                  <p>We deny not the ministery of the Church as an externall

the authority of the Church to be the principall<note n="*" place="margin">Ecclesia non habet magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um supra scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas sed mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterium circa Scripturas.</note> meanes.
When we call the Scriptures Canonicall, we call them not so
passively, because they are received into the Canon by men,
and accepted of; but actively, because they prescribe a Canon

The office of the Church in respect of the Scripture stands in
foure things.</p>
                  <p>1. To distinguish Canonicall Scripture from that which is
not Canonicall;<note place="margin">There are two causes why the Apocripha are cast out of the canon, 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing, and the quality of the Authours. 2.

                  <p>2. To be a faithfull keeper of those books which are inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God, like a notary which keepeth publique writings.</p>
                  <p>3. To publish, declare and teach the truth, as a cryer with
a loud voyce ought to pronounce the Kings edicts, but to

Tables, and so hang them upon pillars of stone, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

market Towns. The Apostle describing the Church, likeneth
it to one of these pillars, whose use was to shew what hung
thereon. It is pillar, not because it <hi>holds up,</hi>

truth.</p>
                  <p>4. To interpret the Scripture by the Scripture. Since many
things in Scripture are doubtfull, and hard to be understood
without an Interpreter, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 31. it doth belong to the
Church to expound the same, to interpret and give the sence,

                  <p>The testimony and tradition of the Church, especially the

suffer them to be read at all, of late they are forced to give
licences to some, and they teach them, that they should not
make the Scripture judge of the doctrine and practice of the
Church, but the doctrine and practise of the Church must be
the interpreter and judge of the meaning of the Scripture; that
is, they must take the Scripture to meane none otherwise
(whatsoever it seem to say) then what is agreeable to that
which the Pope doth teach and practice. There cannot be a
surer signe of a bad cause, then that it feares to be tried by
the writings which it selfe cannot deny to be written by
God, for correction, for reproofe, for instruction, in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.

any devout Christian not to read them, that it should rather
incite them to greater diligence therein; and therefore he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
compares the Scripture to a River, wherein (saith he)
there are as well shallow fords for Lambs to wade in, as depths
and gulphs wherein the Elephant may swim.</p>

de Paula in Epitaphio.</hi> The Apostle would not have commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
this in <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15. that from his childhood he
knew the holy Scriptures, nor noted it to the praise of his
grand-mother and mother, that they had trained him up so, if
he had not known that the holy Scriptures are so plaine that
even a child may be able to understand them. What may we
judge of the other easier bookes, when the holy Ghost would
have the Revelation, the obscurest booke of all the Scripture
to be read <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 3. The people tooke occasion of erring and

                  <p>2. By this reason the Latine Bibles should not be suffered to
be read publiquely, because many understanding Latine from
the reading of them may take occasion of erring. There is a
greater reason to be had of Gods elect which are edified by
reading of the Scripture, then of those who wrest them; <hi>Peter</hi>
by this reason stirred up the faithfull to read the Scriptures
with greater devotion, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>3. This is common both to the Ecclesiasticall persons and
Laity, to take occasion of erring, and blaspheming from the
Scripture. If we peruse the Histories of times past, we shall
finde that learned and Ecclesiasticall men, did oftner fall into
heresies and blasphenies from misunderstanding and wresting
the Scriptures, then any of the common sort of people, who
were often also by the learned drawn into heresie. The Papists

After we have read and understood the Scripture, we must
1. give thanks to God for the right understanding of it, and
pray him to imprint the true knowledge of it in our hearts,
that it may not fall out. 2. We must meditate in the word of
God now understood, and so fix it in our minds. One de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines

things to mind or remembrance, and discoursing of them, that
they might be the better understood, retained, affected, and

apply to his owne soule some necessary truth of Gods word,
till the mind be informed, and the heart affected, as the nature
thereof requires, and is the wholesomest and usefullest of all
exercises of piety. This is to ingrast the word into ones soule,
to give the seed much earth; this is to bind it to the Tables of

in that Story the Regiment of Judges was described in one
Booke, so in this Story, of which these two are but one part,
the Regiment of Kings is described: this is the reason of the
first Title. The other likewise of the first and second of <hi>Samuel</hi>
is given unto it, 1. Because there is very frequent mention
made of <hi>Samuel</hi> therein, he being a principall subject of the
first part thereof. 2. Because it continueth the narration so
farre, till the infallible truth of <hi>Samuels</hi> principall Prophesie
(which seemed to remaine in great doubtfulnesse, at least when
he ended his daies) was fully accomplished in establishing the
Kingdome upon the person and family of <hi>David</hi> the sonne
of <hi>Jesse.</hi>

They are called Propheticall Bookes, because they were

He brings so many and such evident Testimonies of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
incarnation, miracles, preaching, life, passion, death and
resurrection of Christ, that he seemes rather to write a History
of things past, then to prophesie of things to come, and one
calls him the fifth Evangelist. Hence (saith <hi>Senensis)</hi> our
Lord Jesus Christ made choice of this among all the Prophets,
first of all to read publikely, and expound in the Synagogue of
his own Country; and in the new Testament, he is oftner
cited, then all the rest of the Prophets. He began to Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in the yeare 3160 seven hundred yeares before Christ was
borne, <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King of <hi>Judah</hi> yet reigning, and came to
the last times of <hi>Hezekiah, Isay</hi> 1. 1. and 39. 3. therefore he
was almost contemporary with <hi>Hosea, Ames,</hi> and <hi>Micha,</hi> and
finished the course of his life under foure Kings of <hi>Judath,</hi> viz.
<hi>Vzziah, Jathan, Achaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezehiab;</hi> The Hebrewes say
he was of the Bloud Royall, and that he was sawed to death

he taught 60 yeares. His Prophesie consists of 66 Chapters.</p>

               <p>Amongst all the Evangelists, there is a Generall agreement,
and a speciall difference; they all agree in the maine scope and
Subject, Christ; they differ in the speciall argument and order.
All describe the life of Christ, some more largely, some more
briefely, some more loftily, some more plainely, yet because


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107075:54"/>
all were inspired by the same Spirit, they all have equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
The difference of Evangelists in some smaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

truth; for had they conspired all together to have deceived the
world, they would in all things have more fully agreed.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the Covenant of grace is more plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
the will of God, and way to salvation more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
set down in the new Testament, then ever it was in the
daies of <hi>Moses</hi> or the Prophets; and in these bookes of the new
Testament all things are so established as to continue to the
end, so that we must not looke for any new revelation.</p>
               <p>All these Bookes we receive as Canonicall, because they are
divine for matter and forme, divinely inspired by God, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
and given to the Church for their direction, written by
the Apostles or Apostolicall men, sweetly consenting with
other parts of holy Scripture, and with themselves; received
alwaies by the greatest part of the Church of God. They were
written after the death of Christ, by the direction of the holy
Ghost; the Apostles by lively voyce first preached, because it
was needfull that the doctrine of the Gospell should by their
preaching, as also by signes and wonders be confirmed against
the contradictions and cavils of the Jewes and Gentiles, and
allowed by the assent of believers generally before it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to writing, that we might be assured of the certainty of
those things which were written.</p>
               <p>These bookes are acknowledged Canonicall both by us and

they have</p>
               <p>1. An Inscription: wherein is the name of the writer, and
of them to whom he writes, and his wish.</p>
               <p>2. The matters of the Epistle, which are sometimes meerly
religious, concerning certaine Articles of faith, or piety of
life, or about the use of things indifferent; or else familiar
things, witnessing their mutuall good will.</p>
               <p>3. The conclusion: in which are exhortations, saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

travelled to Macedonia, but it is not manifest which was
the first.</p>
               <p>First Epistle to <hi>Timothy)</hi> Some thinke that this Epistle was
written by <hi>Paul</hi> in his bonds,<note place="margin">Capellus ibid.</note> but not rightly; for he makes no
mention of his bonds in it. It is probable that it was written
from Athens, as it is in the Arabicke subscription, when he
came from Macedonia to Greece; and so it was written after
the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Romans)</hi> The Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> was written at Corinth,
when <hi>Paul</hi> having spent three moneths in Greece,<note place="margin">Acts 20, 2.</note> sailed to
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that there he might gather the collections of the
Churches of Achaia, Asia, and Macedonia. This is manifest
from <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 2, 4.</p>
               <p>These are the Epistles which seem to be written by <hi>Paul</hi> out
of imprisonment;<note place="margin">Capellus ubi. supra.</note> the other were written in his bonds. <hi>Pauls</hi>
bonds were twofold; former, and latter. One onely, <hi>viz.</hi> the
latter to <hi>Timothy</hi> seems to be written in the latter bonds of
<hi>Paul,</hi> a little before his Martyrdome; the others were written
in his former bonds.</p>
               <p>Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.)</hi> This seems to be the first of them
all, which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote in his bonds. When <hi>Paul</hi> was captive at
Rome, the Philippians being carefull for him, sent <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
thither, who visited <hi>Paul</hi> in his bonds, and ministred to
him necessary helpes for the preserving of his life, as appeares
by the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> chapter and 25 verse of that Epistle, and the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

chapter, 10. and 18. verses. <hi>Paul</hi> sent him backe againe to the
Philippians, and commends him to them, Chap. 11. 28. That
the Epistle was written in his bonds, is manifest from the first
Chap. v. 7, 13, 14. and from Rome, not Jerusalem, Chap. 4.
vers. 22.</p>
               <p>The Epistles to the <hi>Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi>
were at the same time written from Rome, and sent by
the same, viz. <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>Onesimus.</hi> First, that the Epistle to
the Colossians was written by <hi>Paul</hi> in his bonds, it is manifest
from Chap. 4. v. 3, &amp; 18. but it was sent by <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus,</hi>
Chap. 4. v. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>That to <hi>Philemon</hi> was written at the same time with that to
the <hi>Colossians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Capelli historia Apostolica illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strata.</note> since he salutes <hi>Philemon</hi> in their name in whose
he saluted the Colossians, <hi>viz.</hi> in the name of <hi>Epaphras, Aristar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
Marke, Luke, Demas,</hi> as is manifest by comparihg the fourth
Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> v. 10, 12, 14. with the 22
&amp; 24. of the Epistle to <hi>Philemon.</hi> For this and other reasons
<hi>Capellus</hi> supposeth they were both written at the same time.</p>
               <p>That the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> was written also at the
same time, it may be thus confirmed: 1. Because it was written
by <hi>Paul</hi> in his bonds, <hi>viz.</hi> from Rome, as is manifest Chap. 3.
vers. 1. &amp; 4. 1. 2. It was sent by <hi>Tychicus,</hi> Chap. 6. 21, 22. by
which also that to the <hi>Colossians</hi> was sent. That these three
Epistles were written also by <hi>Paul</hi> in his former not latter
bonds, it is hence manifest, because <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 25. &amp; 26. &amp; 2. 24.
also in the 22 verse of <hi>Philemon, Paul</hi> sheweth that he had a
most certaine hope, that he should be freed shortly.</p>
               <p>The Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was written by <hi>Paul</hi> from Rome,
toward the end of his former bonds. He expresly mentions his
bonds, Chap. 10. 34. and sheweth that he hopes shortly to be
set free, Chap. 13. v. 19.</p>
               <p>The latter Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was the last of all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
written by him in his latter bonds, of which he writes
Chap. 1. 8. &amp; 2. 9. and from Rome, Chap. 1. v. 17. a little before
his martyrdome, which he seems to intimate Chap. 4. v. 6, 7, 8.</p>

deny that it was <hi>Pauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reasons (saith <hi>Cartwright</hi> in his confutation of the
Rhemists) moving us to esteeme it none of <hi>Pauls,</hi> are first, that
his name is not prefixed, as in all the epistles undoubtedly
knowne to be his. Another reason is, that this writer confesseth
that he received the doctrine of the Gospell, not of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but of those which heard it of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. whereas
<hi>Paul</hi> received his doctrine immediately from Christ, and heard
it himselfe of Christ, and not of them that heard it from him.</p>
               <p>To the first objection by <hi>Fulke</hi> it is easily answered, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of stile doth not prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was not the authour
of this epistle; for as men have written divers things in divers


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107075:60"/>
stiles in respect of matter and persons to whom they wrote;
as <hi>Tully</hi> his offices, orations, and epistles; so the Spirit of God
could and might inspire one and the same man to pen in a
different manner. 2. The other argument also against it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Pauls,</hi> because his name is not prefixed, hath but little force
in it. 1. If it be not <hi>Pauls</hi> because his name is not prefixed,
then it is nones because no mans name is prefixed; so <hi>Jerome,</hi>
and from him <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> both thus answer. 2. The

All that the Papists object for these Bookes in the generall,
is, that the third Councell at Carthage, the Florentine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell

Carthage was but a Provinciall Councell, and therefore it
cannot binde the whole world. Moreover in that Councell
there are divers things which the Papists will not endure; as in
the 26 Canon, there is a decree that no Bishop shall be called
chiefe or universall Bishop, no not the Bishop of Rome; how
should the Papists binde us with the authority of that
Councell with which they will not binde themselves? 2. The
Latine<note n="*" place="margin">Jerome <hi>and</hi> Augustine.</note> Fathers judged these bookes fit to be read for example
of life and instruction of manners; but not for confirmation
of faith, or establishing any doctrine. 3. These Bookes are
not Proto Canonicall, truely and properly Canonicall, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God, containing the immediate and unchangeable
truth of God, sanctified by him, and given to the Church
to be a perfect rule of sound doctrine and good life; but
Deutero-canonicall or rather Ecclesiasticall, as they are stiled.
In this sence <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> are to be taken, when
they reckon these Bookes among the Canonicall. 4. No
Councell hath authority to define what Bookes are Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
what not, seeing Bookes truely Divine receive authority
from God himselfe, and are to be esteemed of undoubted
truth, although all the world should barke against them.</p>

truth of God; therefore in generall the alteration of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
States and Kingdomes is shadowed forth and published
in the Chaldee tongue, that the Gentiles might take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof; but the particular Histories of the comming of
the Messias, of his Office and Kingdome, and of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and afflictions which should befall the people of God
are set forth in the Hebrew tongue, as more especially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them. Likewise it pleased God for the better credit of
the story, that the History of those things which were said
and done in Chaldea should be written in the same Language
wherein they were first spoken; and therefore the Epistles and
rescrips of the Kings are delivered in the Chaldee speech, as
taken out of their publique Acts and<note n="*" place="margin">Jun. in Dan. 7. &amp; prolog. in Dan.</note> Records; and that the
History in <hi>Daniel</hi> set forth in the Chaldee speech gaining him
respect with the Chaldeans, might stirre up the Jewes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<hi>Daniel</hi> as a Prophet of God whom the Heathens admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
If there be any footsteps of the Chaldee and Arabique in
<hi>Job</hi> as some learned say; we doe not exclude them from

for the most part in Hebrew, and few parcels in Chaldee, are
the authentique edition of the old Testament.</p>
               <p>The Greeke copies of the new Testament are also from
God immediately, the very dialect wherein those Prototypes
were, which the Pens of the Evangelists and Apostles did

write. For the Gospell of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
being written in Hebrew, and <hi>Marke</hi> in Latine, we have

                  </p>
                  <p>The question betwixt us and the Papists, now cometh to be
considered, which of these Editions is authenticall, that is,
which of it selfe hath credit and authority, being sufficient of
it selfe to prove and commend it selfe, without the help of
any other Edition, because it is the first exemplar or Copy of
divine truth delivered from God by the Prophets and Apostles.
This in respect of the old Testament is the Hebrew and in some
Chapters of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Esra</hi> the Chaldee, and in respect of
the New Testament is the Greeke, all other Editions are but
of humane authority.</p>
                  <p>This proposition true in it selfe, is yet divers wayes opposed
by the Papists, whose opinions may be set downe in three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
                  <p>1. That the Hebrew and Greeke Text are corrupt, and


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107075:72"/>
therefore not<note n="*" place="margin">Bellarm. l. 2. <hi>de verbo Dei c.</hi> 2. and <hi>Rhemists</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face before the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Authenticall, for the fountaine is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before the streames if it come unto our hands uncorruptly.

preserved in the Arke, and that very Gospell written by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
those autographs (saith <hi>Morinus)</hi> are certainely the rule
of all versions.</p>
                  <p>The second proposition is, that the 70. Translaters, were
not so much Translaters as Prophets, who wrote by divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
so that their translation had been authentique, if it
had come to our hands purely and had not perished.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that the vulgar Translation is of authentique
authority, and ought so to be received, neither may any man
presume to reject it upon any pretence; they say it hangeth
betweene the Hebrew and Greek as Christ did between the two
Theeves.</p>
                  <p>To these 3. Propositions we oppose 3. which are most true,
and shall prevaile.</p>
                  <p>1. The Hebrew of the old Testament<note n="a" place="margin">Scriptura Hebraea in v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the new is the authentique Edition, and the pure fountain
of divine truth.</p>
                  <p>2. The 70. were not Prophets, but Translators.</p>
                  <p>3. The vulgar translation neither is authenticall nor perfect,
neither ought it in any case so to be esteemed.</p>
                  <p>Reasons Proving that the Hebrew of the old Testament,
and the Greeke of the New, are authenticall and pure.</p>
                  <p>To prove our first Proposition, these arguments may be
brought.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew of the old, and Greek<note n="*" place="margin">In Ecclesia Christiana nulla unquam fuit Editio authemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, excepta He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braica veteris, &amp; Graeca Novi Testamenti.

what Edition therefore is worthy to be compared to this.</p>
                  <p>When we speake of the originall and authenticke Text of the
Holy Scripture, that is not to be so understood as if we meant
it of the Autographs written by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> or the other
Prophets or Apostles, but onely of the originall * or the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniall

Chamierus de Canone l. 9.</note> were derived according to the variety of tongues.</p>
                  <p>2. For a long time before the Birth of Chirst, the Hebrew
was not only the alone authentique Copy, but the only Edition
which was extant in the world. In the dayes of <hi>Moses,</hi> the
Kings of Israel and the Prophets before the Captivity, what
Edition of Scripture had the Church but the Hebrew? what
did the Jewes read in their Synagognes, and in their solemne
meetings, but onely this Hebrew Edition?</p>
                  <p>After the time of Christ, for the space of 600 yeeres, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Edition of the old Testament, and the Greeke of the new,
were held Authentique, and no other.</p>
                  <p>3. If any thing be erroneous, doubtfull, lesse emphaticall,
or improper, or if in the Articles of religion any doubt or
difficulty arise, which cannot be decided out of translations; we
must necessarily then have recourse to the Hebrew of the old,
and the Greeke of the new Testament, as <hi>Augustine</hi>

readings. 3. When there is any thing doubtfull in the words
of sentence. 4. To understand the force and Energy of the
word, because all things are more emphaticall in the originall.</p>
                  <p>4. If the authority of the authenticall Copies in Hebrew,

                  <p>1. <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> thus argue, if the Jewes corrupted the
Hebrew Text of the Old Testament, then they did this before
the coming of Christ or after it, not before his coming, for
there was no cause why the Jewes should do it, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ would never have suffered so grosse a crime to have
passed without due reproof, when he was not silent for lesser
faults. On the contrary our Saviour sendeth us to the Scripture
to learn the doctrine of salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29. and proveth
his doctrine out of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets. Not after Christs
coming, then the Testimonies cited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>The Hebrew word (say they) truly signifieth a line, but the
Septuagint Interpreters respected the sence, and the Apostle
followed them. The scope of the <hi>Psalme</hi> is, that Gods people
may see what documents are given unto them of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be brought, and led to the true, certain, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowledge of God, to the 7. verse; it sheweth how they
were taught by the works of God, thence to the end; they were
instructed by his word; the Apostle alledgeth this <hi>Psalme</hi> to
prove that the Jewes might come to know God by his word,
and thereby might have faith in Christ Jesus; the sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is not onely the delineation and constitution of things
created, but also the word of God, and the doctrine of the
Gospell, long since propounded to the Jewes, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

as they could not but heare, because it was published
openly to all the whole world by the mystery of the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
out of the predictions of the Prophets. <hi>Paul</hi> interprets the
comparison propounded by the Prophet and teacheth, that as
certainly as the lines of heaven run forth into all the earth, so
certainly in these last times, the doctrine of the Gospell came
forth into all the earth by the Apostles preaching, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle did not rashly change the word of the Prophet,
because the Hebrew Text in the Prophet was corrupt, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
in stead of delineation the Apostle put in <hi>sonus,</hi> having
respect to the present accomplishment of the promise, whereby
God had foretold, that all the Gentiles should be converted

                  <p>1. Some say it joynes together both, one place in <hi>Jeremy,
Chap.</hi> 18. 1. 2, 3. and that of <hi>Zacharie;</hi> but there is little or
no agreement between them. Secondly Some say, that it is
not in <hi>Jeremies</hi> writings which are Canonicall, but in some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procryphall
writings of <hi>Jeremy</hi> which the Jewes had, and
which <hi>Chrysostome</hi> confesseth he saw, wherein these words were;
but it is not likely, that the holy Evangelist would leave a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
Text, and cite an Apocryphall, or give such credit to
it, or seek to build our faith upon it; and by our rule, that
Book should be Canonicall, which is cited by Christ or his
Apostles. 3. Some say that <hi>Matthew</hi> forgat, and for <hi>Zachary</hi>
put downe <hi>Jeremies;</hi> so <hi>Augustine,</hi> and <hi>Erasmus;</hi> but with more
forgetfulnesse, for holy men wrote as they were moved by
Gods Spirit. 4. Some thinke it the errour of heedlesse wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who might easily so erre; but all the oldest Copies, and
the most Ancient Fathers have the name of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> 5. Some
say that <hi>Zachariah</hi> being Instructed and trained up with <hi>Jeremy</hi>
did deliver it by tradition from <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and so <hi>Jeremy</hi> spake it


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107075:77"/>
by <hi>Zachariah,</hi> which might be true, because it is said in the
Text, as was spoken by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> not written. But sixthly, the
most compendious and likely way of reconciling is this; that
<hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> was the same man having 2 names, which
was very usuall among the Jewes, as <hi>Salomon</hi> was called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didiah,

                  <p>The second, whether the Scripture of the Old Testament
was <hi>punctata</hi> from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>To the first question, that we may give a right answer; we
must distinguish of the Bookes of Scripture, some were Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall,
Ethicall, or Physicall,<note n="*" place="margin">Spanhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

former might perish and fall away but not the latter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that common objection of divers Books mentioned in the
Old Testament, whereof we finde none so intituled in the
Canon thereof, is easily answered. Either they were Civill
and common-wealth Stories, whether the Reader is referred
if it like him to read the stories more at large, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
touched shortly; or else they are contained in the Books
of the Kings, which are manifestly proved to be written by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Prophets in their severall ages, wherein they prophesied.
<hi>Salomons</hi> Books which he wrote of generall Philosophy fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but all the other Books of the Scripture do still remain.
First, they are all of God, all whose works remain for ever,
therefore the holy Scriptures being not onely his handy-work,
but as it were the chief and Master-work of all other, must
have a continuall endurance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they all are written generally for our instruction,
and more particularly for admonition and warning, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and consolation, unlesse we will say that God may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in his purpose and end wherefore he ordained them; it
must needs be, that it must continue whatsoever hath been
written in that respect.</p>

errour, whence sprung many other errours. The Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who were generally unskilfull both in Hebrew and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
(some few excepted) were the lesse to be blamed here, since
they made use of no other Editions, therefore they more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
affirmed their own to be Authenticall. <hi>Augustine,
Tertullian,</hi> and many of the Latine Fathers (whom divers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
follow) ascribed too much to the Seventy Interpreters.
Yet there was a controversie between <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their authority, as is evident by both their Epistles.
<hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2. de verbo Dei cap. 6.</note> is large in commending this version, saying, that it
is most certain, that those Interpreters did very well translate
the Scripture, and had the Holy Ghost peculiarly assisting them,
least they should erre in any thing, so that they may seeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be Prophets then Interpreters. <hi>Gretzer</hi> bestoweth a

The Apostles and Evangelists writing in Greek, often followed
the version of the Septuagint then common amongst the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;
and cited it sometimes where there is a most manifest

proved by some arguments, because our Adversaries stand upon
it. Our arguments are these.</p>
               <p>1. It was not Divinely inspired in respect of matter, forme,
speech, as the Hebrew of the Old Testament, and the Greek of
the new were, but was translated by humane indeavour, and
therefore it is against both religion and reason to say it is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall;
a work of men cannot in perfection be equall with
a work of God; for as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith <hi>aliud est esse vatem, aliud est
esse Interpretem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the office of an Interpreter, to translate the authenticall
Scripture, not to make his translation authenticall; for both
<hi>Jerome</hi> and every other Interpreter might erre, so did not the
Prophets and Apostles; the Councell of Trent first decreed
that this translation should be authenticall, before it many
learned Papists themselves did disallow that translation, as
<hi>Paulus Brugensis, Valla, Engubinus, Isidorus Clarius, Joban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Isaacus, Cajetan, Erasmus, Jacobus Faber, Ludovicus Vives,</hi>
and divers others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:107075:82"/>
2. The vulgar translation doth oft change the sentence of
the Holy Ghost; yea, it doth dangerously and heretically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
the sense of holy Scripture, and translate senselesly many
times, therefore it is not to be held authenticall. <hi>Gen. 3. 15.

the body; but much more all spirituall food. <hi>viz.</hi> the blessed
Sacrament it self, which is Christ the true bread that came
down from heaven, and the bread of life to us that eate his
Body. Our Saviour Christ which condemned vaine repetition,
and by a forme of prayer provided against the same, is made here
of the Jesuits to offend against his own rule: for that which is

fourth. Secondly, they lodge in one Petition things of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds, and farre removed in nature, spirituall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
heavenly and earthly; yea, the creature and the creator.
Thirdly, hence it should follow, that he taught them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely

are mysteries, but all mysteries are not properly Sacraments.
How can it be a Church Sacrament, which hath neither ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>The end of the Scripture is considered, 1. In respect of

               <p>In respect of God, the end of the Scripture is a glorifying of
him; by it we may learne to know, love and feare him, and so
be blessed. The glory of God is the chiefe end of all things,

               <p>2. Of promise, there is no unfaithfulnesse in it.</p>
               <p>The first truth referres to the matter which is signified, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called truth or verity.</p>
               <p>The second referres to the intention of the Speaker, which
is properly called veracite or fidelity, the latter is implyed,
<hi>Psal. 19. thy Testimonies are sure,</hi> and so <hi>the sure mercies of</hi> David,
the former is implyed, in that the word is purer then
Gold 7 times refined.</p>
               <p>There are two signes of truth in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. The particularity of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it names particulars in genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
<hi>dolosus versatur in generalibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Impartiality toward friends and their adversaries; the
most holy men have their faults described, they give due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to their adversaries.</p>
               <p>The truth of Scripture is. 1. More then any humane truth
of sense or reason. 2. Above all naturall reason, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity, the incarnation of Christ, justification
by faith in Christ. 3. A truth which evidenceth it self. 4. The
standard of all truth, nothing is true in doctrin or worship
which is not agreeable to this.</p>

God for a long time, for the space of 2400 yeares, unto the
time of <hi>Moses</hi> did instruct his Church with an immediate living
voyce, and had he pleased still to goe on in that way, there had
beene no necessity of Scripture now more then in that age, there
was a continuall presence of God with them, but now there is
a perpetuall absence in that way; and the word of God was
written.</p>

The Patriarks were long lived before, and after the Floud to the

the purity of the word could not fitly be preserved
without writing. By writing we have the comfort of the holy

               <p>1. In respect of the matter or the Bookes, in which the holy
doctrine was written, all which (as many as were usefull to
our salvation) have been kept inviolable in the Church, so that
out of them one most perfect and absolute Canon of faith and
life was made, and this may be called the Integrity of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>2. In respect of the forme, <hi>viz.</hi> of the sence or meaning of
these Canonicall Books, or of Divine truth comprehended in
them, which Books containe most fully and perfectly the
whole truth necessary and sufficient for the salvation of the
elect, and therefore the Scriptures are to be esteemed, a sole ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate,
totall and perfect measure and rule both of faith and
manners, and this is the sufficiency of the Scriptures, which is
attributed to it in a twofold respect.</p>

of God; every thing which is from another as the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente

                     </hi> are more wary then some other Papists; we are abused (say they) when we are said to hold that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not perfect, for (say they) a thing is said to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not when it wants any perfection, but when it wants a perfection due, as a man is not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if hee have not an Angels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, because this is not due unto him; they say it is not a perfection due to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to teach us very thing necessary to salvation.</note> we doe not understand such a perfection as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all and singular such things as at any time have beene
by Divine inspiration revealed to holy men, and by them
delivered to the Church of what sort soever they were; for
all the Sermons of the Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles,
are not set downe in so many words as they used in the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; for of twelve Apostles seven wrote nothing,
which yet preached and did many things; neither are all the
deeds of Christ and his Apostles written, for that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
<hi>John</hi> 20. 30. 31 &amp; 21. 25. but we meane onely a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
perfection which for some certaine ends sake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
to the Scripture as to an instrument, according
to which it perfectly comprehendeth all things which
have beene, are or shall be necessary for the salvation of the
Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the severall Bookes of Scripture are indeed perfect,
for their own particular ends, purposes, &amp; uses, for which they
were intended of the Lord; but yet not any one Booke is
sufficient to the common end; the whole Scripture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
in all the parts thereof, one speaking of that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
doth wholy passe over in silence, one clearely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
what was intricate in another. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes
much of Justification, and Predestination, in the Epistle to


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107075:91"/>
the <hi>Romans</hi> nothing of the Eucharist, or Resurrection.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, since God did reveale his will in writing, those
writings which by Divine hand and providence were extant in
the Church, were so sufficient for the Church in that Age,
that it needed not Tradition, neither was it lawfull for any
humane wight to adde thereto, or take therefrom; but when
God did reveale more unto it, the former onely was not then
sufficient without the latter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the holy Scripture doth sufficiently containe and
deliver all Doctrines which are necessary for us to eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
both in respect of Faith and good works,<note place="margin">Perinde sunt ea quae ex Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris colliguntu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was to continue therein for ever.</p>

2. This was well knowne not onely among the Jewes,<note place="margin">John 1. 18. and 3. 12. Esay 61. 1. 2. Heb. 1. 1 and 2. 3. Act. 1. 3. Matth. 11. 25. 27.</note> but
also among the Samaritanes, in so much that the woman of

us all things.</hi> John 4. 25.</p>
               <p>3. The time wherein God spake unto us by his Sonne, is
called the last dayes or the last time. <hi>Heb. 1. 2. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 20. to
note that we are not hereafter to expect or looke for any fuller
or more cleare <hi>Revelation</hi> of Divine mysteries then that which
was then delivered.</p>
               <p>4. Christ is called a mediator of the New Testament or the
new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. because all things are established by
him as they ought to continue for ever; for that which is old
decayeth and is ready to vanish, but that which is new abideth,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>5. It pleased the Lord in great wisdome to reveale the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace to the Church that she might not despaire; but
obscurely at the first that she might earnestly long for the
coming of that <hi>Messiah,</hi> who was to make known what he had
heard and seene of the Father, which dispensation was needfull,
that the grace of God might not be contemned, as haply it
would have been, if God had fully revealed and made knowne
his bounty unto man, before he had seen his misery, and the
necessity thereof. Our Saviour Christ for substance of doctri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

necessary to salvation, taught nothing which was not before in
some sort contained in the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets,<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 32. John 5. 46. Luke 24. 44. 45.</note>
out of whom he confirmed his doctrine; but that which was in
them more obscurely, Enigmatically and briefely, he explained
more excellently, fully and cleerely; the Apostles proved their
doctrine out of the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Act. 17.
11. and 26. 22. Luke 24. 27. Rom. 1. 2. Act.</hi> 28. 23.</p>
               <p>6. All things necessary in that manner as we have spoken, were
taught and inspired to the Apostles by our Saviour Christ, and
there were no new inspirations after their times; nor are we
to expect further hereafter, which we prove</p>
               <p>1. By places of Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. he that teacheth all
things, omitteth nothing; Christ said all things to his Apostles

2. By reasons drawne from thence, 1. The plentifull
pouring forth of the spirit was deferred till the glorifying of
Christ; he being glorified, it was no longer to be delayed;
Christ being exalted on the right hand of God, obtained the
Spirit promised, and that was not according to measure, and
poured the same in such abundance, as it could be poured forth
and received by men, so that was fulfilled which was foretold
by <hi>Joel 2. 28. Act. 2. 33. John 3. 34. 35. Act.</hi> 2. 16 17. 2. The
Scripture and the prophesies of the old Testament doe teach
and declare that all Divine truth should fully and at once be
manifested by the <hi>Messias</hi> who is the onely Prophet, High-Priest
and King of his Church; there is no other <hi>Revelation</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
none other needfull besides that which was made by him.
<hi>Esay 11. 9. Act 3. 23. 24. Joel. 2. 23. Vide Mercerum in loc.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the last inspiration was made to the Apostles and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be expected. The doctrine of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did suffice to salvation; yet it did send the Fathers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
somewhat more perfect. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10 but to the preaching
of the Gospell nothing is to be added, we are not sent to waite
for any clearer vision.</p>
               <p>3. So long as any truth needfull to be known, was unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
or not plainly taught, the Lord did stirre up some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
or other, to teach the same unto the Church; therefore
the Lord surcea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng to speake since the publishing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
of Jesus Christ, and the delivery of the same in writing,
is unto us a manifest token, that the whole will of God is now
brought to light, and that no new <hi>Revelation</hi> is to be expected.</p>
               <p>Our 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Proposition is, Christ and his Apostles were able
to propound and teach by lively voyce, that doctrine which
pertaines to perfection, <hi>John</hi> 1. 18. and 11. 11. 32. <hi>John</hi> 8. 26.
and the Apostles perfectly taught all things which are or shall
be necessary for the Church, <hi>Act. 20. 27. Gal.</hi> 1. 7. 8. 9. The
doctrine of repentance, and remission of sinnes in the name of
Christ, doth summarily containe all things necessarily to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. and 11. 11. but this doctrine the Apostles
preached, <hi>Act. 13. 38. 39. Luke</hi> 24. 47.</p>
               <p>The word of God is not onely Milke for Babes, but strong

Meat for men of ripe yeares, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 1. 2. Heb.</hi> 5. 14. and 6. 1.
2. therefore it containeth not onely matter of preparation but
of perfection.</p>
               <p>Or 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Proposition is, The sum and substance of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
doctrine which was taught by the Prophets and Apostles,
was by them committed to writing; the Holy Ghost giving
them a commandement, and guiding their hands therein, that
they could not erre, so that the word preached and written by
them is one in substance, both in respect of matter, which is the
will and word of God, and inward forme, <hi>viz.</hi> the divine truth
immediately inspired, though different in the externall forme
and manner of delivery.</p>
               <p>Our 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Proposition is, that nothing is necessary to be
known of Christians over and above that which is found in the
old Testament, which is not clearly and evidently contained in
the Bookes of the Apostles and Evangelists.</p>
               <p>Our last Proposition is, that all things which have beene,
are, or shall be necessary to the salvation of the Church to the
end of the world, are perfectly contained in the writings of the
Prophets and Apostles, long since divinely inspired, written
and published, and now received by the Church of God, so

to be defended by the authority of unwritten traditions, not of
the word committed to writing; onely they affirme in generall,
whatsoever they teach or doe, which is not in the Scripture,
that it is to be put into the number of Traditions unwritten.
The cause of it selfe is manifest, that at their pleasure they might
thrust what they would upon the Church, under the name of
Traditions. <hi>Vide</hi> Whitak. <hi>de Script. controviae quaest Sexta. c.</hi> 5.

Arias Montanus</hi> in his Interlineall translation doth render it

In the English <hi>Geneva</hi> Bible, we translate it by the word <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

word <hi>tradition,</hi> but because we would not have the simple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as though the unwritten verities of the papists were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
commended, or as though we had some honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite

word doth give us free liberty to doe; in our last English Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
we use the word <hi>tradition,</hi> as often as the vulgar Latine
or the Rhemists have done; not that we were driven by feare
or shame to alter what was done before, but because we would
cut off all occasion of carping at our translation, though never
so unjust.</p>
               <p>First we contend not about the name<note n="*" place="margin">The word originally may import any thing which is delivered howsoever ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or writing. Thus what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we have received in the Scriptures, was first tradition as delivered by word, and still is tradition because it is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in writing. But though the word in it selfe have this generall and indifferent significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any thing that is delivered, yet in our disputation it is restrained to one onely manner of delivering by word and relation onely, and not by Scripture.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107075:96"/>
2. All traditions unwritten are not simply condemned by
us. 3. The Apostles delivered by lively voyce many obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
dispensable, and alterable, according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of time and persons, appertaining to order and
comelinesse; onely we say that they were not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Religion, that they were not generall concerning
all Churches. 4. We receive the number and names of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of Books Divine and Canonicall, as delivered by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but the Divine truth of those Books is in it self clear and
evident unto us, not depending on the Churches authority.
The Books of Scripture have not their authority <hi>(quoad nos)</hi>
from the approbation of the Church, but winne credit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and yeeld sufficient satisfaction to all men of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth, whence we judge the Church that receiveth them
to be led by the Spirit of God; yet the number, authors, and
integrity of the parts of those Books, we receive as delivered by
tradition. 5. The continued practise of such things as are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expressely contained in Scripture, nor the example of such
practise expressely there delivered, though the grounds, reasons,
and cause of the necessity of such practise be there contained,
and the benefit and good that foloweth of it, we receive upon
tradition, though the thing it selfe we receive not for traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Of this sort is the Baptisme of Infants, which may be
named a Tradition, because it is not expressely delivered in
Scripture, that the Apostles did Baptize Infants, nor any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
precept there found that they should so doe; yet is not
this so received by bare and naked tradition, but that we
finde the Scripture to deliver unto us the ground of it.<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

To this head we may referre the observation of the Lords

may be called a Tradition. But let it be noted withall, that
we admit it not to have that credit as now it hath, to be the
rule of faith; for this is the priviledge of holy Scripture. The
Creed it selfe was gathered out of Scripture, and is to be
expounded by the Scripture; therefore it is not given to be a

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> some things by word of mouth,
which he taught them not in his two Epistles which he wrote
unto them; therefore he taught some doctrines which he wrote
not, as if that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote no more Epistles then these two;
whereby that which he taught not them in writing unto them,
he taught them by writing unto others. Secondly, how fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
this argument? <hi>Paul</hi> wrote not all the doctrines of
God unto the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> therefore they are not all written
in the Propheticall and Evangelicall writings:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> whereas it is
plainly testified,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 29. 31.</note> that the Old Testament containeth a perfect
rule of the doctrine of salvation; the new being written for a

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was he preached is ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pressed.</note> For there it is witnessed, that <hi>Paul</hi>
taught out of the Scriptures, that it behoved Christ to suffer
and rise againe from the dead,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 6.</note> and that Jesus was Christ; this
teaching then by word is there limited to the Scriptures of the
Law and Prophets. Neither ought it to seeme strange; that
this was the summe of all which the Apostle taught at <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2:</note>
where he tarried so small a while, when amongst the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>

<hi>(verse 14.)</hi> whatsoever he taught by word, or wrote by the

Systeme of Logicke, because a fresh Sophister understands not

are plaine, and obscure in a threefold respect.</p>
               <p>1. They are plaine and easie to be understood by all men in
Fundamentals, and the Speciall points necessary to salvation, as
the Decalogue, the Apostles Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the
like; unlesse by those whose minds the God of this world hath
blinded; if they be obscure in some lesse principall and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
matters, there is need of interpretation, that the
meaning may be more clearely unfolded.</p>
               <p>2. A difference of persons is to be considered, either more

unregenerate; to those the Scripture is plaine and
pe picuous; to whom alone it is destinated, and whose minds
the Holy Ghost will inlighten by the Scripture. <hi>John 7. 17.

they see not <hi>Psal. 36. 3. Esay 29 9. Jer. 5. 21. Esay 6. 9. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 14.
there is a vaile over their hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. 4. which is the cause
why is so many ages under the Papacy, the Scriptures were not
understood, because they preferred a lye before the love of the
truth. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 10. whose Ignorance is a deserved punishment
of that contempt which they shewed to the Scriptures and their
authority.</p>

to the diversity</p>
               <p>1. Of Conditions of life and vocations; for so, many places
of Scripture are hard to this sort of men, which are more easie
to another, neither is it required that all things be understood
of all men; the knowledge of more places is necessary in a
Minister, then in a Trades-man and Husband-man, yet it is

us, not indeed touch our cause, proving only that some
places in the Scripture are difficult which we deny not;
But I shall first take off their answers whereby they would
evade the strength of our reasons for the perspicuity of the
Scripture, and then refute their own Objections.</p>

would not if it selfe were obscure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> answereth, that those places are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of all the Scripture, but only of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and that these also are called a light, not because
they are easily understood (although that be true) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being understood and known they direct a man in
working, 2. If it be understood of all the Scriptures, they
are called light not because they are easily understood, but
because they illustrate the minde when they are understood.
But the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speakes not only of the precepts of the
Decalogue, but of all the Scripture of the old Testament:
which if it be light, much more shall the Scripture of the
new Testament, and therefore the whole body of Scriptures
which the Christians now have, shall be light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that place 119. <hi>Psal.</hi> 130, doth not speake of the

               <p>The like answer serveth for the place of <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45. for by
that abuse of the place, they may wring the reading of the
Scriptures from all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even Ministers or the word command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

place in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is to be understood comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>viz.</hi> that a man faithfull and already gained to the truth,
as this Eunuch was, cannot understand the Scriptures by the
bare reading of them, so well and throughly as when he hath
one to expound them. The Lord which helped the indeavor
of the Eunuch searching the Scriptures by sending of <hi>Philip,</hi>
will never suffer those which seek him in carefull reading of
his word, to goe away ashamed without finding that which
they seeke for, in directing unto him some lawfull &amp; sufficient
ministery to instruct him by. The mystery of the Gospell then
(indeed) fulfilled, remained notwithstanding unpublished to
the world by the Apostles, which is now by their preaching
and writings laid open and made more manifest. The Eunuch
which professed that he could not understand the Scripture
without an Interpreter, did notwithstanding busie himselfe in
reading of it.</p>

is committed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what meanes must be used in the interpretation of
Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. Of the divers senses of Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Interpretation of Scripture is 2 fold.</p>
               <p>One of the words, which is called version or Translation,
this hath been handled already.</p>
               <p>2. Of things which is called explication, the finding out of
the meaning of any place, which is more Theologicall the
other being rather Grammaticall. And this signification of
the thing they commonly call the sence <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 9. Interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Scripture is 1. Ancient, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 8. 2. Honourable,
<hi>Marke</hi> 4. 34.</p>
               <p>The Scripture hath often two senses, one of which the latter
Divines call Literall, Grammaticall, or Historicall, another
mysticall or Spirituall.</p>
               <p>The sense of the Scripture is that which God the Author of
the Scripture in<note n="*" place="margin">Glassius Phil. Sac. l. <hi>a</hi> parte 1<hi rend="sup">a</hi> Tract. 1, Literalis</note> and by the Scriptures gives to men to know

in 2 things. 1. In giving the right sense. 2. In a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107075:107"/>
words taken in their genuine signification carry. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the genuine signification of the words is that, in which
the Author useth them, whether speaking properly or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
therefore the literall sense is subdivided into plaine and
simple, and figurative, which ariseth from the words translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their naturall signification into another, as where
Christ saith 10. <hi>John 16. I have other sheep which are not of this

exprest in the literall sense signifieth another thing in a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for the shadowing out of which it was used by God. The
waters of the Floud, with which the Arke was upheld signified
Baptisme, by which the Church is saved under the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as the Apostle teacheth 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. that History <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
12. it is a Passeover unto the Lord,</hi> is spoken figuratively, the
other words properly. The mysticall sense is, the bones of
Christ were no more broken then of the Paschall Lambe, which
did signifie Christ.</p>
               <p>The Papists say the literall sense is that which is gathered
immediatly out of the words,<note place="margin">Litera gesta docet; quid cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as; allegoria Moralis quid agas, quo tendas anagogia.</note> the spirituall which hath another
reference then to that which the words doe properly signifie.
The last they subdivide into Allegoricall, Tropologicall, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicall,
they say that the Scripture beside the literall sense,
may have these also.</p>
               <p>The Allegoricall sense, is when the words of the Scripture
besides the plaine historicall and literall meaning, signifie some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the new Testament, which belongs to Christ or the
Church, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. besides the truth of the story of the bond
and free-woman, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth it unto the two Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Tropologicall when the words and deeds are referred to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
something which belongs to manners; as <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 9
teacheth from that place, <hi>Deut. 25. thou shalt not muzle the

Hope and Charity, so there are 3 mysticall sences. The allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
answers to faith, the Anagogicall to hope, the Morall
to Charity. <hi>Jerome</hi> (saith he) excelled in the literall sense,
<hi>Ambrose</hi> in the Allegoricall, <hi>Augustine</hi> in the Anagogicall,
<hi>Gregory</hi> in the Morall.</p>

but that it may be Allegorically applied, which is Historically
set downe. There is then but one sense of the place; part
whereof consisteth in the Story, part in the Allegory: So that
the whole sense is contained in them both.</p>
               <p>So for the second example of the Tropologicall: there is
not a twofold sense of that place, but one generall sense, that
as the mouth of the Oxe was not to be muzled, so the Minister
of the Gospell must be provided for. Likewise of the Anago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall
kinde: it is not one sense to understand the rest of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

another the Kindome of God: but there is one whole
sense, that as they for their Idolatry were deprived of the Land
of promise, so we should take heed least by our disobedience
we lose the hope of the Kingdome of heaven. So we conclude
that those are not divers sences, but one sense diversly applyed.</p>
               <p>The literall sense is the onely sense of the place, because out


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107075:108"/>
of that sense only may an argument strongly be framed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing Allegories and Tropes doe no:<note place="margin">

not the sences of the place; and Allegories devised beside the
sense prove not, though they may illustrate. It is manifest
that is alwayes the sense of the holy Ghost, which is drawne
from the very words. But we are not so certaine concerning
any mysticall sense, unlesse when the holy Ghost himselfe

in regard of the person, if it be publike in regard of the

Scripture <hi>toti resistere mundo,</hi> saith the Glosse of the Canon-Law;
the meaning of this place is, that the Prophets were no
Interpreters or Messengers of their own minds but Gods. The
Catholickes hold (saith <hi>Chamier)</hi> meaning still by that Title
the Protestants) that the Scripture is to be interpreted by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
labour and industry, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Augustine, Jerome, Chrysostome,</hi>
but not in a private sense, that is in a sense arising from the
braine of the Interpreter.</p>
               <p>It is true (saith <hi>Cartwright</hi> against the Rhemists) that the
Scriptures cannot be expounded of every private Spirit, nor
(which is more) of any private spirit, nor yet of all private
spirits together; but onely of those which are inspired of God,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Prophets and Apostles, which are here opposed unto
private Interpretation. And therefore it is evident that the
exposition of the Scripture, ought not to be fetched from <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi>
either Fathers or Councels, which speake not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
but from the Scriptures themselves; what he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he declareth in the next verse, where he sheweth the reason
of his saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, that it must be interpreted as it was
written; and by as high authority. Seeing therefore it was first
spoken by holy men, which spake as they were led by the holy
Spirit, and were inspired of God, it followeth, that it must be
interpreted by the same authority. The interpretation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that is brought but of the Apostles and Prophets, is not
private, although it be avowed by one man onely. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side that interpretation which is not brought from thence,
although it have the allowance of whole Generall Counsels, is
but private.</p>
               <p>This is a principall meaning of our Saviour Christ, when he

               <p>Our Adversaries prescribe this method and course to be taken

practise of the Church, the Consonant interpretation of
the Fathers, the decrees of generall Councels; lastly, the rule of


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107075:116"/>
faith consisting partly of the Scriptures, partly of traditions
unwritten.</p>
               <p>In all these meanes the Pope is implicitely understood, for
the rule of faith is that which the Pope approves: the practise
of the Church is that which the Pope observes, the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Fathers is that which the Pope follows, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of Councels, what the Pope confirmes; so that the
Pope must interprete all Scripture. But divers reasons may be
alleaged to shew that the true interpretation of Scripture is
not to be sought for from the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have frequently and grossely
erred in interpreting of Scripture, as in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
8. v. those that are in the flesh cannot please God;</hi> that is those
that are married, said <hi>Siricius</hi> the Pope. Innocent so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
those words <hi>John 6. unlesse you eate the flesh of the Sonne
of man and drinke his bloud you shall have no life in you,</hi> that he
thence concluded, that there is no salvation without receiving
the Eucharist, and that it is to be given to Infants. Pope Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface

Seat or Chaire.</p>
               <p>3. Because many of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have not onely erred
but been grosse &amp; wicked Hereticks. <hi>Liberius</hi> the Pope about the
yeare 350 was an Arrian and subscribed to the unjust condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and afterward as an obstinate Hereticke
was deposed. <hi>Honorius</hi> the first was a Monothelite, he held
that Christ had but one will and so but one nature, and for this
heresie was condemned in 3. Generall Councels. Some Popes
were Atheists, as <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth who called the Gospell <hi>fabulam
de Christo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One cals the Pope that great Heteroclite in religion; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saith, The Pope is the worst of Cardinals, who are the
worst of Priests, who are the worst of Papists, who are the
worst of Christians.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope did reverence the 4 first generall Councels,

               <p>But if these foure generall Councels be of equall authority

               <p>1. Because even universall Councels have erred; the Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian

<hi>Gregory</hi> in rashly preferring the Constantinopolitane Church
before that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> Those that condemned
Christ were then the universall visible Church <hi>Matth 26. 65.
John</hi> 11. 47. See <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>2. Generall councels have beene opposite one to another,
that of <hi>Constance</hi> to the other of <hi>Basill;</hi> whereof one setteth
downe that Councels could erre and so also the Pope, and that
a Councell was above the Pope; the other affirmeth the quite
contrary.</p>
               <p>3. There were no Generall Councels after the Apostles for
300 yeares till the first Councell of Nice, when yet the Church
had the true sence of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>4. The generall Councels interpreted Scripture by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> teach concerning the first
Councell of Nice.</p>
               <p>5. Because they cannot be so easily celebrated to declare any
doubtfull sense of Scripture. They have expounded but few
places of Scripture, neither is it likely the Pope will assemble
them to expound the rest.</p>
               <p>The Papists say, that the Scripture ought to be expounded by
the rule of faith, and therefore not by Scripture onely. But
the rule of faith and Scripture is all one.</p>
               <p>As the Scriptures are not of man, but of the Spirit; so their
interpretation is not by man, but of the Spirit likewise.</p>
               <p>Let Councels, Fathers,<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Greenhill</hi> on third of <hi>Ezek. v.</hi> 14. p. 316.</note> Churches, give their sense of the

               <p>1. The literall and largest sense of any words in Scripture
must not be imbraced farther, when our cleaving thereunto
would breed some dis-agreement and contrariety between the
present Scripture and some other Text or place, else shall we
change the Scripture into a Nose of wax.</p>
               <p>2. In case of such appearing dis-agreement the Holy Ghost
leads us by the hand to seek out some distinction,<note place="margin">Altingius.</note> restriction, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation

these will always fit the purpose; for Gods word must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

               <p>3. Such figurative sense, limitation, restriction or distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
must be sought out, as the word of God affordeth either
in the present place or some other, and chiefely those that
seeme to differ with the present Text, being duly compared

naturall ability of discerning the condition and State of our
Actions, whether good or bad; and that not alone in respect
of men; but of some other thing above men; for when one
hath done things unlawfull, though such as no man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse

and tormented, then he hath some thing in him, threatning,

confesse, there is a higher power to whom that conscience of
his is an Office, and a Supreame Judge. That which the
conscience of every man beareth witnesse unto, is sure a truth;
for that is a thousand witnesses. The feares of an ill consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the joy and security of a good conscience, prove this,

could not make it selfe, cannot of it selfe keepe and uphold
it selfe, seeing no lesse power is required to its continuation
then to its constitution; for it could not continue, if each
of the parts did not so worke as to helpe and uphold the
other in some respect or other. Now these severall parts
could not so worke for one Common end, if they were not
guided thereto by some common and understanding guide
which were acquainted with, and had power over each of
them; therefore it hath one ruler and upholder. That
which is effected by the constant, orderly, and subordinate
working of innumerable particulars for one common end,
whereof no one of them hath any knowledge or acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
must needs be wrought by some common Ruler, and
Governour which knowes the motion and working of
each, and rules all, and each to that end in their severall
motions. What upholds the world; is; but God upholds the
world; therefore he is.</p>

neither when, nor how, he was so formed; therefore some
more excellent thing then a man did frame him there, and
doth daily, and hourely, frame other men; and that is a wise
worker, which is a like wise, and potent in all places of the

prevent the conspiracies of those under them. Nor yet doth it
arise from the goodnesse of the persons governed, most of
which most times are wicked, and unwilling to come under
government, therefore it must be of God; that is, a common
Superiour which holds all in awe.</p>
               <p>2. Extraordinary, Miracles.</p>
               <p>There is a work of Miracles,<note place="margin">Miraculous Effects.</note> for all stories both of Scripture,
and other Countries, doe agree in relating divers Miracles.
Now the worker of a Miracle, is he that can lift Nature off
the Hinges as it were, and set it on againe as seemeth best to
himselfe; and therefore is above the course of nature, and the
Commander of the course of nature,<note place="margin">Exodus 15. 11. 72. Psal. 18. <hi>and</hi> 136. 4.</note> and so is the Author of
all things under himselfe, under nothing; and that is none but


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107075:123"/>
God.<note place="margin">Isay 41. 23.</note> The certaine and plaine predictions of things future
long afore, whose events could by no wit of man, be either
gathered from their causes,<note place="margin">A Miracle is a worke of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite strength, or omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; surpassing the whole power of created nature, as to turne water into wine, to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie seven loaves, to the feeding and satisfying of 4000 men, to give the use of sight to one borne blind, to arise up a man indeed dead, to cure a leprosie with the word.</note> or conjectured from their signes.
Miracles are wrought beyond, and above the course of nature;
therefore some supreame Power must work them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Arguments may be drawn from the contrary, to
prove that there is a God.</p>
               <p>Reasons,</p>
               <p>From the contrary are two.</p>
               <p>1. From the being of Devils.</p>
               <p>There is a Devill, an Enemy to God, which sets himselfe
against God; and desires, and strives, and prevailes in many
places, to be worshiped as God; therefore it must needs be,
there is a God, to whom the Service and honour is due, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confessed, and adored as God; which these doe unduly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and seeke.<note place="margin">The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of wicked Spirits and men.</note> Againe the Devill is a Creature for strength,
wisdome, nimblenesse, able to destroy all man-kinde quickly;
and out of his Malice and Fury, very willing to doe it. Yet he
cannot doe it, it is not done; of this restraint there is some
cause, therefore there must be something, which over-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and over-rules him, and that can be no other then a
God; that is, something of Higher Power, and in wisedom
farre beyond him. Now there are Devils, it is apparent by
the horrible temptations, which are cast into the hearts of
men; quite against and beyond their naturall inclinations, as
Blasphemous Suggestions, and as appeareth by the practises of
conjurers and witches, who practise with the Devill; and of
those Countreys, which worship him instead of God, and as a
God, being beguiled by him.</p>
               <p>2. From the sleightnesse of the reasons brought to disprove
this truth, or to shew the Contrary.</p>
               <p>The reasons produced to shew there is no God are fond and
weake; and what is opposed alone by weake and false rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
is a truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:107075:123"/>
1. If there were a God, some man should see him, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
converse with him.</p>
               <p>This is a brutish reason, what cannot be seene is not, then
man hath no soule; God is above sense; more excellent then to
be discerned by so poor, weak, and low a thing as sense is.</p>
               <p>2. God daily makes himselfe, after a sort visible to men by
his workes.</p>
               <p>2 If there were a God, he would not suffer wicked men to
prosper, and oppose better men then themselves; nor himselfe
to be so blasphemed as he is.</p>
               <p>Those things that to us seeme most unjust and unfit; if we
could see the whole tenour of things from the beginning to
the ending, would appeare just and wise.</p>
               <p>3 All Divine Religion (say the Atheists) is nothing else
but an humane invention,<note place="margin">The Atheists third objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is but an humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</note> artificially excogitated to keep men
in awe; and the Scriptures are but the device of mans braine,
to give assistance to Magistrates in Civill government.</p>
               <p>This objection strikes at the root and heart of all Religion,
&amp; opposeth two many Principles at once; 1. that there is a God.
2. That the Scripture is the word of God, which, though it be
but a meer idle fiction; yet it prevailed too much with some
learned men; <hi>Tullie,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> were the chiefest Patrons of
that conceit, <hi>that Religion is no better then an humane invention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Religion is almost as Ancient as man;<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 3. 4.</note> when there were
but three men in the universall world, we read that two of
them offered up their sacrifices unto God.</p>
               <p>2. The universality of Religion declareth that it is not a
humane invention,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 3.</note> but a Divine impression; yea, and a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity-Lesson,
of Gods own heavenly teaching. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compteth
Religion to be the most proper and essentiall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a man and a Beast.</p>
               <p>3. The perpetuity of Religion proveth also that it was
planted by God.<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the second part of the objection about the Scriptures,
I answer.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more repugnant to Prudence and Policy.</p>
               <p>What Policy was it in the old Testament, to appoint cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107075:124"/>
to cut a poor Child, as soon as he comes into the
world?<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7. 5.</note> two and twenty thousand Oxen, and a hundred and
twenty thousand Sheep were spent by <hi>Salomon,</hi> at the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one Altar. To slaughter so many Oxen and Sheep
(such usefull creatures) was enough to bring a Famine.</p>
               <p>They were to give away the seventh part of their time to
God.</p>
               <p>Christ was not the Sonne of the Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> to
commend him to the Grandees of the world; but the supposed
Son of a poor Carpenter; a Starre leads the Wise Men to a
Stable, though that shined gloriously without, yet there was
nothing within, but what was base, and contemptible.</p>
               <p>Christ fell on the Pharisees, the great Doctors, 23. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
called them fooles, and blind, and threatened them with

were naturally tenacious of their Customes Christ chose silly
unlearned men to propagate the Gospell.</p>

and it is taken from the grounds of Arts: There is no Art
(saith he) neither liberall nor illiberall, but it cometh from
God, and leadeth to God.</p>
               <p>1. From Metaphysicks he urgeth, that the bounding of all
naturall bodies, is the work of God; to be unlimited and
boundlesse, is onely the Prerogative of the Maker of all things.
Every finite body being thus limited, must needs have those
bounds prescribed unto it, by some other thing, and not by it
selfe. For every thing by nature, seeking to inlarge it selfe, as
far as it is able, if it had the setting of its owne bounds it,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107075:124"/>
would set none at all; but would be as infinite, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
is, who hath the setting of limits unto all things; who
could circumscribe all things within their limits, but onely
God Himselfe: who is both the Maker and Ruler of all things?
<hi>Psal. 33. 7. Job</hi> 38. 11.</p>
               <p>2. From Philosophy;<note place="margin">All second causes, depend on the first, and we cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>in Infinitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </note> every thing that is, must needs have

all the causes, there can be but one first, and principall cause;
which is the true cause of all the rest, and of all those effects
which proceede from all of them: then the first cause can be
nothing else but God: for what can that be, which giveth being
unto all things, but only God?</p>

               <p>Others adde these reasons to prove that there is a God.<note place="margin">The Heathens lift up their eyes and hands to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine distresse. Psal. 9. 16.</note>

others, but agree to God principally by way of excellency, as
God, King, and good.</p>
               <p>The Name of God is used five wayes in Scripture:</p>
               <p>First, essentially for God himselfe, <hi>Esay</hi> 30. 27.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the power and efficacy which comes from

               <p>Thirdly, for the command and authority of God, 1 <hi>Sam.

               <p>Fourthly, passively for those actions whereby he is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19. that is nothing but worshiping
and calling upon the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghost, for
assistance.</p>
               <p>Lastly for that Word whereby he is distinguished from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and by which we are to have our thoughts directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him.</p>
               <p>2. God may be known by his Attributes and essentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
of which some shew what he is in himselfe, 2. What
he is to us.</p>
               <p>They are called Attributes.<note n="*" place="margin">Vocantur At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributa quia ea sibi attribait Deus nostra causâ Zanchius de Attributis l. 2. c. 11.</note> because they are rather said to
be attributed to God (that we might by them better conceive
what he is) then to be in him. They are that one most pure
God diversly apprehended, and the same with the Divine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
but for the weaknesse of our capacity they are diversly
distinguished. They are called properties, because they are

peculiar to his Majesty,<note place="margin">Attributum est Divinae simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissimae essentiae pro diversa agendi ratione diversa, &amp; vera habitudo &amp; conceptio nobis expressa.</note> and are so in him, as they are not in

whereby his nature is knowne in it selfe, and is distinguished
from all other things.</p>
               <p>Some Rules are to bee observed in attributing these to
God.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">These Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes differ not among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor from the Divine essence Esay 43. 25. For my selfe, not for my Mercy; to teach us that his Mercy is himselfe, and not different from his Essence, as it is with us.</note> they are all essentiall to God; for in him is no acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at all; whatsoever is in God the same is God. All these
are also one in him; his Mercy is his Justice, and his Justice
is his Mercy, and each are his essence, onely they differ in our
apprehension.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are all absolute properties in God, and so
distinguished from those respective properties whereby every
person in the Trinity hath his own subsistence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are all equall to all the three Persons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affirmed of all. The Father Eternall, most Holy, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
mercifull; so is the Sonne and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">God is so light that in him there is no darknesse at all. 1 John 1. 5.</note> these Attributes are altogether in God alone,
and that in the highest degree and measure, yea above all degree
and measure; they are eternall and infinite in him. Hee
alone is good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 17. and only wise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 27. And
Kings of Kings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. They are affirmed of him, both
in the concrete and abstract;<note place="margin">John 8. 12. 1 John 1. 5. &amp; 4. 16.</note> Hee is not onely wise and
good, but wisdome and goodnesse it selfe, Life and Justice it
selfe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they are all actually and operatively in God. He doth
and will; his holinesse makes us holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:107075:128"/>
6. All these are in God objectively and finally; our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
lookes upon his holinesse, as the face in the looking-glasse
on the man, whose representation it is; and our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
ends in his.</p>
               <p>7. The attributes of God are everlasting,<note place="margin">Psal. 105. 8.</note> constant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
for ever in him,<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> at one time, as well as another.</p>
               <p>This may minister comfort to Gods people;<note place="margin">Psal. 136. 1. and 100. 5.</note> Gods attributes
are not mutable accidents, but his very essence, his love and
mercy are like himselfe,<note place="margin">Psal. 117. 2.</note> infinite,<note place="margin">Num. 23. 10.</note> immutable, and eternall.</p>
               <p>2. We should imitate God, and strive to be immutably good
and holy as he is, <hi>Levit. 11. 44. Matth.</hi> 5. 48.</p>
               <p>These attributes are diversly divided.</p>
               <p>1. They are Affirmative, and Negative, as Good, Just, Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
Immortall, Incorporeall.</p>
               <p>Proper and Figurative; as God is good, wise; members and
humane affections are also attributed to him.</p>
               <p>Absolute and Relative, without any relation to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
as when God is said to be Immense, Eternall; he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
said to be a Creator, King, Judge.</p>
               <p>Some describe God, as he is in himselfe; he is an essence
Spirituall, Invisible, most Simple, Infinite, Immutable, and
Immortall. Some as he is to us, he is omnipotent, most good,
just, wise and true.</p>
               <p>Some declare Gods own sufficiency;<note place="margin">Proprietates Dei sunt <hi>primi</hi> vel <hi>secundi</hi> generis. Primi generis proprietates sunt, quae ita Deo competunt, ut earum contrariae, omni in sint creaturae. Cujus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

infinite, perfect, unchangeable, eternall; others his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
as the working of his power, justice, and goodnesse
over the creatures; so he is said to be patient, just, mercifull.</p>
               <p>Some are incommunicable and agree to God alone; as
when he is said to be eternall, infinite. Others are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
in a sort with the creatures, as when he is said to be wise,
good.</p>
               <p>Those two kind of properties, which are said to be in


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107075:128"/>
God, differ from those properties, which are given to men and
Angels.</p>
               <p>In God they are infinite, unchangeable, and perfect, even the
Divine essence it selfe; and therefore indeed all one and the
same; but in men and Angels they are finite, changeable, and
imperfect, meere qualities, divers, they receiving them by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
onely, not being such of themselves by nature.</p>
               <p>It is hard to observe an accurate methode in the enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Attributes. <hi>Zanchie,</hi> Doctor <hi>Preston,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Storke</hi>
have handled some few of them, none (that I know) hath

               <p>Reasons.</p>

But some thinke the soule is the onely subject and seat,

to God, because he hath an ability of discerning, and

Sometimes againe, those words are taken properly for mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the body of some such forme, fashion, making; so
they are not to be attributed unto God; who because he hath
no body, cannot have an hand, an eye. A body is taken three
wayes. 1. For every thing which is opposite to a fancy and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and so what ever hath a being, may be called a body; in
this sence <hi>Tertullian</hi> attributes a body to God. 2. For that
thing which hath some composition or change; so God onely

But as Simplicity is opposed to mixture. Every thing the more simple (in this sence) the more excellent. <hi>In Deo idem est esse &amp; essentia, vivens &amp; vita, quia Deus non vivit per aliud essentiae superadditum, sed vitam habet inscipso &amp; est ipsa vita, vivit à scipso &amp; per scipsum.</hi>

Some have a more grosse and palpable composition of parts,
both essentiall and integrall, as a man of soule and body, and
the body of flesh, bloud, bone, and such parts. The Spirits
which have not so plaine a composition, are yet compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of substance, and accidents sustained by that substance, and
inherent in it; for the substance of an Angell and his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and qualities are different things; his life is one thing,
his reason another, his will another, his power, wisdome,
nimblenesse, other things. So the soule of a man, and all
Created things, are made up of many things conjoyned in one.</p>
               <p>God is absolutely Simple, he is but one thing, and doth not
consist of any parts; he hath no accidents; but himselfe, his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and attributes are all one thing, though by us diversly
considered and understood. If he did consist of parts, there
must be something before him, to put those parts together; and
then he were not eternall, <hi>Isay</hi> 43. 10. he is one most pure and
meere act. In God to be, to will, and to doe are the same, <hi>John
15.</hi> 26. compared with <hi>John</hi> 14. 6. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>This is one reason why God is so perfect, because he is <hi>Eus

               <p>A reasonable life (to which God resembleth his) is a power
to performe variety of regular and limited actions, to a certain
known end, and that out of choice and councell. Gods life is
his power of working all things according as seemes good to
himselfe after his owne Councell for his own glory; to say he
liveth, is to say he doth perpetually worke.</p>
               <p>Life in things bodily ariseth from the union of the body
and the soule together; and in things that be not bodies but


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107075:131"/>
spirits, from the perfection of the matter and qualities of
them.</p>
               <p>Our owne life is a power, by which we are able to produce
lively actions; Gods life is that power, whereby he is fit to
worke or produce all sorts of actions, suitable to the perfect
essence of his divine Majesty; Or it is that, whereby he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
willeth and affecteth, and can doe all sort of actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
his excellent nature.</p>
               <p>Reasons. 1. From the effects of life, God understands, wils,
loves, therefore he truly lives; for these are all the properties
of livers, therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> often concludes from this that.</p>
               <p>Because God understands all things, that he lives a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
life.</p>
               <p>2 Those things live which move and stirre themselves; God
doth all things by himselfe,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> he is the first and perfectest cause of
all; therefore he most properly lives, and that a most blessed
life.</p>
               <p>3. From his name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is by himselfe
and most perfectly, and of whom all things are, which are

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. God lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause life is originally in him, <hi>Psal. 36. 9 John</hi> 1. 4. in him was life.</note> God therefore so lives, that he is the Authour of all
life to all livers, and therefore he is called our life, <hi>Deut. 30.
20. John</hi> saith of Christ, in him was the Authour of life, and
<hi>Act.</hi> 3. ye have killed the Author of life.</p>
               <p>Amongst the creatures which are subject to our sense, there
is a three fold kinde of life. Two more imperfect; the third
more perfect.</p>
               <p>The former is the life of vegetation or growth; by which
things are able to doe what is requisite for the attaining and
maintaining of their full strength and nature, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
of their kinde, according to their severall
kinds.</p>
               <p>The second is the life of sence, whereby things are inabled
to discerne things hurtfull to them, and things good for them;
to shune the one, and to seek the other.</p>
               <p>These are imperfect kinds of life, because they are inherent
after a sort in the bodies of things, accompanying a corporall
being, which is the meanest being.</p>
               <p>

called reasonable, such as is seen in men and in Angels, which
is an ability to proceed reasonably and understandingly in all
actions, for the attaining of good and shunning of evils, fit for
the welfare of the person indued with reason. Now we must
not conceive in God any such imperfect thing as growth or
sense, for he is a spirituall, a Simple and Immateriall essence;
but his life is to be understood by the similitude of the life of
reason, for he is a perfect understanding. To the being then
of God adjoyn reasonablenesse in our concerning of him, and
we conceive his life somewhat aright.</p>
               <p>God life differs from the life of the creature.</p>
               <p>1. His life is his nature; or essence, he is life it selfe, theirs

<hi>Act.</hi> 17. 25. 28. He is life, and the fountaine of life to all
things.</p>
               <p>3 His life is infinite, without beginning or ending; their
life is finite, and had a beginning, and most of them shall
have an end.</p>

8.</hi> 10. 17. Men will give skinne for skinne, and all that they
have for life. It is reported of one, that he offered to redeeme
his life, thrice his weight in Silver, twice in Gold, once in
Pearle. But we doe little for the living God, and communion
with him in the life of grace, and for obtaining eternall life.</p>
               <p>God is <hi>immortall</hi> and <hi>incorruptible,</hi> he liveth for ever in like
perfection.</p>
               <p>The Scripture confirmeth this.</p>
               <p>1. Negatively, when it removes mortality, and corruption
from God, <hi>Rom. 1. 23. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 17. and 6. 16.</p>
               <p>2. Affirmatively, when it giveth life to God, <hi>Gen. 16. 14.
Deut. 5. 26. Jer.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>The property of Gods life is, it is endlesse, incorruptible,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 40. Life is essentiall to God, he is life it selfe, but
the life of other things is accidentall. His life is also effective,
he gives life to all living creatures.</p>
               <p>2. God is of himselfe eternall, of himselfe, and absolutely
immortall, and incorruptible. <hi>He onely hath immortality,
1 Tim.</hi> 6. 16. Angels are not immortall in and of themselves,
they have not originall, or absolute immortality; their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
is dependent and derivative.</p>
               <p>3. Because he is voyd of all composition, therefore he is
free from corruption.</p>
               <p>4. Because he is simply, and every way immutable.</p>

5 This is proved from the Nobility, and perfection of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

not live; but God is the most perfect, and noble being,
<hi>John</hi> 5. 26.</p>
               <p>6. Because he is blessed, therefore he is immortall, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 14</p>
               <p>1. This comforts all Gods people, who have the living
God for their friend; who liveth for ever, and they shall live
eternally with him; the life of God comforted <hi>Job.</hi> 19. 25.

to exceede reason or capacity; it is opposed to Finite,
which is to bound or limite, to define, to end, or conclude.</p>
               <p>

               <p>He hath all good things in him in all fulnesse of perfection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all measure and degrees, yea above all conceiveable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

all creatures can conceive and thinke; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 20. that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which is in him is Infinite,<note n="(a)" place="margin">All his properties are infinite.</note> his love is infinite, his
mercies are infinite, and so is his anger. That which is of it
selfe cannot be limited by any thing. Every creature is limited
and hath certaine bounds set to it by its causes, especially the

First each thing is set in its owne ranke or order with other
things, some being of one kind, some of another; some things
are simple, some compounded, some corporeall, some incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall,
some things living, some things void of life, some
things sensible, and some things senselesse; and so in the rest.
The maker of all things<note n="b" place="margin">Nature triumpheth in nothing so much as in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude.</note> hath as it were sorted them into

of wisdome.</p>
               <p>God is not limited to any kind of being, but hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
all kinds of being, not subjectively but eminently. He

               <p>He is unlimited in regard of time or duration, and so is
Eternall; in regard of place, and so is immense or omnipresent,
in regard of degrees of all things that are in him, and so is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Infinite in stability, immutable in his power, omnipotent.</p>
               <p>Gods infinitenesse makes all wonderfull, his mercies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
his love infinite, his goodnesse and excellencies infinite.</p>
               <p>A thing may be said to be infinite, either absolutely and in
the whole kind of being, so God, all good is in him formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or eminently. 2. In some certaine kind only, as if there
were infinite quantity, it were only infinite in the way of a
body; it would not containe all other things in it.</p>
               <p>From Gods Infinitenesse ariseth his All-sufficiency, he is

<hi>David</hi> proves it by a particular enumeration, of places, Heaven &amp;

<hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 7. 8. 9. 10. He compares places most opposite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

               <p>2. From Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. From the Simplicity of the Divine essence, God is a pure
act; therefore altogether indivisible, and therefore he is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, and in every part of every thing, whole and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>

compasse (as I may call it) beyond which their essence

in heaven, that they are not the same time on earth. But
God is altogether above place; he is omnipresent, not by any
materiall extension, but after an incomprehensible and
unexpressible manner. He is quite above all place, wholy
without, and within all and every place; and that without
all locall motion, or mutation of place. He is everywhere

               <p>Gods being in every place, is not first by multiplication; there
is not a multiplication of his being, as loaves were multiplyed,
so that they held out to doe that which otherwise they could
not; for then there should be many divine essences; nor second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by division, as if part of his nature, were in one part of the

he is.</p>
               <p>Nor thirdly by commixtion, as if he came into composition
with any creature. He is not the aire or fire, but he is every
where effectively with his essence and being, repletively he
fils all places, heaven and earth. Yet he fils not up a place, as
a body doth; but is present everywhere, by being without
limitation of place; so that he coexists with every creature.

               <p>The Schoolemen, say God is five wayes in the creatures.</p>
               <p>1. In the humanity of Christ; by hypostaticall union.</p>
               <p>2. In the Saints, by knowledge and love.</p>
               <p>3. In the Church, by his essence and direction.</p>
               <p>4. In heaven, by his Majesty and glory.</p>
               <p>5. In Hell by his vindicative justice.</p>
               <p>1. This may teach the godly to be sincere and upright;<note place="margin">Consectaries from Gods Immensity, or Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, <hi>Job.</hi> 31. 14.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they walke before God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. he is present with
them, understands their secret thoughts, and imaginations.
<hi>Psal. 139. 7. 8. Jer.</hi> 23. 23. 24 This should curbe them from
committing secret sinnes; and incourage them to perform
private duties, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. approving themselves to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who seeth in secret. Solitarinesse should not imbolden us
to sinne, nor hinder us from well-doing. It was <hi>Josephs</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to his Mistresse, <hi>how can I doe this great evill?</hi> though they
were alone, God was present.</p>
               <p>Two religious men, took two contrary courses, with two
lewd women; whom they were desirous to reclaime from
their ill course of life; the one came to one of the women as
desirous of her company, so it might be with all secrecy; and
when she had brought him to a close roome, that none could
prie into, then he told her, that <hi>all the bolts and barres which
were, could not keepe God out.</hi> The other desired to accompany
with the other woman openly in the street; which when shee
rejected as a mad request, He told her, it was better to doe it in
the eyes of a multitude, then of God.</p>
               <p>2. This serves to confute the Lutherans, who hold Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
to be communicated to Christs body, and therefore they
say his body is in the Sacrament, and every where else; because
it is assumed by God, but this is false; for the reason of Gods


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107075:137"/>
omni-presence, is the infinitenesse of his nature, and therefore
it can be no more communicated to the body of Christ then the
Godhead can; for his humane nature might as well be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
as everywhere. Christs body is a finite creature, and
though it be glorified, yet is not deified. It is an incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
attribute of the Deity, to be in many places at one and
the same time.</p>
               <p>3. Let us esteeme God a greater good then any creature;
friends are distant one from another; God is with us in our
journies and families. He onely is the object of Prayer, for he
is everywhere to heare thee; and so are not Angels. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

the continuance of things past, present, and to come, all time
hath a beginning, a vicissitude, and an end, or may have; but
Gods essence is bounded by none of these hedges.</p>
               <p>First, he is without beginning, he is before time, beyond
time, behind time as it were, and above all circumscription of
time. <hi>From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</hi> He is what

and his truth.</p>
               <p>4. By a metaphoricall description, dayes and yeares are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed

<hi>Job. 10. 5. Dan.</hi> 7. 9, 22. He is called <hi>the Ancient of dayes,

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:107075:138"/>
Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. God is the best thing that is,<note place="margin">Of necessity there must be a first cause, and therefore must be something without a beginning.</note> therefore it must needs
follow, that he is an eternall essence; for that which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
is better then that which is not.</p>
               <p>2. Else he should depend on some thing else, if he were not
eternall; and then he were not God.</p>
               <p>3. If he were not eternall, he must have a beginning; and
then something else must give it him, and so be better then he.</p>
               <p>4. God created all things, even time it selfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. He
is therefore before all things, and without beginning, <hi>Rom. 1.
2.</hi> and whatsoever was before time, must needs be eternall.</p>
               <p>5. He is the Author, and giver of eternall life to those that
have it, therefore he must needs be eternall himselfe; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
can give eternity, that is eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> If God were eternall; where was he before the world
was? and what did he before he made all things;<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine Confess. l. 11. c. 12.</note> and why did
he make the world no sooner then a few thousand yeares since?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> These are curiosities, but for answer, as he was of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
so was he in and with himselfe. He is that himselfe, to
and in himselfe, which to us our being, time and place are
found to be. 2. He injoyes himselfe, and his owne happinesse.
3. He made the world no sooner, because it did not please him.</p>
               <p>The creature is limited by the circumstance of time, by
which it hath its being measured out as it were by parcels, past,
present, and to come; it had beginning, hath succession, and
may have an end. The most glorious Angell, as well as a
worme, is thus limited by time; once he was not, then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be; that which is past is gone; and that which is to
come is not yet, and he hath but a little time present. But
Gods essence had no beginning, hath no succession, can have
no end. We cannot say of it properly, it was or shall be,
but alone it is;<note place="margin">

               <p>Reasons.</p>
               <p>1. From his perfection, all change is a kinde of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
there is indeed a change corruptive, and perfective; but
the perfective alteration, supposeth the Subject to be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>2. He is uncompounded, therefore altogether Immutable, a
pure act.</p>
               <p>3. He is truly and properly eternall, therefore Immutable;
for he is truly eternall, who is alwayes the same, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
change or end.</p>
               <p>4. If God, should change, then either he must change for
the better, and then he was not best and perfect before; or for
the worse, and then he is not best now.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:107075:140"/>
5 If he should be changed, it must be from some other thing
stronger then himselfe, and there is none such. Nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him can change him, because he is omnipotent, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within him, for there is no Ignorance in his minde,
inconstancy in his will, nor impotency in his power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> God doth repent, <hi>Gen. 6. 6. 1 Sam. 15. 11 2 Sam. 24.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> God is not said properly to repent; but after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of<note n="*" place="margin">Cum nos pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitet, destruimus quod fecimus. Sic Deus paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisse dicitur secundum simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

men use to doe when they repent, they forbeare to doe what
they have done, and doe the contrary, change their actions;
Gods repenting of the evill in those places, is a putting on a
resolution not to do the evill he had threatened, or not to persist
in doing that which he had begun to doe. There is a change
in the creature, but no change in God either in respect of his
nature or decree; therefore in other places it is said, he doth not
repent; that is, not change or alter his minde. God wils

not God; as Houses and Trees seeme to move to them which
are in a Ship, but the Ship moves and they stand firme, one may

that now this thing be done, and after the contrary, but the
will should be changed, if one began to will, what he willed
not before.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 18. 8. and 26. 2. 3.</note> Those threatenings and promises were not absolute but
conditionall; and how soever the condition was uncertaine
in respect of men, yet it was most certaine in respect of
God. His promises are made with condition of faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The object is changed, God is still the same; as the Sun
which was troublesome to sore eyes is pleasant to them being

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> God Immutably wils both the end and the meanes, and
therefore as he wils thy pardon, so he wils thy prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> God created the world, and so Christ was incarnate
and made man; now he that was made something, he was not
before, or did make something he made not before, seemes to
be changed. He is a man, he was not so once; he is a Creator,
he was not so from eternity.</p>
               <p>

but Gods will from eternity, that the world should exist
in time, so that the creature hath something now, which it
had not before, but Gods will hath not.</p>
               <p>God is not changed any way,<note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon them;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 18. 19.</note> they must change, or else there is no repealing of
the curse. The wicked hope he will change, the godly

               <p>2. Of propriety, whereby he having a right to every creature,

               <p>The first is implyed in that of <hi>JAmes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">JAmes 4. 12.</note> there <hi>is one Law-giver,

               <p>Gods dominion is that absolute right and power, whereby
he possesseth all things as his own, and disposeth of them as he
pleaseth.</p>
               <p>Reason. The supreame excellencie of his nature; whereby
he is infinitely above, not onely those things which are actuall,

               <p>Gods first dominion of jurisdiction hath these parts.</p>
               <p>1. To Command.</p>

               <p>3. He can change and alter things as he pleaseth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 21.
as when he bid <hi>Ahraham</hi> kill his Sonne, and the Israelites take
the Egyptians goods.</p>
               <p>4. Can distribute his goods unequally to whom, and when

               <p>The adjuncts of this dominion.</p>
               <p>1. It is Independent; he hath this dominion of himselfe, as
he is God of himselfe.</p>

infinitely greater then all others.</p>
               <p>4. It extends to the soule and heart; God is called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

man needs many helpers, his sences, fancie and intellgible
species.</p>

particular.</p>
               <p>3. Our knowledge is simply finite, but Gods infinite.</p>
               <p>4. We understand things by species or Images, abstracted
from them, he by his essence.</p>
               <p>5. We understand things successively one after another, with
paines of discourse, proceeding from an unknown thing to a
known, or from a lesse known to a more known: but God
knows all things together, and by one most simple, immutable,
and eternall act of understanding.</p>
               <p>6. He knows himself,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>He is</hi> prìmus intelligens and prímum intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibile.</note> and all other things perfectly, all

that which shall be, which shall be never be; we cannot
shew the causes nor properties of an Herbe, and understand
onely those things which are, or at least have been, and we
know doubtingly.</p>
               <p>There is in God (say the Schoolmen) <hi>scientia visionis,</hi> a
knowledge of all future things; 2. <hi>Simplicis intelligentiae,</hi> a
most perfect knowledge of all, and the severall things, which

serve in nature, and that end is the mutuall preservation one
of another, and common beautifying of the whole workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
in subordination to that high end of his glory; and so
he hath fitted each thing for that particular end he made it;
and all for the universall end, to which he intended all. The
Sunne was made to distinguish day and night and the severall
seasons, it is most fit for that end, it is most fit for the end in

Wisdome hath two principall acts, fore-sight, and fore-cast,
by which a man can beforehand see what will be after to
make his use of it; 2. disposing and ordering things, by taking
the fittest meanes and opportunities to attain his own good
and right ends. This vertue is Infinitely in God, for he doth
fore-see all thiings eternally; and in time disposeth of them
most fitly, by the fittest meanes and opportunities for the best
that can be, to his own glory, which is the highest end that he
can and should ayme at; for to that which is the best of all
things, must all things else be referred; therefore God is the
onely wise God. Gods knowledge differs from his wisdome,
in our apprehension thus. His knowledge is conceived as
the meer apprehension of every object, but his wisdome is
conceived as that whereby he doth order and dispose all
things. His knowledge is conceived as an act; his wisdome
as an habit or inward principle; not that it is so, but onely
we apprehend it in this manner.</p>
               <p>Gods wisdom is seene in these particulars.</p>

which is an act<note n="*" place="margin">Gods hatred is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is ready to that which we doe when we hate, even to separate a thing from himselfe. Ezek. 33. 11. Rom. 9, 14. Psal. 45. 7. &amp; 5. 6: Esay 1. 14.</note> of the Divine will, declining, disproving and
punishing of evill, prevailing and reigning in the reasonable
creature.</p>
               <p>In which definition three things are to be noted.</p>
               <p>1. The object of Gods hatred.</p>
               <p>2. The cause and condition of the object hated.</p>
               <p>3. The effect of Gods hatred.</p>
               <p>1. The object of Gods hatred is the reasonable creature,<note place="margin">Hatred is of things contrary to us, as God hates sinne, being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Nature, 2 Law. 3 Hononr. Psal, 45. 8.</note> for
that onely sins. He hateth iniquity, <hi>Psal. 71. 59. Prov.</hi> 11. 1. and
the creature which obstinately and stubbornly persisteth in
evill, so that he doth rejoyce in the calamity and destruction
thereof, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 5. &amp; 5. 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 5.</p>
               <p>2. The cause and condition of the object hated, is sinne; for
which God abhors the delinquent creature; onely the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
creature hath left his station, and defiled himselfe with
the filth of sinne; all the rest of the creatures, whether brute
beasts or insensible creatures, persist in the state of goodnesse
wherein they were created, although perhaps not in the same
degree of perfection and excellency for mans sinne. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
God cannot hate the creature unlesse as sinfull: yet not
every degree of sinne, but a high measure of it, makes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hated. It is true that God abhors the least sin, yet he doth
not abhor the persons of the godly, in which are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of sinne, as he doth those of the wicked in whom sinne
raignes.</p>
               <p>3. The effect of Gods hatred is to punish the person whom
he hates, whom when once it is rejected by God troopes of
evill doe invade, God both permitting and commanding; and
this actuall hatred or outward manner of manifesting it may
not unfitly be referred to the Divine justice. Hatred in
God is a vertue, and fruit of his justice, and not a vicious
passion.</p>
               <p>1. We should hate sinne (for God hateth it) and that with
the greatest hatred,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 16.</note> even as hell it selfe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. sinne is the

mentioning divers evils saith, <hi>God forbid, I hate vaine thoughts,</hi>
saith <hi>David.</hi> Our affections must be conformable to Gods. He
hateth nothing simply but sinne, and sinners for sinnes
sake. 2. Sinne is as most injurious to God, so most hurtfull
to man; therefore it is in it selfe most hatefull. The ground
of hatred of any thing is the contrariety of it to our welfare,
as we hate wild, fierce, and raging beasts, for their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vousnesse,
a Toade and Serpents for their poysonfulnesse,
which is a strong enemy to life and health. Sinne is the most
mischievous and harmfull thing in the world. Just hatred is
generall of whole kinds, as we hate all Serpents, so we should
all sinnes.</p>

hath made just and right Lawes: then it is a wrong to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
a denying and opposing of it, to neglect, dis-regard,

God takes to himselfe also Griefe and Joy. Gods griefe is his
aptnesse to be displeased with a thing, as a man is with that
which grieves him. Joy is the excellency of his nature, by
which he is well pleased with other things.</p>
               <p>So God attributes to himselfe desire and detestation, hope

any thing; Detestation is that whereby he useth fit and due

               <p>Our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 17. reproved one for calling him

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31. It was said of every thing particularly
when it was made, <hi>The Lord saw that it was good;</hi> and in the
conclusion of the whole creation, <hi>God saw all his workes that
they were good,</hi> yea, <hi>very good;</hi> that is, commodious for the
comfort of man, and all other creatures. He made all things
good, therefore he is good himselfe. This may be proved by
the godnesse which still remaines in the creatures; each crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath yet remaining in him a power and fitnesse to doe
much good, and bring much comfort to man, as daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
proves; therefore he that notwithstanding the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of man hath continued yet much good in the world, is
surely good; the beasts doe good to their young, man to his
children; this power they received from God.</p>
               <p>5. God is to be loved, honoured, praised, and served by
man, therefore he is good; or else he were not worthy this
respect from the creature.</p>
               <p>The goodnesse of God is either considered <hi>ad intra</hi> and
absolutely, or else <hi>ad extra</hi> and respectively. For the first, God
in himselfe is good. This appeares:</p>
               <p>1. In reckoning up all the kinds of good things that are,
for there is 1. <hi>Bonum utile,</hi> the profitable good; now how
happy must they needs be who have him which can command
all things; if thou hast him thou hast all things else in him.
2. There is <hi>bonum jucundum,</hi>

<hi>at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore. 3. Bonum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he is the holy God, the authour of all holinesse, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
of it.</p>
               <p>2. This goodnesse of his cannot be increased, it being his
essence, it cannot be made better; for God hath in him not
onely all the actuall, but all the possible goodnesse that is in
the creatures; any creature still may be better; thy riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
comforts may be better; but thy God cannot be a better
God; therefore we should infinitely affect him more then all
creatures.</p>
               <p>3. It is independent goodnesse, he is <hi>omnis boni bonum;</hi>
hence he is said to be onely good, that is, essentially and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably.</p>

               <p>5. It is illimited goodnesse, infinite, without all bounds,
above all that can be conceived; he being essentially so, and
not limited to this or that being, neither is his goodnesse.</p>
               <p>6. It is immixed goodnesse, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. He is light, and there

all terminate their desires in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God is good respectively, in what he doth to the
creatures, that appeareth in the good things bestowed upon
them. He gives to all liberally, especially the rationall, creatures,
as Men and Angels partake of his goodnesse, being made capable

               <p>Gods justice and mercy are both infinite and equall in him,
onely in regard of man there is an inequality. For God may
be said to be more mercifull unto them that are saved then just
to them that are damned; for the just cause of damnation is in
man, but of salvation is wholy from God. In himselfe and
originally they are both equall, and so are all his attributes;
but in respect of the exercise and expression upon his creatures
and abroad in the world, there is some difference. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

thing is, and fidelity whereby he fulfilleth all that he hath
spoken.</p>
               <p>The Arminians urge, how can God in justice command
a man by his word the performance of that which cannot
be done by him without the inward helpe of the Spirit, and
yet in the meane time God denies this inward grace unto
him?</p>
               <p>God may without blemish to his justice command man to
performe his duty, although he have now no strength to doe
it, because once he had strength, and he hath now lost it.</p>

good to be done amongst men if each in his person and place
be not faithfull; this therefore is required of all men.</p>
               <p>Faithfulnesse is that vertue by which a man is carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

his place or promise,<note place="margin">What faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is.</note> or both, do bind him. Or, it is that vertue
by which a man is as good as his word, when one doth speake
good, and is indeed as good as in speech, this is faithfulnesse.
It hath two parts: 1. the agreement of his meaning with his
words at the time that he speaketh, when he purposeth to doe
according as he speaketh. 2 The agreement of his actions
with his words and meaning, when he continues constant in
his purpose till he have done what in him lies to effect it; as
it is said of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>one glory of the Sunne;</hi> sometimes for outward decking and
adorning as <hi>long haire is a glory to a woman;</hi> but the proper
signification of it is, excellent estimation by which one is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before others.</p>
               <p>Glory is used metonymically for that which is the ground
and matter of glory, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 11. &amp; 20. 29. Sometimes the
glory of God signifieth the very essence and nature of God, as
<hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 18. Sometimes it is used to signifie some of Gods At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 12. that is, his grace and good will, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth of which he makes himselfe glorious. Sometimes
it is put for some worke of God which is great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<hi>John</hi> 11. 40. that is, the grace and powerfull worke of
God in raising up thy brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> unto life againe, <hi>Exod.
25.</hi> 16. &amp; 40. 35. that is, some extraordinary splendor, as R.
<hi>Moses</hi> expounds it, which God created, thereby to shew forth
his magnificence and glory.</p>
               <p>Glory is taken essentially, as it signifieth the nature and
attributes of of God; or else respectively, as it signifieth the
acknowledgement and celebration of his Majesty, and this is
called properly glorification; this may have more or lesse.</p>
               <p>Or secondly, much to the same purpose, the glory of God
may be taken two waies:</p>
               <p>1 For the inward excellency and worth whereby he deserves
to be esteemed and praised.</p>
               <p>2 For the actuall acknowleding of it, for glory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
a cleare and manifest knowledge of anothers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107075:173"/>
therefore the glory of God is two-fold.</p>
               <p>First, Internall, which is againe twofold.</p>
               <p>1 Objective, that glory of God is the excellency of his
Divine nature, for such is his Majesty and excellency, that
he is infinitely worthy to be praised, admired and loved
of all.</p>
               <p>2 Formall, is his owne knowledge, love, and delight in
himselfe; for this is infinitely more the glory of God, that
he is knowne and beloved of himselfe, then that he is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and praised by all creatures, Men or Angels, bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>use
this argueth an infinite worth in Gods own nature, that an
infinite love and delight is satisfied with it</p>
               <p>God hath this kind of glory objectiv and formall, most
fully even from all eternity; therefore when he is said to
make all things for himselfe or his glory, it is not meant of
this inward glory, as if he could have more of that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Externall; and that againe</p>
               <p>1 By way of object, <hi>viz.</hi> when he made the Heavens and
Earth, and all these glorious creatures here below, which are
said to shew forth his glory, <hi>Psalm</hi> 19. that is, objectively,
they are the effects of his glorious wisdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and power, and
so become objects of mens and Angels praises of him; and
as the glory of men consists in outward ornaments, so Gods
glory consists in having such creatures, men and Angels to
be his followers.</p>
               <p>2 Formall, when men and Angels doe know, love, and
obey him, and praise him to all eternity.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures every where extoll the Majesty and glory of
God.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Essentially, when it cals God</hi> Great, Most high, Glorious,

and preservation or providence, <hi>Psalm</hi> 19. the whole creation

must needs gather, that if the Heavens be such glorious Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
the Sunne so glorious a Sunne, how much more must
that God be a glorious God who is the authour and worker
of them.</p>
               <p>God is glorious in all his workes upon the hearts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
he puts a glory upon them, so that in this sence he is
effectually glorious, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. a glorious Church, and <hi>Psalm 43.
The Kings daughter is all glorious within;</hi> this glory is grace
when God makes one holy, heavenly-minded, meeke, zealous;
hereafter we shall have glorious bodies and soules.</p>
               <p>God made all things for his glory, for of him and to him
are all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. All the unreasonable creatures are for
Gods glory.</p>
               <p>1 In that they are serviceable to man, for herein God is
glorified in that they can accomplish those ends for which they
were made, and that is for man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. the Sunne and Starres
are for him as well as creeping things; these creatures are for
a twofold use.</p>
               <p>1 To give him habitation and to be meanes of his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
life.</p>
               <p>2 To be continuall quickners of him, to praise Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
power and wisdome; God is said <hi>Acts</hi> 4. not to leave
himselfe without witnesse; the reasonable creatures are made
chiefly for his glory, because they know and love him.</p>
               <p>That God is Glorious appeares</p>
               <p>1 God hath made many of his creatures glorious, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 8.


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:107075:174"/>
so there is one glory of the Sunne, another of the Moone; the
King clad with gorgeous attire, and being arrayed with the
Ensignes of his Soveraignty is glorious, so <hi>Salomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 This glory shall continue for ever because God hath it
from himselfe, and derived it not from another. He is a perfect
being, independent, all things are under him; the inferiour can
not worke without the superiour.</p>
               <p>There is a double glory in things.</p>
               <p>1 Inherent in themselves,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Salomons</hi> glory was in part vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Throne, his glittering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, but his wisdome and understanding were not; God perceives his owne glory, and that it shall continue for ever; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle beheld the glory of Christ as of the onely begotten Son.</note> which is partly visible as that of
the Sunne; partly intelligible, an excellency in a thing which
affects the understanding.</p>
               <p>2 From without, given by others; so there is a kinde of
glory and excellency in some precious stones which affect a
man with a kind of wondering; so in an Angell a great shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as in that which appeared to <hi>Zachary;</hi> so in the vision
that <hi>Paul</hi> saw, and when God appeared to <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an inward glory standing in being worthy of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
esteeme, and an outward glory standing in being highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of; God is worthy to be esteemed above all, and is so
by the holy.</p>
               <p>The chiefest and highest cause of any benefit shewd to us, is
not our selves, but the name of God, even his glory, and the
cleare declaration of his owne excellencies, <hi>Ezek. 20 9. 14. 22.
Psalm 25. 1. Ezek.</hi> 36. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1 The thing which induced God to make all things,
must needs be the cause of all other benefits bestowed after the
creation; now he made all things for himselfe and his owne
name; for neither had they any being, nor could they have
any before, and therefore could not be any moving cause to
their owne creation, therefore neither to doe any other thing.</p>
               <p>2 All creatures are nothing, and lesse then nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of God, therefore he could not by them be moved to
worke any thing, but doth it for his owne names sake. Things
meane and triflng are not fit to be the highest end of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
worke. God is most high and glorious, and all
creatures are lesse then nothing before him, therefore himselfe
must be moved by himselfe, not by them chiefly to doe any


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107075:174"/>
thing for them. For as God hath no efficient, materiall; or
formall cause at all, but is to himselfe instead of all these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is of himselfe, so neither can he have any finall cause
but himselfe. For if he have any other end then himselfe, that
is, his own glory, he were some way dependent upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing which is impossible.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, how is it said then, that God doth this or
that for <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> sake, as often <hi>Moses</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
him in his prayers. The answer is, he lookes upon them
still in subordination to his owne name, so that they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
but in reference to his name, and no otherwise. He glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
himselfe, and aimeth at his own glory, in keeping cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and promise with them.</p>
               <p>Gods glory is the end of predestination, both reprobation,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1. and election, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 5, 6. of the creation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. of all benefits obtained
in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. and should be of all our actions, 1

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the infinite glory which God hath as God,
be communicated to Christs humane nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That being a creature can not have that glory which
is due to the Creator. It is true Christ is infinitely to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
because he is God and man, but not therefore his humane
nature. Our Divines distinguish between a glory meerely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and a Mediators glory, which is next to divine, far above
all creatures.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Christ had it in decree and predestination, and that was
not Gods essentiall glory, which is a property, for he requires
he may have it now, which could not be if he had it from

               <p>We glorifie God not by putting any excellency into him,
but by taking notice of his excellency, and esteeming him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and making manifest this our high esteem of him.
There is a twofold glory.</p>
               <p>1 Essentiall, infinite, everlasting; this is called <hi>gloria,</hi> it


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107075:175"/>
receives neither addition nor diminution by any created
power.</p>
               <p>2 Accidentall, finite, temporary, called <hi>glorificatio;</hi> this ebs
or flowes, shines, or is overshadowed, as goodnesse or grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
prevailes in the world.</p>
               <p>It serves</p>
               <p>1 To shew the vilenesse and basenesse of all wicked men
which oppose Gods glory,<note place="margin">Consectaries from Gods glory.</note> and strive to obscure it, dishonour
this glorious God, setting light by him in their hearts, and
blaspheming him with their tongues; a sinner in sinning lifts
up himselfe above God, preferring his own wisdome before
Gods, and his will before his; therefore <hi>David</hi> worthily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the 104 Psalme with an imprecation against sinners,
God will gaine glory of them in despight of their hearts by
magnifying his justice.</p>
               <p>2 We should labour to partake of Gods Image, that we
might be partakers of his glory; we must earnestly desire that
Gods glory may be communicated to us, that he would send
forth his Spirit of glory to rest upon us, by which meanes we
shall commend our selves to God, Christ, the Angels and
Saints, and our owne consciences.</p>
               <p>3 We must learne to contemplate the glory of God with
admiration; by this one principally differs from a beast. He
hath not a capacity to behold the excellency of God,<note place="margin">Those that doe not take notice of Gods name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lose the chiefe fruit of his workes.</note> the Saints
in Heaven are even taken up and filled with beholding Gods

your soules to enjoy God. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>In the mystery of the

               <p>7 Take heed of those Tenets which oppose Gods glory, as</p>
               <p>1 The lawfulnesse of giving religious honour to images; the
Popish Doctors have wearied themselves and wracked their
braines to coine distinctions, how divine worship may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Images, but the second Commandement forbids Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshipping,
and God acknowledgeth himselfe a jealous God,

               <p>Let us first live to his glory, and doe all for his glory:
1. Because he intended it. 2. He hath joyned our happinesse
and his glory together. 3. It is infinitely more worth then all

Gods Blessednesse is that by which God is in himselfe, and
of himselfe Al-sufficient. Or thus, Gods happinesse is that
Attribute whereby God hath all fulnesse of delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in himselfe, and needeth nothing out of himselfe
to make him happy.</p>
               <p>The Hebrews call blessed <hi>Ashrei</hi> in the abstract, and in the

By the etymologies and significations of these two
words, it appeares (saith <hi>Zanchy)</hi> that there are two parts of
blessednesse, one to be free from all miseries, another to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with all goods, and so to abound with them that thou

light, that is more hot and light then that which is made so;
so must he exceede all other things in blessednesse, which
makes all those persons blessed which have any part of
blisse.</p>
               <p>2 Either he hath blessednesse or there should be none; for if

men and things affect it, therefore such a naturall and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
inclination can not be wholly in vaine, as it should be if
there were no blessednesse to satisfie it. The happinesse of every
thing stands in the perfect enjoying of it selfe, when it hath
all which it inclineth to have, and inclineth to have all and
onely that which it hath, then it is fully satisfied and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and full contentment is felicity. Goodnesse filleth the
reasonable appetite of mans soule, therefore must he needs be
happy whose will is filled with good, for then he enjoyes
himselfe, then is his being truely comfortable to him, and such
as he cannot be weary of. Nothing is happy in enjoying it
selfe and of it selfe, but God alone; all other things doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
themselves by helpe and benefit of some other things besides
themselves. And if they enjoy themselves by helpe, favour, and
communication of a perfect, lasting, constant, eternall and
full goodnesse, then have they a reall, solid, and substantiall
happinesse; but if by a vaine, short, momentany, partiall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
goodnesse, then have they but a shew and resemblance of
happinesse, a poore, weake, feeble, imperfect, nominall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The happinesse of a man consists in enjoying himselfe
by vertue of the possession of the greatest good, whereof he is
capable, or which is all one, by enjoying the greatest good;
for enjoying it he enjoyes himselfe in and by it; and enjoying
himselfe by it, he doth enjoy it, these are inseparably conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
So when a man is possessed of such a thing as doth remove
from him all that may be discontentfull and hurtfull to him,
and can fill him full of content, then is he happy, and that is
when he hath possession of God as fully as his nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of possessing him. Accordingly we must conceive Gods
happinesse to be in the enjoyment of himselfe; he doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
enjoy his being, his life, his faculties, his Attributes, his
vertues. I say himselfe in himselfe and of himselfe doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
enjoy himselfe, and this is his perfect happinesse. He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
a most perfect life, abounds with all perfect vertues, sets
them a worke himselfe in all fulnesse of perfection, and in all
this enjoyes himselfe with unconceivable satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Blessednesse or felicity is the perfect action or exercise of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">Aristotle.</note>


                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107075:178"/>
vertue in a perfect life. The Lord hath a most perfect life,
and perfect faculties, and also most perfect vertues, and doth
constantly exercise those perfect vertues and faculties. He is
blessed because he is strong, and enjoyes his strength, wise and
enjoyes his wisdome, just and enjoyes his justice, eternall and
enjoyes his eternity, Infinite, Perfect, and that without any
dependence, reference or beholdingnesse to any other.</p>
               <p>God is <hi>Happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 Formally in himselfe, which implies 1. that there is no
evill of sinne or misery in him, neither is he lesse happy because
men offend him. Secondly, that he abounds with all positive
good, he hath infinitely himselfe and after a transcendent
manner the good of all creatures; this is implied in that name,
when he is called a <hi>God Al-sufficient;</hi> he made not the Angels or
the world because he needed them.</p>
               <p>3. That he is immutably happy because he is essentially so.
Happinesse is a stable or setled condition; therefore Saints and
Angels also are happy but dependently, they have it from
God.</p>
               <p>Gods happinesse is more then the happinesse of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The creatures are happy by the aggregation of many good
things together, they are happy in their knowledge, in their
love, joy, and these are divers things; but now God is happy
by one act which is the same with his essence. A man here on
earth is happy, but it is not in Act alwaies, it is sometimes in
habit.</p>
               <p>2 Those Acts by which Angels are happy are successive,
they have one act of understanding,<note place="margin">Happinesse is taken two waies. 1 Octjectively, for the object wherein one is happy, as Gods infinite essence is the object both of Gods, Angels, and mens happinesse. 2 Formally, for those acts whereby we possesse that object.

compleat and perfect when we enjoy God as an object wherein
the powers of the soule are satisfied with everlasting delight.</p>
               <p>This may suffice to have spoken concerning Gods Essence
and Attributes, by which it appeares, that God is farre different
both from all faigned Gods, and from all creatures. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the Divine persons followeth, for in one most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
nature of God there are distinct persons.</p>

Trinity hath a sufficient ground, <hi>there are three that beare witnesse in Heaven,</hi> 1 John 5. 7. The word person is extant, Heb. 1. 3. therefore these words are rightly used in the Church.</note> or distinction of Persons in the Divine
Essence.</head>
               <p>WE cannot by the light of nature know the mystery of
the Trinity, nor the incarnation of Jesus Christ. But
when by faith we receive this doctrine we may illustrate it by
reason. The similies which the Schoolmen and other Divines
bring drawn from the creature, are unequall and unsatisfactory,
since there can be no proportion between things Finite and
Infinite.</p>
               <p>Two resemblances are much used in Scripture, the Light
and the word. The Light which was three daies before the
Sunne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and then condensed into that glorious body,
and ever since diffused throughout the world, is all one and
the same light. So the Father of lights which inhabiteth light
which none can approach, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. and the Sunne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2. in whom all the fulnesse of the Godhead
dwelleth bodily,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 17, 18.</note> and the holy Ghost the Spirit of illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are all one and the same God.</p>
               <p>Again, it is the same thing that the mind thinketh, and the
word signifieth, and the voyce uttereth: so is the Father as the
mind conceiving, the Sonne as the word conceived or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the holy Ghost as the voice or speech uttered and imparted
to all hearers; and all one and the same God.</p>
               <p>A studious Father meditating on the mysterie of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
there appeared unto him a child with a shell lading the
Sea into a little hole; he demanding what the child did, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107075:180"/>
said the child,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Par</hi> on Rom. 11. 23.</note> to empty the Ocean into this pit. It is
impossible, said the Father; as possible, said the child, as for
thee to comprehend this profound mystery in thy shallow
capacity.</p>
               <p>The mystery of the Trinity is necessary to be known and
believed of all that shal be saved; it was not so plainly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Jewes of old, as it is to us in the new Testament, a
perfect and full knowledge of this mystery is not attainable in
this life.</p>
               <p>Although Trinity in its native signification signifie the
number of any three things,<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 20. 1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> yet by Ecclesiasticall custome it is

not meant as if the Essence did consist of three Persons as so
many parts; and therefore there is a great difference between
Trinity and Triplicity. Trinity is when the same Essence hath
divers waies of subsisting; and Triplicity is when one thing is
compounded of three as parts, they are three not in respect of
Essence or Divine attributes, three Eternals, but three in respect
of personall properties, as the Father is of none, the Sonne of
the Father, and the holy Ghost of both; three Persons but one
God, as to be, to be true, to be good, are all one, because Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa,</hi> the outward workes
which concerne the creature, belong to one person as wel as
the other, as to create, govern; but <hi>opera ad intra sunt divisa,</hi>
the personall properties or internall workes are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
as the Father begets, the Sonne is begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the
Sonne.</p>
               <p>There is in the Trinity <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> another and another,


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107075:181"/>
but not <hi>aliud &amp; aliud,</hi> another thing and another thing, as
there is in Christ; the Father is another person from the
Sonne, but yet there is the same nature and Essence of them
all. They differ not in their natures as three men or three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
differ, for they differ so as one may be without the other;
but now the Father is not without the Sonne, nor the Sonne
without the Father, so that there is the same numericall
Essence.</p>
               <p>The Father in some sence is said to be <hi>the onely God, John
17.</hi> 3. that is, besides the Divine nature which is common to
the three persons, there is not another God to be found, the
word <hi>(alone)</hi> is opposed to all faigned Gods, to every thing
which is not of this Divine nature; so when it is said, <hi>None
knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and the Sonne but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that excludes not the Holy Ghost which searcheth
the hidden things of God, but all which are not of that
Essence.</p>
               <p>Though there be no inequality in the persons, yet there
is an order, not of dignity but of beginning<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 28. 19. John 5. 26, 27. The Father is the fountaine and originall of all the Deity, and the cause of the Sonne, which the very wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sonne by the holy Ghost made the world, not as if there

Wendelinus.</hi> The Essence considered with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of subsisting is called a Person.</p>
               <p>A Person is such a subsistence in the Divine nature, as is
distinguished from every other thing by some speciall or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
property, or else it is the God-head restrained with
his personall property. Or it is a different manner of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in the Godhead, as the nature of man doth diversly
subsist in <hi>Peter, JAmes, John,</hi> but these are not all one. It
differs from the essence as the manner of the thing from the
thing it selfe, and not as one thing from another; one person is


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107075:181"/>
distinguisht from another by its personall property, and
by its manner of working.</p>
               <p>The personall property of the Father is to beget, that
is, not to multiply his substance by production, but to
communicate his substance to the same. The Sonne is said
to be begotten, that is, to have the whole substance from
the Father by communication.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psalm 2. 17. proves that the Father begets, and the Sonne is begotten of the Father. Galat. 4. 6. See John 15. 26. &amp;</hi> 14. 26.

                  </note> The Holy ghost is said to
proceed or to be breathed forth, to receive his substance by
proceeding from the Father and the Sonne joyntly; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

the Spirit of the Sonne both, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. The Father onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth,
the Sonne onely is begotten, and the holy Ghost
onely proceedeth; both procession and generation are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable.
In the manner of working they differ, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worketh of himselfe, by the Sonne, and through the
holy Ghost; the Sonne worketh from the Father by the
Holy Ghost; the holy Ghost worketh from the Father and
the Sonne by himselfe. There is so one God, as that there are
three persons or divers manners of being in that one God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
the Father, Sonne, and the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>1 Whatsoever absolutely agrees to the Divine nature, that

               <p>In respect of this generation, the Sonne is called <hi>the Word of
the Father, John</hi> 1. 1. not a vanishing, but an essential word,
because he is begotten of the Father, as the word from the
mind. He is called <hi>the Word of God,</hi> both internall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
(that is, the Divine understanding reflected upon it
selfe from eternity, or Gods knowledge of himselfe) so


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107075:186"/>
also he is the inward wisdome of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. because God
knowes himselfe as the first and most worthy object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation;
and externall or uttered, which hath revealed
the councels of God to men, especially the elect; that we
may know the Father by the Sonne as it were by an Image,

               <p>Hence arose the Schisme between the Westerne and the
Easterne Churches, they affirming the procession from the
Father and the Sonne, these from the Father alone.</p>
               <p>To deny the procession of the holy Ghost from the Sonne,
is a grievous errour in Divinity, and would have grated the
foundation, if the Greeke Church had so denied the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Holy Ghost from the Sonne, as that they
they had made an inequality between the Persons. But since
their forme of speech is, <hi>that the Holy Ghost proceedeth from
the Father by the Sonne,</hi>

                  <hi>and is the Spirit of the Sonne,</hi> without
making any difference in the consubstantiality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
it is a true though an erroneous Church in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
divers learned men thinke that à <hi>Filio &amp; per Filium</hi> in
the sense of the Greeke Church, was but a question <hi>in modo
loquendi</hi> in manner of speech, and not fundamentall.</p>
               <p>3 The personall propriety of the holy Ghost is called
procession or emanation, <hi>John</hi> 15. 26. neither hath the
word defined, nor the Church known a formall difference
between this procession and generation.</p>
               <p>The third internall difference among the Persons is in
the number, for they are three, subsisting truly, distinctly and
<hi>per se,</hi> distinguished by their relations and properties, for they
are internall workes and different, and incommunicably
proper to every person.</p>
               <p>There follows an externall distinction in respect of effects
and operations which the persons exercise about externall
objects, namely the creatures; for though the outward works


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107075:186"/>
are undivided in respect of the Essence, yet in respect of the
manner and determination, all the persons in their manner
and order concur to such workes. As the manner is of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
so of working in the persons.</p>
               <p>The Father is the originall and principle of action, works
from himselfe by the Sonne,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 6.</note> as by his Image and wisdome,
and by the holy Ghost.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> But he is said to worke by his Sonne,
not as an instrumentall but as a principall cause distinguished
in a certaine manner from himselfe,<note place="margin">Heb. 1, 2, 3.</note> as the Artificer workes
by an Image of his worke framed in his mind, which Image
or Idea is not in the instrumentall cause of the worke but
his hand.</p>
               <p>To the Sonne is given the dispensation and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the action from the Father by the holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.
8. 6. John</hi> 1. 3. &amp; 5. 19.</p>
               <p>To the holy Ghost is given the consummation of the
action which he effects from the Father and the Sonne, <hi>Job
26. 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
               <p>The effects or workes which are distinctly given to the
Persons, are, Creation ascribed to the Father, Redemption to
the Sonne, Sanctification to the holy Ghost; all which
things are done by the Persons equally and inseparably in
respect of the effect it selfe, but distinctly in respect of the
manner of working.</p>
               <p>The equality of the Persons may be proved 1. by the
worke of Creation, joyntly, <hi>Psalm</hi> 33. 6. severally; for the
Father, those places prove it, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 6. Heb.</hi> 1. 2. the Sonne,
<hi>John 1. 3, 10. Col.</hi> 1. 16. the holy Ghost, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 4. 2 By the
worke of Redemption, the Father sends and gives the Son,
the Son is sent and given by him, the holy Ghost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the worke of conception and incarnation, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35.
3 By the worke of Sanctification, the Father sanctifieth,
<hi>John 17. 17. Jude</hi> v. 1. the Son, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26. the holy Ghost,
2 <hi>Thess. 2. 13. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2. 4 By the worship of religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The Father is religiously adored often in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17. the Sonne <hi>Acts 7. 59. Heb.</hi> 1. 6. the holy
Ghost <hi>Acts 28. 25, 26. Rom.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:107075:187"/>
This is a wonderfull mystery rather to be adored and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
then inquired into; yet every one is bound to know
it with an apprehensive knowledge, though not with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive.

God concerning the eternall and Supernaturall estate of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

but as for that actuall Election, and Separation, <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>Beza</hi> hold it to be from the corrupted Masse; of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
these reasons may be given.</p>
               <p>1. We are chosen, that we might be holy and unblameable;
this supposeth that we were considered in Election, as finners,
<hi>Ezek. 16. 6. 9. 1. Rom.</hi> 2. 9. Election is of God, that sheweth
mercy, and wee are called vessells of mercy; mercy presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
misery.</p>
               <p>2. We are elected in Christ as our head; and he is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Saviour which presupposeth sinne; he came <hi>to save
sinners, Matth.</hi> 20. 16. the meanes of salvation are given to
few, few are holy, the effect of Election, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7. 13.</p>
               <p>3. Man simply considered is the object of Predestination, in
respect of the preordination of the end; but man corrupted,
if we respect the ordination of the meanes which tend to that
end; or man absolutely, in respect of the supreame or last end,
or in respect of this, or that subordinate end.</p>
               <p>4. The end<note n="*" place="margin">Finis electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis est patefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio divinae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordiae in gratuita quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundam pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum salute. <hi>Wendelinus.

upon the foresight of his good workes and his perseverance in

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. This makes the Doctrine of Election such a depth,
that God loveth <hi>Jacob</hi> and hateth <hi>Esau,</hi> in the Angels, some
are elected, and some fallen.</p>
               <p>2. To accept of persons is then when we preferre one before
another, and ought not to doe so, now that God chooseth
some; it is of his meere grace,<note n="*" place="margin">Laudet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordiam Dei qui libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur non culpet judicium qui punitur, <hi>August.</hi> Eepist. 106.</note> for all deserve eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Arguments against the Papists and Lutherans.</p>
               <p>That which is the effect and fruit of election, that cannot
be a cause or condition, for then a thing should be a cause to it
selfe, but these are effects, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. It should be according to
them, he hath chosen us because we were foreseene holy, <hi>Acts

but he beleeveth because he is ordained to eternall life.
Secondly, then we should choose God and not he us, contrary
to that, <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. Thirdly, Infants are elected, who cannot
beleeve or doe good workes. Fourthly, if man were the cause
of his owne election, he had cause to glorie in himselfe, electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should not be of grace.<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 5. 6.</note>

2 <hi>Thes. 1. 10. &amp;</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>2. Saving faith is a true effect of Gods election, peculiar to
the elect, &amp; common to all the elect which live to be of age and
discretion, but many are destitute of faith for ever: therefore
they must needs be out of Gods election.</p>
               <p>3. The Scripture saith expresly,<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 11.</note> that few were chosen,

               <p>Though some of the places of Scripture may be expounded
of the small number of Beleevers in the dayes of our Saviour,
yet some are more generally spoken, shewing plainly that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
few do find the way to life.</p>
               <p>At this day, if the world were divided into thirty parts, 19.
of them doe live in Infidelity, without the knowledge of the
true God. The Mahometans possesse other sixe parts of the
world. Amongst them which professe Christ, scarce one part
of those five remaining do embrace the true religion: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more do professe with the mouth, then do with the heart
beleeve unto salvation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> say there is an election axiomaticall, not
personall: they acknowledge that there is a choise of this or
that particular meanes to bring men to salvation. God (say
they) hath revealed but two wayes to bring men to life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by obedience to the Law, or by faith in Christ. But they
deny that there is an election of this or that particular man.
But God hath set down with himselfe from all eternity, who
shall lay hold on Christ to salvation, and who not, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.
speakes of an election personall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12. of both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
axiomaticall and personall. Some hold that Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
is so uncertaine and changeable, as that the elect may

nor being subject to corruption.</p>
               <p>By these reasons it is evinced, that the world is not eternal,
but was created by the chiefe work-man of all things in time.
But concerning the time of the yeare, when the world was
made, whether in Summer, Autumn, or the Spring, wee will
not raise any curious and unprofitable questions. See <hi>Sarsons
Chronologia vapulans,</hi> page 123. Let it suffice to know that
it was created by God in the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. that is, in
the beginning of time, or rather together with time then in
time; for the instant and moment of Creation was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all following, but not the end of precedent time.</p>
               <p>Hitherto concerning the efficient cause, there followeth the
matter of Creation.</p>

the Angels, the reasonable soule, and the highest Heaven

               <p>2. The mediate Creation is, when a thing is brought forth
of a praexistent matter; yet so rude and indisposed, that it
may be accounted for nothing; so <hi>Adams</hi> body was created of

               <p>Divines observe foure things in Gods Creation.</p>

               <p>The Creation of the Heavens is a great and wonderfull
worke of God; the Heavens were not alwayes, neither came
they by chance, or any other way, but by the wonderfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God creating them. So the Scripture telleth us often,
<hi>Psal. 102. 15. Esay</hi> 40. 12. and 22. and 42. 5. and 45. 2. and
48. 13. God frequently challengeth to himselfe the glory of
this exceeding great worke, alleadging it as an effect of his
wonderfull power and greatnesse. The excellency and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this worke appeares in divers things. 1. The abstruse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the matter. 2. The perfection of the forme. 3. The


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107075:201"/>
exceeding hugenesse of its quantity. 4. The height of it. 5.
Its swift motion. Lastly, the excellent usefulnesse of if for the
Creatures here below, and all other things contained in it.</p>
               <p>First, the matter of the Heavens is darke and hidden, and
goes beyond the power of mortall creatures, certainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
of it. Philosophers know not what to say here; some
of them doe thinke, that the upper heavens are made of the
same matter with these inseriour bodies, and some againe do
deny it, and thinke it consists of another, which they call the
fifth E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sence; because they perceive it to bee of such different
working and qualities front the things below.</p>
               <p>2.

The Philosophers divide the Regions of the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of, if any at all. The first moveable, as they termed it,
the highest Orbe by the unspeakable, swift circumrotation of

vers. 5 <hi>Who hath laid the foundation of the earth,</hi> or founded the
earth upon his Basis, that it should not be removed for ever.
The earth is the heaviest and lowest element. It is so made that
it doth stand firme in its place, so that neither the whole earth
is moved out of its place, nor yet the great parts of it. This
is an exceeding wonderfull worke of God to settle the earth
so upon certaine foundations, that it is not shaken out of its
place. Take a little piece of earth not bigger then ones fist,
nay then ones eye, or the apple of it: hold it up in the aire,
let it fall, it will never cease moving till come to lye upon
some solid bodie,<note place="margin">Nec circumfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pendebat in aere tellus ponderibus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brata suis <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid met.</hi>
                  </note> that it may hold it up &amp; stay the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it.
Now how is it, that this whole lump of earth, the whole body
I say of the earth hangeth fast in the wide and open aire, and
doth not sway and move now hither and now thither: what
is it that holdeth it up so stedfast in the very midst of the aire?
It is Gods worke who hath founded it on his Basis that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be moved.<note place="margin">

<hi>Joh</hi> 26. 7. There is nothing which might hold it up, &amp;
yet behold it hangeth still and quiet, as if it had some pillar or
base upon which to rest it selfe. The Lord doth in larger words
commend it to the consideration of <hi>Job,</hi> when himselfe comes
to speake with him, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 4. &amp; 6. God there compareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to a builder that layes the foundation, and then sets up
the building by line and measure, and convinceth <hi>Job</hi> of his
weaknes, that knoweth not how this earth should be set up or
founded, whereas the Lord himself effected this building long
before <hi>Job</hi> was. <hi>David</hi> telleth of it, Psal. 24. 2. as a ground
of Gods right unto it, and to all things that are in it: for saith
he, <hi>He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the flouds.</hi>
And <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 29. and 30. 4. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 4. This
is a great work, because it is both necessary and unsearcheable.
It is necessary, for it is the cause of the order of things in all

the world, and of their not being jumbled and confounded

that is built upon it, will totter and tumble, and come

should shake or reele, and be apt to move hither and thither,
the things that be upon it by nature, or that are built upon it
by the workmanship of man, could not possibly subsist or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.
Rivers and Channels would be daily altered, dry ground

down off the earth, did it not keepe its own room: nay
heaven &amp; earth would come together, utter confusion would
overturne the face of the earth, and men, beasts, and all things
below would come to nothing. So needfull it was for this
great Architect to set the Corner-stone of the earth, fast, firm,
and immoveable. But the cause of it is unsearcheable, who
can find out to the full the reason of this so necessary a work?
Every heavy thing we see must have something to keepe it up,
something on which to rest it selfe, that it may goe no further
but abide where it is: but what doth this earth rest on?
How is it held so even in the very midst, and sweyed neither
one way nor another? who can tell me a full, just, satisfactory
reason in nature? We must not thinke that God doth hold it
up by an immediate, violent, supernaturall, or miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
working, but in a naturall way by ordering the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of nature so, that they shall necessarily concurre to effect
this setlednesse. Philosophers give this reason of it, they say,
the simple bodies were made, some of a light, subtill, thin,
and spirituall nature: and their propertie is to ascend, to goe
upward still, so as the light still flies higher; and some of a
more grosse, thicke, and heavie nature, and the property of
these is to move downward, and still the heavier to make it
selfe a way through the lighter, and to presse toward the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is the middle point of the whole round of the world;


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107075:205"/>
for it must bee confessed that the world is round. Wherefore
seeing every part and portion of the earth presseth toward the
very middle point of all, it cannot be, but that all must stand
fast in the midst, seeing each part thronging the other, and
leaning upon the other toward the very middle: all will bee
quiet if the parts be even poised. But now how heavie things
should be made so to move toward the Center, and how each
part should so evenly move, and a number of other questions
more, let them answer that are able, especially seeing the earth
doth not carry in it selfe to sense, a perfect, even, and smooth
roundnesse, it is hard then to answer to the question which
God propounded to <hi>Job, upon what bee the sockets of it fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
It is a worke of God exceeding our capacitie, and must
therefore quicken and call up our admiration.</p>
               <p>We should blame our selves for so seldom putting our selves
in mind of this great work, to stir up our selves, to magnifie
the Author of it, and make it an argument of our blessing his

our dutie. Oh how brutish and blockish are we! So strange &amp;
so mightie a worke is done and continued in our sight, here it
was done before I was here, and here it will remaine and bee
continually done after I am gone hence. I enjoy the benefit of
it as well as any other, and with all others, and yet when did
I take it into consideration? When did I once offer it to the
serious meditation of my minde? When did I say to my selfe,
how doth this great ball of earth remaine unmoveable in the
midst of this wide and spacious Heaven? Why doth it not
reele or totter toward the North or South, the East or West,
or now upward, now downward? What hand doth hold it
up, and that so stedfastly, that for thousands of yeares it hath
not moved? surely some potent and intelligent workman hath
in such a wonderfull manner reared up and founded this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
That is he whom we call God; why do I not fasten in


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107075:205"/>
my selfe a more sure and firme, notion of his being, and a
more lively, firme, and effectuall acknowledgement of his
excellencie?</p>
               <p>We are worthy of great blame that have scarce ever directed
our minds to the contemplation and fruitfull meditation of
this great act of God among the rest, for any good, spirituall,
and holy intent. Schollers sometimes in their Philosophicall
studies stumble upon these questions, and set their witts on
worke to find out the natural reason of them, but alas in how
unsanctified a manner, so as not at all to inforce the thing
upon their soules, for making of them more thankfull and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient!
But for the plaine man that is no Scholler, though
he have wit enough for all things else, yet hee hath no wit to
enter upon these cogitations: and when he findeth the matter
so farre above his reach, yet to tell himselfe that this is one of
Gods workes, and so to call on himselfe to feare, know, and
obey him, this, this is that we must every man lament in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as a just and due cause why the Scripture should ascribe
brutishnesse unto us, and we unto our selves, and why wee
should present our selves before the divine Majesty with bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and lowly confessions of our wrong done to God, in rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
him of the honour due unto him for his workes which
our selves have the fruit of. Secondly to our selves, in depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our selves of the best and most excellent fruit of them,
which is to be led by them above themselves unto him.</p>
               <p>This may exhort every one of us to take this work of God
from <hi>David,</hi> and to make it as it were our theame, or the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our meditations. Whosoever applyeth himselfe to
raise up such thoughts, shall finde a great unaptnesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and a kinde of wearinesse to them with a vehement incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to entertaine other fancies, and the Devill will take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
hence to disswade him from doing the duty at all, as if
it were as good omit it, as performe it so weakly: it is a false
tale which Satan tells, for God hath promised acceptance to
the weakest endeavours, in calling himselfe a Father, but to
accept of the non-performance, he hath never promised, for
even a Father cannot do that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:107075:206"/>
Lastly, we must learn to seeke unto God, and trust in him
for spirituall stability of grace in our soules, and must thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
him. Lord, when there was never an earth, thou
mad'st one, and didst lay the foundation of it so sure, that no
force nor skill can move it. O, thou canst also create a frame
of holinesse in my heart and soule, and so stablish, settle, and
confirm it that it shall never be moved. I beseech thee, and trust
that thou wilt do this as thou hast done the former. One
prime use to which we must improve these naturall benefits, is
to quicken our prayers, and confirme our faith in begging,
and expecting such as are spirituall. When God will confirme
the faith of his people, and winne them to call upon him for
good things, he puts them in minde of these wonders in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they must make use of them therefore, for this purpose.</p>

               <p>3. Very profitable, we drinke it, and wash with it, and our
meate is prepared by it, and beasts drinke it.</p>
               <p>It reprehends us, that so ungratefully enjoy and devoure
this benefit without lifting our hearts up to God, and praising
him for it; A secret Atheisme prevailes in our hearts, which


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107075:206"/>
is the cause of this great blockishnesse and ingratitude, and
corrupts all things to us, and forfeits them, &amp; provokes Gods

thou washest thy hands, let thy heart be lifted up to God that

him, that hath done this for me.</p>
               <p>The usefulnesse, abundance, and easinesse to come by, doth

the earth, giving breath of life to all things that breath, this
is the third Element, light and subtill, moving upward, not
downeward, because it hath no heavinesse in it.</p>
               <p>It is divided into three regions or stages. The highest is said
to be exceeding hot, and also dry, because it is neare the fiery
Element and starres, by the force of whose beames it receiveth
the heate, which also is much encreased by following the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Heavens. The lowest region is (they say) hot and
moist: hot by the reflection of the Sun-beames meeting with
the earth, and moyst from its own proper nature, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the vapours exhaled out of the earth and water: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is variable, now bot, now cold, sometime temperate,
differing according to times and seasons of the yeare, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
also, or severall climates. The middle region of the aire,
is cold in respect of the two other, because it cannot follow
the motions of the Heavens, (as the upper region doth) being
hindered by the tops of mountains; 2. being free from the reflex


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107075:207"/>
beames of the Sun, by which the lower region of the aire is

               <p>The Aire is most thin,<note place="margin">The qualities and use of the Aire.</note> without light or colour, but apt to

               <p>This Element also leades us to God. For 1. It t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the first day.</p>
               <p>Without light Gods other works could not have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered

to manifest his excellency to men, it is a comfortable thing to

God hath assigned such a way and race to the Sunne, which by

to see the darknesse vanquished, and the light conquering,
and that the Sun is raised above our Horizon, and is come to
visite our parts againe, it were a fruitfull thing to think thus.
How great a journey hath the Sunne gone in this little time
wherein I have been asleep, and could observe nothing, and
now returned againe as it were to call me up; say, Lord thou
hast made night,<note place="margin">Sol exprobrat dormientem. <hi>Erasm.</hi>
                  </note> I have the benefit of it, and now light visits

in the evening a little before we sleepe, we should think
of the great work of making day, for these many houres the
Sun hath beene within our sight, and shewed its beames and
light unto us, and hath run a long race for our good, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with it lightsome cheerfulnesse, the companion of the day.
Now it is gone to the other part of the world to visite them,
that God might shew his goodnesse to one place as well as to
another. Where a multitude of things concur to one effect,
with which none of them in particular is acquainted, there
we cannot but know that one common wisedome ruleth them
all, and so it is in the working of the Sun, Moone, and Stars,
to make the Seasons of the day and night, and of Summer and
Winter, therefore some common wisedome must over-rule all
of them. There is a spirituall light in our Horizon: whereas
Judaisme and Turcisme is darknesse; and Popery, a glimering
light. We should pray to God to give us spirituall light, and

be thankfull for it. He makes day and night also in respect of

               <p>There doe arise from the ends of the earth as the Scripture
speaks, that is, from all quarters of this inferiour part of the
world, consisting of earth and water, certain steams or fumes
partly drawn up thence by the heate and influence of the Sun
and other Planets or constellations, partly breathed out of
the earth by the naturall heate thereof. Whereof some are hot
and moist, being as it were of a middle nature betwixt water
and aire: some hot and dry being of a middle nature betwixt
fire and aire as some Philosophers thinke, of which two, as
of the matter, are brought forth these strange things which
wee see in the aire, and among the rest, Thunder. Though
thunder bee first in nature, being by the violent eruption it
makes out of the cloud the cause of fulgurations, yet we see
first the lightning before wee heare the Thunder, because of
the swiftnesse of the fire above the aire, and because the eye is
quicker in perceiving its object then the eare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:107075:211"/>

of the aire it might bee purged and made fit for the use of man
and beast, being cleansed from those ill and pestilent vapours,
which otherwise would make it too thicke, grosse, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome
for our bodies, for this is one speciall end of winds,
thunders, and the like vehement works that are in the aire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the particular work for which God assigneth them, and
therefore with thunder likely is joyned much raine, because the
cloud is dissolved at the same time, and sometimes violent
winds and tempests, because the exhalation inflamed, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with it selfe such windy fumes as it meetes withall in the
aire, and so by violent stirring the aire purgeth it, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the parts of the earth by shaking and moving it.</p>
               <p>1. We must turne all this to a spirituall use, <hi>viz.</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
us in the feare of him that is Lord of Hoasis, who shews
his greatnesse in these mighty deedes of his hand, to which
purpose alwayes the Scripture speakes of it, exhorting the
mighty to give unto the Lord glory and strength in regard of
this.</p>
               <p>2. We must observe God so in this and all his great works,
as to cause our mindes to encrease in the knowledge of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie,
and our hearts in the love and feare of him. All his
works are therefore exhorted to praise him, because wee by
all should learn his praise and greatnesse. How able is God
to destroy sinners, how quickely and in a moment can hee
bring them to ruine! let him but speake to the thunder, haile,
tempest, and they will beate downe and consume his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
before his face, ô then tremble before him.</p>

               <p>Let us consider the causes of these clouds, and the uses of

               <p>The efficient causes are thought to be the heate &amp; influence
of the Sun and the Stars which doth rarifie the water, &amp; draw
thence the matter of the clouds, as you shall perceive, if you
hold a wet cloath before the fire, that a thicke steame will
come out of it, because the fire makes thin the thickness
of the water, and turns it into a kind of moist vapour, and the
earth hath some heate mixed with it through a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of fire that is dispersed in the bowels of it, which causeth
such like steames to ascend out of it, and the coldnsse of the
middle region doth condensate and thicken these steames or
breaths, and turne them againe into water at length and at
last to thicke clouds.</p>
               <p>2. The matter is the steams that the waters and earth doe
yeeld forth by this heate.</p>
               <p>The uses of it are to make rain and snow, (snow is nothing
but rain condensated &amp; whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First, without this drinke afforded to the fields, we should

destruction of all living creatures that are maintained by the

Though ice be not Chrystall, yet some say Chrystall is
from ice; when ice is hardened into the nature of a stone it
becomes Chrystall; more degrees of coldnesse, hardnesse,

then God pleased to divide the waters from the earth, so as
to make dry land appeare, and for that end. 1. He drave the
waters into one place, spreading the earth over them, and
founding it upon them, <hi>Psal. 104. v.</hi> 6. 7. God by his mighty
power (compared there to a thundering voyce) did make the
waters to gather together into the place that hee had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for them under the earth, and that by raising up hills and
mountaines, and causing dales and valleyes, then God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the waters their bounds that they should still continue

done.</p>
               <p>There are divers profitable questions about these things?</p>
               <p>1. Whether the Sea would not naturally overflow the land,
as it did at the first creation, were it not with-held within
his bankes by divine power?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107075:216"/>
The answer is affirmative,<note place="margin">We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the earth and waters. 1. absolutely, as they are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and solid bodies, so the water hath the higher place, being lighter. 2. In respect of the superficies of either, so the superficie of the earth is higher. <hi>Carp.</hi> Geog. If wee compare the Coasts and the neerest Sea, then the land is higher then the Sea: but if wee compare the land and the maine Sea, then the Sea is higher then the Land, and therefore the Sea is called <hi>Altum,</hi> where ships flye faster to the shore then from it.</note> and the reason is evident, the
water is lighter then the earth, and heavier things are apt to
pierce through the light, and the light will take to themselves
an higher place, and give way to the heavier things to descend
through them; mixe a great deale of dirt and water, and let
it stand a while and take its owne proper course, and the dirt
will sinke to the bottome, leaving the water above it selfe.
Aristotle and others say that the Sea is higher then the earth,
and they can render no reason why it (being apt to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad)
should be kept from over-flowing the land, whence he
proves Gods providence.</p>
               <p>2. Whether there be more Sea or Land. The multitude of
waters made by God at first did cover the earth, and inclose it
round, the Sea therefore must needs be farre greater then the
Earth. The Mapps shew it to be greater in quantity then the
Earth.</p>

9. Esay</hi> 40. 12. Hee is said to have weighed the mountaines
in scales and the hils in ballances, that is, to have poised them
even, so that the earth might remain unmoveably in the parts
of it as well as in the whole. The greatnesse of this worke
appeares:</p>
               <p>1. In the strangenesse and hiddennesse of it.</p>
               <p>How should so heavy a thing as the earth thus heave up it
selfe into so great ascents, to give place unto the waters under
it? the immediate power of God is the cause of it, <hi>Ps.</hi> 24. 2. &amp;

               <p>2. In the usefulnesse of it?</p>
               <p>1. For beauty and ornament, it gives a more delightfull
prospect to see hills and dales, then to looke upon all one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and flat piece of ground without any such risings.</p>
               <p>2. It conduceth to the fruitfulnsse of the earth. The vales
are much more fruitfull then if they were flats without hills,
because of the dew and moysture that descendeth upon them,
from the hills, and some things grow better upon the higher
places, on the sides or tops of the mountaines.</p>
               <p>3. Without these hills and mountaines there could not
have been roome for the waters which before did swallow up
the earth in its bowels, neither could the dry land have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
               <p>4. Without such hills and dales there could not have beene
rivers and springs running with so constant a course.</p>

               <p>The water of the Sea is salt, not by nature but by accident.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> refers the saltish quality of the Sea-water to the Sun
as the chiefe cause, for it drawes up the thinner and fresher
parts of the water, leaving the thicker and lower water to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
adustion of the Sun-beames; and so consequently to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
salt,<note place="margin">

nature, causing both the motion and saltnesse of the
Sea. <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth that the Sea in Summer, &amp; toward
the South is more salt then else-where, and is fresher toward
the bottome then top.</p>
               <p>The Sea is salt, 1. to keepe it from putrifaction, which is
not necessary in the floods, because of their swift motion. 2.
for the breeding and nourishing of great Fishes, being both

               </p>
               <p>Some say it is the breathing or blowing of the world, as
<hi>Strabo, Albertus Magn.</hi> One said it was because the waters get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
into certaine holes of the earth, were forced out again by
Spirits remaining within the earth. <hi>Macrobius</hi> said it was by
meeting the East &amp; West Ocean. <hi>Cicero</hi> seems to ascribe it only
to the power of God, others for the most part ascribe it to
the various light or influences of the moone, which rules o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all moist bodies.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Brierwood de meteoris.</hi>
                  </note> Some attribute it to certaine subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

                  <hi>Coelius Rhodiginus</hi> (Antiq. lect. l. 29. c. 8.) writeth of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>

into one place, and much of it hidden in the bowels of
the earth, and there as it were imprisoned or treasured up by
making the Sea and dry land so another part of them was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to runne up &amp; down within the earth, and upon it in
springs &amp; rivers, which rivers are nothing but the assembling
of the waters into divers great channells from the fountains
and springs, which the Psalmist describeth by its matter and
use or effect. <hi>He sendeth the springs into the valleyes which run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the hills,</hi> that is, He made the springs and fountaines to
conveigh waters from place to place, the use of this is to give
drinke unto the beasts, even to the wilde asses who quench
their thirst there. There be many other uses of springs and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but this is noted as the most manifest and evident. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
use is for the fowles, which have their habitation in
the trees which grow neere and by meanes of these springs, &amp;
there they sit and sing. These spring bring up so much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to the upper parts of the earth as causeth trees to grow
also for fowles to build and sing in. Some of the waters also
were drawn up into the middle region of the world, &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into Clouds, that so they may be dissolved and powred
downe againe from thence upon the hills also and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which cannot be watered by the Springs, that so the whole
earth may be satisfied with the fruit of Gods works.</p>
               <p>The Poets faigned that <hi>Jupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Pluto</hi> divided
the Universe, and that <hi>Neptune</hi> had the Sea for his part, which
is called <hi>Neptunus</hi> either <hi>à nando</hi> from navigation, or <hi>a nubendo,</hi>
from covering, because the Sea covers the earth: and <hi>Pontus;</hi>
the nations about Pontus thought no Sea in the world like
unto their owne, and doubted whether there were any other
Sea but that, whence <hi>Pontus</hi> was used for the Sea in generall.</p>
               <p>The Sea is a wide and spacious place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctor</hi> Halls Contemplation.</note> 
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 25. The
great deepe, the wombe of moisture, the well of fountains
the great Pond of the world.</p>
               <p>The reason of the greatnesse and widenesse of it is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of waters which were made by God at the first, which
because they did cover the earth and inclose it round, it must


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107075:218"/>
needs be farre greater then the earth,<note place="margin">It must be large to containe so many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> and therefore when God
saw fit to distinguish the dry land from the earth, must needs
have very great ditches cut for it in the earth, and caverns made
to hold it; &amp; therefore the earth in Scripture is said to be
spread out upon the Sea, because a great part of it is so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the waters that are under it.</p>
               <p>Again, the use the principall use of the Sea &amp; waters ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was; that it might supply vapours for making of the clouds
by the attraction of the Sunne and native heate of the Sea in
respect of some fire which God hath mixed with the earth and
waters,<note place="margin">Amos 5. 8. and 9. 6.</note> that they may be more fit to give life to living things.</p>
               <p>Now if the superficies of the Sea were not very large and
wide, the Sunne could not have power enough by its attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
heate and warmth, by which it doth attenuate &amp; make
thin the waters into vapours: which after the cold of the aire,
when they come into the middle region of it, doth againe
thicken and turne it into waters. I say the Sunne could not
else have power to draw out of the Sea sufficient store of these
vapours for watering of the earth with showers. So the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the waters and the necessity of having much of them
drawn up for raine required, that they should not have little
receptacles, but one so great and spacious a receptacle which
we call the Sea. <hi>Oceanus,</hi> the Ocean is that generall collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all waters which environeth the world on every side.
<hi>Mare</hi> the Sea is a part of the Ocean, to which we cannot come
but by some streight.</p>
               <p>In the Sea are innumerable creatures,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 25. 107. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> small and great, there
walke the Shipps, there play the <hi>Leviathans.</hi> What living

downe in those fearfull billowes; for greatnesse of number,
hugenesse of quantity, strangenesse of shapes, variety of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions,
neither aire nor earth can compare with the waters.</p>
               <p>Another use of the Sea is,<note place="margin">Psalm 104.</note> that <hi>there goe the Ships,</hi> as the
Prophet speakes in a kind of wonderment.</p>
               <p>The whole art of Navigation is a strange art, the Lord sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Sea for this purpose, that it might be usefull to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107075:218"/>
men from place to place, and other things from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to countrey. Men build moveable houses, and so goe
through the waters on dry ground: they flye through the Sea
by the helpe of windes gathered in fitly with sails, as birds do
through the aire: and having learnt of birds to steere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the Sea, they have an helme, at the which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
sitting, doth turne about the whole bodie of his ship at
his pleasure. The swiftnesse of the motion of a ship is strange,
some say that with a strong winde they will goe as fast and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
then an arrow out of a bow. The Lord hath given under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to man to frame a huge vessell of wood cut into s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

pieces, and to joyne it so close with pitch and rozin and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things mixt together, that it shall let in none or but a
little water, and it shall carry a very great burden within, &amp;
yet will not sinke under water; and hath given wisedome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to man to make sailes to receive the strength of the winde,
and cords to move them up and down at pleasure, and to
make masts to hang on those sails, &amp; hath given men a dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
to run up to the tops of these masts, by means of a cord
framed in fashion of a ladder, that can but even amuze an
ordinary beholder, and all this for a most excellent use, <hi>viz.</hi>
of maintaining commerce betwixt Nation and Nation, and
of conveighing things needfull from one place to another,
that all places might enjoy the commodities one of another.</p>
               <p>To this art of Navigation do Kingdoms owe most of their
riches,<note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 26 &amp; 10. 22.</note> delights and choise curiosities, a great part of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
riches came in this way; it is the easiest, safest, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
way of transportation of goods.</p>
               <p>How obnoxious are we to God,<note place="margin">Consectaries rom the Sea.</note> therefore we should not
be bold to offend him, how much danger do we stand in if he
should let the waters take their own naturall course, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
themselves above the mountaines.</p>
               <p>At the flood he gave leave to the great Deeps to break their
bounds, and permitted the waters to take their own place, &amp;
the waters were some 7. yards higher then the tops of highest
mountaines. He can doe as much now for the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his just wrath, for though He hath promised that the


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107075:219"/>
waters shall never overflow the whole earth, yet not that they
shall never overflow <hi>England</hi> which stands also in the Sea.</p>
               <p>2. Let us praise the goodnesse of God which preserveth the
whole world alive by a kind of miracle, even by keeping the
water from overflowing the earth. God would convince us
that we live of his meere favour, and that his speciall power
and goodnesse keeps us: the waters if they were left to their
own naturall propensity would soone overwhelm the earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but that God locked them up in the places provided
for them. This worke is mentioned in divers places, <hi>Job
38.</hi> 8. and 26. 10. <hi>Psalme 37. 7. Prov. 8. 29. Jer.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
               <p>First, it is absolutely needfull for the preservation of the
lives of all things that live and breath out of the Sea.</p>
               <p>2. It is a strange and hidden work, God effecteth it by some
setled reason in the course of nature, but we cannot by sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
find it out. Perhaps this may be it, the naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of every heavy thing is toward the Center, and then it
will rest when it hath attained to its own proper place. Now
the earth is stretched over the flouds, and it may seeme that a
great part of them doth fill the very bowells &amp; concavity of
the earth in the very place where the Center or middle point
of it is seated.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that they will not be drawne up againe, nor
follow the upper parts which tosse themselves up and downe,
but rather pull down those rising graves againe, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is most evident in nature by many experiments every
day, that it is utterly impossible there should be any <hi>vacuum</hi>
as they call it, any meere empty place in which nothing at
all is contained, because that would divide the contiguity of
things, and so cause that the world should bee no longer an
orderly frame of divers things together: for the parts would
not be contiguous and united together if such a <hi>vacuum</hi> should
fall out, therefore water will ascend, aire will descend, and
all things wil even loose their own nature, and doe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their nature, rather then such a thing should be.</p>
               <p>Now it may seeme the Lord hath hidden the water in the
earth with such turnings and windings, some places in which


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107075:219"/>
it is, being larger some lesse large, that the larger places ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no open vent for aire to succeed the water, cannot be so
soone filled from below, as they would emptie themselves
upward, and so there must needs be vacuity, if they should
not returne back againe and stop their course, and therefore
they must needs stop as it were in the midst of their carriere.
And this also may seeme to be a great and principall cause of
the fluxe and refluxe of the Sea, which if it were not, the
waters having their course alwayes one way, must needs by
little and little returne againe to cover the earth. If
this be the cause (as is probable) it is wonderfull, that God
should set such an inclination into all parts of the world,
that they will suffer any crossing of their own particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
rather then not maintain the generall course of nature
in the close joyning together of things: for if they might bee
sundred one from another, at length the whole must needs be
quite out of frame, and a generall confusion would follow.</p>
               <p>We must even chide and reprove our selves for our extream
stupidity that are so little (if ever a whit) affected with this
worke so great in it selfe, and so behoofefull for our very life
and being.</p>
               <p>How are we daily and hourly preserved from the swelling
waves: how comes it that in all this length of time the Sea
hath not broken in upon us,<note place="margin">See the history of <hi>Canutus</hi> in Cambden.</note> and overtopped the earth? We
doe not tell our selves of our debt to God for commanding
the waves not to be so bold as to drowne us.</p>
               <p>It may exhort us to feare him that hath appointed the
Sands for a bound of the Sea, and will not let the waves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
over us for all their tossing and tumbling. He is of great
power, and can over-rule so furious an Element, and feare
not though the waters roare, and though the mountains were
cast into the midst of the Sea.</p>
               <p>This commends unto us Gods greatnesse who doth so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
surpasse the Seas greatnesse, and who hath made so
much water for it, and it a place for so much water. Let us
thinke of it in particular, and dwell a little upon it, that we
may also know our nothingnesse. What a great thing is the


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107075:220"/>
Sea in it selfe considerd! What is this Island in comparison of
the Sea, and yet we call it <hi>Great Brittaine?</hi> It must needs bee
greater then the earth, for the waters did round about involve
and encompasse the earth, what then is the whole globe of
Earth and water, and yet that whole globe is a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in comparison of heaven, and yet all that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in comparison of God. O how great is hee, and
how much to be admired? Great, not in quantity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension
of dimensions, but in perfection of Essence. How
great is hee that is beyond Earth Sea and world and all more
then these are beyond Nothing.</p>
               <p>And let us a little compare our selves with this great and
wide Sea. The Sea is but part of this Globe, yet hath in it
water enough to drowne all the men that are in the world, if
either it were suffered to overflow as once at <hi>Noah's</hi> flood, or
else they were cast into it, so that all men are but a small tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
thing in comparison of this Sea, and then what am I
must every one say to himselfe, and what compared to God
the maker of the wide Sea and this wide world. Oh how
nothing is man, am I my selfe among other men, and why
am not I humble before God, why do I not cast downe and
abase my selfe in his presence, and carry my selfe to him as
becommeth so poore, meane, and small a creature, to so Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and great a Creator. Let us morally use the things wee
see, else the naturall knowledge will doe us no good at all.</p>
               <p>We may see in the Sea a map of the misery of mans life, it
ebbeth and floweth, seldome is quiet, but after a little calm
a tempest ariseth sodainly. So must I looke for stormes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the sea of so troublesome a world.</p>
               <p>For the great worke of Navigation, and so of transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things by Sea, and for the fitnesse of the Sea to that
use wee must praise God, every man hath the benefit of it.
By vertue of it wee have Pepper, Cloves and Mace, Figs and

and all the commodities of other Kingdomes distant a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

Some come forth without seede, some have seede, some grow

               <p>We must here condemne our stupidity and blindnesse of
minde that are not provoked many times by this particular to
magnifie the name of God. When a man hath occaslon to
travell through a Close or ground, how great store of herbs
seeth hee, whose nature, yea names he is ignorant of, yet
admireth not God in them, nor confesseth his power and

               <p>Secondly, we are to lament the fruite of our sin, which hath
made us blinde, there is nothing hurtfull to mans bodie, but
some herb or other rightly applyed would cure it.</p>
               <p>It is a great and worthy worke of God to make grasse on

every where, and in abundance, covering the face of the earth,
and hiding the dry and naked face thereof.</p>
               <p>2. The colour of it. It is of a greene and some-what of a
durke greene colour, which is neither over-light nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darke,

fit to content and delight the eye, refresh &amp; preserve the sight.</p>
               <p>3. The usefulnesse of this creature for the Cattell, it is a
soft covering to make the lodging of the poore beasts more
easeful for them, even as it were a mattresse for them to lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It hath a sweet iuyce and verdure in it by which it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

and is fit to nourish them to be turned to bloud and flesh, so to

4. The wayes, meanes, and manner for bringing it forth
for this use, the whole course of the Heauens, Sun, Moone,
and Starres, which runne a large race daily with great swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and the great workes done in the aire for producing
divers Meteors, do tend in great part for the bringiug forth
of this grasse. The grasse it selfe hath a life and vigour in the
roote of it, by which it drawes from the earth that moisture
which is agreeable to it, and disperseth it likewise.</p>
               <p>1. Wee are dull and blinde, and behold not God in this
great worke, when wee goe into the fields, and can scarce
tread beside it: We do not consider Gods greatnesse and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in making so beneficiall a thing so common; Wee let
this worke of God perish in respect of any spirituall use wee
make of it, to make our soules the better.</p>
               <p>2. Let us stirre up our selves to observe Gods hand in this
worke with others, and confesse our debt to him, that gives
us Commons and Pasture for all our Cattell.</p>
               <p>Trees are certaine plants springing from a roote with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Trunke or Stemme (for the most part) shooting up in
height, and delineated with lims, sprigs or branches.</p>
               <p>Leaves are <hi>ornamenta arboris, &amp; munimentà fructus,</hi> they
serve to grace the tree, make it pleasant to behold and defend
the fruit from the injury of the weather.</p>

proceed out of the earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 16, 17. The nature of the
trees is wonderful in these respects principally:</p>
               <p>First, the way and manner of their growing and being. An
Oake comes from an acorne, an Apple-tree from a kernell.
What a kinde of power and vertue is that which God hath
put into a kernell being so small a thing, that it should
pull to it selfe by an unknown vvay the juice of the earth, and
should send some of it down-ward into little small strings as
it were to fasten it selfe in the earth, and send some upward
to spread it selfe above the ground; and yet it should distribute
the moysture so fitly, as to grow in due proportion within
the earth and without; that it should frame to it selfe a bodie
and divers branches in such fashion, that it should b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d and put
forth leaves, that it should cause a fruite to grow upon it, or
seede and that in great numbers, every one of which is able
to make another tree, and that tree to yeeld as much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:107075:223"/>
2. The great variety of kinds of trees; we in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
have divers Oakes, Elmes, Ashes, Beech-trees, Chesnut-trees,
Sally, Willow, Maple, Syccamore, besides Apple and
Peare-trees of divers kindes, Cherry-trees, Hazell, Walnut-trees.
Some trees are of huge growth, as Oakes, Cedars,
Elmes, some low as the Thorn, the nut. Some of one fashion,
colour, making and manner of growth, some of another:
this sheweth an exceeding great measure of wisedome in him
that made them all.</p>
               <p>The use of trees in the next place is manifold.</p>
               <p>1. They serve for fruit: what great variety of fruit do they
yeeld, what pleasant and wholsome fruit, what store and
plenty of fruit. Some Summer fruit that will be gone quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
some Winter fruit that will last most part of the year, and
some all the yeare.</p>
               <p>2. For building both by Land and Sea, to make us hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
both strong and stately, warme, dry, and coole, under
which we may rest our selves, in Summer free from scorching
heate; in Winter and stormie times, free from pinching cold,
&amp; the injury of the weather. With wood also wee make floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and fleeting houses, with which wee may dwell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the waters, and passe through the deep Sea. as
upon dry ground.</p>
               <p>3. It yeeldeth fuell too, by which wee doe both prepare
our food, and keepe our selves warme in the winter, and in
the time of weaknesse and sicknesse. Had wee not something
to burn, we could neither bake our bread, nor brew our beer,
nor seeth our meate, nor rost it, nor at all make use of flesh,
to eate it as now we doe.</p>
               <p>4. For delight: How comfortable a shade doth a spreading
Ash or Oake yeild in the hot Summer, how refreshing is it to
man and beast.</p>
               <p>How pleasant a place was <hi>Paradise,</hi> and what made it so, but
the artificiall order, fashion, and growing of all sorts of trees
fit for food and shadow.</p>
               <p>Wee must observe our owne faultinesse with sorrow and
humiliation,<note place="margin">Corallaries.</note> for that we have not observed more seriously


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107075:223"/>
and usefully this worke of God. Wee have perpetuall use of
Timber and fuell: we eate much fruit from these trees, we
reape the benefit of this work of God from time to time. We
sit upon wood, we feed upon wood, we dwell under wood,
under trees cut downe and fitted for our use: wee cannot step
out of doors but our eyes are fixed upon some tree or other,
great or small: but we take not notice of God in this worke,
and praise his name that made all these trees.</p>
               <p>Let us mend this fault, and stir up our selves to consider
God in this worke, praise him for fruitfull trees, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinds of trees. Let us acknowledge his power, wisdome,
&amp; goodnesse in them, &amp; his exceeding bounty &amp; tender care to
man that hath so furnished the world with innumerable sorts
of trees.</p>

wee have not more admired,<note place="margin">Corollaries.</note> honoured, feared, loved that
great worker to whom these Creatures doe point us. We do
not often enough tell our selves, this Moone, this Sunne,
these stars could not, nor did not make themselves. They could
not possibly be without any beginning at all, for they are
but parts of the whole world, and no part of any whole can
be eternall, because there must be something before that did
unite those parts together; wherfore they were made by some
superiour essence, and more excellent then themselves, and
that is God. How great, how wise, how good, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
excellent is He whose hand framed and ordered these
things. The Sunne ariseth to us constantly, the Moone also
keepes her course with like constancie. Doth not that mighty
armie of stars which in a cleare night shew themselves, even
speake to us as it were to consider of his incomprehensible
excellencie which made and rules them?</p>

and secondly also to bring forth abundantly as here, and also
<hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 7. Fishes breed and bring forth young in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
more then any other creatures do, by the multitude of
spawn they would encrease beyond all measure and number,
if by one meanes or other the spawne were not devoured and
consumed.</p>
               <p>Who can render a reason of their ability to swim so in the
waters, to support themselves in the midst of the waters, &amp;
convey themselves up and down in it?</p>
               <p>Fishes are in Scripture termed <hi>Reptilia,</hi> Psal. 104. 25. <hi>In
the great and wide Sea there are things creeping innumerable both
small and great,</hi> so called, because things when they swim
seeme to creep along in the water. As birds have their wings
and traines by meanes whereof they cut their way, and make


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107075:226"/>
smooth passage through the aire, so fishes are furnished with
finnes wherewith they guide themselves in their swimming,
and cut the current of the streames aud waves for their more
easie passage, wherein their course is directed by their taile, as
shtps are conducted by their Helm.</p>
               <p>The Sea gives more and greater dainties then the earth,
those that did most affect to please their pallate of olde, set
great store by fishes, and paid dearer for them then flesh. God
hath furnished them with a strong power of encreasing. Birds
bring forth some foure or five in a nest, some three, and some
but two, the most but twenty, as the little Wren, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so little, the kinde would bee consumed by the things
which devoure such weake creatures, if those that be, did not
bring forth very many: but every fish brings forth a great
multitude, many hundreds as we may see in their spawne.</p>
               <p>That God should give unto these things a power to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
so very fast, is wonderfull, and it is agreeable to reason
too, for the fishes doe more devoure one another then the
beasts doe, the greater being much more ravenous then any
beast, as being bigger, and their stomacks by an antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis

               <p>They are said to bee without number, Psal. 104. 25. not
simply, but to us, for wee cannot tell the number of them,
though God (which made them) doe know the particular

               <p>God hath created the Fowles of heaven among other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Psalm 104. 12. Gen.</hi> 1. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>The things wherein the Foules differ from other creatures
are 1. That they be winged, having feathers and wings by
which they are covered, and by which they doe passe through
the aire, and the place wherein they flye, viz. in the open fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
in this lower heaven. Their creation is wonderfull
in divers respects.</p>
               <p>First, their making is wonderful, far differing from that of
beasts, fishes, and men.</p>
               <p>2. They have great variety of kindes, some wilde, some
tame, some great, some little, some Sea or water birds, some
land birds.</p>
               <p>3. Their manner of breeding, they lay egges and hatch
them, &amp; out of a kind of confused substance, that to us seems
void of life, by the heate of their bodies they doe bring forth
their young naked at first, which after by the same cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of warmth, do bring forth feathers to cover them. Many
of them are so beautifully adorned with their feathers for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and are so glorious, as a man cannot but looke upon
them with wondring and delight, for where doth nature shew
more variety, and a pleasinger composition of colours then in

Doves necke, a Peacocks taile, and some other like birds.</p>
               <p>4. For their swiftnesse of flying, that they can with such
celerity passe through the aire.</p>
               <p>5. They are many wayes serviceable to many: they are a
dainty foode for weake stomacks, they pull up many kindes
of wormes and vermine, that else would bee very harmefull

               <p>Amongst other creatures, the Lord hath stored the world
with divers kindes of foure-footed beasts, which move and
walk upon the face of the earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 11, 12. these were
created on the sixth day.</p>
               <p>These beasts are creatures endued not with life alone, but
with sense also. They consist of a body and of a sensible soule,
&amp; besides the life of vegetation which is to be found in plants,
by which they grow and are nourished; They have also a soul
whereby they discerne divers bodily objects, and can both
discerne and follow that which is good for them, and shunne
what is evill, and so preserve themselves alive by using things
helpfull for them, and avoiding the contrary. All these beasts
were made to walk upon the ground with four feete, having
their heads bowing down to the gronnd to seeke their diet,
without which they could not live, and which is provided
for them upon the face of the ground.<note place="margin">There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kindes of bruite beasts differing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, qualities, figure, colour, quantity, voice.</note> They were made on
the sixt day before man was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>This worke is wonderfull in respect of the divers sorts of
these beasts, some great, and some small, some of one shape &amp;
nature, some of another.</p>
               <p>We see great variety of them in our owne Countrey, and
there is farre greater variety abroad in the world which wee


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107075:229"/>
have never seene. That out of the same earth and water all
these kinds should grow by a word spoken with the mouth of
God, <hi>let it be so,</hi> is a strange and wonderfull thing. By vertue
of these words, there were Sheep, Goates, Kine, Horses,
Camels and Dromodaries, Elephants, Lions, Beares, Dogges,
Tygers, Wolves, Foxes, Deere. What are all these but a
most artificiall mixture of earth and water put into a certaine
shape or forme of members, having head, feete, backe, breast,
bellie, braine, liver, heart, guts, and other intrailes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
power to see, hear, to touch, smel, tast, to eate, drinke,
goe, generate, to remember, to have a kinde of thought of
things within, to imagine and discerne, having also affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and passions. They carry us, feede us, cloath us, till
the ground for us. How full of tedious and toilsome paines
would our lives be, if we had not a horse to beare us up and
downe from place to place, and horses or oxen to convey
all manner of things for us.</p>
               <p>Wee must magnifie the name of God, and frame our selves
to sincere thankefulnesse unto him who hath made such a
multitude of creatures inferiour to our selves, and given to
us the use of them. O what a wonderfull skilfull workeman
is hee, that out of the earth could produce such a number of
such creatures. And how good was he to us, that hee did not
give reason unto them as well as sense; for if they had reason
to know their own strength and our weaknesse, wee should
never keep them under as we do.</p>
               <p>Let us not abuse these creatures of God to bad purpose,
or use them in a cruell and inhumane manner; they are our
fellow creatures, made of a little courser earth; and since
they obey us with all cheerfulnesse, let us be likewise obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Virgin that she should conceive our Saviour in her wombe by
the over-shadowing of the Holy Ghost. A multitude of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
celebrated the Nativity of our Blessed Saviour with an
hymne of joy. Angels Ministred to Christ after his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

An Angel acquainted the women with his resurrection,
after he had terrified the men that were set to keepe the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,
and rolled the stone from the doores thereof. An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

many more apparitions of the heavenly Spirits, we read that
the Angels of God are many thousands, yea millions, and of
the company of innumerable Angels, and of Angels pitching
their tents about the righteous, and holding them up in their
hands, and chasing the wicked and destroying them.</p>

               <q>Reasons why God made Angels.</q>
               <p>The will &amp; power of God, therefore they are, because God
saw it fit to make them, yet two reasons may be rendred of
this worke.</p>
               <p>1. God saw it fit to raise up our thoughts from meaner, to
more excellent<note n="*" place="margin">Angels are a meane betwixt God and man, as man was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the beasts.</note> creatures, till we came to him: first things
(say some) were made which had no life, then living things
without sense, as plants and trees, then sensible, then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</p>
               <p>2. It was convenient that every part and place of the world
should be fill'd with Inhabitants fit for the same, as the aire
with birds, the earth with beasts and men, the Sea with fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and the heavens which we behold with Stars, &amp; the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Heavens with Angels.</p>
               <p>God is the maker of Angels.<note place="margin">God made the Angels, <hi>Psalm 104. 4. Coloss.</hi> 1. 16.</note> These glorious Creatures
which shall have no end, had a beginning as well as the silliest
beast, bird, or fish, and they are equally beholding (nay more,
because they have received more excellent endowments) unto
God for their being with the silliest worme. And though
<hi>Moses</hi> mentions not in particular either the act of creating
them, or the time, yet S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>by him were all
things made, visible and invisible:</hi> and it is evident by discourse
of reason, that the Angels were made by God. For either


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107075:232"/>
they must be made by God or some other maker, or else they
must be eternall, for whatsoever is not made by some maker,
cannot be made at all: and whatsoever is not at all made, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.
Now if the Angels were eternall, then were they
equall with God in selfe-being, they might bee called selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subsisting
essences, and so should be equall with God, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in no more neede of him then hee of them, owing no
more service, homage, and praise to him, then hee oweth to
them, and so they were Gods as well as he, and then wee
should have multitude of Gods, not onely one God, and
so should not God bee the first and best Essence, there being
so many others beside him, as Good and Omniscient as hee;
wherefore they must bee made by some Maker, because they
cannot bee Eternall: and if made, then either by themselves
or some other thing besides themselves, not by themselves,
because that implies and absolute contradiction: &amp; if by some
other thing, then by a better or worse thing, not by a more
meane, for the lesse perfect, cannot give being to a more
perfect thing, for then it should communicate more to the
effect then it hath in it selfe any way, which is impossible,
that any efficient cause should doe; not by any better thing
then themselves, for excepting the Divine Majestie which is
the first and best, there is no better thing then the Angels,
save the humanity of our Lord Jesus Christ, which could
not bee the Maker of them, because they were created some
thousands of yeares before the humanity was formed in the
Virgins womb, or united to the second person in Trinity.</p>

               <p>6. The names of the Angels. The first and most common
name is that of <hi>Angel,</hi> which name is common to the good
and evill angels, yet in a farre different sense. The evill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

to note the excellencie of their originall) because they fell
from their blessed condition, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 3. Jude</hi> 6. In the first
place to shew the prerogative of the Saints: and in the second
to shew the reason of Gods justice.</p>
               <p>The evill spirits are called Angels, the name which was
first given them. Otherwise they are not absolutely called
Angels, (that name being peculiar to the Angels which stood)
but Angels of the Divell &amp; angels of Satan,<note place="margin">Cameron tomo 2<hi rend="sup">do</hi> Praelect.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> because they

               <p>Some as proper names are given to certaine Angels, <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
Dan. 10. 13. which is compounded of 3. Hebrew parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<hi>Mi-ca-el,</hi> who is like or equall to the strong God. It
signifieth the power of God, because by him God exercised his
power: and <hi>Gabriel,</hi> Dan. 8. 16. <hi>&amp; 9. 21. Luke</hi> 17. 19. that is,
the glory of God, who executed the greatest Embassages in
Gods name to men. <hi>Vide Sculteti exercitat.</hi> Evangel. l. 1. c.9.</p>
               <p>7. The Angels Ministrie and service. Their service may
be considered either in respect of God, the Church, or the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Church. Respecting God, and the Church, and
the people of God, they have divers services.</p>
               <p>The office of good Angels in respect of God:</p>
               <p>1. They enjoy God and glory,<note n="*" place="margin">They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Thrones (saith a School man) because they doe attend on the Throne of God.</note>

This implieth their great purity and happinesse, and withall
their Ministrie: what God bids them doe they are ready to
doe. They shall attend Christ when hee comes to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>2. They praise God and celebrate his Name, cleave inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably
unto him, and obey his Commandements, <hi>Esay 6.
Psalm 103. 20, 21. &amp; 104. 4. Dan. 7. 10. Job.</hi> 1. 6. they see the
worth and excellencie of God, that he deserves more praise
then they can give.</p>
               <p>3, They praise and worship Christ as the head of the
Church, <hi>Apoc. 5. 11, 12. Heb. 1. 6. Phil.</hi> 2. 10. also as his
Ministers, <hi>Matth. 4. 11. Luke 22. 43. Matth.</hi> 28. 2. they stand

               <p>8. The speech of Angels?</p>
               <p>Angels and Devils communicate with God, and one with
another, not by speeches,<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> on <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 1. p. 43. See Doctor <hi>Preston</hi> on Prayer.</note> for language requires bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107075:236"/>
which these Spirits want: but as they apprehend
every object without senses, so they expresse it without lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in a secret way.</p>
               <p>We come now to some profitable questions about the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>The first is this, if the Angels be so beneficiall to us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may they not bee prayed unto.</p>
               <p>The ground and cause which brought in praying to Angels
is laid down <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13.<note place="margin">Origines ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los docet invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candos certam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que invocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis formulam praescribit. <hi>Homil. in</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech. Jelem. Casmannus.</note> where you have a generall prohibition
of religious worshipping of Angels, with the cause of it.</p>
               <p>There are three causes why they attempted this?</p>
               <p>1. They entred into things which they did not know, as
the Papists, how can they tell whether the Angels pray for
us, whether they know our wants.</p>
               <p>2. They follow their carnall mind, because they see in the
world, that to great Magistrates we use Mediators and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
they dare not goe of themselves, so here.</p>
               <p>3. Humility, for this they talk as Papists do now, wee are
unworthy to goe directly to God, and therefore we need the
help of Angels: but this is vaine, for Christ is nearer to us
then Angels are, <hi>Ephes. 3. 12. Tutius &amp; jucundius loquar ad Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,
quam ad aliquem sanctorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We say that all lawfull and moderate reverence is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Angels which consists in these particulars.</p>
               <p>1. We acknowledge the great gifts of God in them, and
praise God for them. We confesse it is his mercie, that hee
hath made such noble creatures to bee serviceable to us, and
then for themselves in our judgments.</p>
               <p>1. We honour them and judge them more noble creatures
then man, they have greater wisdome, holinesse and power
then man hath.</p>
               <p>2. For our will and affections, we loue them, because they
love us and delight in our good, being ready to helpe us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where.</p>
               <p>3. We should be carefull of our carriage, because of their
presence, we should not sinne because of the Angels.</p>
               <p>4. Wee desire to make them examples of our lives, that we
may doe Gods will as they do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107075:236"/>
5. If Angels should appeare visibly to us, wee should ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
them as more excellent creatures, but yet stll keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of civill or fraternall honour<note n="*" place="margin">Cultus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternae societa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> as to our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
servants: but yet above us and not honour them with
religious worship.</p>
               <p>The Papists say a religious worship is due unto them, but
(yet that wee may doe them no wrong) not indeed such as is
due to God, but secondary; yet stil religious, and so they
say they intercede for us, not as Christ, but in an inferiour
way: and in this sense they hold they may be worshipped and
prayed unto.</p>
               <p>Now we will refute their arguments, and then confirme
the truth with strong reasons.</p>
               <p>For the first, all lawful reverence is commanded by the
first Table, and that is religious, or else by the second, and that
is civill: but that manner and degree of their worship is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
therefore it is meerly invented.</p>
               <p>2. By generall consent, religious worship is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we doe acknowledge God to be the <hi>primum principium,</hi> the
<hi>ultimum finem,</hi> and <hi>summum bonum,</hi> now this is but one: and
we may as wel say there is a <hi>summum bonum secundariò,</hi> as there
is a secondary religious worship.</p>
               <p>3. There is the same reason of a religious worship as there
is of a divine act of faith, love and hope: but if a man should
say, we may with a divine faith beleeve in God primarily,
and Angels secondarily, it were ridiculous, therefore here if
religious worship were due because of supernaturall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
then every godly man were religiously to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.</p>
               <p>Our arguments in generall against this are these?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, &amp; him
only shalt thou serve, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. it is applyed to Christ.</p>
               <p>2. The promise is to those onely which call upon him,
51 <hi>Psal. 15. call upon mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It cannot bee of faith, for how shall I know whether
they hear me, whether they be present.</p>

place.</p>
               <p>The second question is, whether every man hath his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

Sic interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti sunt hunc locum</hi> Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomus, Augustinus, Hieronimus &amp; alii Casmannus. It is greater both Dignity and benefit, that every one of the faithfull have many Angels appointed by the Lord for his guard, whereof the proofe is manifest, <hi>Psal. 34. 7. &amp;</hi> 91. 12. an host of Angels pitch their Tents round about them. As many reprobate Angels seeke the destruction of one onely man, <hi>Marke 5. 9. and</hi> 12. 45. so the Lord encountreth them by a number of his elect-Angels, Master <hi>Cartwright.</hi>
                  </note> but yet the more to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
because it was generally held among the Heathens,
who did ascribe to every man born a bad angel to afflict, and a
good one to defend him: a good &amp; ill <hi>Genius</hi> as they called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<hi>Becanus</hi> brings places of Scripture to prove it, but there is
altogether silence in the Scripture concerning it: for when
the Angels are charged to have care over us, it implyeth that
it is all their care. The chiefest place which most seems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that opinion, is <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 15. where they said that it was
<hi>his Angell:</hi> Now to this some answer, that the men spake
according to the opinion of men then generally received, &amp;
not according to the truth, as we may give an instance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the blind man, when they asked <hi>whether he or his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
had sinned that he should be borne blinde:</hi> how could hee sin
before he was borne: but some answer, that there was an
opinion generally received, which all the <hi>Platonists</hi> held (&amp;
so <hi>Origen</hi> and many of the Ancients) that the soule was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before it was put into the bodie: and as it did good or il,
it was put into a well tempered or a maimed bodie: especially
they thought these Angels did appeare a little before or after
mens death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks that it was an Angel peculiarly destinated to
<hi>Peter</hi> for that time of his imprisonment. If it were a peculiar
Angel, then it would follow, that he spake and had the same


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107075:237"/>
gestures that men have to whom they belong. Therefore it
may well bee rendred <hi>it is his messenger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 7. 24.</note> as the word is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
translated. But you will say then, they thought the
messenger spake like him; No, but it might fall out, that
they thought <hi>Rhode</hi> did mistake: and when he said I am <hi>Peter</hi>
they might thinke he said I am come from <hi>Peter,</hi> and so it
may bee answered. If every man have one Angel, why did
more then one carrie <hi>Lazarus</hi> his soule to heaven, <hi>and he hath
given his Angels charge over thee,</hi> that is, many over one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man. <hi>Cameron tomo 2<hi rend="sup">do</hi> Praelect. vide</hi> Rainold, <hi>de lib.

Spirits but differently, some because they are present
at our Assemblies: and if you aske what need that, seeing
God and Christ are there, they answer that hee mentioned
God and Christ before, and now addeth these as inseparable
servants which are sent for the salvation of beleevers: others
as probably make it a new argument from the Angels, <hi>Esay</hi> 6.

God hated, but by his death it is otherwise. But though

There names, offices, actions, apparitions shew plainely,
that they are not bare qualities but true substances.</p>
               <p>It serves for instruction, 1. To see the blindnesse &amp; errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
of mankind, in that a great number of men of learning
and wit and parts good enough, and that such as lived in
the Church and acnowledged the five bookes of <hi>Moses</hi> to be
divine, should yet make a shift to winke so hard, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine
that there were no Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:107075:240"/>
What falsehood may not the Devill make a man entertaine
and defend, and yet seeme not to denie the Authoritie of
Scripture. If a man confessing <hi>Moses</hi> writings to be true, will
yet denie that there be either Spirits or Angels, which are
things so plainely revealed by <hi>Moses,</hi> that a man would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it impossible to receive his writings and not confesse
them. But if God leave man to the Deuill &amp; his owne witte,
he wil make him the verier foole because of his wit, &amp; he will
erre so much the more palpably by how much he seems better
armed against errour, euen as a mans owne weapon beaten
to his head by a farr stronger arme will make a deepe wound
in him.</p>
               <p>Se wee our aptnesse to run into and maintaine false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,<note n="*" place="margin">Superbi sunt, nec noverunt Moysi sententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, sed amant suam; non quia vera est, sed qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a sua est. <hi>Aug Confess.</hi> l. 12. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> and let us not trust in our owne wittes, but suspect
our selves, and seeke to God for direction.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Let us learne humilitie from this, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
our selves with these excellent Spirits, learne to know
how meane we be, that we may be also meane in our owne
esteeme. So long as a man compares himselfe with those things
and persons which are baser then himselfe, he is prone to lift
up himselfe in his owne conceit and to thinke highly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but when he doth weigh himselfe in the ballance with
his betters, he begins to know his owne lightnesse. The Lord
hath set us men in the midst as it were betwixt the bruite
beasts and the celestiall Spirits, we doe so farr exceed them as
the Angels exceede us, as for bodily gifts, the beasts in many
things goe beyond us, some are more strong, swift, have more
excellent sight &amp; smell then wee, but in few things doe we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
the Angels. They are swifter and stronger then we, and
their excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reason goes beyond ours in a manner, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
which is in us excelleth the fancie of the beasts,
they know a thousand things more then we doe or can know,
One Angell can doe more then all men, can speake more lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
repeate more histories, in a word can performe all
acts of invention, and judgement, and memorie farre beyond
us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Since God hath made Angels to serve and attend


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107075:240"/>
him, should not we that are farre Inferiour to them, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
also to serve him, yea exceeding glad and thankfull that
he will vouchsafe to admit us into his service. Doth he need
our service, that is served with such ministers and messengers?
Let us frame our selves to obedience, and doe Gods will on
earth with all readinesse and cherefulnesse, seeing there is soe
great store of more worthy persons in heaven that doe it. An
Angell will not esteeme any worke too difficult or base, why
should wee?</p>
               <p>Fourthly. The Angels which waite about the throne of
God are glorious, &amp; therefore the Lord, himselfe must needs
excell in glorie. <hi>Esa. 6, 1, 2. Ezek.</hi> 1, 28.</p>

will; whose nature is such (they say) that what it hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
with full deliberation, it cannot refuse it againe, but this
is noe good reason, because the choice made cannot alter the
nature of the will. The Fathers give these reasons. 1. The
Divell sinned of himselfe, but man was tempted. 2. In mans
fall all mankinde would have beene damned, but in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
fall, not all Angels.</p>
               <p>The best answer is this,<note place="margin">The Angells are not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation one from another, but were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all at once, so that of them some might fall and others stand, but men descend by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from one stock or roote, and therefore the first man falling and corrupting his
nature, derived to all his posterity a sinfull nature.</note> when thy had sinned, God, out of
his justice refused to give them any help of grace; by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they
might rise from sinne, and without which it was impossible
for them to recover, and this is the Apostles argument, if God
were so severe that he would not give these so great and noble
Creatures time of repentance, neither would he others. The
Angels were intellectuall Spirits, dwelling in heavenly places
in the presence of God: and the light of his countenance,
and therefore could not sinne by error or misperswasion, but


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107075:242"/>
of purposed malice, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost
and irremissible. But man fell by misperswasion, and being
deceived by the lying suggestion of the Spirit of errou.</p>
               <p>The Devils malice against man-kinde appeares,<note place="margin">Vide Amesij medullam. l. 1. c. 11.</note>

where there is an imbred enmitie in the Devill, as likewise,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> where he is saide to be a roaring Lion, a Lion roares
when he hath got his pray by way of triumph, or when hee is
hungrie and almost starved and so most cruell.</p>
               <p>This malice of his appeares in his going up and downe the
whole world to damne men, &amp; that though hee get no good
by it, nay, though his condemnation bee so much the greater,
and therefore if God should let him doe what he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us. He would first bring all outward miserie as upon
<hi>Job,</hi> and then eternall damnation. And though he knowes
God will defend the godly, yet he never leaveth to vex them,
to tempt them to sinne, to overwhelme them with griefe and
dispaire, so that he is opposite to God. The Devils malice is
beyond his wisedome, else he would never oppose the people
of God as he doth, since hee doth hereby advance their glory
and his owne ruine.</p>

actions, thence proceeding to sinnes of infirmitie, and soe to
wilfull transgressions, and at last to obstinacie and finall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie.</p>
               <p>5. To bring us from one extreame to another.</p>
               <p>6. To perswade that this suggestions are the motions of
Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>7. To make advantage of time by alluring every age to the

youth to lust, perfect age to violent and audacious attempts,

               <p>More were possessed with them in the time of the Gospell,

his power over Devils. This possessing was nothing but
the dwelling and working of the Devill in the bodie: one was
demoniacke and lunaticke too; because the Devill tooke these
advantages against his bodie, and this hath beene manifested
by their speaking of strange tongues on a suddain. The causes
of this are partly from the Devils malice &amp; desire to hurt us, &amp;
partly from our selves who ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bid the Devill goe into <hi>Saul;</hi> or out of grace, that they may

               <p>The difference betweene Gods temptations and Satans,
they differ:</p>
               <p>1. In the matter: the matter of Gods temptations is ever
good, as either by prosperity, adversity, or commandements,
by chastisements which from him are ever good: but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Satans temptations is evill, he solicits us to sin.</p>
               <p>2. In the end, the end of Gods temptation is to humble ns
and doe us good: but of Satans, to make us dishonour God.</p>

               <p>2. The worke made, not an Hermophradite as some would
have it (though <hi>Adam</hi> comprehended both sexes) but hee is
distinguished into both sexes: thus it followes after, male
and female.</p>
               <p>3. The pattern of it, the image of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 7.
Col. 3. 10. Bellarmine</hi> distinguisheth between an age and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude;
the first (saith he) consists in naturall endowments:
the other in supernaturall graces: rather image and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
represent an exact likenesse. These two words are in an
inverted order joyned together, 5 ch. ver. 3 <hi>JAmes</hi> 3. ch. 9. v.
mentions only likenesse, leaving out image, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
signe, that there is no difference betweene them, but
that the second is added to insinuate the perfection of the
image.</p>
               <p>There is a four-fold image or likenesse?</p>
               <p>1. Where there is a likenesse with an absolute agreement
in the same nature, and so the Son of God is called the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

his soule. 3. In the whole person for the union of both.</p>
               <p>The soule of a man is conformable to God in respect of its
nature, faculties, and habits.</p>
               <p>1. In respect of its nature, essence, or being, as it is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and immortall substance.<note place="margin">This was great controversie between <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> &amp; <hi>August.

That of <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 1. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. makes it the more probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it is by immediate creation, &amp; for that of original sinne, the soule is created as part of man, and so justly deprived of that originall excellency.</note> The Scripture witnesseth,
1. that the soule of man is a spirit, <hi>Matth. 27. 20. Acts</hi> 7. 59,
2. That it is immortall.</p>
               <p>1. Because it cannot bee destroyed by any second cause
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 28.</p>
               <p>2. Being served from the bodie, it subsists by it selfe, and
goes to God, <hi>Eccles. 12. 7. Luke</hi> 16. 22.</p>
               <p>3. Because it is a simple and immateriall substance, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on matter: the minde workes the better, the more it
is abstracted from the body, when it is asleep or dying.</p>
               <p>4. Because it transcends all terrene and mortall things, and
with a wonderful quicknesse searcheth after heavenly, divine,
and eternall things. There is an invincible argument for the
thing secretly imprinted in the instinct and conscience of the
soule it selfe. Because it is every good mans hope that it shall
be so, and wicked mans feare.</p>
               <p>5. The foode of the soule is immortall, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. the
evident promises of eternall life prove the soule to be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
<hi>He that beleeveth in me hath eternall life:</hi> and <hi>to day thou
shalt bee with mee in Paradise.</hi> Nothing can satisfie the soule
but God.</p>
               <p>6. Man is capable of vertue and vice, of immortall desires
and affections.</p>
               <p>7. The soules of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were not made of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but came by immediate creation, in whom God gave a
specimen, what he would perpetually doe with other men.
That is but a Cavill, that <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. speakes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

over the creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 28. The image of God
doth not principally consist in this, but secondarily, therefore
though the man and woman were created perfectly after
Gods image in other respects, yet in this respect the woman
had not the image of God, as the Apostle sheweth. The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which <hi>Adam</hi> had over the creatures, was not absolute and
direct (that God reserved to himselfe) but it was for <hi>Adams</hi>
use, then the stoutest and fiercest beasts would be ruled by
<hi>Adam,</hi> this dominion since the fal is lost for a great part of our
rebellion against God, the creatures rebellion should mind us
of ours: we may see somtimes a little child driving before him

of the soul, the time when it was infused, it is most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the body was first made as the organe or instrument,
and then the soule put into it, as God did make heaven and
earth before man was made.</p>
               <p>God did not create all the soules of men at once, but he
creates them daily as they are infused into the bodie.</p>
               <p>There are these two <hi>Questions</hi> to be resolved.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Whether immortalitie was naturall to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Whether originall righteousnesse was naturall to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the first. A thing is immortall foure wayes.</p>
               <p>1. Absolutly, soe that their is no inward or outward cause
of mortalitie 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. soe God onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:107075:248"/>
2. when it is not soe by nature, but immortalitie is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
voluntarily, put into the constitution of the creature
by the Creator, soe Angels are immortall.</p>
               <p>3. Not by any singular condition of nature but by Grace,
so the bodies of the Saints glorified.</p>
               <p>4. When it is mortall inwardly but yet conditionally it
is immortall, that is, if he doe his dutie and soe <hi>Adam</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
               <p>For the second <hi>Question.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Affirmatiuam tuentur ci Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </p>
               <p>The properties of it are these.</p>
               <p>1. It is originall righteousnesse, because it is the naturall
perfection of the whole man and all his faculties, for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
sake we call it originall righteousnesse. It is soe both
in regard of it selfe, for it was the first in the first man.</p>
               <p>2. in regard of man, because he had it from his very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>3. In regard of his posterity, because it was to be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to others.</p>
               <p>2. It is universall, it was the rectitude of all parts, it could
not else be an image of God, unlesse it did universally resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him in all holinesse. His understanding had all things for
truth, his will for good, his affections for obedience.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Harmonious</hi> every facultie stood in a right order, the will
subject to the understanding and the affections to both.</p>
               <p>4. It was due to him not by way of desert, as if God did
owe <hi>Adam</hi> any thing but conditionally, supposing God made
<hi>Adam</hi> to injoye himselfe and by way of meanes.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> denie that that was naturall to man in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie,
and therefore they say mans nature is not corrupted
by the fall, because a supernaturall gift onely is taken from
him, all his naturals being left, which is the opinion of

shall put them to death, and therefore they hold that <hi>Enoch</hi>

<hi>John Baptist</hi> is expresly said by Christ to be the <hi>Elias</hi> that was

we hold that wheresoever Paradise was, yet in the great

still, onely the forme, beautie and fruitfullnesse is spoiled
<hi>Gen. 7. 19. Paradise</hi> signifieth a garden, the word being transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<hi>In Hebrew</hi> it is called <hi>Heden,</hi> which signifieth <hi>delights,</hi> a
Garden of all manner of delights, a place beset with all kinde
of fruitefull and beautifull trees. There were two speciall
trees in it, one called the tree of life, the other of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evill.</p>
               <p>Some say it was called the tree of life from the effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the hidden power and force it had<note n="a" place="margin">The Poets from the tree of life tooke their Nectar, and <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctar, signifieth making young, and <hi>Ambrosia</hi> Immortality: therefore they are said to bee the meate and drinke of the Gods.</note> of sustaining
and prolonging mans life. Although it be a dispute, whether
it had this force as meat to prolong life or as medicine to
prevent death, old age and diseases, as likewise whether this
power in the tree were naturall or supernaturall.</p>
               <p>Therefore others say it was called soe not from the effect,
but signification, because it was an outward signe, that God
would give them immortalitie if they did continue.</p>
               <p>It is questioned, whether the tree of lif was a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pareus answers,</hi> that it was a Sacrament three wayes.</p>
               <p>1. As an admonishion to them, that the life which they
had, they had it from God, for as often as they tasted of it,
they were to remember that God was the author of life,</p>
               <p>2. As it was a symboll of a better life in heaven, if he did
continue in obedience.</p>

did obtaine life. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 7. He is called <hi>the tree of life in the midst


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107075:249"/>
of Paradise,</hi> but that is onely allegoricall and allusive, soe that
what the tree of life was to <hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie, the same is
Christ to us in our corrupt estate.</p>
               <p>2. The tree of Good and Evill.</p>
               <p>It was not so called from any internall forme as if it selfe
were knowing good and evill,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> nor from the effect, as if by
eating thereof it would have procured wisedome in man
and made him wiser, nor yet was it called so from the lying
promise of the Devill, concerning omniscience, for God call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it so before they met together, therefore it was named so
from the Event, for God by this name foretold what would
follow, if man did not abstaine from it; that he should expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
know what was good and what was evill, hee
should practically feele what he had lost and what evill he
had plunged himselfe into. Some have thought, that those
words <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. should not be understood Historically but
allegorically,<note place="margin">Pareus.</note> that is, that God gave him noe hopes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into this place againe, but the text contradicts that, some
have understood by Cherubims, some species and images of
terrible creatures,<note place="margin">Corrrollaties from Gods goodnesse to man in his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> as wee call Scarecrowes, but that is
simple to thinke that <hi>Adam</hi> was so childish to be afraid of
those; others interpret it of the fire of Purgatory. The more
probable Interpretation is, that by Cherubims are meant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
who did after a visible manner shake up and downe this
fiery sword,<note place="margin">1. It serves to blame mankind for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full naughtiness in striving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, who hath bestowed so great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved benefits upon him. 2. Let us seriously consider of our selves and of our making, that we may come to a due knowledge of God, of our selves, One saith, the soule is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together immateriall, for what hath accidents, hath matter, nothing but that is the subject of accidents. 2. what is finite is materiall: seeing finitenesse is the attribute of matter by which it is contained within its own limits: but it subsists, lives and workes, being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the body, it is immateriall.</note> 
                  <hi>Moses</hi> doth therfore call them Cherubims, because
the <hi>Jewes</hi> knew what he meant, having such formes over the
Arke. Therefore it is taken for Angels, not simply but as
they appeared in some shape. It is a curiositie to enquire how
long they staid there, although it is certaine they ceased when
Paradise was destroyed, which was by the floud</p>
               <p>Therefore this serves 1. For information, to instruct us.</p>
               <p>1. That everyman and woman hath a soule, there is a bodie

everlasting weale or woe.</p>
               <p>3. It is soe immortall that it admits of no cessation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission,

               <p>2. What it is.</p>
               <p>1. That there is a Providence which governeth the world,
and that nothing is done in the world without the certaine
and determinate counsell of God, is thus proved.</p>
               <p>1. Faith which leanes and rests on testimonies of holy

                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:107075:250"/>
2. Certaine demostrative reasons, taken</p>
               <p>1. From the causes; <hi>viz.</hi> the Attributes and nature of God.</p>
               <p>1. There is a God: therefore providence, because he is a
most powerfull and wise King.</p>
               <p>2. The omnipotent will of God, whereby all things are
done, without which nothing can come to passe.</p>

all things which are done in his kingdome</p>

and goodnesse whereby he communicateth himselfe to the
creatures.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unchangeably depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on the counsell and decree of God.<note place="margin">God by his Prophet infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly foretold su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</note>
               </p>
               <p>6. He regards the ends of things, therefore also the meanes
to those ends.</p>
               <p>7. Hee is the first cause: therefore on him depend the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
causes.</p>
               <p>2. From tbe effects: the works of God.</p>
               <p>1. The most wise order of things both naturall and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,
which could not be setled, much lesse preserved, by
blind nature, chance, or fortune.</p>
               <p>2. Naturall notions, or the law of nature in the difference
of honest and dishonest things,</p>
               <p>3. Peace or torment of conscience from keeping or viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Law.</p>
               <p>4. Punishments &amp; rewards agreeable to mens deeds: which
prove there is some Judge of the world, and revenger of sins,
whose severity we cannot shun.</p>
               <p>5. Heroicke motions, vertues and singular gifts given by
God to Princes, Magistrates, Inventers of Arts, Artificers &amp;
others, for the common benefit of mankind.</p>
               <p>Lastly, by the same reasons it is proved, that there is both
a God and Providence.</p>
               <p>2. what providence is:</p>
               <p>It is an externall and temporall action of God, whereby he
preserveth, governeth, and disposeth all and singular things
which are and are done, both the creatures, and the faculties


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107075:251"/>
and actions of the creatures, and directeth them both to the
mediate ends, and to the last end of all, after a set deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
manner, according to the most free Decree, &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of his owne will; that himselfe in all things may bee
glorified.</p>
               <p>1. The matter or object of Gods providence, is the whole

               </p>
               <p>1. God is infinite in all excellencies, infinite in wisedome:
there may as much wisdome be seen in little as in great things:
all things in the world, yea even all things which might have
beene as well as those that have fallen out, are subject to his
wisedome and power, nothing so small, but it is a fit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of knowing and ordering.</p>
               <p>2. There is a necessary connexion and mutuall dependance
betweene great and small things, the one supporting &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the other, so that it is not possible to conceive how


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107075:251"/>
any thing should be ordered by God if all things were not,
the little things being like the pins of a house which hold the
building together, or the hinges of a great gate, upon which
the whole is moved.</p>

nothing can bee hid from his knowledge: the Lords manner
of working in the smallest things is so wise and excellent, as
it serveth sufficiently to free him from all imputation of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in regarding them. No Philosopher would count it a
base thing to be able to dispute accurately of the nature of a
flea, and to give a reason of its making and working: why
therefore shall it be an impeachment to Gods glory in a more
perfect manner then we can conceive of, both to know and

               <p>2. The kinds of Gods providence.</p>
               <p>1. The providence of God is either 1. Generall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all Creatures, that whereby God taketh care of the
world, and all things therein according to their nature, <hi>Act.
17. 25. Heb. 1. 3. Gen. 9. 1, 2, 3. Psal.</hi> 36. 6.</p>
               <p>2. Speciall, that which doth peculiarly appertaine to
Creatures endued with reason and understanding, <hi>viz.</hi> Men
and Angels: and among them he lookes chiefly to this Elect
with a fatherly care, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. and of this Providence is
that place before noted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. to be understood.</p>
               <p>2. Gods Providence is either, 1. Mediate, when God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth
creatures by creatures, as by meanes and instruments.
But God useth them:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:107075:252"/>
1. Not necessarily for want of power in himselfe, but of
his owne Free-will in the abundance of his goodnesse.</p>
               <p>2. Providence includes meanes * which if we neglect, we
tempt God.</p>
               <p>3. God well useth evill instruments besides and beyond
their own intention,<note place="margin">Qui ordinat ad finem ordinat ad media.</note> as the Jewes, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23. and <hi>Josephs</hi>
brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 5.</p>
               <p>2. Immediate,<note place="margin">To shew that hee is not tyed to second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1.</note> when God by himselfe, without the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the creatures doth preserve and govern things. Thus
the Apostles were called: thus God made the world immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
without any instruments.</p>
               <p>3. Gods Providence is. 1. Ordinary and usuall when God
governeth the world and things of the world according to
the order and lawes which himselfe set in the Creation.</p>
               <p>2. Extraordinary and unusuall, when hee worketh either
against or beside that order so appointed, as in working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p>3. The degrees and parts of Gods providence?</p>
               <p>1. Conservation,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9. 6. Heb. 1. 3. Acts 17. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Job 12. 14, 15. Psal.</hi> 44. 2. It is that
whereby God doth uphold the order, nature, quantity and
quality of all and every Creature both in their kinde
and in particular,<note place="margin">Tres sunt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus divinae pro videntiae 1 <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatio,</hi> actio Dei, qua essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias Creaturaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quod species vel individua, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuat, eorum<expan>

<hi>individua,</hi> as trees, herbs, bruite beasts, men; Hee preserves
things, <hi>quoad individua,</hi> which are incorruptible, as Angels,
Stars.</p>
               <p>2. Government, it is that whereby God doth dispose and
order all things according to his owne will and pleasure, so
that nothing can come to passe otherwise then he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Gubernatio,</hi> actio, qua prae summa sua autoritate, potentia &amp; sapientia de rebus omnibus disponit easque pro arbitrio suo regit. 3. <hi>Ordinatio,</hi> qua Deus pro admiranda sua sapientia &amp; potentia omnia in ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nem redigit, fines certos &amp; bonos constituendo, &amp; med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is a great work of God to continue a succession of living
creatures in the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 30. This is that for which


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107075:252"/>
God tooke order in the beginning; when having made the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he bade them <hi>encrease and multiply, and fill
the face of the earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 22. God challengeth this worke
to himselfe in his speech to <hi>Job</hi> 39. 1. One generation comes
and another goes. It is noted as an act of Divine blessing to
encrease the fruits of the Cattle and the flockes of sheepe and
kine, <hi>Deut. 28. 4. Psal.</hi> 107. 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. If this worke were not wrought, the world
would bee empty of living creatures within one age: beasts,
birds and fishes and all would faile within a few yeares, and
so should men be deprived of that help and benefit which they
enjoy by them.</p>
               <p>2. The powers of propagating kinds is a wonderfull work
no lesse then that of Creation, done by a wisdome and power
infinitely surpassing all the wisedome and power of all men.</p>
               <p>Let us sanctifie God in our hearts by contemplating this
great worke. We see the truth of one part of the narration of
Scripture, in the increasing and multiplying of creatures, and
we see it done by a secret and hidden way, let us therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
his promises. Can God promise any thing to us more
exceeding our reason, to conceive how it should be effected,
then it exceeds our reason to think how the kindes of things
are increased and contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed in the world for so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of yeares? We can see no reason how an egge by the hens
sitting upon it for a few dayes should be made a sparrow, star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
hen, or other bird.</p>
               <p>God prepareth fit nourishment for all the creatures to eat,
and conveyeth it to each of them in that quantity and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
which is fittest for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 27, 28. &amp; 145. 15. &amp;
147. 9. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons.</hi> He that provideth foode for all, must know their
number, their nature, and places of abode, and their severall
needs, and he that knowes these particulars, must be none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but God: he must know the quantity of the thing provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for foode, and the quality of it, and the season of it, and
none can doe these things but an infinite Essence, that is to
say, a God. 2. God in providing for the Creatures, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for man who feedeth on them, and he declareth his own


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107075:253"/>
wisedome and goodnesse in continuing the kindes of things,
and continuing them in welfare.</p>
               <p>This should teach us faith in Gods promises, by which he

but as the best have some evill, so the worst have some good,
and therefore God will punish that evil which is in the good,
with temporall punishments, and give temporall blessings to
the evill for the good that is in them: that seeing all good
must be rewarded with good, and all evill with evill: the good
of the good might have an everlasting reward of good: and on
the contrary, the evill of the evill might have an everlasting

               <p>3. Let us often put our selves in mind of this truth, that
it may worke in us a reverent care of ordering all our words
and actions aright in his sight, that nothing may slip from us
unworthy his eye and eare, offensive to his most great and
most pure Majestie, and all-seeing eye. How carefull are wee
of our speeches and actions, when wee know that they are

4. God hath a generall providence about all things, yea
even in sins. God determines sin in regard of time and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
