            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Power of the <hi>Prerogative</hi> to reſtrain Foreign <hi>Trade</hi> from <hi>ſome,</hi> and grant it to <hi>others,</hi> was <hi>vindicated</hi> and <hi>aſſerted</hi> for <hi>Law</hi> by the <hi>Companies Council;</hi> and tho' the deciding it by a <hi>Legal Trial</hi> was <hi>propoſed,</hi> yet it was <hi>declined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Powers</hi> in their former <hi>Charters</hi> were acknowledged to be <hi>unlawful</hi> by the <hi>Company's own Council,</hi> whereupon it was deſired, they might be <hi>diſtinguiſh'd</hi> in their new <hi>Charters,</hi> from thoſe which were <hi>lawful;</hi> but for want of ſuch a <hi>diſtinction</hi> of the <hi>lawful</hi> from the <hi>unlawful Powers,</hi> it is left to the <hi>Company,</hi> their <hi>Factors, Servants</hi> and <hi>Mariners,</hi> to determine which <hi>Powers may</hi> and which <hi>may not</hi> be <hi>lawfully uſed;</hi> and if one may judge by <hi>their Proceedings,</hi> they will account them <hi>all lawful,</hi> as it's plain they <hi>have done</hi> by the <hi>Petition</hi> given into <hi>Council</hi> the 21 <hi>October,</hi> to ſtop the Ship <hi>Redbridge,</hi> by which they claimed the <hi>ſole Trade to the Eaſt-Indies,</hi> granted them by <hi>Charter,</hi> and pretended that the <hi>lawful Trading</hi> thither of others their <hi>Fellow Subjects</hi> was a Contempt of their <hi>Majeſties Government,</hi> and of the <hi>known Laws of the Land.</hi> Upon this <hi>Petition,</hi> and bare Allegation of the <hi>Company,</hi> the ſaid Ship was ſtopt.</p>
               <p>By which <hi>Proceeding</hi> its evident, what <hi>Conſtruction</hi> is now put on the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of their former <hi>Charters</hi> by theſe <hi>new Grants;</hi> which may further appear by the not granting <hi>Protection for Four hundred Seamen</hi> to go to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> this Seaſon, upon the ſeveral <hi>Petitions</hi> which were delivered into <hi>Council,</hi> and the granting to them <hi>Protections</hi> for Twelve hundred Men, even whilſt they were no <hi>Company,</hi> nor had any <hi>Charter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And how contradictory ſuch an <hi>Excluſion</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> without an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> is to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, may appear by the ſeveral <hi>Judgments</hi> which have been given in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> ſince their <hi>Majeſties happy Acceſſion to the Crown,</hi> upon Actions brought againſt ſeveral Perſons for ſeizing <hi>Ships</hi> and <hi>Goods</hi> for <hi>Trading</hi> within the limits of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> and <hi>African Company's Charter,</hi> and is likewiſe demonſtrated by the <hi>Petition which the Company</hi> delivered to the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons</hi> in the former Seſſions, praying to be confirmed by an <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further appears by the time which was ſpent in Settling that <hi>Trade,</hi> during the <hi>two laſt Seſſions</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which would have been needleſs if the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Charter</hi> could have legally <hi>excluded</hi> his Subjects without an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which is a Power His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſeems to diſclaim in the aforeſaid <hi>Meſſage</hi> ſent the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> laſt Seſſions; for therein it is expreſly declared, <hi>That the Concurrence of the Parliament is neceſſary to make a compleat and uſeful Settlement of that Trade.</hi> — And if their <hi>Concurrence is neceſſary,</hi> its plain the <hi>King</hi> cannot do it <hi>by his own Authority alone</hi> without their <hi>Concurrence,</hi> and the <hi>Company's</hi> being <hi>eſtablished contrary to their repeated deſires, it's humbly ſuppoſed,</hi> can never be thought an <hi>Inducement</hi> for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to <hi>confirm them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus given an Account of the Means of <hi>obtaining their New Charters,</hi> it may not be improper to conſider how they have put it in Execution, and eſpecially as to the raiſing <hi>the additional Stock of Seven hundred forty four thouſand Pounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein the <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> which they have <hi>practiſed</hi> to draw in others to <hi>Subscribe,</hi> are ſo <hi>extraordinary,</hi> that they are worth obſerving, as may apppear by the manner of their Addreſſing to thoſe who need perſwading, to Subſcribe to this or the like Effect: —</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Sir, <hi>If you will write into the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Stock, you ſhall have Security to your own Satisfaction. — That you ſhall have Ten</hi> per Cent. <hi>Profit for what Money you think fit to Subſcribe, and your Money paid you at a Twelve Months end, or elſe have liberty then to keep the Stock if you pleaſe.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe all Men have not Money by them, there is an Expedient found out for that too. Thus —</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline margQuotes">"<hi>Sir, If you are pleaſed to be concerned in the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Company's Stock on theſe Terms, though you have no Money by you, that ſhall be no Objection; for you ſhall have it provided for you.</hi>
                  </q>—</p>
               <p>And theſe <hi>Methods</hi> have produced an <hi>extraordinary effect</hi> in <hi>changing ſome Mens Minds,</hi> and convincing <hi>others <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> and this has been the <hi>particular Province</hi> of ſome of that <hi>Committee,</hi> who are but late <hi>Converts</hi> themſelves, and who have been ſo <hi>Zealous</hi> in this matter, and ſo <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>General</hi> in their <hi>Propoſals of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that they are become <hi>Notoriouſly Famous for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>eaſieſt</hi> and <hi>cheapest way</hi> they have ever yet had of <hi>making Friends,</hi> for if a Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Pounds ſhould be under-written on theſe Terms, the <hi>Ten per cent.</hi> Profit would amount to but Fifteen Thouſand Pound, of which the Intereſt for a Year comes to Seven Thouſand Five Hundred Pound.—So that it would only coſt Seven Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds—, which may eaſily be ſlid into an Account of <hi>Promiſcuous Charges</hi> and <hi>Secret Services,</hi> among other <hi>greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and this beſides engaging ſo many <hi>new Friends,</hi> is done as a means to draw in <hi>double</hi> as much to be <hi>Subſcribed</hi> by others, who know nothing of ſuch <hi>Bargains,</hi> but are induced to Subſcribe by the <hi>Influence</hi> of ſuch <hi>Examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Joining Seven Hundred Forty Four Thouſand Pound to the <hi>Companies Imaginary Stock,</hi> is in effect the giving them at leaſt one half of it, which is Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Seventy Thouſand Pounds for an <hi>Admittance</hi> into this <hi>Trade.</hi> Whereas it (notwithſtanding the <hi>Right</hi> which the <hi>Subject</hi> has to the <hi>Freedom of this Trade</hi> by Law,) the Priviledge of the admittance into the Exerciſe of it, were a thing which was neceſſary to have been <hi>Purchaſed of a Subject,</hi> it would have been a much <hi>Cheaper Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi> to have given <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds</hi> for <hi>a new Company,</hi> as was Propoſed, than to give them Three Hundred and Seventy Thouſand Pounds, or more, for the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Coming into the <hi>Old One;</hi> but ſuch <hi>a Purchaſing of a Subject</hi> the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of this <hi>Trade</hi> for <hi>Fifty Thouſand Pounds,</hi> might well have been <hi>accounted a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> to the <hi>Peoples Right</hi> thereunto, as well as a <hi>diminution</hi> of the <hi>Reſpcet</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> due to the Proceedings of the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons,</hi> who its not to be doubted will be very Cautious of giving any ſeeming Countenance to a <hi>Proceeding</hi> wherein the <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> is ſo highly <hi>Concerned,</hi> as that of being deprived of the <hi>Right</hi> which <hi>they have</hi> to the <hi>Freedom of Trade</hi> without <hi>an Act of Parliament.</hi>
