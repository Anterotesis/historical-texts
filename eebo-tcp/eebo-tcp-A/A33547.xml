            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

who, to keep up their <hi>Trade,</hi> study to impose on others,
amusing them with <hi>mysterious Nonsense.</hi> Others essay to
prove, That <hi>Faith</hi> is impossible where Reason rules and
is used; and therefore that Believing proceeds from a
Defect of Reason, and consequently unworthy of those
who own themselves to be Men, that is, reasonable
Creatures. A Third sort examine the several Points of
<hi>Faith,</hi> as they are set forth in <hi>Systems</hi> and <hi>Confessions,</hi>
and do either dwindle them away into nothing, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them very absurd, that is, impossible or no ways
worthy to be believed. This Controversie is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Importance: all ought to be inquisitive into it, and
earnest to know on what Side <hi>Truth</hi> lies, not to satisfie
an idle Curiosity, but to discover the certain and solid
foundation, if there be any such thing, on which they
may build their Peace and Comfort, with respect to the
<hi>present life,</hi> and joyful hopes in reference to <hi>that</hi> which
may be <hi>hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this account I resolved on this <hi>Enquiry,</hi> and to
proceed in it with all the care that becomes a Lover of
Truth, in matters of so very great moment, who ought
not to suffer himself to be byass'd by his former Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor to be carried off by the Censures of the World,
nor to be possessed with a fondness for Opinions, meerly
because they are <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Old,</hi> Singular or Common.</p>
               <p>My first aim was to satisfie my self; and now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the giving true information to others, and for that
end shall lay all things candidly before them, imposing
as little on them, as on my self, who am not willing to
be deceived. And I am confident that he, who is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and willing to be informed, shall receive plain and
full <hi>Conviction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To try this Matter, I do not find it proper to appeal
to the Universal Doctrin, either of the Present, or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40791:4"/>
Church. The Fathers may be thought as partial
and incompetent Judges as the Modern Divines. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
have no weight with the Patrons of Incredulity,
they laugh at this Method, and judge it as unreasonable,
as if one would consult old Bigotted Aristotelians about
the <hi>New Philosophy.</hi> I know their regard to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
is much the same as what they have to other Books:
They read and examine it with the same boldness and
freedom, and very often with less Modesty than human
Writings: because its Assertions are plain, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
unanswerable; therefore, to shelter themselves,
and to defend their Opinions, they disown its Authority,
and cry it down as a Book which is not implicitly to be
believed more than others. Hence it is that some attack
the <hi>Authentickness</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Text;</hi> others, the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity</hi>
and <hi>Inspiration</hi> of the <hi>Pen-men:</hi> and all of them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
one way or other, to remove the only sure Light we
have to direct our Course. So they would reason us into
a fearful and troublesom uncertainty: and they make our
condition as deplorable as Persons at Sea in a dark
tempestuous Night, without Waggoner, Compass, or
Pilot.</p>
               <p>I intend not to prove the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi>
which hath been admirably well done by several,
both in this, and former Ages: I take this for granted.
But if this be too great a <hi>Postulatum,</hi> it will be sufficient
for my business to suppose it in the first rank of Books,
which it may claim, both by reason of its Antiquity,
and the things contained in <hi>it.</hi> The Authors of this Holy
Book merit Reverence and Esteem, at least as much as
<hi>Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, Epictetus, Confutius</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> and
other Ancients, whose Sentiments the World is curious
to know, and which Learned Men have been employed
to Collect, as useful to Mankind. Nay, I am willing at
present even to pass this too. I ask only (which cannot
be Justly denied) a due Attention to what is said in
Scripture, and an impartial and unbyass'd consideration
of the excellency and reasonableness of what it proposes;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40791:5"/>
for then, I am sure, that the <hi>Doctrine of Christianity</hi> will
appear divine, and true, and <hi>worthy of all acceptation:</hi>
for <hi>it</hi> shines with Evidence, as the Light which proves
and manifests <hi>it self</hi> to every one that is not <hi>blind. If our
Gospel</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) be hid, it is hid to them that are
lost,</hi> &amp;c. The finest Picture doth not look well, if it be
not set in a proper Light. Nor doth the Gospel appear
reasonable, when it is not duly represented. All the
Cavils and Objections, that are made against it, proceed
from a wrong view of it; represent it fairly, and there
is nothing more agreeable: Its Imperfections are Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and admirable Contrivances: its Foolishness is the
highest Wisdom: its seeming Absurdities and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
upon Examination, are most rational and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
consistent: its Faith is Conviction and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
In a word, it is every way <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>true,</hi>
and <hi>worthy to be received</hi> by the wisest and most perfect
Men, as I hope to make appear by these <hi>Essays,</hi> and
what are to follow hereafter, which I desire may be read
with Attention and Candour, and according to the
Method in which it is written: for Divine Truths are
in this like the Propositions of <hi>Euclid.</hi> There is a
dependency amongst them, the first must be received
before the rest can be admitted; but tho' what is
Prior in order of Nature ought to be first considered,
yet it is certain, that the same is not so fully comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as when what follows is known and understood.
Thus the Existence of a Deity is to be proved before a
Providence, and yet the Proofs of a Providence, and such
a view of it, as we may have by Reason and Revelation,
doth not only mightily confirm us in the Belief of a God,
but also very much enlarge our Idea of him: What
may be known by Nature and Reason, should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
before the Discoveries of Revelation; and yet the
Light of Revelation doth give clearer Convictions of the
former, and doth render intelligible, what before could
not indeed be denied; but yet was not well understood.
Nature and Reason may be compared to the dawnings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40791:5"/>
of the Morning, which is not to be despised; but the
Discoveries of the Scripture, resemble the Light of the
Sun when it is mounted the Horizon, which is full and
sufficient for all that is necessary to our present State.</p>
               <p>We should have begun at that <hi>Faith</hi> which is peculiar
to the Gospel, and so spared our labour in proving a
Deity and Providence, if the present growth of Atheism
had not made it necessary to establish these first. It is
true, these Subjects have of late been excellently well-handled,
to which we might have referred; but that
would have been to build upon another Man's foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
All must acknowledge, that these Subjects are
of great importance, and therefore what we offer about
them, ought to be kindly received both by those who
doubt, and those who believe; that the one may be
confirmed, and the other satisfied, in Matters that so
nearly concern them. I would not be thought to despise
some Proofs and Arguments which I have not used: Our
Essays would have run out into vast Volumes, if we
had amassed all that might have been said, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have only made choice of such things as either
have been least considered by others, or which may be
of most common use. We do not write for the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of those who have been bred in Universities, and
therefore have purposely waved what could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
without Metaphysical Notions, and the abstruse
part of Learning.</p>
               <p>We have digested our Enquiries about Faith into <hi>three
Parts,</hi> of which the present Essays make the <hi>First:</hi>
And we have been advised to Publish them separately,
to encourage the Reading of them: For, tho' those who
have most need of Information, have also generally most
leisure to Read; yet it is well known that they are also
least willing to undertake the Reading of what requires
many Hours and much Attention. Bulky Books fright
them, and they throw them by, as too great Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to their Diversions, for the most of their Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
are nothing else. But if such will not be at the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40791:6"/>
pains to read a few Sheets, they betray their Aversion
to these Truths, and do in vain pretend to excuse their
Infidelity, by want of true Conviction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Part</hi> is wholly taken up about Providence,
which is too copious a Subject to be exhausted by any;
but without the hazard of being vain or immodest, I
may say, that there is at least some things suggested,
which may both perswade the belief of a Providence,
and also satisfie mens Minds in some measure about
the Strange and Wonderful Dispensations of it, which,
not being commonly handled, we have the more largely
insisted on. In the <hi>Third and last Part,</hi> shall be considered
that <hi>Faith</hi> which is founded upon <hi>Revelation;</hi> which also
we shall indeavour to set in its true Light. Both these
<hi>Parts</hi> shall follow very soon, if it please God to assist us;
and I heartily wish, that all of them may prove Useful
to the design proposed, by helping to clear those Truths
which are of the greatest Importance.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Faith is, and hath been, the Perpetual Standard
of Righteousness from the beginning of the
World.</head>
                  <p>1. AS all <hi>Authors</hi> (whether Historians or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers)
have their <hi>peculiar Phrases</hi> and <hi>way</hi> of
<hi>Speaking,</hi> so <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>word</hi> and <hi>term</hi> proper to <hi>Sacred
Scripture.</hi> It never occurs to us in the reading of any
of the Heathen Moralists, in <hi>that sense</hi> in which we meet
with it almost in every leaf of the Holy Bible. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
as agreeable to the other Apostles, he discourses often,
and very much of <hi>Faith;</hi> so, in three several Epistles,
he asserts, that the <hi>Iust shall live by Faith:</hi> and in one of
them, he Prefaces it with an <hi>as it is written,</hi> testifying by
this, that it was no New <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40791:6"/>
was taught by the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
we find the same very <hi>words</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk,</hi>
Chap. 2. 4. whence we may conclude, that this
is a <hi>Scripture Maxim,</hi> of certain and perpetual Verity,
under every Dispensation, as well the former as the
present.</p>
                  <p>2. By the <hi>Iust,</hi> is to be understood the Good, Holy,
and Righteous; in opposition to the Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.
And <hi>to live,</hi> comprehends and must be extended
to, the whole tract and course of their Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
for to restrain it to <hi>any single,</hi> or <hi>individual
act,</hi> which hath not an Universal Influence upon the
whole Man and all its Motions, is to make the Scripture
and Inspirer of it, speak very improperly. He is not
said to Live in a place, who Lodgeth there a Night or
two; but who has his constant Residence and Abode in it.
Nor can he be said properly to live by any Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
who now and then perhaps diverteth himself with
it; but only he who makes it his profession, aim, and
study, who constantly exerciseth it, and subsisteth by it.
So when it is said that the <hi>Iust live by Faith,</hi> the meaning
is, and must be, that they always <hi>walk</hi> by <hi>Faith;</hi> they
order and frame their whole Life and Conversation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to it. It is the Principle by which they are
actuated, and which produceth all that they do. As
the Soul and Spirit give Life to the Body, excite, direct,
and determine the Actions of the whole Man, so Faith
is the Soul, Life and Spirit of a Just or Righteous Man,
the first and great Principles of his Motions, the chief
Rule and Director of his Actions, that which quickens
his Hopes, awakens his Fears, excites and curbs his
Passion, and which pusheth him forward to all that is
suitable to his Rank, Quality, and other Circumstances
in which he stands. In a word, to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> must be
to think, speak, and act by it, for Life comprehends all
this. And he who doth thus <hi>live by Faith,</hi> is truly Just,
Good, Holy, and Righteous. For if it be true that the
<hi>Iust do live by</hi> Faith, <hi>it</hi> is also true that <hi>they who live</hi> by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40791:7"/>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> are <hi>Iust.</hi> As Knowledge and Wisdom render a
Man learned and wise, so <hi>Faith</hi> makes one <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi>
and this Righteousness encreaseth according to
the proportion of our Faith; for there are degrees of
Faith as of Life; there are weaker and stronger, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and perfect in both.</p>
                  <p>3. Now that it is not peculiar to the state of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
for the <hi>Iust</hi> to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> but that they did so,
under the Law, and before it, doth further appear from
what the Apostle writes in the <hi>Eleventh Chapter</hi> of the
<hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where, by a long enumeration of
particular instances, he proves that all the Righteous,
even up to <hi>Abel,</hi> that is, ever since the Fall, did walk by
<hi>Faith;</hi> and that <hi>Faith</hi> was the source and spring of both
their Common, and Extraordinary Actions. And he
might have ascended higher, and shewed, that even in
the state of Innocence, <hi>Faith</hi> was appointed the Life and
Soul of Righteousness: for that Command which was
given to our first Parents, about the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi>
in the <hi>midst</hi> of the <hi>Garden,</hi> was to exercise their <hi>Faith,</hi>
as their Transgression was a failure of <hi>Faith</hi> as well as
of Obedience. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
and in the first Part of that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> pursues the
same Truth against the Bigotted Jews and Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
For to convince them of their Error, in expecting
to be <hi>Iustified</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> He shews clearly,
that, before the <hi>Law</hi> was in being, <hi>Men</hi> were accounted
<hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> by reason of their <hi>Faith,</hi>
and therefore that <hi>Faith</hi> was the permanent and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Standard or Rule both for measuring Mens Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and for obtaining their <hi>Iustification.</hi> Because
<hi>Abraham</hi> was an eminent Example of <hi>Faith,</hi> therefore
he was not only <hi>reputed Righteous,</hi> but had the peculiar
honour to be called the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> and the <hi>Father of
the Faithful,</hi> in all succeeding Generations. And all who
believe, and <hi>live</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> are stiled the <hi>Children</hi> of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of his Honour and Privileges. Upon
which account they are also named the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40791:7"/>
the <hi>holy Seed,</hi> the <hi>righteous Generation,</hi> in opposition to
the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Belial,</hi> the <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Reprobate,</hi> who are
branded with the Character of <hi>Vnbelievers, Children</hi> of
<hi>Vnbelief, Persons</hi> without <hi>Faith,</hi> as the <hi>Original</hi> bears, which
is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be said on this Head, but it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appears from what hath been said, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the peculiar Dialect, both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New
Testament, Faith</hi> and <hi>Holiness, Believing</hi> and <hi>to be Iust,</hi> or
to <hi>live righteously,</hi> are used indifferently, as <hi>reciprocal
Phrases,</hi> which import or inferr one another. And the
reason of this Dialect is, because, according to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
of the Scripture, that which goes under the
Name of <hi>Faith,</hi> is the first Principle which actuates a
a good or just Man, and that the Goodness or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
which is acceptable to God, is only the Effects
or Expressions of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which naturally and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
follow it, as the Light doth the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Now, before I proceed further, it is fit to make a
little Pause; and it may be convenient to represent here
the Obligation which lieth upon all, who own the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Scripture, to entertain those <hi>Phrases</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi>
with respect and reverence.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>They</hi> ought to esteem them not only Sacred, but
Exact and Just, and the fittest to convey true Notions
into our Minds. A Wise Man can express his own
Thoughts best. And sure none can be supposed more
qualified to know the most apposite words for expressing
Truth, than the Spirit of Truth, or they who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
by it. <hi>They,</hi> who recede from the <hi>Phrases</hi> of any
Author, do also generally differ from his Sentiments,
and give others occasion to mistake them: For the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and repeated Phrases, which one has used con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
do give the greatest Light to the Discovery of
his Thoughts: For, if he had not perceived or fansied
some Propriety in those <hi>Phrases,</hi> for representing what
he would be at, he would not have been so fond of
them, nor would he so constantly have used them, even
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40791:8"/>
as an exact and skilful Painter, observeth carefully, both
the Strokes and Mixtures, which are fittest to shadow
out the Colours and Figures he would represent.
But even abstracting from the Divine Authority of
Scripture, and the peculiar Inspiration of the Pen-men,
it is very great Immodesty to offer to correct and amend
their Expressions; as if any now a-days could express
their Thoughts, Notions and Sentiments better, than
they themselves were capable to do, especially on Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
with which they were well acquainted, and which
they knew better than other Men, by reason of their
Profound Meditation, the Purity of their Minds, and
the Integrity of their Lives: These very things (if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and immediate Inspiration will not be allowed
them) could qualifie them to teach the Nature and Acts
of a Holy Life, or true Righteousness far better than
others. All the Heathen Philosophers came short of
their Perfection, and therefore are not so good Masters
of Morality: for <hi>Moral Truths</hi> are not like <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
ones,</hi> to be learned by Reading and Study: The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of those comes best, nay, can only be had by
serious and continued Practice. A good Man Unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
has a deeper sense of Christian Morality, and can
discourse more lively and reasonably of it, than the
greatest Scholar, who has only the Theory. And there
be some Expressions which seem mean and silly to the
last, which the other feels to be just and Emphatick;
as what that Man esteems lofty and Sublime, this Man
Undervalues; for the one knows and thoroughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
the Subject he speaks of, which the other does
not. To return, all the Disciples of any Sect, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Authors and Founders of them, and love to
speak in their Language, and according to their Dialect.
An Aristotelian will huff, and grow very angry, if the
<hi>Cant</hi> of his Schools be mocked; and the well-bred Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian
will not be much more calm and easie, when the
Terms and Principles of his Philosophy are played upon.
Now ought not Christians to be much more tender of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40791:8"/>
the Divine Phrases which the Prophets and Apostles
have used to set forth the Secret and Sublime Principles
of that Life, which renders us acceptable to God, and
makes us to be reputed Righteous in his sight? Which
Phrases were neither blindly hit upon, nor affected to
amuse, but wisely chosen as most proper; because both
clear and comprehensive. Therefore to mock <hi>Faith,</hi> and
to turn <hi>Believing</hi> into Ridicule, to explode the Phrase,
and pretend to give better, is insufferable Insolence, and
a high Affront to the Apostles, and Prophets, and that
Spirit which did inspire them. Christians ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
this: to bear with <hi>it</hi> is not Meekness; but want of
Zeal and Courage; it is a lazy treachery, as when one
beholds the Rights of his Country or Society invaded
and betrayed, and yet holds his Peace. It does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Children of the Family to assume the Liberty,
or rather licentiousness of Enemies and Aliens, and if
the Wantonness of their Humour prompt them to it, it
is their Duty who have the Charge of the Family, to
Chastise them into better Manners.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Faith as Opposed to Doubting.</head>
                  <p>1. WHatever regard be due to <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi>
there is a greater due to the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. Men are no better than <hi>Parrots,</hi> if they

thing therefore to be considered is, what is <hi>this Faith</hi>
which the Just should live by, which is so much magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and spoken of in Scripture, which is now, and
which is said always to have been the Principle of a holy
and spiritual Life.</p>
                  <p>2. In order to this, I resolve not either to consider
the <hi>Definitions</hi> of others, or to give a <hi>New one</hi> of my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40791:9"/>
own, the <hi>common Definitions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> would hamper me
too much: If I were tied to them, I could not have
the freedom of my design, which is, to make a clear,
full, and ample Description of <hi>Faith.</hi> This is not to cast
a slight upon any of the received <hi>Definitions;</hi> which, as
they are placed in the <hi>common Catechisms,</hi> do serve well
enough to point out some of the special and chief Acts of
<hi>Faith,</hi> but which yet are not sufficient to give a full or
clear <hi>Idea</hi> of it. Nor will I attempt to amend them, or
to establish a better one; for it is not easie to make a
good <hi>Definition</hi> of such a very comprehensive thing as
<hi>Faith</hi> is: nor is such a thing well understood by any
Definition, as by taking a particular and separate view
of those things which it comprehends. It is but a very
confused Notion of <hi>Grammer, Logick,</hi> or any other
<hi>Science</hi> which Youth have by the <hi>Definitions</hi> which are
first taught them; they then only rightly understand the
Nature and Use of these <hi>Sciences,</hi> when they have gone
through them.</p>
                  <p>And as I am not to trouble my self with the <hi>common
Definitions,</hi> so neither will I intangle my self, or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with the <hi>ordinary Distinctions</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> such as <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Faith,</hi> an <hi>Historical Faith,</hi> a <hi>Faith of Miracles,</hi> &amp;c.
For tho' there be something in Scripture which gives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to these Names and Distinctions, yet the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of them would give little light to our Enquiry,
for they suppose the Knowledge of Faith which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after, and are designed to mark out some certain
degrees of Faith, rather than to instruct the Nature of
it, which we mainly aim at. For my purpose is, by the
light and guidance of Scripture alone, to search out
this <hi>Faith,</hi> which is necessary to entitle one to be Just
and Righteous before God, and upon which account it
must be that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>without Faith it is impossible to
please him,</hi> Heb. ii. 6. And to prevent all dangerous Errour,
that we may not mistake one sort of Faith for another, a
Faith which cannot, or doth not render Just, for one that
doth, we shall have still in our Eye this necessary Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40791:9"/>
3. To proceed then, In the first place, I find <hi>Faith</hi>
taken in opposition to <hi>Doubting:</hi> So it is taken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.
and in several other places. And in this sense <hi>Faith</hi> is
much the same with Conscience, and is an <hi>inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
or Perswasion of Mind</hi> concerning what is true
or false, good and evil, lawful and unlawful. Which
Perswasion or inward Conviction, is the first Rule or
Standard by which one's Integrity and Uprightness is to
be measured; and therefore it is as necessary for the Just
to live by this Faith, as for a Square to have four equal
sides: both Texts of Scripture, and the Nature of the
thing require it. The true and primitive Character of
a Just Man is to be Conscientious, to follow the Dictates
of his Mind, and to order his Life and Actions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what he knows and believes to be right. A Just
Man must be Upright, and there is no Uprightness if
the outward and inward-man do not keep touches, if
there be no Correspondence betwixt them, if the Mouth
contradict the Heart, and the Life and Actions be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
to the inward Light and Sentiments.</p>
                  <p>This Faith is as the Eye by which we see and know how
to order our Steps; it is as the Light to shew the Way
in which we should walk, and not to follow it, or to go
contrary to it, is great Perverseness, and the Character
of a Wicked Man. As the Spirit is the Principle of Life,
and Life of Motion; so this Faith is the first Principle
of a good Life, and Men are to be reckoned good or bad
as they walk according to it: He is a bad Man who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
it, and he is no good Man whose Actions do not
flow from it. The Motions of a Puppet or Engine may
be both Regular and Useful, but they cannot be reckoned
Natural; because they proceed not from a Principle of
Life, but from Artificial Springs. So tho' one's Actions
be never so plausible, fair or useful to others, yet they
are not good; nor is he, who doth them Just, if they
proceed from any other principle than this Faith, that is,
an inward Perswasion of their being just and good, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and reasonable, <hi>for whatsoever is not of Faith</hi> (saith the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40791:10"/>
Apostle) <hi>is sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. Hence it is that we see
some in Scripture branded with the Character of ill Men,
and others denied the Approbation of being good, whose
Actions were outwardly good and commendable, because
they did what they did, for other Reasons, and upon
another account, than the intrinsick goodness of those
things, or their own Perswasion of it.</p>
                  <p>4. All the Actions of every one are to be Approved or
Condemned, with a regard to this Faith, and by vertue
of it, things, in themselves good and lawful, become
evil, and what is evil loseth a part of its malignity.
Thus the <hi>Eating of Flesh,</hi> which in it self is a lawful and
innocent Action, is a damnable Sin to him who has the
least doubt whether it be lawful; and what is clean
turns unclean to him who thinks it so, as is excellently
discoursed in that fore-cited Chapter. So on the other
hand, we find God himself excusing <hi>Abimelech</hi> for taking
<hi>Sarah</hi> into his House, because <hi>he did it in the integrity of
his heart;</hi> that is, he was ignorant of her being another
Man's Wife. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perfection of the Saints
was the more pardonable, because he verily thought he
ought to do many things against the Name of Jesus:
<hi>I was before</hi> (saith he) <hi>a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and
injurious, but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in
unbelief;</hi> that is, without Faith, or the perswasion of
the evil of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
                  <p>But then it is to be remembred, That this Faith which
hath such Influence upon our Actions, and which is so
Essential to a Just Man, is not Fancy or Imagination, nor
a light or hasty Perswasion. <hi>Let every man be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in his own mind,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and
therefore our Faith and Perswasion ought to be well-grounded,
the effect of serious Enquiry and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it may give true and certain Direction, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it may be still said that we are regardless of Right
and Wrong, Truth or Falshood, Good and Evil, which
is inconsistent with the Character of a perfectly Just
Man. A wise Architect doth not work at random, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40791:10"/>
by Plumb and Rule; but then he is first careful that his
Plumb and Rule be right and exact; for without this,
he cannot sincerely intend to have his work perfect. So
a Just man carefully studieth both a Conformity betwixt
his Actions and his inward Sentiments, and betwixt these
and truth, and the stable Rule of Right and wrong,
Good and Evil. To act contrary to inward Conviction
is to offend wilfully, and the height of Wickedness; but
it is the next degree to it to be careless whether we
offend or not, whether we do Good or Evil, which we
are guilty of, when we are not at any pains to adjust
our Perswasion to Truth, to know the right, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our selves of what is good, lawful, and fit to be
done. The same reason which makes it Just, and our
Duty to act according to our Knowledge, and inward
Perswasion, or to do the Good we know, obligeth us to
search out the real Good that is, that there may be no
Errour in our Perswasion, nor Crookedness in our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
and then only our Thoughts can justifie our
Actions, when, by Diligence and due Care, we have
endeavoured to make our Thoughts just and true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Nature of things; for without this, we
cannot be <hi>fully perswaded in our Minds,</hi> as the Apostle
enjoineth; the assurance of Faith is wanting, which is
necessary to dispel all doubts, and to establish our goings.
<hi>Happy is he</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul) that condemneth not himself in
that thing which he alloweth,</hi> Rom. 14. 22. by which he
gives us to understand, that our Heart must approve
our Actions; our Minds must Judge, that the ways
we take are right, otherwise we stand Self-condemned.
Now the Judgment is not Just which is not certain,
which is rashly or hastily pronounced, before a strict
Examination, or a due Attention to all the Proofs and
Evidences which can be brought for clearing the Cause.
There is still place for Doubting, when necessary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the proper Means have not been used for right
and sufficient Information. And as Doubting defileth the
Man, and polluteth all his Actions, so it is uneasie to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40791:11"/>
Mind: As Darkness, in which when one walketh, it
maketh him Apprehensive, full of Fears and Jealousies,
going forwards and backwards, to the right and left,
without any steady course; because he has no certainty
of his way. What is translated a <hi>Double-minded Man,</hi>
ought to be a <hi>Doubtful Man,</hi> one that has not the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Faith; and such an one (saith St. <hi>Iames) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
in all his ways, he wavereth like a wave of the Sea,
which is driven with the wind and tossed,</hi> Jam. 1. 6, 8.
Fleeting and Inconstancy, change of Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
regarding Events and outward Advantages, is
at least a sure sign and evidence that the Person has not
attained to a true Faith, or full Perswasion of his Duty,
of what is good, lawful, or necessary; for Faith gives
a chearful confidence, it makes one constant, and to be
always the same; because Truth and the Nature of
things change not.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Matter; By <hi>Faith</hi> here we are to
understand a true Knowledge of the Nature of things,
a clear Conviction of Truth, and a hearty full Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
of Good and Evil, Lawful and Unlawful,
which every one should endeavour after as much as
possible: And also every one ought to live answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to the measure which he hath attained of it.
Who doth thus, so far he is to be reckoned Good
and Just; for he hath no Perverseness in his temper, no
crooked Byass in his Constitution, but sheweth an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of Mind without guile or hypocrisie, and a
regular Will, which offers no Prejudice, but which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to every person and thing what is due.</p>
                  <p>6. Righteousness begins here: A tendency towards
this Faith is the first Symptom and Appearance, as well
as Motion, of a Just and Good Life, which like the
Natural, upon its first Production, may be weak and
languid; but which, like it too, groweth if it be not
stifled: and as it groweth, so it acquireth strength
and vigour, until it arrive at Perfection. The first
moments of the Morning are hardly distinguished from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40791:11"/>
black Night; but it creepeth on insensibly, until the
whole Hemisphere be enlightened. So <hi>the Paths of the
just</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) are as the shining light, which shineth
more and more until the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4. 18.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of Faith as opposed to Atheism, and how a belief
of the Existence of God, is necessary to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the certain Rule of Moral Actions.</head>
                  <p>1. TO go on with <hi>Faith,</hi> which in the Second place
is opposed to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and so it is a <hi>firm Belief
of the existence of a Deity,</hi> a certain, full, and clear Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that God is, and a sense of those Attributes which
are necessarily included in the true Idea of God. <hi>He</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>who cometh to God, must believe that he
is, and that he is a Rewarder of them who diligently seek
him,</hi> Heb. 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>2. The Faith, spoken of in the former Essay, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to enquire after this; and this we are now upon,
enforceth the reasonableness and necessity of that; such
is the relation betwixt them, and so mutually do they
support one another. Not to <hi>Criticize Grammatically</hi>
upon the words [<hi>Lawful, and Vnlawful</hi>] which suppose
a Superiour, even Good and Evil depend much, if not
altogether, upon the Knowledge of God, and are to be
measured by a Relation to him: the Nature of these will
be found to vary very much, according as the Existence
or Non-existence of a Deity is established. If Man have
no Superiour, none to reward or punish his Actions, then
I suppose the Government of himself is Arbitrary, as the
chusing Employments is now thought to be; his chief
business is to please himself; and consequently, Good
and Evil are only to be considered with relation to one's
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40791:12"/>
self and his present Interest; which shall make as many
different notions of Good and Evil, as there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Humours, Inclinations, and Interests among Men.
Good and Evil shall in that case have no certain Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
by which to be measured, but shall be of as mutable
a Nature, as Honesty and Dishonesty in a divided Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
where the same thing is both Honesty and
Knavery, in the Judgment of the different Parties, and
where the same Person shall be both reputed a Hero and a
Villain. Then no act can leave a guilt, and better or
worse, well or ill done is to be measured by the Event
and Success. And tho' Moral Laws can be shewed to
have a Foundation in Nature, yet the transgression of
them, for a particular Pleasure or Conveniency, will be
thought no more culpable than to level a Mountain, to
cut the course of a River; to force Water to ascend, and
such like, which seem to be equal Violences to Nature;
so that he who has a Liberty to do the one, may also
do the other.</p>
                  <p>But the case is quite altered, if there be a God, for
then we are no more at our own disposal than Servants:
He who made us, has an absolute dominion over us; and
all our care ought to be to please him: His Will is a Law,
and the perpetual Standard of Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p>3. However it is certain, that, (according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
none are reckoned Just or Righteous, but such as
act with a continued regard to God, which sometimes
is expressed by the <hi>fear of God,</hi> sometimes by <hi>walking with
him,</hi> or <hi>before him,</hi> and having the <hi>heart perfect or upright
with God.</hi> When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pleaded his Integrity, it was
in these words, <hi>Remember, Lord, how I have walked before
thee with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good
in thy sight.</hi> Upon this account, <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
Lot, Ioseph, Ioshua, Iob,</hi> and all the other Worthies in
Scripture are put into the Catalogue of the Just. And
granting that there is a God, it will necessarily follow
that he only is a Just Man, who sets God before him,
who makes him the end and measure of his Actions, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40791:12"/>
the very design of whose Life is to please God: Nor
can there be a more proper Character of an Unjust Man,
than that by which the Wicked and Ungodly are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in Scripture, Viz. <hi>They have not the fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes, God is not in all their thoughts, they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God;</hi> that is, they have no consideration of him, nor
regard unto him. He is not Just who doth not render to
every Man what is due. If one keep squares with others
never so well, if he deal never so fairly with them, yet
if he, at the same time, be untowardly, or undutiful to
his Parents, he cannot properly be called Just. So let
one possess all that is called Vertue towards Men, yet if
God have not due Acknowledgment from him, that
Man is neither Just nor Righteous. Nay, as he is not a
good and faithful Servant, who does not sincerely intend
his Master's Honour and Interest in all he doth; so, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scripture) none can claim the titles of
Just or Righteous, or have them bestowed upon them,
who do not all for God's sake, whose chief Motive to
do Good and forbear Evil is, because the one is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, and the other offensive to him.</p>
                  <p>4. Wherefore those Divines are much to be censured,
who recommend Morality, and a good Life chiefly by
other Topicks than these: for they are either ignorant
of the Principles and Philosophy of the Scripture, or they
discard the same to establish a better, and more plausible
Scheme of things. They who profess to believe the
Divine Authority of the Scripture, ought also to think
that they are incapable to correct its Principles, or to
establish what is more Just, or Wise; and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
better shew their Learning and Judgment, than by
making it appear that they fully understand the Scope
and Doctrine of the Scripture. But whatever Opinion
they have of the Scripture, seeing their Profession obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them to teach it, they ought to do it candidly; that
is, without mixing their own Fansies and Opinions. If
one was appointed to read a Lecture of either Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telian,
or Cartesian Philosophy, he could not be said to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40791:13"/>
execute his office with ingenuity, who did not represent
them purely according to their Authors, but who did
blend them with other Principles. A righteousness built
on the Principles of Self-love, Honour, Conveniency,
Pleasure, and such other Motives, is a Righteousness built
on a Heathen Foundation, which cannot please God, no
more than we do think our selves obliged by Acts and
Deeds, which had no regard to us. I would not be
thought by this to exclude all respect to our Private and
Personal Interest; nor yet to disprove a humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Enquiry into the reasonableness or excellency of the
Divine Laws: But as the surest Proof, the clearest and
shortest Demonstration of this, is drawn from the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
Nature, Will, and Authority of God; Just as
we best understand the Wisdom and Reasons of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by considering what the King is, and what
he proposes to himself. So the only design of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
should be to encourage our Obedience, to render
it more ready and chearful by convincing us, that he,
who has the Authority over us, employs it most for our
Advantage, that so the Servitude, which we owe by
Nature, may become voluntary, that we may be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of revolting: and tho' we could be free, yet we
may chuse rather to be Servants for ever, like that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
under the Law, who gave his Ear to be bored
thorow, preferring (out of love to his Master) perpetual
Bondage to his Freedom.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether it should move Indignation or
Pity most, to see how pleasantly Men delude themselves
with Suppositions of Mankind; their starting up free
without all obligation, except to consult their own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Convenience. Some, who make these Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
deny a Deity, and proceed without any Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of God. Others own a Deity, but they found
our Obligation to him only on his possessing Wisdom,
Reason and Knowledge in greater measure. But this
state of Nature is a Dream and meer Romance, and all
their Suppositions are wild, extravagant, against Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40791:13"/>
and Nature, if Mankind had another beginning, if
we all owe our being to another; for then we are not
free, our Creation subjects us to him. We ought in the
first place to regard his Will, which is a Law of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible
Obligation, not by vertue only of the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of it, or the conveniency it brings with it, but by
vertue of the Authority enjoining it. He is an open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
who has no regard to this Authority at all, and he,
who preferrs any thing to it, or has any other thing in
greater consideration, has broke the first and greatest
chain of Justice; he is not truly Loyal, but waits an
opportunity to revolt. Tho' Rewards and Punishments
be proposed, yet they are not intended for weakening
the Authority of the Supream Lord; but to preserve it
from contempt, and to heighten our regard for it. Which
Rewards we ought to consider, and have always before
us, both that we may know the Nature and Importance
of those things to which they are annexed; and also, that
by them we may be the more capable to serve and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God, to whom we owe infinite Service, if it were
in our Power.</p>

was laid.</p>
                  <p>1. And as it is sure and certain, so it is clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
This is not a Truth which lies hid, or myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
wrap'd up, which requires depth of Judgment,
vast Learning, assiduous Study, and great Pains to the
digging it up: We may come at this, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
long and dangerous Voyages, without the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Study of Languages, without turning over many
Volumes, without the trouble of consulting all the Wise
and Learned, and collecting their Sentiments. This lies
open to every Man of common Sense and Judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is what every Man should know, believe, and
understand. The Necessaries of Life are common every
where, and may be had in every Country by a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Industry, which is no ways uneasie. What must be
fetch'd from afar, with much expence and labour, doth
rather please Fansie, than serve Nature: So they are only
<hi>Indian Trifles,</hi> for amusing and sustaining a vain Curiosity,
which for the most part are returned to us by the Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Travels of Learned Men. And tho' they produce
also things Substantial, to give solid Delight and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
yet even of these it must be said, that they are
not absolutely necessary to give us Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to establish this Faith, which is the Ground-work
and Foundation of all. What is necessary and sufficient
for this, is obvious and at hand, that all may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excuse; for which cause I may apply these words of
Moses, <hi>This is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It
is not in Heaven, that thou shouldst say, who shall go for us to
Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40791:14"/>
Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou shouldst say, who shall
go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear
it and do it; but this word of Faith is very nigh unto thee, in
thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou mayst do it,</hi> Deut.
30. 12. That is, the Evidence of this Faith depends not
on the knowledge of what is transacted in these upper
Regions, nor on what passeth in the remote Parts of the
World; but the Evidence of it lies in every Man's own
Bosom: His own Mind (if he hearken to it) can make
him conscious of this Truth: That thing within him
(whatever it be) which makes him sensible of other things,
can convince him of this.</p>
                  <p>2. Because I intend to speak intelligibly to all, what
the meanest Capacity may comprehend, I will not run
into the Philosophical Debate about <hi>innate Ideas;</hi> I will
not enquire, whether all be born with an Idea of God,
nor of what force that is, to demonstrate his Existence;
but whether the Mind of Man come to the World void
of all Notions, or prepossessed with Principles, by which
it is to examine all things afterwards: it is certain, that
it is capable of discerning things when duely set before
it; as the Eye is capable of distinguishing objects and
colours in a clear light, and at a due distance. If the
Mind cannot refuse an assent to some things, if upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
representation of them it owns a Conviction, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without violence work it self into a denial; it is all
a matter, whether this be from <hi>innate Principles,</hi> or the
<hi>natural Evidence</hi> of these things themselves. And that
there are some things clearer and more evident than <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi>
it self, appears from this, that even <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Demonstration</hi> proceeds upon the supposition of
this, and requires them as <hi>Postulata.</hi> Now the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
have only considered such <hi>Axioms</hi> as relate to
Lines, Figures, and Bodies: There are other <hi>Principles</hi>
as self-evident as these; whence comes that the Voice of
Nature is Uniform, and that there is a common consent
of Mankind: Wherefore it is no <hi>Paradox</hi> to say, that
the Existence of God, and the Principles of Morality, is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40791:15"/>
not only as certain, but more evident than the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi>
of <hi>Euclid,</hi> because the generality of Mankind have
always easily (by the very bent of their Nature) given
an assent unto them, and that the greatest Barbarity and
Corruption could never entirely deface them. Some
Mens Genius is not capable of Mathematicks, but all are
capable or Morality; and the reason of it is so plain, that
every unbyass'd Mind assents to it.</p>
                  <p>That there are Debates about some Moral Principles,
and particularly this of a Deity, is no more an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
against the Evidence thereof, than the Arguments
of <hi>Zeno</hi> against the Possibility of Motion, or the Sophistry
of the Scepticks against the certainty of these things
which fall under our senses. There are some things
which a Child can distinguish as well as any of riper
Years, and which a Country Clown may Judge of as
well as a Philosopher; and consequently common Sense
and Reason may be known from the one as well as the
other, nay, very often better: for the one speaketh what
his Mind naturally dictates, whereas the other being
amused with the Notions he hath read, which his Head
always runs upon; He discourseth according to these,
and so perverteth his Natural Reason. The most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Person can at first sight distinguish <hi>Natural Things</hi>
from <hi>Artificial,</hi> and without hesitation, without waiting
a deduction of <hi>Logical Inserences</hi> is presently convinced,
that both the one and the other has a cause, and did not
spring from themselves. None was ever so sensless as to
think a House was built without Hands; and any of
common sense seeth, that <hi>Natural Things</hi> far excelleth
these of <hi>Art,</hi> being more curiously wrought, more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
contrived, being more beautiful, serving to more
uses; and in a word, every way more perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leave Men to the freedom of their own reason, they
would as readily believe a God, as that a House had a
Builder, or a Watch an Artificer.</p>
                  <p>3. Some will not yield that there are, or can be real
Atheists; because it implies such absurdity. But we see
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40791:15"/>
daily instances of Mens swallowing very gross Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Nay, there is hardly any absurdity which some or
other has not received; which should teach the wisest to
walk with fear, and to preserve their reason carefully.
If there be no Atheists, some take a great deal of Pains
to no purpose; for they are at much ado to perswade
us that they themselves are, and to bring others to be
Atheists.</p>
                  <p>But as I see no reason to doubt that there are such, tho'
very much reason that there should be none. So Mens
Athèism proceeds either, 1<hi>st.</hi> From their Vitiousness,
which first breeds in them a dislike of God, and then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
them to dispute his Providence, and at last his Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.
Just as they who are embarked in some Design,
which makes them dread the King, first Quarrel with
his Government, and then deny his right and title. Or,
2<hi>dly.</hi> It arises from the Difficulties which they meet with
in the Contemplation of his Nature and Attributes;
because they cannot clear or comprehend these, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they deny his Being, thinking it better to deny what
is plain and evident, than to own their Ignorance, or the
shortness of their Reason, than which nothing can be
more unreasonable, as we may have occasion to shew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
Is it reasonable to deny plain and common
things, because there are some things without our reach?
Shall I put out my Eyes because they fail me in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars?
because they do not reach beyond the Clouds,
nor penetrate into the <hi>Secrets of Nature?</hi> Difficulties
which are insuperable may put a stop to further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
and make it reasonable not to determine any
thing positively in these Matters where we find them: but
they can never make it reasonable to deny what was
clearly perceived before these occurred.</p>
                  <p>Tho' the Divine Essence he incomprehensible, because
infinite, and because it does not fall under our sense, tho'
the ways and Workings of God be unsearchable and past
finding out, yet plainer and more certain Evidences can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be desired of united Wisdom and Power, than what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40791:16"/>
we have continually before us; nay, carry about with us
in our own selves. As soon as one casts his Eye seriously
upon them, he shall be convinced: He that considers
them, shall acknowledge them; and therefore a Third
Cause of Atheism is want of Consideration and Reflection.
Some are Atheists, because they do not think; their
Souls are always asleep, and they never open the Eyes of
their Mind to behold, by a wise regard, the many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
of Omniscient Power, the beautiful Scenes, the
curious and admirable contrivances of Almighty Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
with which the World is filled. They are like
these sensual, dull, and uninquisitive Souls, which creep
about the Palaces of Princes, on the account of the Meat
and Drink, which is to be had there in plenty. They
mind nothing but the crambing their Bellies, and are
altogether insensible of the <hi>Stately Magnificence,</hi> the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Architecture,</hi> the <hi>fine Sculpture</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> which
draws Strangers thither from all Parts of the World.
He, who leads such a life, should be set to graze with
the Beasts, for his life is not much better than theirs,
and his Soul seems to be altogether sensitive.</p>
                  <p>It is the Property of Man to think: his Dignity above
the other Creatures lies in a power of discerning and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
things, their Nature, Ends, and Uses, their
relation to each other, their cause and contrivance, and
what else may enlarge the Mind with Wisdom and
Knowledge to which he bends (when free) as naturally
as a Stone to the Earth. He, who does not employ his
Thoughts these ways, abdicates the Dignity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and he, who thus carefully maintains it, will be
full of God, if I may so speak, God will be in all his
thoughts, for he shall see him every where, before him,
behind him, on every side, and in every thing. As the
foolish <hi>Iews</hi> asked a sign of Jesus Christ, when according
to their Hypotheses, and the Supposition of their Law
and Prophets which they themselves believed, every
word he spoke, and every work he did was a Sign. So
some unreasonably demand a Proof or Demonstration
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40791:16"/>
of a Deity, whilst they walk in the midst of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and do tread on them every step. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see his invisible Essence, yet upon the first opening
our Eyes, we discern unquestionable Effects of his Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Attributes: And if they do not affect us, because
they are common and ordinary, it bewrays our want of
Judgment and Consideration; for the excellency of a
thing lies not in its being rare and singular, but in the
design, contrivance, and usefulness. Is the Art of a
Watch less to be regarded, or doth the Memory of the
first Inventor deserve less honour, because now adays
every body carries one in his Pocket; and that perhaps
some of no great capacity are taught to work them.</p>

                  <p>1. GEnerals do not much affect us, nor are things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
known by a general view of them, we
then see and understand them best, when we consider
each apart by it self. The World is too large a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to be taken up at once; we will therefore descend
to particulars, and shall begin at home. Take a view but
of the outward make and figure of the Body of Man;
Consider the variety of Parts, the Symmetry, Situation
and Proportion, either in respect to the whole, or to
each other; the firmness of the Feet, the strength of the
Legs, the well-compacted thickness of the Thighs, the
stateliness of the Trunk, the force of the Arms, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and innumerable uses of the Hand, the comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and beauty of the Face, the majesty of the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and the ornament of the Hair. The finest Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and most curious Statuaries think they cannot shew
their Skill better, than to imitate these, and tho' the
best imitation of them be very rude in Comparison with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40791:17"/>
the Original, yet even these rude Counterfeits have been
much admired, and have procured much Honour and
Fame to those who made them. Now if the Copy be
admired, what doth the Original deserve? If the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
or Statue shew Art and Skill, shall the Original be
ascribed to chance? Is it not more reasonable to think
that it is the work of some wise and excellent Hand?</p>
                  <p>2. Especially if we penetrate into the Inward frame
and texture, which is altogether unimitable: none was
ever so mad as to attempt it. When the outward co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the Skin, which also is admirable, being a Net
of Nerves curiously interwoven, when this (I say) is
laid aside, what a wonderful Contrivance appears of
Bones, Muscles, Arteries, Nerves, and other Vessels,
which both astonish the wisest, and also afford them
matter of curious Enquiry. Since the Beginning of the
World all the wise and curious have been prying into
the Body of Man, Dissecting and Anatomizing the Parts
of it. Some have spent their whole life in considering
but one particular Part; and yet after so many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years, there is no perfect discovery, either of the
whole, or almost of any part. There is a <hi>terra incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita</hi>
even in this <hi>little World.</hi> As there are at this day better
Anatomists than whom former Ages could boast off: So
the most Skilful do acknowledge ingenuously, that they
discern neither all the Parts of this admirable Machine,
nor yet all the true Uses of those Parts which have been
discovered. All the Functions of the Brain and Spleen are
not yet understood; and it is but meer Conjecture what
is said of several others. Is it not then against common
sense to ascribe to any thing but perfect Wisdom, what
is thus above the reach of the wisest Men, and what puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles
them to comprehend!</p>
                  <p>3. To give further Conviction of this truth, <hi>let Life,
Motion,</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> be considered. What admirable and
exquisite Wisdom doth appear in the frame and disposal
of the <hi>Senses!</hi> As in a City invested with Enemies, and
in danger to be betrayed, it is necessary to advert to all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40791:17"/>
the Motions of those within, and to keep Watch at all
the <hi>Ramparts,</hi> and other places proper for discovering the
Advances and dangerous Approaches of the Enemy. So
it is necessary to the preservation of the Body, that both
its outward and inward state be perfectly understood,
that all the Motions within, and all Applications without
be felt, that it may be presently known what are hurtful,
and what convenient, what should be cherished, and what
prevented; wherefore we see that the <hi>Organs</hi> of this
<hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Feeling</hi> are posted every where throughout the
Body; so that the least disturbance within, and the
slightest touch without, even in the Extremities, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
perceived. <hi>Tasting</hi> being designed for distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Meats, and for discerning what is agreeable; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Instrument of this <hi>Sense</hi> is the <hi>fore-part</hi> of the
Tongue, which lies at the very Gates of the first entry
or passage to the Stomach, to secure against what is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable:
For if the Faculty of <hi>Tasting</hi> had been placed
more inwards, the disgorging unsavoury things should
have been very incommodious. Because all the ends and
purposes of <hi>Smelling</hi> may be served by <hi>one Organ,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no more, but that is curiously formed, and
admirably sitted to receive the insensible Particles, which
evaporate from all Material Substances, whether animate
or inanimate, natural or composed. However the <hi>Organ</hi>
of <hi>this Sense</hi> is grosser in Man, than in some other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
because they require it far more exquisite. For
Example, If the Dog had not this <hi>Sense</hi> in a nicer mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
than Man, he would not be worth keeping; for
then he could neither trace out his Master's footsteps,
nor yet find out where the Partridge feeds, or the Hare
has her Seat, which certainly never happened by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.
If this be not Design, we may make Design
and Chance all one; for it is impossible to distinguish
them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>two other Senses</hi> being by far the most Delightful
and Profitable, therefore each has <hi>two Organs,</hi> most wisely
situated, and most admirably contrived to answer the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40791:18"/>
purposes of these two Faculties. The Fabrick and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Eye is so curious, that never any yet did
consider it without wonder and astonishment. This is
the foundation of the <hi>Opticks,</hi> which is the most pleasant
and curious part of Mathematicks. Upon which account,
I must say, That if there be Mathematicians who are
Atheists, they are of all others most inexcusable: For
seeing Vision, and the Fabrick and Motion of the Eye, by
which it is performed, is according to the strictest Rules
of Mathematicks, and that he must be a Master of
that Art, who can unfold the Method and Manner of
Vision, and explain the Reasons of it. Is it not the
height of Impudence? Is it not a Violence to common
Sense? Is it not to contradict and baffle Demonstration
it self, either to think or say that Vision was contrived,
or the Eye framed without Wisdom, or that the Author
thereof was not skilled in the Nature of Light, the Rules
of Motion, the Doctrine of Refraction and Reflexion,
without which the Eye had been no Eye, nor Vision ever
effectuated? To secure this necessary Organ from danger,
it is lodged in a well adapted <hi>bony Orbite;</hi> and because
only a Body of a Spherical Figure can move easily within
another, especially when the whole space is to be filled
up, therefore the Eye is Spherical, which is the only Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
capable of those many Motions which are necessary
for discerning the various Objects which surround us;
and both to facilitate these Motions, and for performing
them rightly, it is tied by various Muscles, interwoven
with many Nerves; by the means of which, it moves up
and down and to either side easily. These Muscles are
also so situate, that one is a kind of curb to the motion
of the other, lest the Eye should be in hazard of being
renversed: Moreover, they serve to keep the Eye fixed
upon Objects, as long as there is occasion to look at them.
The Eye-lids are not only for a cover when we are asleep;
but also they serve to clean and clear it by their Motions,
which could not be so safely done by the Hand. As the
Eye giveth Life and Beauty to the Countenance, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40791:18"/>
the inward Thoughts and hidden Temper both of
Body and Mind; so nothing could have been more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
contrived for Vision; being composed of various
humours contained in different Coats. The <hi>Cornea</hi> or <hi>White</hi>
is convex, and receiveth different degrees of Convexity,
according as the Objects are far or near: and to render
it capable of changing its Figure thus, the humour next
to it is thin, liquid, and pliable, which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Aqueous.</hi> The <hi>Pupilla</hi> or <hi>Sight</hi> doth dilate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
it self as there is more or less Light. And because
various distances of Objects require different Positions of
the <hi>Cristalline humour,</hi> through which the Rays of Light
pass to the <hi>Retina,</hi> where they form the Image of the
external Object: For Rays from a nearer Object unite
at a greater distance than those which come from an
Object more remote; therefore the <hi>Cristalline humour</hi> is
pressed upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> by what Anatomists call <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamentum
Ciliare,</hi> and yet it is kept by the <hi>Vitrious humour,</hi>
at such a due distance as is necessary for uniting the Rays
exactly upon it. And that the Image of the Object, which
is formed upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> may not be disordered by a
Reflexion of the Rays which pass through it, therefore
the <hi>Choroides</hi> or coat which surrounds it, is tinctured
black, which colour doth not reflect any Rays; for if it
were of another colour it would, and so hinder a distinct
Vision of external Objects. The <hi>Retina,</hi> upon which
the Image of all external Objects is formed, is not above
an inch and a half; and yet without Calculation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
Experience, or Arithmetical Tables of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we are made to perceive all Objects distinctly in
their just and real Proportions and at their true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
which is a most wonderful Contrivance, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impossible without infinite Power and Wisdom,
as both this and some other particulars of Vision are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable
by humane Reason.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the <hi>Ear</hi> less curious than the <hi>Eye:</hi> Some offer to
prove it more Artificial; but, Comparisons here (as in
other things) are to no purpose. Certainly, there are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40791:19"/>
as many (if not more) distinct Parts in the Fabrick of
the <hi>Ear</hi> than <hi>Eye.</hi> But it not being my design to give an
Anatomical Discourse, I will not offer to dissect it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all external Sound is given by a <hi>delicate Membrane,</hi>
which is guarded by a <hi>viscous Substance,</hi> lest rude and
violent Percussions should break it. There are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Cavities</hi> for receiving the impressions and beatings
upon this Membrane, for reverberating them, for modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and distinguishing them, that they may be clearly
understood. All which can be ascribed to nothing less
than infinite Wisdom, which contrived the <hi>Eye,</hi> to give
us the most delightful Prospect of the most pleasant <hi>Scenes</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Opera;</hi> and which formed the Ear to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
us with the sweet <hi>Notes</hi> which the most Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<hi>feathered Chorus</hi> Sing to the Praises of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and especially that by these means our Souls, tho'
strictly chained to, and closely detained in the Body,
may be capable of communicating their Thoughts to
one another.</p>
                  <p>4. Which leads me to the <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>intellectual Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
the vast Capacity of the Mind, the quick and lively
force of the Imagination, the incomprehensible Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
of the Memory, where Myriads of things are laid
up without any Confusion, but ranged in that good
order, as a very Thought can produce them in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
This is a large Subject, I dare not attempt it,
lest I be carried too far, or should utter things not so
obvious, or which might occasion debate. I only mark
the excellency and usefulness of <hi>these Faculties,</hi> which
every one can understand. It is by the means of these
that we think, reason, discourse, arrive at Wisdom and
Knowledge, by comparing things together, considering
their mutual Relations, by Judging the present from
what is past, by running the Effects up to their Cause,
and by taking measures, both of Natural and Moral
Events and Productions, from the Nature and Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Causes. By all which method and manner of
reasoning, we constantly find that <hi>every thing must have a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40791:19"/>
Cause,</hi> for <hi>nothing can produce nothing;</hi> nor can any thing
give to another the perfection which it self wants. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must have a Mover: Life must proceed from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that Lives, and Art and Contrivance from one or
other that understands the same; and consequently the
whole System of our Reason must be overturned, the
first Principles of Knowledge rejected, and the clearest
Perception denied, if <hi>he who planted the Ear did not hear,
if he who formed the Eye did not see, if he who teacheth
man Knowledge doth not know.</hi> In a word, if the Author
of our Being be not infinitely. Wise and Powerful, to
which all Mankind have given their consent; for as the
Latin Orator, and some others have observed, there was
never yet found any Nation or People who did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
a God.</p>
                  <p>I crave leave to add some few Thoughts more for
evincing this.</p>
                  <p>5. One is taken from the wonderful Contrivance of
<hi>nourishing the Body,</hi> and supplying all its Parts. Many
rare Inventions have been ruined, because they could
not be sustained or repaired: When the secret Springs
broke, they perished; and what a trouble is it to uphold
the Machines of Humane Contrivance, or to keep them
a going? But as the Author of our Being did foresee that
our Bodies were liable to decay, and did waste them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by acting and moving; so he has most wisely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against that Evil, and has laid down a wonderful
easie Method of sending Recruits to all the Parts, far
and near; nay, even to these which are wrap'd up in the
Heart of others, without doing prejudice to the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
Vessels, which is by receiving a little proper
Food into the Mouth, from whence after chewing and
mastigation, it is conveyed into the Stomach, where it
is digested into a liquid Substance, whether by heat or
acidity, or both, or by the motion of the Stomach it
self, we shall not debate. But however it be, there is a
speedy <hi>Dissolution</hi> of what comes there, and a better <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>retion</hi>
or <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>different Substances</hi> after <hi>Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40791:20"/>
than can be by the most expert Chymist. Which
Preparation being made, it is instantly discharged into
Pipes and Canals, of different sizes, and strangely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected,
which supply every Part with what is necessary;
so that the remote Parts are not neglected, nor the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
ones sooner supplied: all are equally provided and
taken care of, and at the same instant refreshed. When
the Body is faint and feeble, seems to have lost all its
Spirits, and upon the point of expiring, how suddenly
doth a little Food recover it? how soon is its colour
renewed? and how instantly doth it begin to exert
strength and vigour? should this be passed over because
common? should it be slighted because ordinary? should
we not regard this wonderful Device, by which our Life
is maintained from Day to Day? Methinks, those who
are so well pleased with Eating and Drinking, should
thank the Contrivance. Upon this is founded the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of asking a <hi>Blessing before Meat,</hi> and of <hi>giving Thanks
after;</hi> and to say the truth, it is not only laudable, but
more reasonable and necessary than is commonly believed.</p>
                  <p>6. And as the <hi>Nourishment of the Body</hi> doth ascribe Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to its Author, so both his Wisdom and Power doth
appear in its <hi>Generation.</hi> What an unlikely beginning has
it? how unaccountable that an <hi>homogeneous fluid</hi> should
be the foundation of such an <hi>hetterogeneous solid?</hi> We are
sure it is, but how it comes to be cannot be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The manner of this Production is as much hid
from our Understanding, as the place from our Eyes.
The wisest Philosophers are but Children here; their
Principles of Mechanism can give no light to this Affair;
all they say, is but a heap of fanciful and groundless Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.
Nor do I believe the sole Power of what is
called Nature sufficient; there must be the guidance of an
intelligent Spirit, to regulate Nature, and to see it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
its Duty. As in a Watch, all the Wheels and Parts
have a mutual dependance on each other, and do regulate
one another's Motions, and cannot move without the
Spring: nor this, unless it be wound up by some Hand:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40791:20"/>
So there is a mutual dependency among the Parts of the
Body: They must be all formed at once, and must all
perform their Functions together, otherwise not any of
them can act or move. The <hi>Circulation of the Blood</hi> is the
Cause of <hi>Animal Motion,</hi> or absolutely necessary to it,
and the means of Nourishment. The Blood cannot cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
without the <hi>Motion of the Heart,</hi> nor the Heart
move without <hi>Animal Spirits:</hi> Nor are <hi>Animal Spirits</hi>
formed but by the <hi>Circulation</hi> and <hi>Secretion</hi> of the <hi>Blood;</hi>
therefore there must be some supervenient Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
them all <hi>simul &amp; semel,</hi> to breathe Life into them,
and to set them a going. And if it be said that this is
now performed by the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Mother,
which circulate in the <hi>soetus,</hi> yet the Argument holds still
against the formation of the <hi>first Man,</hi> without super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Aid; which makes out my purpose, and which
is agreeable to the account we have of Man's Creation
in <hi>Genesis,</hi> where it is said, that God <hi>formed Man out of
the Ground,</hi> and then <hi>breathed into his Nostrils the breath of
Life;</hi> that is, by his Almighty Power he wrought a
lumpish piece of Earth into that wonderful Machine of
Man's Body: But the Creation and Conjunction of those
external and internal Parts, not being sufficient to give
it <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Motion;</hi> he also afterwards inspired this, by
a second Supernatural act of breathing into him. But to
leave Philosophizing, and to return to our Subject, how
doth the unsuitable and improbable matter from which
we proceed, argue the Almighty Power of him who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
it? And was it possible without infinite Wisdom,
to provide so wonderfully for the Nourishment and Safety
of the Child during the Nine Months that it continues in
the Womb? from which Prison it is also delievered in a
strange manner, which merits Admiration. When all
these things are considered, how much truth and force
is in that divine Hymn of <hi>David,</hi> where he Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
his Generation and Production, and where he saith,
<hi>God hath possessed my Reins, thou hast covered me in my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Womb. I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40791:21"/>
wonderfully made; Marvellous are thy Works, and that my
Soul knoweth right well. My substance was not hid from thee
when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest
parts of the Earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet being
imperfect, and in thy Book all my Members were written, which
in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of
them,</hi> Psal. 139. 13, <hi>&amp;c. Iob</hi> also hath spoken as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophically,
and much more truely, than any who hath
attempted to explain the formation of the <hi>foetus,</hi> and
that in a very few words; thus, <hi>Hast not thou poured me out
as Milk, and curdled me like cheese? Thou hast cloathed me
with Skin, and fenced me with Bones and Sinews. Thou hast
granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved
my Spirit,</hi> Job 10. 10.</p>
                  <p>Once more let it be considered how admirably each
Part is fitted for the use to which it is destined: And as
a great many perform their Motions without our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence,
so these external Members, which are at the
command of our will, do follow our thoughts quickly
and readily, without previous Preparation, or so much
as a Minute of time intervening. Nothing is quicker than
a Thought, and yet as soon as we will it, the Tongue
speaks, the Hand acts, and the Feet walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all
of them again cease their Motion just as we think it;
such a close dependence there is of these Members upon
our Minds or Faculty of Thinking. One cannot Play
well or distinctly upon any Instrument before he can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the Strings, and until he learn what touches
are proper to make the different Notes. But we are not
taught the distinct and proper Muscles, Nerves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by
which our Members move: Nor do we so much as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how they move them, and yet all is done, as if
we had a distinct and perfect Knowledge, and that too
with the swiftness of our Thoughts; for our Thoughts
and these Members keep pace together, if there be no
obstruction and hinderance; and if it were not so, we
should be under great Disadvantages. I could bring se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other instances to prove, that the Structure and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40791:21"/>
Oeconomy of the Humane Body is a most wonderful
and artificial Contrivance, which can be ascribed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less than infinite Power and Wisdom, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that it is a Demonstration of a Deity.</p>

                  <p>IT hath been made appear that every one of us car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
in us, and about us, a <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Deity.</hi>
Whenever we look upon our selves, we see him; for we
read his Wisdom and Power in our Make and Frame, in
our first Production and daily Preservation, and by both
our external and internal Senses.</p>
                  <p>1. But if one Evidence be not sufficient for so weighty
a Point, let us interrogate other <hi>Creatures,</hi> and they
will all unanimously answer the same thing. We are
indeed a wonderful Work, but we are not the only
Work of our Maker, he hath framed other Pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
which no less manifest his great Power and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
Wisdom. It is evident that he who made us,
made other things, and had both of us in his view when
he made either. What should be the use of an <hi>Eye,</hi> if
there was not <hi>Light?</hi> And to what purpose should there
be <hi>Light,</hi> if there was no <hi>Eye</hi> to see it, nor any Creature
to discern the Beauties which it discovers. He then, who
formed the Eye, created the Light; and he who ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Light, resolved to have a Creature capable of Seeing.
We cannot live without Food; nor can the Earth afford
us necessary Food without the warm and kind influences
of the Sun: that therefore there should be a Sun to
render the Earth fruitful, by its benign influences, could
not be Chance, but Contrivance, and this proves an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Being.</p>

2. If there was but one instance that looked like Art
and Design, we should not lay much stress on't; we might
be tempted to think that was only a lucky hit of <hi>blind
Fortune.</hi> But we have many Thousand instances in the
Heavens, in the Earth, and in the Seas, in both the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
and Animal World, where each Individual is not
only wonderfully contrived in reference to the Ends and
Uses of its particular being; but also in reference to
one another: for they are admirably fitted to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and are made to serve other most wisely: The
<hi>Vniversal Frame</hi> is as a huge Machine; the vast Orbs
above, and this in which we dwell, as so many Wheels
and suitable Parts, which the Artist hath most skilfully
joined, that not only each may have its proper Motion
easily, but that the particular Motion of one may be
beneficial to another, and all of them serviceable to the
general Design; no part can jolt out of its place, nor
interfere with another. A Fleet of 500 Sail can hardly
keep together without falling foul on each other; and
behold those innumerable and prodigious Orbs move
continually in their immense space, without rubbing, tho'
they naturally gravitate towards one another, which
shews that they are steered by a most dexterous Pilot.
And was it possible to put so many vast Orbs in motion
without Omnipotency? We may as well imagine that an
Ant or Worm may cause an Earthquake. Certainly <hi>the
Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth
his handy-work. Day unto Day uttereth speech, and Night
unto Night sheweth knowledge; nor is there any Language
where their Voice is not heard;</hi> that is, though the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Nations of the World speak with different Tongues,
which makes them that they cannot understand each
other; yet the Heavenly Bodies, by their regular and
useful Motions, speak an <hi>Vniversal Language</hi> intelligible
to all of common Sense, for convincing them that they
are the Work and Contrivance of an Almighty and most
Wise God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40791:22"/>
3. Again, Let us consider the <hi>Vegetable</hi> and <hi>Animal
World</hi> as a well-govern'd Common-wealth, where the
People are wisely employed according to their Stations
and Capacities, whose different Employments breed no
Confusion, but do preserve the Order and Peace of the
State, and promote its Wealth, Power, Strength and
Glory. The Earth sends forth Trees, Herbs, and Plants
of all Sorts for Food or Medicine, to serve the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or Advantages of humane Life; and all these spring
up in their proper Situation, as if planted by the Hand
of some skillful Gardner, which are sorted into diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Climates, to whet and encourage Industry, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
and securing a good Correspondence amongst
Men. Animals are destined to several Uses, and are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to such Regions as are proper to their Nature and
these Uses. Fowls have the Air to rove in; Fishes sport
themselves in the Waters; and Quadrupedes walk on
firm Land; Camels are allotted to <hi>Arabia,</hi> where there
is no Water: Salvage Beasts are sent to Desarts, where
they may do less Harm; and they who are mild, tractable,
and useful, are kept amongst Men. Such Animals as
are dangerous to others, or of less Use, are generally
barren and unfruitful, whereas other Kinds do multiply
in Abundance: For there would be no Living in the
World if Lions, Tigres, Bears, Wolves, Foxes, and
the like, were as numerous as Sheep and Oxen. And
the Air should shortly be dispeopled of its feathered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
if the Vulture, Eagle, and Hawk, could
draw out Armies like the Flocks of Crows and Pigeons.
Now who impos'd these hard Laws upon those Beasts
and Birds of Prey? What <hi>Pharaoh</hi> forbad them to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
to the Danger of the State? Is it possible that the
Terrour of Man could have made them drown or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
their Brood? Was it by the Art of Man that Foxes,
Wolves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> produce all Dogs, and almost but one
Bitch at every Litter, whereas other Animals bring
forth Males and Females equally. Can this proceed from
any, but the wise and potent Author of all things? But
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40791:23"/>
to go on; the climbing Goats feed upon the Rocks; the
simple Sheep and unweildy Oxen graze in the Valleys,
and the frighted Deer are removed to range in the
Woods. The fierce and undaunted Horse is appointed
for the Battle; the Ox to Labour, the Sheep for Food
and Cloathing; the Hare and Partridge for Diversion,
and the Hound and the Hawk for catching them. Thus
there is Use and Design to be seen in every Creature,
nay, even in Insects and creeping Things, which we
look upon with so much Contempt. The very common
dull Worm hath its Use; and lest they should be over
numerous, the blind Mole is given to check them. But
how useful is the Silk-Worm? What a Treasure doth it
yield? And how splendid are Men by its Labour? What
might be said of the Bee? Its Conduct and Industry are
admirable; like an excellent Chymist, it extracts the
mellous Juice from the Herbs and Flowers, but does not
spoil their Beauty and Figure, as Chymists do by their
Operations. It admirably composes Wax, which serves
to many Uses, and yet conceals from Mankind both the
Matter and Art of that Composition; for it is not yet
discovered: For they are mistaken, who think that with
which their Thighs are loaded is the Substance of Wax;
for this is of different Colours, whereas the Combs at
first are almost a pure white: And besides, I my self
have observed several Cells in the Combs, filled with
that Matter which is upon their Thighs, but for what
Use I have not yet discover'd, except it be for hatching
their Eggs.</p>
                  <p>4. If any Object, the Locust and Caterpillar; they may
well as upbraid the Prudence and Policy of a State for
keeping Forces, which generally are made up of very rude
and insolent People; for these are a Party of the Army of
the Lord of Hosts, which he sends out at his Pleasure, to
chastise the Pride, Wantonness, Ingratitude, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness
of Man, who is the only disorderly Part of
the Creation: He only breaks the Peace, and moves Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in this excellent and large Common-Wealth; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40791:23"/>
he does it to his own Prejudice, as generally all rebellious
and seditious People use to do: But his unruly and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
Behaviour is no Ground of impeaching the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Almighty Head of this great Common-Wealth
of the World, far less than the rebellious and
seditious practising of Subjects is chargeable upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
who oftentimes (as all Histories inform us)
run into it without just Provocation, through their own
Wantonness or Ignorance, or foolish Fears, or the evil
Counsel of cunning Men, who make them misapprehend
some things, and beguile them with a Pretence of making
other things better, which in the end turns worse. All
the Disorders in this Universal State, which is made up
of all Creatures, proceed from these very Causes, which
give Disturbance to particular humane States. If I may
be allowed to borrow a little Light from <hi>Revelation,</hi>
when I reason against Atheism: The Devil or <hi>Lucifer</hi>
being proud, and full of himself, became disaffected,
and turn'd Male-content; and to make himself a Party,
he addressed to Man, preying upon his Weakness and
Inadvertency, whom having once deluded, he still keeps
into that rebellious Interest, by suggesting evil Thoughts,
cherishing their Corruption and bad Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>5. Some may say, That this overturns all we have
said about Design and Contrivance, seeing it seems to
prove a grand Mistake in the Master-piece. If the
World, the several Parts in it, and the Conjunction of
these Parts be the work of infinite Wisdom, would one
have been made to disturb all the rest, to disorder the
whole Contrivance? Or would the Power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over these have been committed to one altogether
unqualified and unworthy of it, as Man seems to be? Or
must it be said, That the contriving of vegetative and
sensitive things was with in the Skill of this wise Being,
but that rational things, or what is of a higher Nature,
is above his Reach; and therefore he missed his Aim,
and came short of his Design? No, none of these things
follow. The Almighty God would shew his Power and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40791:24"/>
Wisdom by the creating an Infinite Variety of Beings,
endued with all Degrees of Perfections; and therefore
one who was to be free, to be entrusted with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of himself, and who was to be under no other
Force than that of Reason and Truth, nor to have any
other Tyes than that of Gratitude and Interest, which
he might know sufficiently by the Exercise of his intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Faculties, and the Application of his Mind to what
is always before him. Other things could not be left to
themselves; being endued with no Sense or Reason of
their own, they are still guided by the Wisdom of their
Maker; and hence it is that they never step aside, but
always move regularly: Infinite Wisdom appears in all
their Motions, and from this it is that some Creatures
without Sense, and others which have no more than
Sense, do out-do all the works of Men: Without Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
they know the Rules of Architecture, the
Nature and Uses of things, and the Means of compassing
them better than Man with all his Reason, and after all
his Study and Application: Nay, the Perfection of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Art</hi> is but a faint Imitation of what other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do by that which is called <hi>Natural Instinct,</hi> which
is truely the Guidance of that Infinite Wisdom which
contrived them. Mens best Knowledge is but Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Observation from their inferiour Creatures.
And as it thus appears, that those Creatures are under
the Management of their Maker, whose Wisdom mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
it self in their Motions and Actings: So it is no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in this most perfect Wisdom, that Men do not act
perfectly or exactly right, because they are left to their
own Freedom, and the Direction of an imperfect and
limited Reason, which yet was sufficient, if they had
adverted to the Marks and Instructions given them.</p>
                  <p>As by Revelation we are assured that Man was at
first made upright, so there are Reasons and Prints to
convince us of it without Revelation. And as he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with Perfections above others in this part of the
World, with intellectual Faculties which they want, so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40791:24"/>
it seems evident, that all those other things were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be subject Matter for those intellectual Faculties to
work upon. Pictures are not hang'd up but to be seen,
for they cannot talk together; so neither can Plants or
Beasts. This World therefore would have been but as
a wast House; tho' richly furnish'd, yet it would have
been altogether desolate of Inhabitants, if there had
been wanting one of Understanding and Judgment, and
capable of making wise Reflections on what there is in it.
Man's Life would be very miserable if he had not the
Service of those other Creatures, and they would be useless
if it were not with a Respect unto him. Either they were
designed to administer into him, or he was made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Advantage which redounds from them: They
are excellently fitted to one another, which could only
proceed from an intelligent Being of infinite Wisdom
and Power.</p>
                  <p>Thus there are so many and so great Instances of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and Contrivance, that no thinking Man is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
this <hi>Faith</hi> in God. He who doth not admit this Faith,
must be strangely stupid, and so much to be pitied, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably
obstinate, and therefore exceeding censurable.</p>
                  <p>6. I would ask such Persons what they would be at to
satisfie them? Do they require a Sight of God? They
may as reasonably ask to see a Voice, to touch a Tune,
or to try the Objects of one Sense by another, as Colours
by the Ear, and Odours by the Eye. Will they deny
the intellectual Faculties of Perception, Judgment, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination,
Memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be in others, because they
have no immediate Intuition of them? Is it not sufficient
Demonstration, that this, or the other Man doth possess
these Faculties, when the one or the other sheweth the
proper Signs of them, and that the necessary Effects
thereof may be perceived in his Discourse and Actions?
And what greater Demonstration would any have of an
Almighty, Intelligent Being, than prodigious and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Instances of Wisdom and Power, such as the World
every where presents us with! God's Essence is invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40791:25"/>
at least to us. What Organs the Angels of Heaven
have for beholding him, we do not know; but <hi>he dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in a Light which no Man can approach unto, whom no
Man hath seen, nor can see.</hi> But that which <hi>may be known
of God is manifest, for he hath shew'd it; for the Invisible
things of him from the Creation of the World are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
Power and God-head; so that they are without Excuse,</hi> viz.
who doubt or deny a Deity, or who are not perswaded
of his Eternity, Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, and
who doth not glorifie him as such.</p>
                  <p>7. If God was not eternal, nothing could have been
made, for there was then nothing to have produced any
thing; therefore his eternal Existence is evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Existence of other things, which do not exist
<hi>necessarily:</hi> And there is not any thing but himself which
has <hi>necessary Existence</hi> included in its <hi>Idea.</hi> And though
the creating of any one thing was a Demonstration of
his Almighty Power and Wisdom, because nothing less
could produce any thing out of nothing; yet he hath
created innumerable things of vastly different Natures
and Properties, that by this infinite Diversity and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Beings, his infinite Power may be visible to those
who are capable to perceive it. The Immensity of his
Power appears in the Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the World, to which
our very Imagination can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
no Limits.<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <p>By the latest and exactest Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Modern Mathematicians, there goes 69 Miles and a Tenth Part to a Degree, so that the Periphery or Circumference of the Earth is 24876 <hi>English</hi> Miles. Its Diameter is 7915, and the whole Solidity may be reckoned Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Fifty Nine Thousand Five Hundred Seventy and Eight Million, Nine Hundred Thrity Three Thousand Four Hundred and Five Cubical Miles. The Earth is greater than <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Mars;</hi> for the First bears only the Proportion to it, which an 100 hath to 347, and the other of an 100 to 334; That is, the Earth is more than three times greater than any of these: But then it is much less than the rest of the Planets; for in respect of <hi>Venus,</hi> the Earth has only the Proportion of 43 to an 100, to Jupiter as 121 to 10000, to <hi>Saturn</hi> as 296 to 10000, and to the <hi>Sun</hi> as 1 to 1367631.</p>
                        <p>The Magnitude of the fixed Stars cannot be conjectured; but there are Demonstrations offered to prove them greater than any of the Planets; seeing they shine so bright at amost stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Distance: For a Telescope which multiplieth 200 times, doth not shew them bigger than they appear to the naked Eye, but rather less. Whence it follows, That this planetary Orb is but as a Point, in respect of the Distance of the fixed Stars; and consequently, That the Vniverse which comprehends the Planets and all the Stars, visible and invisible, each of which has a particular Orb, must be Immense beyond all Imagination and Apprehension.</p>
                     </note> The Length
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40791:25"/>
and Greatness of the Earth, with the vast deep, doth
astonish us when we have it in our View; but how little
doth this Greatness appear, when we lift up our Eyes
to the Heavens and behold the innumerable Multitude of
those shining Orbs, Two of which, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Panetary
World, are only less than the Earth; and some of them,
not only many Thousands, but Millions of times greater,
as we are assured by the Authority and Observation of
Mathematicians, and which, without them, we may
rudely conjecture by their Appearance at so vast a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
By the help of Glasses we may discern many
more Stars, than what appear to the naked Eye. And
there be very good Reason to believe, that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more which Glasses cannot reach; so that Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it self cannot grasp the Universe: And all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
Faculties fail us when we offer to view the Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of it. <hi>Lo, all that we see are but Parts of his Ways, for
how little a Portion is heard of him,</hi> saith <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 26. 14.</p>
                  <p>8. How these celestial Orbs are filled and furnished,
we know not; but we have very good Reason to believe,
That they are not wast and desolate Places, or meer
<hi>Masses of Matter</hi> to fill up the immense Space of <hi>Vacuity.</hi>
Without doubt they are admirably replenish'd by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Wisdom, as well as this which is inhabited by us,
where are infinite Diversity of Instances, for forming and
enlarging in us an Idea of the God-head, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us that his Wisdom and Power cannot be bounded.
In one Place Matter lies heaped in <hi>loose Particles</hi> as Sand,
which can be easily separated, nay, blown asunder: In
another Place it is kneaded like <hi>Dough,</hi> we know not
how, as in <hi>Clay</hi> and such like Ground: Again, it is both
closely united, and also hardned wonderfully, as <hi>Stone,</hi>
of which there are divers sorts, some of a bright and
dazzling Lustre, as the <hi>Diamond</hi> and <hi>Crystal;</hi> other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
Black, or of an unspotted White, or admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
variegated with different Colours, as the several
sorts of Marble. Sometimes this hardned Matter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible,
as <hi>Coal;</hi> sometimes malleable, as <hi>Metal,</hi> which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40791:26"/>
may be beat so thin, that a very small Quantity of Gold
could be made to cover the whole Surface of the Earth,
as can be demonstrated from <hi>Leaf-Gold,</hi> and the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Gilded-Wire;</hi> for a Grain Weight or two may be
extended to some Thousand Ells of Length. Thus the
Power of God doth wonderfully appear in the very Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of the <hi>Atomes</hi> and Particles of <hi>Brute</hi> and <hi>Lifeless
Matter,</hi> which also sheweth his Wisdom no less; for by
this means, Matter is made to serve to many different Uses
and Purposes, which otherwise could only have served
one or a few. Convenient Houses, strong and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Buildings, could never have been erected of <hi>Sand</hi>
and <hi>loose Dust,</hi> nor could <hi>Stone</hi> be beat out into useful
Plough-Shares and Pruning-Hooks, Swords and Knives,
and such other Instruments as the Conveniency of Life
requires. Of what Advantage <hi>Iron</hi> is, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by the Imperfection of Arts in <hi>America,</hi> before the
<hi>Europeans</hi> carried it thither: Tho' it be commonly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
the coursest of Metals, yet none is more useful,
and without it other things could not be so well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.
It should be tedious to run over the several
Species of <hi>brute Matter,</hi> but it is evident, That the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Variety thereof renders the State and Condition
of Mankind more convenient and happy; and if but a
few of them had been wanting, they should have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under great Inconveniencies; As for Instance,
how inconvenient would it be for those who inhabit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Countries, remote from the Sea, if there were not
Rocks and Mines of Salt; and therefore the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of such Variety, speaks out both the infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Wisdom of God.</p>
                  <p>Which doth yet more appear when we consider <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi>
which is <hi>Matter</hi> raised to the <hi>First Degree</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi>
being made capable of Nourishment and Growth. Some
have written several large Volumes about the Number,
Kinds, and Vertues of <hi>Plants,</hi> and many more might be
written without exhausting the Subject. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
different <hi>Genders</hi> or Kind of Plants, and every one
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40791:26"/>
of these in the same <hi>Gender</hi> differ from other as to Size,
Shape, Figure, Colour, Odour, Vertue, Duration, and
the like; so that the Number of known Plants are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be Eighteen or Twenty Thousand; and there
may be yet many more undiscovered. Some are almost
insensibly small, other vastly great; some proceed from
the Seed, others by the Root; some bear Seed, others
none at all; some send forth a Flower, others are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; in some the Flower puts out first, in most others
it is last; some have no Odour, others either refresh
with their Fragrancy, or they offend with their Stink;
some are only commendable for their Beauty and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as the Tulip, others for their Use and Vertue;
and some have Beauty and Vertue enjoined, as the Violet,
the Rose, the Lily, and the Gilly-Flower. Some wither
almost as soon as they spring up others last a Season; some
are Annual, and others perpetual; and all these divers
Kinds have one common Nourishment, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rain</hi>
and <hi>Dew</hi> from Heaven. What Admiration may it breed,
to consider that such an insipid thing as <hi>Rain-Water,</hi> is
capable to be distilled into Liquors of so many different
Colours, Tasts, Smells, and Vertues, as are the Juice of
Plants! And it is no less Matter of Admiration, that this
same liquid Rain should be consolidated into so firm, hard,
and strong Parts, as are the Roots, Trunks, and Barks
of Trees: For their Accretion and Growth is only from
Rain, the Earth, being only a fit Receptacle to preserve
it for them, as is evident from divers Experiments. Is
not all this the wonderful Work of God, of which who
can make any doubt? If the inward Structure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Mechanism of Plants or Vegetables be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for they are composed of different Parts, wisely fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for Nourishment, Growth, and Preservation: The
Root fixeth it in the Earth, sucks in Nourishment, and
is as the Stomach in Animals, to digest and prepare it.
Then there are various Fibres as Veins to receive the
Sap, and thro' which it circulates. There are also
some Vessels to take in Air for Respiration, to facilitate
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40791:27"/>
the Circulation of the Sap. The outer and inner Bark
of Trees preserve them from the Injury of the external
Air: The Leaves are not only for Beauty, but to defend
the Fruit, and to shade the Tree it self from excessive
Heat, and to gather the Dew, which returning with the
inward Sap, helps to nourish the Fruit and Branches.
Every Vegetable has its peculiar Contrivance suited to its
Nature and Use; which abundantly demonstrates that
they are all the Effects of infinite Power and Wisdom:
But there are some more remarkable Instances, which,
like strange Prodigies, seem to be planted with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to force our Admiration and Acknowledgment.
Take this short Account of them, which Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> hath
given in his ingenious and pious <hi>Treatise of the Wisdom

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Aloe Muricata,</hi> or <hi>Aculeata,</hi> which
yields the <hi>Americans</hi> every thing their Necessities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as Fences, Houses, Darts, Weapons, and other
Arms, Shooes, Linen and Cloths, Needles and
Thread, Wine and Honey, besides many Utensils,
for all which <hi>Hernacles, Garcilasso de la Vega</hi> and
<hi>Margrave</hi> may be consulted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Bandura Cingalensium,</hi> called by some
<hi>Priapus Vegetabilis,</hi> at the end of whose Leaves hang
long Sacks or Bags, containing pure limpid Water,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40791:27"/>
of great Use to the Natives, when they want Rain
for Eight or Ten Months together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Cinnamon-Tree of</hi> Cylon, in whose
Parts there is a wonderful Diversity. Out of the Root
they get a sort of <hi>Camphire,</hi> and its Oil; out of the
Bark of the Trunk the true Oil of Cinnamon; from
the Leaves an Oil like that of Cloves, out of the
Fruit a Juniper Oil, with a Mixture of those of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon
and Cloves. Besides, they boil the Berries
into a sort of Wax, out of which they make Candles,
Plaisters, Unguents. Here we may take Notice of the
Candle-Trees of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> out of whose Fruit
boiled to a thick fat Consistence, are made very good
Candles, many of which have been lately distributed
by that most ingenious Merchant, Mr. <hi>Charles Dubois.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Fountain or Dropping-Trees in the
Isles of <hi>Teno,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and in <hi>Guinea,</hi> which serve
the Inhabitants instead of Rain and fresh Springs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> we will only mention the Names
of some other Vegetables, which with Eighteen or
Twenty Thousand more of that Kind, do manifest to
Mankind the Illustrious Bounty and Providence of the
Almighty and Omniscient Creator towards his unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Creatures, as the Cotton-Trees, the Manyoc
or Cassava, the Potatoe, the Jesuits Bark-Tree, the
Poppy, the Rheubarb, the Scammony, the Jalap,
the Coloquintida, the China, Sarfa, the Serpentaria
Virginia, or Snakeweed, the Nisi or Genseg, the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Balsam and Gum-Trees, many of which are
of late much illustrated by the great Industry and Skill of
that most discerning Botanist, Doctor <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Pluke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
Of what great Use all these, and innumerable
other Plants are to Mankind, in the several Parts of
Life, few or none can be ignorant. Besides, the
known Uses in curing Diseases, in feeding and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poor, in building and dying, in all Mechanicks,
there may be as many more not yet discovered, and
which may be reserved on purpose to exercise the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40791:28"/>
Faculties bestowed on Man, to find out what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>10. But if we make one Step higher to view the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life,</hi> we shall see Wisdom and Power still more
wonderfully displayed and diversified. What a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Bulk of Life and Animal Motion is the <hi>Whale!</hi>
What a huge Animal Machine is that <hi>Leviathan! By whose
Neezings a Light doth shine, and whose Eyes are like the
Eye-lids of the Morning. Out of whose Nostrils goeth
Smoak as out of a Seething-pot or Cauldron. He maketh the
Deep to boil like a Pot, the Sea like a Pot of Ointment. He
maketh a Path to shine after him, so that one would think the
Deep to be hoary.</hi> And is not the Epitome of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life as astonishing which we have in the <hi>Mite,</hi> and
other almost imperceptible Creatures! Which tho' they
be but as <hi>Motes</hi> in the Sun, nay according to the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of some, there are some Animals less than a Grain
of Sand by several Millions, yet they have Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and consequently are inwardly composed of Heart,
Lungs, Veins, Arteries, and Fibres, which proves the
wonderful <hi>Divisibility</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Art</hi> of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power, which can produce the same Motions
and Sense in an <hi>Atome</hi> which we see in the hugest Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
Again, we see here all imaginable Qualities distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
into various Sizes, Shapes, and Figures; and also,
all or most of them united together into one. Some are
designed to fly in the Air, and for that end are furnished
with Feathers, Wings, and very strong Muscles, by which
means they are capable to continue and support themselves
a long time in the Air, without wearying: And because
their Feathers may be spoiled by Rain and Dew, and so
rendered useless; therefore each Fowl has Two <hi>Pots</hi> of
<hi>Oil,</hi> that is, <hi>Two Glandules</hi> upon its <hi>Rump,</hi> which always
produce an <hi>Vnctuous Substance,</hi> for anointing the Feathers
that they may not be wet, or receive any Prejudice from
Rain or the Moisture of the Air. Others are framed to
swim in the Waters, and therefore have a peculiar Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of their Lungs and inward Parts, which makes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40791:28"/>
them require less Air than Terrestrial Animals. And
tho' the Animals proper to one Element cannot live in
another, for Fishes brought to the open Air pant and
die; Land-Fowl, and the Generality of Terrestrial
Creatures, when they fall into the Water, cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
long without Drowning. Yet to shew that nothing is
impossible to Almighty Wisdom, there be some Fishes
framed to fly above Water, and a great many Fowl to
swim and dive under it. So there are Terrestrial Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupedes,
which, without Feathers, fly in the Air, as
Bats, and some <hi>Indian</hi> Squirrils; and there be others,
whose Food being Fish and Water-Insects, they range
continually in the Waters, as the Beaver, the Otter, the
Phoca or Sea-Calf, the Water-Rat, and Frog; all which
have their Toes interwoven with a thin Membrane to fit
them for Swimming, and also are furnished with a <hi>Wind-Bladder</hi>
to afford them what Air is necessary to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Blood, so that they can continue long in
the Water without Suffocation. Now could all these
different proper Structures of Animals have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
without Wisdom? Could they have been distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in some, and united and intermingled in others,
according to the Elements for which they were designed,
without infinite Understanding?</p>
                  <p>To proceed, the Power of Seeing far is given to the
Eagle and others, Swiftness to the Hare, Hound, and Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck;
Strength to the Ox and Bear; Fierceness to the
Lion; Cunning to the Fox; Docility to the Dog;
Courage and Fleetness to the Horse; and the Elephant
is made both formidable and tame, cunning and docile,
strong and fierce.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, there is Man to manage this and all the
other Animals, who, tho' he be neither so clear sighted
as some, nor so strong, nor so fierce, nor so swift as
others, yet by his Reason and the Ordinance of God,
he has Dominion over the Fowls of the Air, the Beasts of
the Field, and the Fish of the Sea, and maketh them all
to do Homage unto him. <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40791:29"/>
Works! In Wisdom thou hast made them all, the Earth is
full of thy Riches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. We need not ascend higher, nor go further to
fetch Proofs of a Deity, nor Instances of eternal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wisdom and Power. They who are so peevish
as to quarrel what they see here, would not lay
aside this unreasonable Humour, tho' they were carried
to the Regions above. They who are not convinced
by these things which are continually before them, would
not be satisfied with other Arguments, and there are
innumerable more. As they are hardned against the
ordinary Works of God, so they would resist obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such as are extraordinary, for they mock all of this
kind which have been. Wherefore it is wisely observ'd,
That God never wrought a Miracle to convince an
Atheist; for besides that it is not reasonable that God
should indulge an unreasonably willful, and obstinate
Humour, no Miracle can be more effectual, or less
liable to Exception than the regular Motion of those
prodigious Orbs in the Heavens above, and the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Productions in the Earth below, all of which
shew admirable Art and Contrivance. When common
Food ceaseth to nourish, Delicacies and Dainties seldom
do good. If the Body be clean and sound, common
Food should be both savoury and nourishing. And if
Men would lay aside their Pride, Malice, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
of Naughtiness; if they would be meek and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile,
they should soon perceive the reasonable Force of
what we have touched, to perswade to a Belief of the
Existence of God. And if any would have the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of a fuller View of these Works of Wisdom and
Power, I referr them to the forementioned <hi>Treatise</hi> of
Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> because it may be easily had, and is made plain
and intelligible by the meanest Capacity.</p>

               <div n="7" type="essay">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:40791:29"/>
                  <head>ESSAY VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of the Absurdity of Atheism.</head>
                  <p>1. THere are Two sorts of Demonstrations, one is a
positive Proof drawn from certain and known
Principles; the other sheweth the absurd and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Consequences which would necessarily follow,
if what is required be not granted, which is therefore
called <hi>Demonstratio ex absurdo.</hi> Mathematicians make
use of both: And there be many Propositions in <hi>Euclid</hi>
which are not demonstrable but by the last Kind. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them makes a thing sure; and what is capable
of both is most evident, and consequently nothing can
be more absurd and unreasonable than to deny and resist
what is clearly made out both these Ways. And hence
also it follows, That the Atheist is monstrously obstinate,
and to the utmost Degree absurd and unreasonable;
seeing the Existence of a Deity can be demonstrated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>First,</hi> It is evident by what hath been delivered in
the former Essays, that there are clear Instances of
Wisdom and Power in the World; and it also clearly
appears that this Wisdom and Power are united in one,
because they never act separately, but always work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Power is always directed by Wisdom, and
what sheweth the one sheweth the other, which is a
sufficient, full, and as great a Demonstration as can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
be demanded, of the Existence of a wise Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or powerful Wisdom, and consequently that there is
a Being superiour to all that we see, which has as much
Wisdom and Power as what we find expressed in the
Contrivance and Frame of the World, and in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the several Beings that are in it, that is, there
is and must be an all-wise and Almighty God; for by
him we understand a Being whose Power and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40791:30"/>
is infinite. Of whose Existence we are also
further assured by all the Principles of reason and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and by all those Methods by which we find out
the Truth of any thing: For we are ascertained of the
Truth of things, either by the Consideration of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and abstracted Idea's, or by Deductions from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which all acknowledge to be self-evident, or by
their effects and Manifestations, or finally by Testimony
and Tradition. And all these several Ways, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that there is such a supreme and perfect Being as is
meant by God.</p>
                  <p>3. Moreover, this Truth is so far from being shaken
by the Arguments and Objections of Atheists, that they
do rather confirm it. Wherefore, that we may entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
silence them, and remove all Difficulties which any
may entertain in this Matter, we will consider some of
the chief of their Objections, without concealing or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing
the Force of them.</p>
                  <p>Firt, <hi>It is objected,</hi> That an Argument, drawn from
final Causes, the Ends and Vses of things, is not concluding,
nor of Force enough to establish such an important Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it has more of Fancy than Solidity in it: The ends of
things are but little known, and are only devised by a strong
Imagination. Fancifull Men apprehend a Thousand things
which have no Foundation in Nature, as cunning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Persons can adapt and appropriate things to several
Vses to which they were never destined. It is unreasonable to
pretend, that the several things in Nature have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
designed for the Ends and Vses to which the Art or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of Mankind have employed them. And the like may
be said of most other things, which we only fanste were formed
with a Respect to such or such an End, because we perceive
some Agreeableness betwixt them and it. <hi>This Argument</hi>
Lucretius <hi>insists on, which I shall set down according to
the excellent Translation of Mr.</hi> Creech;
<q>
                        <l>But now avoid their gross <hi>Mistakes,</hi> that teach</l>
                        <l>The Limbs were made for <hi>Work, a Use for each;</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:40791:30"/>
The <hi>Eyes</hi> design'd to <hi>see,</hi> the <hi>Tongue</hi> to <hi>talk,</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>The <hi>Legs</hi> made strong, and knit to <hi>Feet,</hi> to <hi>walk;</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>The <hi>Arms</hi> fram'd long, and firm, the <hi>Servile Hands</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>To work, as <hi>Health</hi> requires, as <hi>Life</hi> commands:</l>
                        <l>And so of all the rest whate'er they feign,</l>
                        <l>Whate'er they teach 'tis Nonsense all, and vain.</l>
                        <l>For proper Vses were design'd for none</l>
                        <l>But all the Members fram'd each made his own.</l>
                     </q>
Again:
<q>
                        <l>These various things <hi>Convenience</hi> did produce,</l>
                        <l>We thought them fit, and made them for our Use.</l>
                        <l>Thus <hi>these,</hi> and thus our <hi>Limbs</hi> and <hi>Senses</hi> too</l>
                        <l>Were <hi>form'd</hi> before that any <hi>Mind</hi> did know</l>
                        <l>What <hi>Office</hi> 'twas that they were <hi>fit</hi> to do.</l>
                        <l>Well then, 'tis fond to think that these began</l>
                        <l>For proper Vses made, bestow'd on Man.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. The Summ of this Argument is, That all things
happened by Chance, That nothing was contrived or
made with Design, and that the pretended Ends and
Uses of things are arbitrarily imposed by Men. But this
Argument falls to pieces, and is of no Force at all, if it
evidently appear that the Frame of the World, and the
Structure of particular Beings cannot be ascribed to
Chance, but to Contrivance and Design, which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
inferr an Intelligent Being: For even the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of this do acknowledge, That acting intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
proves Wisdom and Understanding, otherwise they
would not be so anxious to remove all Contrivance from
Natural things.</p>
                  <p>Now, neither the Continuation of the present State of
things, nor their first Production can be afcribed to
Chance without the grossest Impudence. Not the first,
because Chance is Chance still, and not only may, but doth
more often miss than hit right; whereas the Motions of
the Planets are certain and regular; and the successive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40791:31"/>
Production of Animals and Vegetables is constant and
unchangeable, never miscarrying, but when some visible
impediment happens. The several Species are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
or blended together, but every thing produceth
its like of the same kind, with all its natural Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Proportions. If one should always throw the
same Number with Two Dyes, when the Odds is more
than a Million to One, tho' there be but Six different
Numbers on each, we would conclude that he did it not
by Chance but by some Art or Trick which secured it.
How improbable then, nay, how impossible is it, that so
many Thousand admirable and regular Productions
should happen merely by Chance, when each is a greater
Chance than one against many Thousands of Millions
without the Management of a wise Power. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him a wise and expert Artist, who always hits his
Mark, and compasseth his Design. And is there not as
much Reason, to conclude these many natural Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
the Effects of an Intelligent Being.</p>
                  <p>If it be replied, that all things now are continued and
perpetuated by the Order and Method into which Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
has settled, and into which it fell by mere Chance; I
answer, That neither can the first Production of things,
or that Order and Law by which they are now produced
be ascribed to Chance, which was the other thing I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.
For supposing Matter to be Eternal, we must
also suppose some other thing to put it into Motion, for
Motion is not essential to Matter: And tho' we should
suppose, that both Matter and Motion were Eternal,
yet we cannot thence conclude, that blind Matter and
undetermined Motion could ever produce any regular
thing, without a Director, or one to super-intend it.
At the most it can be supposed only to occasion a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of its Parts, and a Secretion of the subtile from
the grosser Particles, as we see done by some Chymical
Operations; but no Force put upon our Imagination can
ever make us fansie that it could be so admirably orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
of it self, or by mere Chance shap'd into so many
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40791:31"/>
different independent Species of Beings, which have also
Power to perpetuate their Kind, not to speak now of
the Faculties of thinking and reasoning. We may with
much more Ease conceive, that a fortuitous Jumble
of Letters may compose all the Books of the World,
which the Atheists have been often, and of old twitted
with.</p>
                  <p>And as Reasoning <hi>à priori,</hi> we cannot admit Chance
to be the Cause of things, so <hi>à posteriori,</hi> we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Contrivance and Design to be visible in the Frame of
the World, the Order of Beings, and the particular
Structure of each, unless we do Violence to both Sense
and Reason. Such as refuse to acknowledge it, I would
have them to declare greater Signs and Evidence of Art,
Design, and Contrivance, than what is to be seen in
and amongst natural things. Are not all things made
in <hi>Number, Weight,</hi> and <hi>Measure?</hi> Where do they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Confusion or Disorder? Where do they see
irregular and unsuitable Mixtures or Compositions?
Are their disproportionable Quantities of Matter, or
disagreeable Qualities conjoined in any Subject? Is not
Order, Method, just Proportion and Measure to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
every where, and in every thing? Are not all
things so exactly adapted together, and so well fitted to
each other, that whether we consider Individuals, or the
several Species, or the whole Frame together, nothing
can be better devised? What is it to act intentionally,
or with Design, but to propose some certain end, and
to carry it on by suitable Means? And therefore when
we see things so conveniently adapted together as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
certain Effects, and so well adjusted as to prevent
the Miscarriage of them, have we not all Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that there is Design and Contrivance there? The
more excellent the Effects be, and the more Artificial the
Means, it still proves more Wisdom in the Author and
Contriver, and consequently the Author of Natural
things is infinitely more wise than Men, because Natural
Productions do far exceed those of Humane Art, and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40791:32"/>
Means by which they are produced are much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.</p>
                  <p>It is great Perverseness and inexcusable Obstinacy,
not to acknowledge a wise Contrivance in the Ends and
Uses of Natural things, or to alledge that they are all
devised by Men: For tho' we should grant, that the
Ends and Uses to which the Wit, Art, and Industry of
Man has improved many of them, were not foreseen by
their wise Author, nor those things which they have
thus improved, intended by him purposely for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Conveniency and Advantage of Life; yet there are
real and visible Ends and Uses, and manifest admirable
Contrivances in Order to the same, which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
independent upon either the Art or Imagination of
Men. Is the Distinction of Animals into Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
and the Adaptation of the Female to conceive and
nourish the <hi>Foetus,</hi> both while it is in the Womb and after
it is brought forth, merely grounded upon Fancy? Could
either Individuals have been multiplied, or the Kinds
propagated without this? And was not this an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Contrivance, and could it have been without Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Understanding? What Reason is there to
ascribe a Watch to Art and Contrivance more than the
Structure of Animals, which is composed of different
Parts and Vessels, curiously set together? Why should
we think, that Windows were designed to let in Light
to the House, and not the Eye purposely framed to see?
Why should we think, Doors and Gates intended by the
Architect for giving Entry to what we would admit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the House, and shutting out other things, and not
also conclude the <hi>Valves</hi> of the Heart, Veins, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
such another Contrivance? Is there more Art in
the various ways of joining the different pieces of any
Frame or Machine, than there is in the different joinings
of the Bones of the Body, which makes them move diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
and very usefully? As for Example; The upper
part of the Bone of the Arm is convex, and that Bone
of the Shoulder which receives it is concave, by which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40791:32"/>
Means we can trun our Arm round, whereas at the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
there is another Kind of Articulation, which only
suffers that part of the Arm to turn upwards towards
the Shoulder. And because neither of these joinings were
proper for the divers Motions of the Hand and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Arm,
therefore its Bones are joined so as to make it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of turning round, and of moving backwards and
forwards, up and down, and almost every way. The
Teeth are the only Bones of the Body, except those of
the Ear, which are not covered with a most sensible
Membrane: And if they had been covered with it, we
had been liable to continual Pain. Now this Difference
between the Teeth and the rest of the Bones could not
be Chance, but a wise Contrivance. I might also make
out this further, by considering the different Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
betwixt the Teeth of Men and other Animals,
and those of other Animals according to their different
Natures, and by many other Instances. But what hath
been said is sufficient to prove, That the Ends and Uses
of natural things are real and not fansied by Men; that
the Universal Frame and the Nature of particular things
do evidently and demonstrably prove a wise Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance;
and consequently that all things are the Effects
of a wise and intelligent Agent. And who would be
further cleared and perswaded of this Matter, let them
read the Treatise which the Honoured and Worthy
Master <hi>Boyle</hi> has written of Final Causes.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>But</hi> 2dly, <hi>'tis objected,</hi> That if it be reasonable to
conclude the Existence of a Deity, or some supreme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
powerful Being from the seeming Order and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of some things, it is as reasonable to conclude that there
is no such being from the manifest Irregularity and Vseless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of other things, for if there was a God, or any Wise Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Being, as is pretended, all his Works would bear
Prints of his Wisdom. But we see many things which have
no manner of Contrivance in them, which are of no Vse, but
rather prejudicial, and therefore we have Reason to believe,
that the rest happened by Chance and not by Design. Thus
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40791:33"/>
(<hi>say they</hi>) the Spleen is the Occasion of much Pain and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and is of it self of no Vse, for several Animals have
been known to live without it. Mountains are irregular and
ill contrived Heaps, which spoil the Surface of the Earth, and
render it less beautiful, and are very inconvenient for Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Commerce. If this Terraqueous Globe had been the
Work of a wise Agent, there would not have been more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than dry Land, which is the only proper Habitation for
Man and Terrestrial Animals, which are by much preferrable
to Fishes: Nor would there have been so much Ground laid
wast which cannot be inhabited, as the Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
the <hi>Lybian</hi> Sands, and about the Two Poles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. To all this I answer First, That tho' it should be
granted that there are many thing without Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and which show no Design, yet it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
to deny the necessary Consequences of what
doth manifestly show both a Contrivance and Design;
and therefore whether there be more or fewer Instances
which do so, it still follows that there is a Wise, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Being, capable to produce them. 2<hi>dly,</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
without Rashness conclude, That a things is without
Contrivance, because we cannot find it out, nor is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for any use, because we cannot perceive it. Our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is very much limited, and it is impossible for us to
comprehend all that God doth, and it is great Presumption
to condemn what we do not understand. No wise Man
will slight the Works of any famous Mechanick or Artist,
tho' he doth not presently conceive what he intended
by it; for his known Art and Skill in other things makes
it reasonable to believe, that what is not yet declared
or understood was nevertherless well designed and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
contrived: Even so, seeing the general Frame of
the World doth show so much Wisdom, and that there
appears so much Art and Contrivance in the Nature and
Structure of particular Beings, we ought from hence to
conclude, that all things are wisely and well contrived
for excellent Ends and Purposes, tho' we be ignorant of
many of them. 3<hi>dly,</hi> In passing a Censure and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40791:33"/>
upon particular things, we ought not to consider
them separately only, but also with a Respect to other
things, to which they have a Relation, and with which
they are conjoined.</p>
                  <p>Having premised these things in general, I answer
next to these particular Instances proposed. <hi>First,</hi>
That tho' the Use of the Spleen is not yet well known,
nor can it be certainly determined, nevertheless we have
no Reason to think it useless, seeing the Structure of it
is as curious as that of the Liver, Lungs, and other Parts.
The Use and Function of several other Vessels were
not known till of late, and after Ages may discover the
Use of this too, which certainly was never placed in the
Body without some special End or Use; nor must it be
reckoned altogether useless, because some Animals have
been found to live without it: For so, both Men and
other Animals do live without some Parts, which are of
a known Use and of a special Contrivance; besides, tho'
the Loss of the Spleen did not instantly put an end to
Life, it might have shortned it, or rendred it painful and
uneasie, marring the Oeconomy of the Body. 2. As to
the Mountains, they are very far from being useless; for
they serve to collect and condense the Vapours which
feedeth Springs and Fountains: They determine the
Winds in some measure: They nourish divers Plants,
which will not grow upon the Valleys: They are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for Metals and Minerals, and are so far from spoiling
the Beauty of the Earth, that they make it much more
pleasant, by casting it into divers Shapes and Figures.
3. There is as much dry Land as is necessarry either for
Man or Terrestrial Animals, nay, as much as could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
many Millions more than there are, so that there is
no Reason to complain of being straitned by want of
Room. And it was necessary that there should be more
Sea than dry Land, partly for the Conveniency of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and partly for furnishing sufficient Rain to water
the Earth. The Ground requires all the Rain which
falleth, which, by Computation is reckoned in one
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40791:34"/>
Year to be Five times the Quantity of Water in the Sea.
If therefore there had been less Water, either the Earth
should have been without sufficient Rain, or when it
rained the Sea should have been too much emptied,
which would have been very inconvenient, both for those
Creatures who live in it, and also for the Ships that
sail upon it. The <hi>Libyan</hi> Sands, and barren Desarts of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> &amp;c. cast no Reflection upon the wise Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Earth, for it is not reasonable to think
that all Parts should be alike good and excellent; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
is both useful and pleasant: What is wanting in
these barren Places is supplied by the Richness of others,
which are also rendred more delightful by the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of such frightful Desolateness, even as Shadows
contribute to the Beauty of a Picture, and the Brightness
of the other Colours. Besides other Uses which we yet
know not, they may be designed also to make us sensible
how much we owe to the Bounty of the wise Author of
all things, who hath made so much of the Earth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Habitation for the Children of Men. <hi>Lastly,</hi>
The same may be said in Reference to the Countries
about the Two Poles, which are not very considerable,
if we compare them with the rest of the habitable
World. And besides, they show the wise Contrivance of
the Spheroidical Figure of the Earth, and of making the
Axis so much shorter than the Diameter of the Equator;
for if it had been otherwise the frigid Zones should have
been much more large, and much less habitable. There
is no way to Remedy that Inconvenience of the Country
about the Poles, at least in our Conception, except there
were Two Suns, or that this Sun was made to move
without and beyond the Tropicks, neither of which
would be so convenient as the present Contrivance.</p>
                  <p>7. 3<hi>dly,</hi> It is said, <hi>That the World and all things in it
were eternal; which if true</hi> (in their Opinion) <hi>will cut off
all Pretext of Contrivance and Design: For if nothing was
ever made, then nothing also was ever contrived, there being
no Occasion for contriving what was already existent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40791:34"/>
8. But this Opinion of the Eternity of the World is
taken up without any Shadow of Reason or Probability.
It is a precarious Assertion, which being denied can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be proved. 2. It contradicts the Universal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, which hath always attested that the
World had a Beginning. 3. It is against the current
Testimony of all History, which traceth the Origin of
Nations and People, the Inventions of Arts and Sciences,
and which sheweth that all have happened within the
Space of less than Six Thousand Years, according
to the most probable, (if not certain) Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which could not be if the World and Man had
been Eternal. Therefore <hi>Lucretius</hi> reasoneth very well
in his Fifth Book.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>But grant the World <hi>Eternal,</hi> grant it knew</l>
                     <l>No <hi>Infancy,</hi> and grant it never New,</l>
                     <l>Why then no <hi>Wars,</hi> our <hi>Poets</hi> Songs imploy</l>
                     <l>Beyond the Siege of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or that of <hi>Troy?</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Why former <hi>Heroes</hi> fell without a Name?</l>
                     <l>Why not their <hi>Battles</hi> told by lasting Fame?</l>
                     <l>But 'tis as I declare; and thoughtful Man</l>
                     <l>Not <hi>long ago</hi> and all the <hi>World</hi> began:</l>
                     <l>And therefore <hi>Arts</hi> that lay but <hi>rude</hi> before</l>
                     <l>Are publish'd now, we now <hi>Increase</hi> the Store.</l>
                     <l>We perfect all the <hi>Old</hi> and find out <hi>more</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Shippings</hi> improv'd, we add New Oars and Wings,</l>
                     <l>And <hi>Musick</hi> now is found and speaking Strings.</l>
                     <l>These <hi>Truths,</hi> this <hi>Rise of things</hi> we <hi>lately</hi> know.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> Tho' we may fansie that these greater and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Bodies of the Planets and Stars may have been
Eternal, because they have lasted so many Thousand
Years without any visible Change, as is acknowledged
by all, yet we cannot bring our Imagination to conceive
the Eternity of successive Beings possible, for a great
many Contradictions and Absurdities do follow it. If
Mankind had never any other Production than what is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40791:35"/>
now, then there was never any Man who had not a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
And if all had a Beginning, then Mankind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Eternal; therefore we must of Necessity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Production of some one or more (from whom
the rest have descended) in a manner different from the
present: And there is no Account of the first Production
of Mankind so reasonable or so probable, not to say now
certain, as that which declares the immediate Creation
of one Man and one Woman by the Hand of God. The
like may be said of all other succesive Beings. But
5<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Tho' we should force our selves to
grant the Eternity of the World and all particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yet it could not be reasonably inferred from thence
that there is no God; for they, who desire this large
Concession, must grant to us too, which cannot possibly
be denied, that there have been from all Eternity In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of great Power and Wisdom, from which it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follows, that there is an Eternal, Wise, and
Mighty Being; for Power and Wisdom must proceed
from something that is wise and powerful. Therefore
the Old Philosophers, who did hold the Eternity of the
World, did believe it a necessary Emanation from the
Being of God, and thought not that it did, or could sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
without him.</p>
                  <p>9. It is 4<hi>thly,</hi> Objected against the Being of a God,
<hi>That if it was, it would render the Being of other things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
for if he was, he would be infinite, and if infinite there
could be no Room for the Existence of other things.</hi> But this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
proceeds upon a mistaken Notion of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Nature of God, as if he was some gross material
Substance vastly extended, whereas he is a Spirit, that
is, a Substance altogether different from Matter or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who hath not the Properties of it; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
we cannot draw just or true Conclusions about
him from what is observable in them. God's Infinity is
not infinite Extension; and tho' his Omnipresence hath
some Resemblance to it, yet the Spirituality of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes his Ubiquity and Omnipresence in no wise
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40791:35"/>
incompatible with the Existence of Material Beings of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Substances: Nay, they are only sustained by the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Essence; and therefore the Existence of so many
finite things, which have no Self-Sufficiency to exist of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
doth evidently demonstrate the Existence of an Infinite
Essence as the Cause and Upholder of them.</p>
                  <p>It would be tedious to consider all the little Cavils and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of Atheists against a Deity. The most material are
reducible to those we have now proposed, and may be refuted
by the Answers which we have now given; for they proceed
either from wrong Apprehensions of the Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God, or from Ignorance of the Nature and Relation
of other things, or from an obstinate Resistance of what is
<hi>de facto</hi> evident; and all of them demonstrate their Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
and Absurdity, which doth further appear by the
absurd and unreasonable Consequences of not acknowledging
a Deity, which is a second Way of proving it.</p>
                  <p>10. For, if there be no God, then it necessarily follows,
That either every thing made it self, or that all things came
from nothing, and that there are Effects which have no Cause;
for there is Life, Sense, and Reason, without any being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to produce them: And there are artificial Contrivances,
regular Proceedings, and wise Adaptation of things to Ends
and Purposes far above the Power and Capacity of any thing
which is existent. These and many such things follow the
Denial of a God, which are not only great Difficulties, but
such gross and senseless Absurdities as no thinking Person can
either swallow or digest.</p>
                  <p>As therefore Deformity sheweth Shape and Proportion
beautiful, so the Belief of a Deity appears more reasonable,
by the Absurdity and Unreasonableness of Atheism, which
contradicts common Sense, overturns the agreed Principles
of Knowledge and Reason, confound Chance and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
Accident and Design, and which has its Recourse to
Wild, Romantick, and most precarious Hypotheses; for they
cannot shun the owning an Infinity, and the Existence of
something from Eternity; and they are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that things are framed according to the Rules of Art
and Proportion. Now is it not more reasonable to ascribe
the constant Observance of these Rules to an Intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
than to Chance or no Cause? For there is no middle
thing betwixt them to be fixed on; either the one or the
other must take place. <hi>Nature,</hi> which they talk so much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40791:36"/>
of, is an <hi>Obscure Word</hi> for concealing their Thoughts and
Sentiments: If by this they mean something distinct from
<hi>Matter,</hi> which moves and directs it, their <hi>Nature</hi> is God in
Disguise; and if they must flee to this for a rational Account
of the Production of things, why do they quarrel at the
Word [God] which carries a clearer <hi>Idea,</hi> and in the Sense
of which all the World is agreed. Tho' this <hi>Nature</hi> of theirs
be equivalent, yet it is more mysterious, and therefore it
smells of some designed Perverseness, as if by the Use of this
Word, and the Disuse of the other, they would turn Peoples
Thoughts from God, and God from the Honour of being the
Creator of all things. But if by <hi>Nature</hi> they only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>certain Laws,</hi> and I know not what <hi>Ordinances,</hi> by
which things must move; is this sufficient to explain the first
Productions of things? For tho' it should be true that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cannot move but according to these Laws, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by them in process of Time the Work could have been
produced as it is at present, after that <hi>Romantick Manner</hi> of
<hi>Cartesius;</hi> yet there was no Necessity that <hi>Matter</hi> should
move at all, nor could it move of it self. Wherefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or not, they must own the Existence of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>prior</hi> to <hi>Matter</hi> it self, or the Motion of it, which
<hi>Cartesius</hi> was sensible of, and therefore he could not build his
airy and fanciful <hi>System,</hi> without supposing the Existence of
a Deity. And if he had kept his Eye upon this infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Being, and considered the World and all particular
things as his Work; if instead of a vain curious Enquiry how
things should have been, if Matter once moved had been left
to it self, he had shewed how things are, and explained the
admirable Contrivance of them, if he had given us a History
of Nature, and described the Wisdom of God in the Make,
Order, Place, and Relation of particular things; I say, If
<hi>Cartesius</hi> had done this, as he seems to have been able for it,
the World would have been more obliged to him, his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
should have been more rational and satisfactory, more
useful to others, and of more lasting Fame to himself;
Whereas now by turning his Thoughts from the Ends and
Uses of things, and the Wisdom of the Author and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
he has turn'd his Back upon the only true Light that
was to have guided him; he has grop'd in the Dark and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
nothing but useless Conjectures and the extravagant
Ravings of his Brain, which tickled Men at first, as all
Novelties use to do, but which wise, inquisitive, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40791:36"/>
Men will, and must disgust because there wants Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>As God is the first Cause and Author of all things, so the
Belief of a Deity is the Foundation of all solid Reason; what
is not built on this is Nonsense and Absurdity. I know the
Atheists arrogate to themselves Wit, and Judgment, and
Knowledge above others, and do think that it is the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Credulity of the <hi>Bulk of Mankind</hi> (as one lately
Words it) which make them to be of another Belief. But I
pray you, must they carry away Sense and Understanding
from others, because they are so vain as to think it? Do not
those in <hi>Bedlam</hi> think themselves wiser than others? All the
rest of the World are Fools in their Eyes, and those who keep
them there, not only Fools, but Oppressors and most unjust.
And yet Atheism is a more extravagant and pernicious Madness,
which it is the Interest of Mankind to keep from spreading. But
alas it has been suffered to take Root and spread, nay it is
cherished and encouraged. Men walk the Streets and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
act this Madness. In every Corner they throw their
Squibbs of Scoffs and Drollery against the Almighty Author of
their Being. They meet in Companies to concert how they
may most wittily expose him, and what is the readiest way
to render him ridiculous in the Eyes of others: A Clinch, or
Jest, or puny Witticism is received and entertained as an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Discovery, and carried about with all Diligence. Tho'
there be no Reason why the Atheist should be a Zealot, there
being no Obligation on him to propagate his Opinions; and
because the less they are entertained by others he is the more
secure; yet no <hi>Sect</hi> is become more zealous of late than
<hi>Atheists,</hi> and their <hi>Fraternity,</hi> who maintain their Cause by
an affronted Impudence, by the Exercise of a froathy Wit
more than Reason, and by Jesting and Drollery rather than
serious Argument. And is this a reasonable or commendable
way of handling a Matter so serious and important? Should
Impudence run down Evidence? Should a Jest or a Witticism
be of more Weight than the Dictates of common Sense and
sober Reason? If these Men were capable of Counsel, I would
ask them whether they are absolutely sure that they are in the
right? Are they able to demonstrate that there is no God?
This is more than any ever yet pretended to; and if they
cannot pretend to this, ought they not to walk very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
If there be a God, as there may, for any Assurance they
have to the contrary, what then have they to expect for these
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40791:37"/>
bold Insults and that wicked Opposition to him? A modest
Enquiry into Truth, even into the Existence of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is reasonable, and cannot offend either God or Man: But
Spite and Insolency cannot by any Means be justified. It shews
a Desire that there should be no God, more than Doubts and
Scruples about his Existence, which must needs provoke the
most hight God, and draw down his Judgments, both on those
who are guilty, and on the Land which cherisheth them.</p>

            <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>THO' the Existence of God be most evident, yet I thought
my self obliged to insist the longer upon proving it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is of such Importance; for it is the Foundation of all
Knowledge and Certainty as well as of all Morality and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
The Belief of a Deity is the first Article of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Creed, upon which the Truth and Certainty of the rest
depend: And therefore 'twas necessary to shew that this is no
vain Hypothesis, or imaginary Supposition; but a Truth
loudly proclaimed, and strongly confirmed not only by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but every part of the World. So that whatever the
Atheist may arrogate to himself, and whatever Esteem may be
paid to him unjustly in this corrupt Age, yet he is so far from
being wiser than others; that by the universal Voice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as well as Scripture, he will be declared <hi>a Fool who saith
that there is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I have proved that this God doth rule the World,
which is also included in this first Faith, I shall then consider
what it is to live by it, and shall shew how necessary it is to
the being just and righteous. And I hope that there is such
Satisfaction given in these Essays, that who shall read them
will be desirous of the other that are promised.</p>
