         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>¶Before wee fall in hande with the interpretation of this Epiſtle, it ſhall bee verie requiſite, firſt to laye downe vnto the Reader ſome briefe admonition, whereby he may knowe, bothe how it is to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and alſo how to attaine to the certaine knowledge thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt of all is to bee noted, that all the Apoſtles doe handle one and the ſelf ſame doctrine, and therfore is it not well done of ſome, in that they ſay there bee onely fower E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes, and fower Goſpels, whereas all is one Goſpell, what ſo euer the Apoſtles haue left in writyng.</p>
               <p>Now, the Goſpel ſignifieth nothing els then the preaching and publiſhing of the grace and mercie of God through Chriſt our Lorde, purchaſed for vs by his death. And to take it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, it is not that whiche is contained in bookes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in letters, but rather the vocall preachyng, and the liuely worde and voyce, whiche ſoundeth in the whole worlde, and is ſo openly vttered, that it maie euery where bee heard. Neither is it a booke that containeth the Lawe, wherein are many points of good doctrine, as it hath bin hitherto commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeued. For it draweth vs from all confidence and hope of any woorke of our owne, whereby to become righteous: and declareth vnto vs the riche graces of God, freely and without any our owne merite giuen vnto vs: teachyng vs alſo Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:9409:7"/>
who hauing by his interceſſion appeaſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God, and ſatiſfied for our ſinnes, hath quite aboliſhed and blotted out our iniquities and by his works, iuſtified and made vs righteous.</p>
               <p>Now, whoſoeuer either preacheth or writeth theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he teacheth the true Goſpell in deede, whiche all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but eſpecially S Paule and S. Peter haue done in their Epiſtles, Whatſoeuer then is preached or publiſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſte, is one Goſpell, although one handle it after one ſorce, and in one kinde of wordes, an other after an other ſorce, and in an other kinde. For a thing may be handled either in many wordes or in fewe and may be deſcribed either briefly or at large. Howbeit ſeeyng all tendeth vnto no other ende but to teache vs that Chriſt is our Sauiour, and that we through faith in hym, without any our owne workes, are iuſtified and ſaued, it is al one Word, and one Goſpell, as there is one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, and one Baptiſme in the whole Churche of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thou readeſt then nothing written by any of the Apoſtles, whiche is not alſo contained in the writynges of others that were as it were penners of the Scripture: but thei that haue handled this poynt eſpecially and with greater endeuour and ſtudie then the reſt, namely that onely faithe in Chriſte doeth iuſtifie, euen thei are the beſt Euangeliſtes of all. Hereupon thou maieſt more rightly call the Epiſtles of Paule the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, then thoſe thinges whiche Matthewe, Marke, and Luke haue written. For thei deſcribe not muche beſide the Hiſtorie concernyng the doinges and miracles of Chriſte: as for the grace whiche Chriſte hath purchaſed for vs, none doeth more fully and fitly entreate therof then S. Paule, eſpecially in his Epiſtle to the Romans. Now, ſeing the Word is of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance then the actions and doynges of Chriſte, and that if we ſhould want the one of them, it were farre better to be with out the deedes and Hiſtorie, then the Wordes and Doctrine, it followeth that thoſe bookes are moſt highly to be eſteemed, whiche entreate eſpecially of the doctrine and wordes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. For aſmuche as if there were no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſt, and that we were altogether ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of them,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9409:7"/>
yet were his wordes ſufficient for vs, and without which wee can not ſo muche as liue.</p>
               <p>Hereupon therefore it followeth, that this Epiſtle of S. Peter is to bee accompted among the moſte excellent bookes of the newe Teſtament, and is the true and pure Goſpell, in aſmuche as the Apoſtle herein teacheth nothyng els, then that whiche Paule and the reſt of the Euangeliſtes doe: namely ſincere faith, and that Chriſte is freely giuen vnto vs, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng taken awaie our ſinnes, is our onely Sauiour, as in the proceſſe of this Epiſtle we ſhall ſee. By this that is here ſaied, wee maie likewiſe iudge of all bookes and doctrines, what is the Goſpell, &amp; what is not. For whatſoeuer is not either prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or written after this ſorte, and to this ende, that maie wée boldly iudge not to bee the Goſpell, haue it neuer ſo faire and goodly a ſhewe. This power to iudge haue al Chriſtians, and not the Pope or Councels alone, whiche face and crake that thei and none but thei haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to iudge of doctrines. And thus muche maie ſuffize for the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: let vs now heare the Epiſtle.</p>

                  <p>The word, <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſignifieth that we ſhould be holie in hart, inwardly and in ſpirite before God.

This then is the meanyng of ſainct Peter: God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate you to this ende, that now at the laſte ye ſhould bee holie in deede, accordyng as ſainct Paule ſaieth in the fourthe to the Epheſians: <hi>In righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> that is in holineſſe whiche is ſincere, and altogether entire.

Theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges muſt thou confeſſe, if thou wilte bee a Chriſtian. For this were extreme ignominie, &amp; blaſphemie to the name of Chriſt, if we ſhould ſo denie this honour to his blood, as not to beleeue that by it onely our ſynnes are cleane waſhed awaie, and wee ſanctified.

And here ſainct Peter hath vſed ſomewhat an other maner of ſpeeche then ſainct Paule: Yet is it in effecte as muche as when S.

For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moſes had builded the Tabernacle, he tooke the blood of Goates, and therewith ſprinckled bothe the Tabernacle and all the people. Now this ſprincklyng did not inwardlie ſanctifie in ſpirite, but onely outwardlie and in externall thinges, and therefore is there neede of a Spirituall clenſyng, foraſmuche as that ſanctification was outward and carnall, whereof there is no regarde before God: yet did God thereby as it were, by a Type or figure, ſignifie this ſpirituall ſanctification. That then whiche S. Peter here ſaieth is thus muche in effecte: The Iewes pleaſe them ſelues in outwarde holineſſe, wherby thei are thought righteous, and of a good life before men, but thei counte you emong the reprobate: howbeit you haue a ſprincklyng farre better, for ye are ſprinckled in ſpirite, and are clenſed inwardlie. The Iewes ſprinckle them ſelues with the blood of Goates outwardlie, but ye are ſprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled in your conſciences inwardly, ſo that your harte is cleane and therefore herein you haue greate cauſe to reioyce.</p>
                  <p>Hereof it is that the Gentiles bee no more Gentiles: euen as thoſe righteous Iewes are no more righteous by their ſprincklyng, for theſe thynges are now chaunged and altered. None other ſprinklyng is required, but that whiche maie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert vs, and make vs Spirituall. Now to ſprinkle after this ſort, is nothyng els then to preache, that Chriſte hath for this cauſe ſhed his blood, onely to make interceſſion for vs vnto his Father, and to ſaie: Moſte deare Father, thou ſeeſt here my
<pb facs="tcp:9409:12"/>
blood, whiche I haue ſhedde for this ſynner. Here, if thou doe beleeue, thou art truelie ſprinkled. And thus thou ſeeſt what is the true maner of ſprinklyng. Now if all the Popes, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and ſacrificyng Prieſtes ſhould at once iumble together and bryng all their traſhe, rifferaffe and baggage, thei are not able either to teache, or doe ſo muche as S. Peter doeth here in theſe fewe woordes. And this is the ſubſcription of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, wherein he declareth his office, what that is whiche he preacheth. Wherefore that whiche is here taught, is the onely Goſpell: all other kindes of doctrine (if men accoumpt theim any waie neceſſarie to ſaluation) whiche ſounde not after this ſorte, are to bee troden vnder our feete, reiected, forſaken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and abandoned: Yea all thoſe bookes are to bee loathed, and miſliked, whiche hauyng gaie titles of good Woorkes, Praiers, Indulgences, Pardons and ſuche like, are not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, directlie, and ſoundlie grounded vpon this foundation.</p>

And that which he ſaith is in effect thus much: Ye haue now peace &amp; grace, but not perfectly, therefore muſt ye continually profite, vntill that olde Adam bee wholy killed and mortified in you. Grace is the fauour of God: here hath it his beginnyng in vs, but needefull and requiſite is it that it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies become daily more and more effectuall in vs, and take encreaſe euen till our diyng daie.

But (alas) what ſmall ſtoare of ſuche kinde of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng is there to bee founde in the Bookes, euen of them that are accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted the beſt.

This it is to preache the true Goſpell in deede. Whatſoeuer is not preached after this ſorte, is not the Goſpell, whoſoeuer hee bee that preacheth it.</p>
                  <p>The very ſumme then and effect of theſe woordes is this: that Chriſt by his reſurrection hath brought vs to his father, and hereby alſo Sainct Peter goeth about euen by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte to bring vs to the Father, and to ſet hym a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betweene GOD and vs. It hath bin hitherto preached that wee muſt call vpon Saincts, to bee our interceſſors with God. Hereupon wee haue runne to the holy Virgine Marie, and haue made her our Mediatour, leauyng Chriſte in the meane ſeaſon as an angrie Iudge. So doeth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it commeth and approcheth nerer: it giueth this glorie to Chriſt our Lord, that he is our onely mediator, by whom alone we muſt come vnto the Father. O ineſtimable treaſure which is giuen vs by Chriſte, namely that wee maie goe to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and aſke the inheritance wherof Sainct Peter here ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes doe moreouer plainly ſhewe what mynde the Apoſtle had, why that ſo earneſtly and with ſuch vehement ardencie he began to praiſe the Father, and will haue vs alſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9409:13"/>
to praiſe and bleſſe hym, for the incomparable riches which he hath giuen vnto vs, in that he hath begotten vs againe, and that before we could euen ſo muche as thinke thereof, muche leſſe preuent hym, ſo that here is nothing remaining to preach and praiſe, but the onely mercie of God. And therefore can we boaſte of no workes at all, but muſt confeſſe that we haue all through his onely mercie, whatſoeuer wee haue. Here is now no more Lawe, no wrathe as in tyme paſt there was, when it made the Iewes to flée, beyng ſtriken with terror, ſo that they durſt not goe vnto the Mount. God doeth not now ſtill vrge and ſtrike vs, but handleth vs as fauourably as maie be, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyng and makyng vs anewe: neither giueth hee vs grace to doe one good woorke or twoo, but frameth in vs a newe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a newe life, ſo that wee bee now an other thyng then wee were before when wee were the ſonnes of Adam: namely wee are tranſlated from the inheritance of Adam to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of God, that hee maie bee our Father, and we his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and therein his heires euen of all good thynges that he hath. See what excellent thinges are in the Scripture hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led concernyng this matter. Now inaſmuche as wee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and the ſonnes and heires of God, wee are equall in dignitie and honor with Sainct Paule, Sainct Peter, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Virgin Marie, and all the Saincts.

Howbeit he permitteth vs to liue here to this ende, that we maie bring others alſo vnto the faith, which he him ſelf hath doen to vs before. Nowe while wee liue here
<pb facs="tcp:9409:14"/>
on the earth, wee liue in hope. For albeit wee be certaine that through faithe wee haue all the good thinges of God (for faith as it aſſuredly bringeth with it regeneration, ſo doeth it bring alſo adoption and inheritance) howbeit we ſee not this as yet, and therefore doeth it as yet conſiſt in hope, beyng ſomewhat remoued from our ſight that wee can not ſee and beholde it. Now this the Apoſtle calleth the hope of life: which is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe kinde of ſpeeche, as is this, The man of ſinne. Wee call that a liuely hope, wherby we certeinly hope &amp; aſſuredly looke for eternall life, whiche is now hid as it were with a veile, that it can not bee ſeene, neither is it preſently perceiued but in the harte through faith, as Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle Chap. 3. wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <hi>Now are wee the ſonnes of God, and yet doeth it not appeare what wee ſhalbe: but we knowe that when he ſhal appeare, we ſhalbe like hym: for we ſhall ſee hym as he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe the life preſent, and the life to come can not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, neither can it bee that wee ſhould eate, drinke, ſleepe, watche, and doe other workes of Nature which this life brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it, and bee therewith alſo bleſſed: therefore can wee not attaine vnto this, to liue for euer, vnleſſe wee firſt dye, and forgoe this preſent life. Wherefore while wee here liue, wee muſt ſtill ſtande in hope vntill it pleaſe God to call vs hence to beholde and ſee, thoſe good thinges which we now hope after. And how maie we come vnto this liuely hope? By the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, (ſaieth the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt) from the dead. I haue oftentymes ſaied, that none can rightly beleeue in God, and come vnto hym without a meane, for aſmuche as wee are all the children of wrathe, and of our ſelues can doe nothyng that is acceptable before God: wee haue therefore neede of an other, by whom we maie appeare before hym, who may make interceſſion for vs, and reconcile vs vnto hym. Now there is none other mediator then the Lord Chriſt, who is the Sonne of God. It is therefore no true faithe whiche the Turkes and Iewes haue, who ſaie and beleeue that GOD is the maker bothe of heauen and earth: for thus doeth the Deuill alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and yet doeth this beleefe nothyng at all profite hym.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9409:14"/>
Thei preſume to come into the ſight of God without Chriſte the mediator. Thus ſaieth Sainct Paule in the fift to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes: <hi>Wee haue acceſſe vnto God through faithe,</hi> (not by our ſelues, but) <hi>by Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore wee muſt haue Chriſte with vs, wee muſt come with hym, wee muſt ſatiſfie God by hym, and doe all thinges with God by hym and in his name. The ſame is this in effect whiche Sainct Peter ſaieth in this place: for it is aſmuche as if he had ſaied: we certeinly looke for eternall life although wee liue here on the earth: yet no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by the reſurrection of Chriſte, that is to ſaie, euen therefore, becauſe he is riſen againe, aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth on the right hande of his Father. For this cauſe did hee aſcende, that he might giue vnto vs his ſpirit, whereby beyng regenerate we might bee bolde to goe to the Father and ſaie: Behold I come before thee O mercifull father, and praie vnto thee, not that I putte any truſt or confidence in any praier of myne owne, but for that my Lorde Chriſt doeth make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for me, and is myne Aduocate. All theſe wordes carie an ardent efficacie and fierie force, where there is a harte that beleeueth: where the harte beleeueth not, there all ſuche words are colde, neither doeth the conſcience feele any comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>Wee maie here alſo iudge and knowe, whiche is ſyncere doctrine and true Chriſtian preaching and which is not. For, hee that is a Preacher of the Goſpell, muſt moſte zelouſly and diligently preache forthe the reſurrection of Chriſt: whiche he that doeth not, is no Apoſtle. For this is the Summe of our faithe. And thoſe Bookes of all other are the beſt and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt, whiche teache and treate vpon this poincte principally and chiefly, as before hath beene declared. This article of our Faith is of moſt waightie importaunce. For if Chriſt had not riſen againe, all our comforte and hope were in vaine: and all whatſoeuer Chriſt hath either done or ſuffred, ſhould be to vs in no ſteede. And therefore this maner of teaching is moſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. Beholde, Chriſt hath dyed for vs, and taken vpon him to ſatiſfie for vs to the iuſtice of his Father, againſt Sinne,
<pb facs="tcp:9409:15"/>
Death and Hell, with whom he had a moſte ſharpe and bitter encountrie, yet could none of them ouercome hym, but were by hym all conquered and ſubdued, for that he was the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He roſe again (mawgre the forces of them all) &amp; brought them in ſubiection to himſelf, and that for none other cauſe, but to ſet vs free and at libertie, out of the daunger and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of them. This if wee ſtedfaſtlie beleeue, wee haue a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect aſſuraunce and full poſſeſſion of all theſe benefites: whiche beyng eche waie impoſſible to bee brought to paſſe by our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues or any ſtrength that is in vs, it behoued that Chriſt ſhould performe the ſame. Otherwiſe, there had been no cauſe, why he ſhould haue deſcended from heauen hither among vs, vile wretched and ſinfull men.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when men in preachyng attribute any of theſe thinges to our woorkes, thei doe nothyng els but cauſe that theſe ſo neceſſarie pointes of doctrine cannot afterwards take any place in the hartes of the hearers, nor be rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of them. O, how well ought theſe thinges to be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to vs Chriſtians? how throughly ought this Epiſtle to be vnderſtoode of vs?</p>

God, &amp; remaineth iudge of all doctrines. Contrariwiſe, where faithe and the power of God is not, there is nothyng but error and blindneſſe: there reaſon is caried away hither and thither, from one woorke to an other, in aſmuche as it ſtriueth by her owne woorkes to come vnto heauen, and therefore alwaies thinketh: Behold, this will bryng me to heauen, let me worke this, and I ſhall bee partaker of eternall felicitie and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

The Scripture doeth often compare the croſſe vnto fire: ſo here Sainct Peter compareth gold which is tried with fire, to the triall of faith whiche is made by the croſſe and afflictions. The fire doeth not diminiſhe Golde, but clenſeth and purifieth it, that whatſoeuer droſſie ſubſtaunce is mixed with it, maie be ſeparated from it.

For hereunto tendeth the whole Scripture, that withdrawyng vs from al confidence in our own works, it maie bryng vs to faith: and very needfull it is that we he very diligent in learnyng the Scriptures, whereby wee maie bee certein and throughly confirmed in faith. After the ſame ſorte doeth Sainct Paule alſo call vs to the Scriptures, when as in the firſt Chapter to the Romanes, he ſaieth that <hi>God had promiſed his Goſpel afore by his Prophets in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Alſo when as he ſaieth Rom. 3. that the faith whereby wee are iuſtified, was witneſſed before in the Lawe and the Prophets. We reade alſo in the 17. of the Acts that he did the ſame when he preached of faith to them of Theſſalonica, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he called to the Scriptures and expounded the ſame vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: who alſo on the other ſide ſearched the Scriptures daily, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe thynges were ſo or no which ſainct Paule did teach. This it behoueth vs to doe alſo, that thoſe thynges whiche we reade in the newe Teſtament, wee maie learne to confirme out of the olde. Wherein wee ſhall ſee thoſe promiſes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng Chriſt, whereof Chriſt himſelf alſo hath admoniſhed vs Iohn. 5. <hi>Searche,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>the Scriptures, for they beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mee.</hi> And againe: <hi>If ye did beleeue Moſes ye would alſo beleeue me, for he wrote of mee.</hi> Thoſe vaine ianglers therefore are not to bee regarded, whiche contemne the olde Teſtament, and preſumptuouſly ſaie that wee haue no more neede thereof: when as notwithſtandyng out of it alone muſt be taken the foundation and grounde of our faith. For to this ende God ſent his Prophets to the Iewes, that thei might te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9409:19"/>
vnto them of Chriſte that was to come. Wherefore the Apoſtles did euery where conuince and refell the Iewes out of their owne Scriptures, prouyng Ieſus to be Chriſt. And for this cauſe the bookes of Moſes and the Prophets are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels, foraſmuche as in them we reade the ſame thinges fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde concernyng Chriſte, whiche afterwarde beyng doeu and accompliſhed, the Apoſtles did preache and write. This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence onely there is, that whereas the bookes of bothe were committed to writing, yet is it (not withſtanding) not ſo much requiſite that the Goſpel or new Teſtament ſhould be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in writyng, as preached by the voyce, whiche maie openly publiſhe and ſounde it forth, that it maie be heard euery where in the worlde. Now, whereas it was alſo written, that was more then neceſſary. For whereas the olde Teſtament doeth ſpeake onely of Chriſt to come, the Goſpel is that liuely word and vocall preachyng of Chriſte who is alreadie come. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the bookes of the olde Teſtament, moreouer this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is: firſt the fiue bookes of Moſes are the ſumme of the whole Scripture, and are peculiarly called the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Then are there Hiſtories alſo and Bookes, wherein are deſcribed the deedes and diuers examples of them whiche obſerued Moſes lawe, and alſo of them which tranſgreſſed the ſame. Laſtly there are Prophets, whiche haue plaine relation to the writyngs of Moſes, and haue more largely and in plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wordes expreſſed the ſame. Howbeit there is one and the ſame meaning both of Moſes and of al the Prophetes. Now, whereas it is wont to be ſaied that the olde Teſtament is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated and reiected, it is thus to bee vnderſtoode. Firſt, this difference there is betwéene the olde and newe Teſtament, as wee haue ſaied, that the olde ſignifieth Chriſte to come, and the newe doeth performe and exhibite preſent, thoſe thynges which in the old were promiſed and by figures ſhadowed forth and ſignified. Wherfore thoſe types or figures doe now ceaſe, foraſmuche as that is accompliſhed and performed whiche thei did ſignifie, and that fulfilled which thei did promiſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought there to bee obſerued hereafter any choyce of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb facs="tcp:9409:20"/>
apparell, places, and tymes: thei are all in and by Chriſte (to whom thei were referred) made of an indifferent vſe. For theſe obſeruaunces did not ſaue the Iewes, neither were they giuen them to this ende, that thei ſhould thereby bee iuſtified: but that thei ſhould by them (as it were) ſet forth Chriſt, who was to come.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in the old Teſtament God had a double rule or gouermente: the one inward, the other outward: For he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned his people bothe inwardly in harte, and outwardly in bodie and externall affaires. Therefore did he giue vnto theim ſo many Lawes, and ſo mingled one with an other. As where the houſehande might giue a bill of diuorcement to the wife, if he would not keepe her, but put her awaie from hym, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to outward rule or regiment. But it belonged to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gouerment, whereas God commaunded theim to loue their neighbour as themſelues. Howbeit, now he ruleth onely Spiritually ouer vs by Chriſt: corporally &amp; outwardly by the ciuill Magiſtrate. Wherefore, when Chriſte was come, that externall or outward gouernment was taken awaie: he doeth not commaunde vs to putte any more difference betweene the outward perſones, tymes, or places, but doeth ſo gouerne vs ſpiritually by his woorde, that wee are Lordes of all thynges that are without vs, and are bounde and tyed to no corporall thynges. But thoſe thynges whiche pertaine to ſpirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration or gouernment, are not taken awaie, but are ſtill in force, as are thoſe thynges whiche thou readeſt in Moſes, concernyng the loue of God and thy neighbour. Theſe GOD will haue duely obſerued: for by the Lawe he will condemne all thoſe that doe not beleue. The figures alſo haue their place and ſenſe Spiritually, that is, thei were Spirituall thynges which were ſignified by theſe outwarde figures: Whiche out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thynges are now taken awaie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as where the houſebande did refuſe his wife for adulteries ſake, and put her awaie from hym: whiche was a figure, and had a certaine ſpirituall ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whiche was afterward ſpiritually fulfilled. For God did after the ſame ſorte refuſe the obſtinate Iewes, whiche
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9409:20"/>
would not beleeue in Chriſte, and choſe the Gentiles, whiche he dooeth euen yet alſo: prouidyng that when any refuſeth to liue in the faithe, he bee caſte out of the Churche of Chriſt, that he maie repente. After the ſame ſorte is that conſtitution alſo, wherein it was ordeined, that a woman ſhould bee maried to the brother of her houſebande beyng deade, and to bryng forthe children by hym, who muſt bee called by the name of hym that was deade, and poſſeſſe his ſubſtaunce. Albeeit this bee now aboliſhed, yet is it neuertheleſſe a figure, whiche ſignifieth ſomethyng concernyng Chriſte. For he is our brother, who hath died for vs, and before his Aſcention into heauen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vs, that we ſhould by the Goſpel make ſoules (which are his ſpouſes) as it were pregnant and fruitefull: hereuppon wee retaine his name, and are named of hym, to whoſe moſte excellent riches we ſucceede. Yet muſt we not boaſte and ſaie, that we haue conuerted and wonne men: for all ſuche effectes muſt be onely attributed vnto Chriſt. The ſame maie be ſaied alſo of other figures of the old Teſtament, whiche it were too long and tedious ſeuerally to rehearſe.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoeuer then in the olde Teſtament, is not externall or outwarde, is yet in force and efficacie, as are all the ſaiyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Prophetes, concernyng Faithe and Loue.

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were repleniſhed with the holie Ghoſte, &amp; were certaine bothe that thei were ſent of Chriſt, &amp; alſo that thei did preache the true and vndoubted Goſpell: yet did thei humble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them ſelues thus farre, that thei required to be beleeued in nothyng, whiche thei did not proue ſoundlie out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to bee ſo as thei affirmed: that the mouthes of Infidels might be ſtopped, and be able to ſaie nothyng againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with reaſon.

And alſo thei ſhall neuer bee able to proue vnto vs their childiſhe trifles by the Scriptures: as namely, that he is in a damnable eaſe, whiche faſteth not this or that daie, and ſuche like: wherefore it is not meete, neither ought wee at any hande to beleeue them.

In the Goſpell it is ſhewed vnto vs what Chriſte is, that we maie throughly knowe hym, namely that he is our Sauiour, that he taketh awaie our Sinnes, that he deliuereth vs out of all miſeries, that he reconcileth vs vnto his Father, and that without any our workes, he doeth iuſtifie and ſaue vs. Who ſoeuer doeth not thus acknowledge Chriſt, is altogether deceiued. For albeit thou knowe hym to bee the Sonne of GOD, who died, roſe againe and ſitteth now at the right hande of his Father, yet haſt thou not thereby throughly knowne Chriſt, neither ſhall this knowyng of hym any whitt auaile thee: vnleſſe thou proceede a ſteppe further, and bothe knowe and alſo beleeue, that he did all theſe thynges for thee, to helpe, relieue and comfort thee. Vaine therefore are al thoſe thynges, whiche hitherto haue been obtruded, and preached vnto vs by the Schoolemen, inſomuche as thei were without this knowledge of Chriſt: and entred commonly no further in conſideration thereof, but onely to thinke how muche ſorrowe and greef our Lorde Chriſt ſuſtained in his paſſion: as though that now he ſitteth idle in heauen, takyng no further care for vs, but ioiyng with hym ſelf, whereby the peoples hartes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vtterly drie, without the right vſe of that heauenly dew, and water of their ſoules, ſo that no liuely faithe can growe or take roote in them. Now, Chriſte ought not thus to bee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

as that he liueth and raigneth for hym ſelf, but that he is ours. For other wiſe, what neede was it for hym to deſcende into the worlde, and to ſhedde his precious blood?

Ye haue attained an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible inheritaunce, whereof hath beene ſpoken afore: now therefore there remaineth nothing behind, but that the veile being taken awaie, that may bee openly ſhewed which earſt was hidden. This muſt ye yet expect and looke for, till the tyme come that it bee giuen you to ſee it. You therefore are come to this good poinct, that you maie with boldneſſe and truſt, inuocate and call vppon God your Father, becauſe he is (neuertheleſſe) iuſt, as he that will render vnto euery one without reſpect of perſones accordyng to their workes. Let no man perſwade hym ſelf, for that he is dignified and entitled with this worthie name to bee called a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or the Sonne of God, that therefore God will ſpare hym, if hee liue without his feare: and accoumpt it enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee hath ſuche an excellent name. The worlde in deede iudgeth accordyng to reſpectes of perſones, not iudgyng all perſones equallie and indifferently, but ſpareth ſuche as bee their Freendes, wealthie, riche, fayre, learned, wiſe, mightie, and in high authoritie. But God reſpecteth none of all theſe, hee dealeth in all thynges with indefferencie, bee the perſones neuer ſo high of callyng. So did hee in Egipt ſlea the Childe aſwell of the kyng, as of the pooreſt Sheepeheard. <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. And therefore the Apoſtle here warneth vs that wee lookyng for the like iudgement ſhould ſtand in feare, and not ſo to vaſit
<pb facs="tcp:9409:30"/>
our tytle becauſe wee are called Chriſtians, that therefore wée ſhould preſume that God will any whitt more ſpare vs then hee wil others. For this vaine perſwaſion long agoe deceiued the Iewes, who bragged them ſelues to bee the Seede of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and the people of GOD. The Scripture maketh no difference accordyng to the fleſhe, but according to the Spirit. Very true it is that God promiſed, that Chriſt ſhould be borne of the ſeede of Abraham, and that out of hym ſhould come an holie people: but it followeth not therevpon, that all they bee the children of God whiche deſcended from the ligne of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Hee alſo promiſed ſaluation to the Gentiles, but he ſaied not, that hee would ſaue all the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>But here now ariſeth a queſtion. When we ſay that God doeth ſaue vs onely by faithe without reſpect of good workes, how happeneth it that Sainct Peter doeth here ſaie, that hee will not iudge accordyng to the perſon, but according to euery mans worke? I anſwere. Whatſoeuer wee haue taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng faithe, how that it alone doeth iuſtifie vs before God, is without al doubt very true: foraſmuch as the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth and witneſſeth the ſame more plainly then that it can bee denyed. Now, whereas ſainct Peter doeth here ſaie, that God iudgeth accordyng to workes, that alſo is as true. But this by the waie muſte vndoubtedly bee beleeued, that where Faithe is not, there neither can any good woorke bee: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that there is no Faithe where there bee no good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. Therefore thou muſte bryng bothe thy Faithe and thy good woorkes into one, as in the which being bothe together, is comprehended and contained the ſumme of a true Chriſtian life. As thou liueſt therefore, ſo ſhalt thou receiue, and ſo will God iudge thee. And therfore although God iudge vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to our woorkes, yet neuertheleſſe, this remaineth alſo alike true, that good workes are onely the fruictes of Faithe, whereby it ſhalbe eaſie to finde and trie where Faithe is, and where is Infidelitie. And therefore will God iudge thée accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to thy workes, and will thereby laie it face to face to thy charge whether thou haue Faithe or no. As no man can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9409:30"/>
confute a Lyer then by his owne woordes: And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it is plaine that by thoſe words he is not made a Lior, but he was a Lyer afore that he vttered any lye, becauſe that a lye muſt needes proceede from the harte into the mouth.</p>
                  <p>Take therefore theſe ſame woordes of Sainct Peter in a moſte ſimple ſenſe, and in ſuch ſorte that you vnderſtande wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to be the fruictes and ſeales of Faithe, and that God doth iudge men according to theſe fruictes, whiche can not but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and followe a true and ſounde Faithe: to the intent it maye manifeſtly appeare, where Faithe remaineth in the harte, and alſo where Infidelitie lodgeth. God will not iudge accordyng to theſe interrogatories and queſtions: whether thou be called a Chriſtian or no: or whether thou bee baptized or not: but hee will thus queſtion with thee: Sirrha, if thou bee a Chriſtian, where bee thy fruictes, whereby thou art able to confirme and approue thy faithe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſaieth ſainct Peter, foraſmuche as you haue ſuche a father, which iudgeth not accordyng to any mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſee that yee haue your conuerſation in the tyme of your dwelling here, in feare: that is to ſaie: Feare ye this Father, not in the feare of puniſhment and reuenge (for ſo the wicked reprobates and Deuilles dooe feare hym) but feare ye hym, leaſt he ſhould forſake you, or withdrawe his holie hande from you. Euen as an honeſt and good childe ſtandeth in feare leaſt hee ſhould offende his father or commit any thyng that ſhould not bee well liked of hym. Suche a feare doeth God require at our handes whereby wee maye loathe and abhorre ſinne, and diligently ſtudie to helpe out neighbour ſo long as we haue to liue in this worlde.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſtian that beleeueth well, is poſſeſſed of all the goodes and benefites of God, and is the childe of God, as wee haue heard afore declared: but the tyme that hee here hath to liue, is nothyng els then a kinde of Sequeſtration or Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare of other wine is wont to enkindle and ſtirre vp naughtie deſires: but this wine, to wit, the Goſpell, repreſſeth the ſame and maketh the harte chaſt. And this is it that S. Peter here meaneth, when hee ſaieth, where Truthe is bolden faſt in the harte, and obedience thereunto giuen through the ſpirite, that that and none but that, is the trueſt cure &amp; preſenteſt remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9409:35"/>
this daungerous euil and miſchiefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſide which, there is none other that can be found ſo able to driue awaie and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie theſe euill cogitations and vaine thoughtes. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this remedie (the Goſpell I meane) is entered and taken poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within the harte, all naughtie leude motions do ſtraightways giue place and vaniſhe awaie. Let hym that wil, trie this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hee ſhall duely finde it ſo to bee, as all they that haue made triall thereof, doe very well know. But the Deuill doth not eaſely ſuffer any man to come to that poinct, as in harte ſo to embrace the Worde of God, that he maie feele what a good taſte and ſauour it hath: becauſe hee knoweth full well, what great power and mightie efficacie is in it, to ſubdue and beate downe all naughtie deſires and euill thoughtes. Therefore, that whiche ſainct Peter here ſpeaketh, is as though he ſhould thus ſaie: If you bee deſirous to remaine and continue chaſt, it ſtandeth you in hande, to embrace and ſhewe your obedience to the truthe through the Spirite: that is to ſaie, It neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behooueth you not onely to reade and heare the Worde of God, but to embrace the ſame in your hartes. And therefore, it is not enough, that the Goſpell bee once preached or once heard, but thou muſt continuallie cleaue vnto it and followe it. For, this grace hath the Worde, that the oftner a man taſteth it, the ſweeter it ſtill wareth, and the pleaſaunter it reliſheth. For albeit it alwaies teacheth one and the ſame doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng Faithe, yet can it neuer bee to the godlie and well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mindes ſufficiently and enough heard.

Wee haue oftentymes afore ſhewed that in theſe two thinges, Faithe towardes God, and Loue towarde our neighbour, doeth conſiſt and is contained the whole life of a Chriſtian. Alſo, that this Faith of Chriſte is not giuen to any, but that there remaine (neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe) in our fleſhe (ſo long as wee here liue) many naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie concupiſcences, luſtes and deſires: ſithins that none here in this worlde can be ſo holie, but that he liueth in the fleſhe, and whatſoeuer is in the fleſh, the ſame can not be perfectly cleane. Therefore ſaieth ſainct Peter, be ye ſo inſtructed that ye may abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sinnes which as yet adhere, and cleaue vnto you, and againſt them ſee that ye continually fight: for thoſe be the moſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous and moſt pernicious enemies that we haue, which lye within our owne boſomes: and in the middeſt of our fleſhe and bloud dooe watche, ſleepe and liue with vs, as it were ſome troubleſome Gueſt, of whom (when a man hath once harboured and taken hym into his houſe) he can not againe be ridde. Wherefore, ſeeing that Chriſt through Faith is all and wholly yours, and that you bee now poſſeſſed of his ſauyng healthe and all other his benefites and graces, knowe ye now that this charge and duetie lyeth vppon you, that you laie aſide all maliciouſneſſe, or whatſoeuer is euill, &amp; all guile, that is, that none deale with an other vnfaithfullie and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinglie, let there not bee ſeene any falſhood in fellowſhippe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you (as the prouerbe is) neither any craft and treacherie, whiche (God hee knoweth) is now adaies too riſe. But as it becommeth vs that bee Chriſtians, in all poinctes towarde God to deale, not feinedly and crookedly, but directly, ſincerely and with a pure harte: ſo alſo towardes men, it is our partes to deale plainly, ſimply and iuſtly, that no man ouerreache or vndermyne an other, in buying, ſelling, or ſuche like.</p>
                  <p>So ſaieth ſainct Paule, Epheſ. 4. <hi>Put awaie liyng, and let euery man ſpeake truthe vnto his neighbour.</hi> The truthe is this, that your ſpeeche bee, yea yea, and naye naye. Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

                  <p>A Chriſtian ought ſo to liue, that he maie not care though all men ſee and knowe what he thinketh in his harte: as he that in all his conuerſation and life ſeeketh nothyng els but to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and to be ſeruiceable vnto his neighbour: not fearing any man at all. For euery one ought to ſhewe hymſelf ſuche an one in the verie ſecretes of his minde, as he is outwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted: and not vnder the viſor of honeſtie to deceiue and bleare the eyes of the people.</p>
                  <p>Sainct Peter further ſaieth, that wee muſt alſo laye aſide Enuie, and euill ſpeakinges. Wherein hee doeth very aptlie and well reproue thoſe vices that among men are vſuall and common in their mutuall traffiques and dealinges. This vice of euill ſpeakyng, is a ſinne now adaies very common, and rife, quickly ſlipped into, and ſooner committed then a man would weene. Therefore take heede to your ſelues (ſaieth he) of this fault, yea although ye haue the Spirite: to the intent that ye maie by proofe know what be the fruictes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>

whiche is ſincere and without deceipt.</p>
                  <p>Againe, theſe wordes bee figuratiue. For he ſpeaketh nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bodily Milke, neither of any corporal kinde of ſucking, nor yet of any naturall birthe and natiuitie. But hee ſpeaketh here of an other kinde of Milke, whiche is Spirituall, whiche is drawen by the Soule, &amp; ſucked with the Hart. This Milke ought to bee without deceipte, and not guilefull, as it many tymes nowadaies happeneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much paltring and deceiptfull wares are retailed and vttered in ſale. Truly it is moſte ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that Chriſtians beyng new Borne and yet Infantes, ſhould be nouriſhed with ſincere, pure, and perfect good milke. Now, this Milke is nothyng els then the Goſpell, whiche is the Seede whereof we be conceiued and newe borne, as afore we declared: theſame alſo is our meate, wherwith (after we be come to growth, we are fedde: it is alſo our Armor wherwith we bee fenced, cladde and armed: and to ſpeake all at once, the ſelf ſame Goſpell is all thynges vnto vs. Now, whatſoeuer is thereunto myngled or corrupteth and infecteth the ſinceritie thereof, is the doctrine of men. Therefore doth the holie Ghoſt here warne vs, that euery one of them whiche bee regenerate and newe borne in Chriſt, ſhould carefullie looke about hym, and take heede what Milke he ſucketh, and learne to bee able to iudge of euery doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The Dugges or Teates, diſtilling and draynyng out this milke, and out of whom Infantes doe ſucke, are thei whiche preache and teache the pure Worde in the Churche of Chriſt. So ſpeaketh the Bridegroome to his Spouſe in the <hi>Cantic. Chapter.</hi> 4. <hi>Thy two Breaſtes are like two twinnes of yong Roes.</hi> Betwene theſe ought there to hang a bu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dell of Myrrhe, as the Spouſe there ſaieth <hi>Canti.</hi> 1. <hi>A bundell of Myrrhe is thy Louer vnto mee, whiche lyeth betweene my breaſtes.</hi> The meanyng whereof is, that Chriſt onely is alwaies to be preached. This Bridegrome alwaies ought to lye in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle betweene our breaſtes. Otherwiſe, if Chriſt be not purely preached, the Milke is corrupted, and al thinges are prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, noyſome and contagious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9409:42"/>Purely preached I call that, when it is firſt taught, how that Chriſte hath dyed for vs, and by his death hath reſcued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vs from Synne, Death and Hell: this doctrine is in hearyng very pleaſant, and like as it were ſweete Milke. But withall, anone after muſt the <hi>Croſſe</hi> alſo bee preached, to wit, that wee muſt euen ſo ſuffer as he hymſelf hath ſuffred: this is a vehement ſtrong drinke and mightie Wine. Therefore to ſuche as are but newly wonne and begotten in Chriſte, gentle meate (that is to ſaie) Milke muſt bee firſt giuen: whiche can no waie be ſo conueniently doen, as firſt and formoſt by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng and ſhewyng vnto them Chriſte: who is nothyng at all ſharpe and bitter, but rather euen ſweeteneſſe it ſelf: both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt in reliſhe and toothſome in taſte, without any maner of harſhneſſe or harme. And this is that very ſincere and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Milke, without all deceiptfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And here againe hath ſainct Peter by Milke, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and glaunced at other places of Scripture, as his order and cuſtome is often and very plenteouſly to doe: namely that in the 23. of Exod. and Deut. 14: The Lorde gaue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, ſaiyng: <hi>See that thou ſeeth not a Kidde in his mothers Milke.</hi> For what purpoſe I praie you, willed God this to be written? what matter is there in it, that a Kidd muſt not bee killed, ſo long as it ſucketh? Doubtleſſe, for none other cauſe, but to ſignifie the ſame thyng whiche ſainct Peter here teacheth. For it is nothyng els, then if hee ſhould ſaie. Looke that ye preache gently and ſoftlie to thoſe Chriſtians that bee as yet Infantes and Weakelinges, let them be well fedd, and fatted in the knowledge of Chriſte, ouercharge them not with ſtrong learnyng, for their weakeneſſe and age can not awaie with it, nor yet digeſt it.

Here haue we had ſomewhat adoe, for that wee haue mainteined and affirmed, that theſe perſones whiche commonlie of late yeres haue been called, and tearmed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Prieſtes, are not Prieſtes before God at all: and that aſſertion prooued we cheeflie out of this place.

That if any ſhould bee ſo wilfull in ſuche ſorte, to wreſte and teare in peeces (for I will not call it expounde) this place, as that the ſame were to be meant of a double Prieſthoode (whiche ſome bluſteryngly and boldly haue auouched) that is to witte, bothe of a Spirituall and alſo of a Corporall Prieſthoode, will hym to cleare his eyeſight, and a little better to awake his ſenſes.

                  <p>Againe, we will aſke theim this queſtion, whether in this place, S.

And thei ſhal euen (will thei, nill thei) be driuen to confeſſe, that ſainct Peter here in this place, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto all Chriſtians, and namely to them whiche ought to laie aſide all Maliciouſneſſe, Guile, Diſſimulation, Enuie and euill Speakyng: and to be as newe borne Babes, and to ſucke this ſame ſincere Milke. Behold, how a lye doeth rightly and featly conuince it ſelf. The caſe therefore ſtandeth very cleare, for ſomuche as ſainct Peter ſpeaketh vnto all that be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the truthe is manifeſtly ſhewed forthe by it ſelf, how that theſe maſkyng Prieſtes doe vtterly lye: and that Sainct Peter ſpeaketh not ſo muche as one worde of that Prieſthood of theirs, whiche thei them ſelues haue frames and deuiſed, and afterward, accordyng to their accuſtomed violence and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, haue deriued and drawen vnto them ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the whole route of this counterfait Prelacie is in deede nothyng els, then as it were a ſorte of Idolles and light perſones: euen ſuch Prelates and Biſhoppes as children make among them ſelues at ſainct Nicolas tyde. And as is their Prieſthood, ſo alſo are their Lawes, their Sacrifices, and all their workes, directed to mere ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and for the belly.</p>
                  <p>Thei therfore onely are an holie and ſpirituall Prieſthood, whiche are the true Chriſtians and are built vpon this corner Stone. For ſith that Chriſte is the Bridegroome, we are his Spouſe: and the Spouſe or wife hath all thinges that bee her hoaſbandes, yea euen his owne bodie. For when hee giueth himſelf to his Spouſe or wife, he can not but withall alſo giue himſelf wholly vnto her, and al that he hath whatſoeuer. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the wife doth giue, and dedicate herſelf wholly vnto him.

Theſe thres offices therefore, he beſtowed and bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vnto vs. And ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he himſelf is thus a Prieſt, and we his Brethren, all wee that are Chriſtians haue not onely power and authoritie, but alſo a commaundement and charge: yea it is our partes and dueties, and neceſſarilie behooueth vs to ſet out and preache the glorie of God, to praie and make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion one of vs for an other vnto GOD, and finallie to offer vp our ſelues vnto God.

Theſe and ſuche like outwarde actions both Sacrifices and Prieſthoodes are ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and are now newe and ſpirituall.

If the world doe it not, we our ſelues muſt needes doe it. For aboliſhed and killed muſt al that be, whatſoeuer it is that we haue of the olde Adam, as afore out of the firſt Chapter we heard more at large.

                  <p>But here now, maie a queſtion ariſe: If the caſe to ſtande, that we bee all of vs Prieſtes, and that all haue power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to preache, what ſhall wee then ſaie? Shall there bee no difference among men? Muſt women alſo execute the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Prieſtes? I aunſwere, that in the newe Teſtament it was vtterly vnmeete that any Prieſte ſhould haue a ſhauen Croune, not for that the thyng of it ſelf is euill, (ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man maie if he will haue al his bodie ſhauen) but leaſt, there ſhould bee any difference at all betweene them and any other of the common ſorte of the Chriſtians, whiche thyng in deede our faith can not ſuffer: ſo that thoſe which be now called Prieſtes, are no otherwiſe in that reſpect, then others of the people who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their al the Laitie. Onely this thei vſed to appoinct ſome, vnto whom being elected and choſen by the Churche or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the office and charge of preachyng was committed. And therefore, there is none other difference among Chriſtians, but onely in reſpect of Office, vnto whiche a man is by the Churche lawfullie to be called. Before God there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce at all. For therfore are ſome choſen and ſelected out of the Church, to the intent that in the name and behalf of the whole Congregation, they maie beare and execute that office and function: which office (neuertheleſſe) all haue: and not, that one ſhould haue more power (abſolutely) then the reſt. Therefore ought no man to intrude hymſelf &amp; take vpon him to preach to the Congregation, but it behooueth, that he bee choſen by the

                     </gap> among themſelues a certaine proper ſtate and condition, as though they were ſo appoincted and conſtituted by GOD by meanes whereof thei haue gotten here ſuche large priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that now adaies euen among vs our ſelues here in the middeſt of Chriſtendome there is more diuerſitie and greater difference, then is betweene vs and the Turkes. When thou wilte conſider and looke into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that beare the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, thou oughteſt not to make of them any reſpect or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: as that thou ſhouldeſt ſaie, this is a man and that is a woman: this is the maiſter and that is the ſeruaunt: this is a young man and that is an olde man, as ſainct Paule ſaieth to the <hi>Gala. Chap. iij.</hi> For thei are all one, and a ſpirituall people: and therefore thei are all Prieſtes together, and all bothe may and ought to ſhewe forthe the Worde of God. Sauyng that, in the Church, women ought not to ſpeake, but to referre that to men to teache and preache there, becauſe of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, who hath commaunded that women ought to bee ſubiect to their houſbandes, as Sainct Paule teacheth <hi>j<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. xiiij.</hi> This order doeth God in deede permit and allowe of. But for this, he dooeth not admit any difference of power. But in places where none are allowed to be but women, and no men, as in Nunneries, there might a woman well bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincted to preache to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this is the two Prieſthood, which (as we haue ſaied) conſiſteth in theſe three poinctes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, in ſpirituall oblation: in praiyng for the Churche or Congregation: and in teachyng and inſtructyng the ſame with the pure Woorde of God. He that can do this, is a Prieſt: and whoſoeuer are ſuch, vpon them alſo lyeth the charge to preache the Word: to pray for the Congregation: and to ſacrifice themſelues vnto God. Forſake therefore and renounce the opinion of thoſe Doltes, which call the common raſkall ſorte of Clergie men, or Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes (as thei terme them) onely Prieſtes: whiche kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:9409:47"/>
you euidently ſée to execute no other office, but to bragge out their lewdneſſe with a ſhauen croune, and greaſie fingers. If this ſhauyng and anoyntying dooe make Priſtes, then tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can I aſwell make an Aſſe to bee a Prieſt, by ſhauyng and clippyng of certaine of his haires, and by annointyng and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmearing his hoofes.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, ſainct Peter wiſſeth vs <hi>to offer vp ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, acceptable vnto God by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now, if Chriſt bee that corner Stone vppon whom wee are builded, it muſt needes bee, that all our cogitations to Godward, ought to bée furthered, adminiſtred and doen by and through him alone, as hath afore been ſufficiently declared. For God (although I ſhould pine awaie and conſinne my ſelf euen to death) would neuer a whit regard or reſpect my death: but he reſpecteth and regardeth Chriſte, by whom it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes are regarded and had in price with God, which otherwiſe, he would not accoumpt worth a ruſhe. Greate cauſe therfore there is why the Scripture tearmeth Chriſte, a precious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Stone, ſeeyng that he communicateth and imparteth his vertue and power vnto all them that by Faithe are built vpon him. Therefore teacheth S.

So doeth he here in this place inferre and bryng fower or fiue places of the Scripture toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt whereof, he hath taken worde for worde out of the Prophete <hi>Iſaiah</hi>: to wit, that Chriſte is that precious fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall or Corner ſtone. Whiche place is the very ſame, that wee euen laſt of all entreated of, and accordyng to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie expounded. The firſte and chiefe place is, the Doctrine of Faithe, whiche ought to bee firſt ſet downe as the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if a man were to preache in any place where Chriſt afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme had not been preached. For here and hence muſt we take our beginnyng, that Chriſt is that Stone, vpon whom Faith ought to be builded &amp; to reſt. That the Prophete ſpeaketh not of any corporall or materiall Stone, it is moſt plainly proued by that which next followeth: <hi>He that beleeueth in him, ſhall not bee aſhamed.</hi> If I ought to beleeue in him, then it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that he muſt needes hee a Spirituall Stone. For how or why ſhould I beleeue in Stones or Woodd? Againe, hee muſt needes bee the true God, for becauſe in the firſte Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the firſt Table, wee are expreſſely forbidden to beleeue in any other thyng, ſauyng in him. Seyng therefore
<pb facs="tcp:9409:48"/>
that ſuche a Stone is couched and ſaied in the foundation, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whom wee ought to beleeue, it conſequentlie followeth, that he the ſame is God. Againe, he can not onely be God, but he muſt alſo bee Man withall: becauſe he is to bee partaker of the building, and not onely partaker, but alſo the head thereof. Now, where any houſe or building is ſet vp or reared, there it behooueth that one Stone bee agreable to an other, that eche one maie frame and bee couched and ſquared in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nature and forme that the other ſtones are. Therefore, ſeeyng that wee ought to bee builded vppon Chriſte, it muſt needes bee that he bee like vnto vs, and altogether of the ſame nature that other ſtones are of, whiche are builded and laied v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, that is to ſaie, very perfect, and true <hi>Man</hi> as we are.</p>
                  <p>After this ſorte, in plaine and common wordes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſeth ſuche high Myſteries and waightie matters: to wit, the Summe of our Faithe: and in ſuche ſhort and brief ſentences comprehendeth more then by any mortall man can poſſiblie by vttered.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Buildyng</hi> or edification is, wee haue alſo declared, to witte, It is that Faithe, by whiche we are ſtaied and builte vpon Chriſt, repoſyng our whole truſt and confidence in him, by whiche meanes wee be come like vnto hym: and this muſt therfore ſo be, that the whole diuiding maie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt of all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes aptly agreing together, and mutually ioined &amp; framed one into an other. For it is of neceſſitie, that all the other Stones muſt be placed and couched orderly, accordyng to this firſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>But why dooeth the Prophete call hym, a <hi>Fundamentall Stone</hi>? Truly for none other cauſe, but that, as nothyng can be builded, vnleſſe the foundation Stone bee firſt ſaied (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all the other Stones teſt and ſtate vpon that Stone, thei can not ſtande) ſo muſt we leane and ſtare vppon Chriſte, and acknowledge him as our foundation.

But when Chriſt came, he tooke awaie theſe glorious boaſtes of the Iewes, by callyng the Gentiles alſo vnto God. Therefore of bothe of vs, the Iewes (I meane) and the Gentiles he hath made one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by Faithe: and hath ſo bountifully dealt with vs, that bothe of vs can not but needes confeſſe, that of our ſelues wee haue no goodneſſe at all, but that we be all Synners, and that bothe of vs ioyntly together, ought to looke for our righteouſneſſe and for heauen, not elſwhere, but from hym alone: and that we beyng the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, haue our aſſuraunce of Faithe, that Chriſt is come for our auaile, helpe, relief, and ſuccour, aſwell as for the Iewes. And therefore is he the <hi>Corner Stone,</hi> for that he hath ioyned together theſe twoo walles, knittyng theim faſte one to an other, to witte, the Iewes and the Gentiles, that thereby we might be made one buildyng and one houſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſte of all the Prophete thus concludeth, <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in hym, ſhall neuer bee aſhamed.</hi> In that, the Prophete ſaieth, that thei ſhall not be aſhamed, whiche beleeue in Chriſt, he plainly ſheweth vnto vs, what God hath in his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell decreed, namely, that the whole worlde, ſhall one daie bee confounded and aſhamed: But yet that he will deliuer ſome out of that companie and number, ſo that none ſhall be able to auoide and eſcape that confuſion, ſauyng onely ſuche as ſhall firmely beleeue in Chriſt. In this ſorte doeth Chriſt alſo hym
<pb facs="tcp:9409:49"/>
ſelf, expounde and interprete theſe thynges in the laſte Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Marke, where he ſaieth thus, <hi>He that ſhall beleeue and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaued, but he that will not beleeue, ſhall bee damned.</hi> In whiche woordes ſoothly he alluded vnto this Prophete. And therefore verie well to this purpoſe ſpake S. Peter afore in his firſt Chapter, where he ſaied, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes haue enquired of the tyme and ſearched of the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Prophecied of the grace that ſhould come vnto vs.</hi> And after this maner now ought Chriſt to bee preached, that it is he whiche hath ridde and deliuered vs from this confuſion and ſhame, wherevnto we did al lye open &amp; were endau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gered.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe ſtoute Champions, and braggyng mainteiners of <hi>Freewill,</hi> and of any ableneſſe and power in man, come forth and anſwere this place if thei can. When ſoeuer thou art min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at once and with one reaſon, vtterly to ouerthrowe all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine woorkes, all humaine doctrines, and all whatſoeuer els can, or maie proceede from man, this one place ſhall abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhe thee with ſufficient matter to confute the ſame, that thei ſhall not bee able to ſtande, but to fall doune euen like drie leaues from a Tree.</p>
                  <p>Wee conclude therefore, that whatſoeuer dooeth not ſtaie and leaue vpon this Stone, the ſame to bee in a deſperate and forlorne caſe. This quite debarreth thee from attributyng any thyng at all, vnto thyne owne woorkes. The holie Ghoſte and Diuine Maieſtie ſpeaketh in ſuche familier phraſes, that any man maie perceiue the ſame and againe, vttereth all ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, that nothyng is able to ſtande againſte it. Who therefore dare oppoſe hymſelf, or again ſaie this? Naie, who is he that will not therewith be daunted and terrified? God therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, that we ſhould vtterly diſtruſt our owne ſelues, and relye onely and wholly vpon his goodneſſe, beeyng builded vpon that foundation, which no creature can be able to ouerthrowe, or caſte doune: whiche is as muche to ſaie, as that no manne ſhould truſt to his owne righteouſneſſe, but depende and ſtaie vpon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſte, and the benefites that he hath purchaſed for hym. But what is it, to ſtaie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9409:49"/>
and relye vppon his righteouſneſſe? It is nothyng els, but that I ſhould altogether deſpaire of all help in my ſelf, and enter into this cogitation: all righteouſneſſe, all truthe, and all whatſoeuer is myne, muſt needes quaile, and bee renounced: And I am wholly to put my truſt in this, that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Truthe, and Life of Chriſte, and all his goodneſſe and benefites, whiche I doubt not but are frankly, and freely giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, ſhall continue for euer. The foundation is alreadie laied, wherein I firmely ſtande: And ſure I am that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is not ſtaied on it, can not but altogether fall doune. But he that leaneth vppon this foundation, ſhall not onely not bee confounded and aſhamed, but ſhall for euer ſtande ſo faſte, that no power ſhalbe able euer to hurt him. Therefore muſt Chriſt not onely be a Stone, but a Stone of fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation: whiche thing ought to make vs chearfull and bolde. For it is God that hath ſpoken it, who can not lye.</p>
                  <p>Finallie this Stone ſerueth not for it ſelf, but ſuffereth it ſelf to bee troden doune, and digged ſo deepe into the ground, that it can not be ſeen: but the Stones whiche be couched and laied vppon it, are ſeene. For therefore was he giuen vnto vs, that we ſhould receiue giftes of hym, that we ſhould reſte our ſelues vppon hym, ſtaie on hym, and ſtedfaſtly beleeue that whatſoeuer he is, the ſame to be wholie ours: And whatſoeuer he can doe, the ſame maketh to our ſaluation, in ſo muche that I dare boldly ſaie, Thei are myne owne proper Goodes, and my Treaſure, wherevpon my Conſcience is firmelie ſtayed, and whereto I ſtedfaſtly truſt.</p>

Forſooth, the Scripture ſpeaketh of the ſame, in twoo ſortes: namelie, there bee ſome that doe beleeue on hym: And againe, there bee many that dooe not beleeue on hym. Now, vnto them that doe beleue on hym, he is precious: and it can not be, but their hartes (hauyng ſtill their hope, truſt and confidence in hym) muſte needes bee excedyngly cheared, and made ioyfull.

Truely this: when Chriſt is preached, and that thou heareſt theſe wordes, Beholde, he is the Stone that is laied for a foundation: then art thou vtterly to diſpaire, diſtruſt and renounce al helpe in thy ſelf, and to condemne and accoumpt as deteſtable, all thine owne woorkes and all thyne owne Righteouſneſſe: and onely to repoſe thy confidence vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

What (ſaie thei) dareſt thou auouche &amp; ſaie that Virginitie, Single life, Maſſing and ſuche like, are nothyng worthe? Thou ſpeakeſt thus through the very inſtinct of the Deuill. For nothyng but mere good deedes are accepted before GOD. Yea thei are not (as they think) without ſome ſtrong places of Scripture, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce of their aſſertion: hauyng ſtill in their mouthes, that God hath commaunded vs to doe good Workes. Therefore when wee reiect the ſame, ſtraightwaies wee heare at their handes, Heretike, Heretike, to the Fier with him, to the Fier with him. And thus thei can not abide this Stone, thei vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ruſhe and puſh at it, and doe all thei can to pull it doune, and are therein themſelues ſo cruſhed and bruiſed, that by the ſame very Stone thei are vtterly daſhed in pieces.

It is laied and ſhall for euer remaine in his place: hee that wil ruſhe and bruiſe himſelf vpon it, can not better eſcape but be daſhed in peeces and grounde into pouder.</p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>ſtumblyng</hi> and <hi>offence taking</hi> at this Stone, whereof the Scriptures ſpeake muche.

And thus it commeth to paſſe, that Chriſte (albeit hee bee an elect and precious Stone) is called without any fault of his owne, <hi>a Stone of Offence and Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng.</hi> And as the Iewes did, ſo alſo dooe wee and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.

Now, who is ſo ignoraunte that knoweth not, that all the table of the greaſie Shauelynges, bee nothyng leſſe then Prieſtes? And as theſe aforeſaied Polleſhorne Shauelynges, are not therefore to be reputed Prieſtes afore GOD, becauſe of their crounes, ſo neither before God are Kynges accoump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Kynges, becauſe thei weare Crounes.

                  <p>Here thou ſeeſt how ſainct Peter plainly ſaieth, that there is but one onely <hi>Light:</hi> wherein he maketh it moſt apparaunt, that all our Reaſon (ſeeme it neuer ſo ſharpely to vnderſtande and perceiue) is nothyng els then mere darkeneſſe. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, that Reaſon be able and hath the ſkill to coumpt, one, two, three &amp;c. and likewiſe to ſee, diſcerne and knowe, blacke from white, and greate from ſmall, and ſo of other externall and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde thinges, yet is it not able to ſee what Faithe is. Here is it altogether blinde, inſomuche that if all the wiſedome of al men in the worlde were gathered and incorporated into one, yet were it not able to comprehende or reache ſo muche as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one letter of the wiſedome of God. Wherefore, S. Peter here ſpeaketh of an other Light and that a <hi>merueilous Light,</hi> and flatlie alſo telleth euery one of us, that we grope in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                  </p>
                  <p>Experience alſo teacheth vs the ſame thing. For when we heare it preached, that by our workes we can not obteine any thyng at Gods handes, and therefore that wee haue neede of a Mediator, to make interceſſion vnto God for vs, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vs vnto hym: heere (doubtleſſe) muſt reaſon needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that of it ſelf it was neuer able to vnderſtande and know theſe thinges, and therefore had neede of an other Light and an other knowledge, to teache it to vnderſtande the ſame. Therefore whatſoeuer is not the Worde of God and Faithe, the ſame is nothyng els then blinde darkeneſſe. For without theſe two (the Worde of God (I meane) and Faithe) Reaſon iumbleth at randon, and groapeth after his waie like a blinde man in the darke, catchyng holde firſt of one thyng and then of an other, and neuer knoweth what it ſhould dooe. But when theſe thinges are tolde to the greate learned and wiſe men of this world, thei can not abide to heare it, thei ſtamp and ſtare, thei fret, fume and merueilouſly rage at it. And therefore, S. Peter ſheweth himſelf here, an Apoſtle of a ſinguler vndaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted boldneſſe, in that, he dared to call that <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> whiche the whole worlde in a maner doeth euen generallie almoſte, adore and reuerence as <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, therefore wee ſee that the chiefeſt and eſpecialleſt office of all others, appertainyng vnto vs Chriſtians, is, that wee ſhould ſhewe forthe and declare the vertues and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workes of our God. Theſe Vertues and notable workes, by God for vs doen, are thoſe which ſomewhat afore we haue ſpoken of: namely, how that Chriſt by the vertue of God hath ſwallowed vp Death, deuoured Hell, conſumed Sinne, and placed vs into an eternal life. Theſe Vertues are ſo great and wonderfull, that no man is able to comprehende the ſame, muche leſſe to perfourme them. And therefore it is to little purpoſe, that ſome in this poynt obiect and preach to vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the doctrines of men: they ought rather to preache vnto vs this <hi>Vertue,</hi> whiche ouercometh both Deuill, Synne and

Of this, the Prophetes are euerywhere very plentifull: and to theſe places doeth S. Peter here allude.

Hitherto hath hee very aptlie and orderlie planted the foundation of the Chriſtian Faith, whiche is his chiefeſt drift: Now proceedeth he to teache vs, how we ought to demeane and behaue our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues generallie towardes all Men. And this is truely the verie right courſe and order of true preachyng. Namely, firſt to ſet out the dignitie, excellencie and effect of Faith: how it is to be knowen, how and what it worketh, what vertue, ſtrength, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie, and nature it hath, how it yeeldeth and bringeth vnto vs all thinges euen aboundantlie, whiche are appertinent and needful to Godlineſſe or Saluation: how that no good Work can bee doen by any man, but onely by Faithe, and finally how that by this faithe, all that whiche God hath, is made ours. If

God now haue thus dealt with vs, and hath giuen and beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed all his riche gifes vpon vs, it followeth, that he himſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is ours: inſomuche that by Faithe, we are poſſeſſed of all his goodneſſe, whereby wee can lacke nothyng. What a greate charge therefore lyeth there now vpon vs, to doe in lieu of this ſo ſurpaſſyng bountie? Shall wee giue our ſelues to idleneſſe? God forbid. It were beſt (in deede) euen ſtraight waies to dye, that we might preſently haue the fruition and poſſeſſion of all theſe his gracious goodneſſe. But ſo long as wee liue here, it is our partes and dueties, ſo to deale and ſo to ſhew our ſelues in euery reſpect towardes our neighbours, as God hath dealt and ſhewed himſelf towardes vs. Therefore it is Faithe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſaueth vs: &amp; Loue requireth of vs, that we ſhould ſerue our neighbours and bee carefull ouer them. For that whiche Faithe receiueth from God, Loue beſtoweth vpon our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. That which was ſpoken in one word, maie now largely be expounded and declared in many, as S. Peter doeth in this place. The meanyng therefore of the Apoſtle where he ſaieth, <hi>Dearely beloued, I beſeche you as Straungers and Pilgrims,</hi> is this: You that are now one with Chriſte, are growen (as it were) into one maſſe or lumpe with him, inſomuche that his goodneſſe is yours, and your hurtes be his hurtes: who as he is carefull bothe for you and for all ſuche thinges as maie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you, ſo alſo ought you to imitate herein this your ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Sauiour, and ſo to frame and direct your liues, that you maie ſeeme nothing leſſe then to bee Citizens of this World, ſith you bee adopted and enfraunchiſed Citizens in heauen, where al good thinges are laied vp for you. That if you ſhould once looſe all theſe tranſitorie and momentanie goodes of the worlde: yet hauing ſtill Chriſte, who is infinitely more worth then all theſe brittle and temporall traſh, you ſhall receiue and ſuſtaine no damage, no loſſe, no hinderaunce at all.</p>
                  <p>The Deuill is Prince of this Worlde, and gouerneth the ſame: and his Citezens are the men of the World: Therefore ſeyng that you are not of this Worlde, ſo vſe and behaue your ſelues, as Straungers and Paſſingers dooe in their Inne:

                  <p>For thus is a ſure note of true Chriſtianiſme, when thou ſeeſt thy ſelf neuer to liue in quiet: neither muſt thou thinke to be ſo exempted and priuiledged, as that thou ſhouldſt not feele Siunes within thee: for feele theim ſurely thou ſhalte: But yet thou muſt haue ſuche a feeling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that thou do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all yeeld thy conſent vnto them.

When thou confeſſeſt thy Synnes, and craueſt mercie for the ſame, thou muſte thinke with thy ſelf ſo to deale, as Souldiours are wont: who a little before the Battaile, raunge themſelues into order and Martiall arrayes but when the tyme commeth that the matter is to bee tried by dent of ſworde and handyblowes, then (as though all that had been doen afore, had beene but preludes and ſportinges) they buckle themſelues to their tooles, drawe their Blades, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly

And therefore the life of a Chriſtian is nothyng els but a Battaile or a warfare, as the Scripture ſaieth: and therefore the Lorde our God is called the <hi>Lorde God of Sabaoth,</hi> that is, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: and in other places, he is named, <hi>the Lorde mightie in Battell.</hi> And by this he declareth, what a mightie Lorde he is, whiche maketh his people wage battaile, and to ſtande euer preſt in warlike araye and readineſſe, whenſoeuer the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſounde: to the ende, thei ſhould ſtill thus conſider and thinke with themſelues: ſtande here, ſtoppe there: ſtrike heere, vndermine there &amp;c.

I anſwere: This was an old obiection, which the Ethnickes in tymes paſt alledged againſt the Chriſtians, ſaiyng: that if thei ſhould liue in ſuche order, their Countries and Commonweales would ſoone bee brought to ruine, and bee quickly ouerrunne. But wee now vnto theſe thinges aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere thus: It is true that Chriſtians ought not to reſiſt euil, neither to reuenge them ſelues, but rather to ſuffer violence and wrong, which alſo is a cauſe why thei maie not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, burdenous and troubleſome to Ethnikes. But by this, the Magiſtrate is not inhibited the Sworde, nor iudiciall try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles, for although thei liue ſo orderly that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath any iuſt cauſe to complaine vppon them, becauſe thei offer wrong to no man, but deſerue well of all men, and paciently beare whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is doen to them by others: yet becauſe of falſe and conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaite Chriſtians, and them that knowe not Chriſte, theſe thinges (the Sworde and Iudgement) muſte bee in vſe, that thei whiche doe hurte and wrong to others, maie be puniſhed, whereby publicke tranquillitie maie bee maintained, and the Godly maie liue in peace and ſafetie. God therefore, ouer and beſide his worde, hath inſtituted and appoincted this prophane
<pb facs="tcp:9409:63"/>
or ciuile power, to repreſſe them, which of their owne accorde will not refraine from doyng and offryng harme and iniurie to others.</p>
                  <p>It plainly therefore appeareth, that God hath appoincted and inſtituted the Magiſtrate, becauſe of them that doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: And that therefore Chriſtians whiche adminiſter that function, not onely maie, but alſo ought to vſe the Sworde: namely, thereby to releeue their neighbours, in repellyng and puniſhyng malefactours, and in defendyng and mainteinyng the peace, tranquillitie, and ſafetie of theim that bee good and vertuous: and yet neuertheleſſe the ſaiyng of Chriſte ſtandeth ſure, of not reſiſtyng euill.</p>
                  <p>For although a Chriſtian man beare the Sworde, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a Prince, or any other Magiſtrate, yet ſhould he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vſe it for hymſelf, neither ſhould he therewith reuenge hymſelf for any priuate quarell of his owne: But muſt execute his place and office for the behoofe of others, and this is the woorke of Chriſtian loue, with the Sworde to defende the whole Commonwealthe, and not to ſuffer good men vniuſtlie to be moleſted and trodendoune. Chriſt gaue and bequeathed his doctrine to theim onely, that beleeue and haue Loue: And ſuche dooe ſhewe forth and expreſſe the ſame in their workes. But ſeyng that the greater parte of the worlde beleeueth not, neither obſerueth this precepte and Commaundement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſte expedient to ouerrule and gouerne theim, not as Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (for ſuche thei are not) but as Ethnikes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims: and to ſtaie and repreſſe their ſenſuall and wilfull out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages: For otherwiſe, if thei ſhould bee ſuffered to runne hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long at their owne pleaſures, in their diſordred looſeneſſe, and lawleſſe violence, no man ſhould bee able to liue in quietneſſe, and ſafetie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, there bee twoo ſortes of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> in the worlde as there bee alſo menne of twoo ſortes: to witte, Chriſtians, and not Chriſtians. Chriſtians are gouerned by the Worde of GOD, and thoſe neede not in reſpecte of them ſelues any prophane Magiſtrate. But thei that be not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9409:63"/>
haue neede to bee vnder an other power and rule, namelie the Sworde: becauſe thei can not abide to be obedient vnto the Worde of God. But if wee were all Chriſtians, and obedient to the Goſpell, wee ſhould not haue any neede at all of the Sworde, or any Ciuile power. For where there are no miſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the Beleeuers he hath reſerued vnto hymſelf, whom he gouerneth with his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Woorde.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, a Chriſtian Empire is not againſt the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie and Empire of the worlde: Neither is Ciuile and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane power againſt Chriſt: but yet it properlie appertaineth not to the office of Chriſt, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is an externall and outward thinge, as alſo all other offices, conditions, and ſtates of men bee. And as theſe are beſide the mere office of Chriſte, (in ſo muche that an Infidell and Miſcreaunt maie aſwell beare the Office, as a Chriſtian) ſo is alſo the office of the Sworde: For it neither maketh nor vnmaketh a Chriſtian.

<pb facs="tcp:9409:64"/>
was then dooen and practized, whiche now adaies the greater ſorte of Men vſually committeth. Wee now through the good gifte and greate fauour of GOD, dooe againe vnderſtande and knowe the truthe: And plainly ſee that all is nothyng but mere deceipte and iugglyng, whiche hitherto by the Pope and his Chergie hath been taught, eſtabliſhed and doen. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences now (thankes bee vnto God) are deliuered out of the ſnares of humaine Traditions, and freed from that violence, wherein thei had before entrapped vs: And now are wee made free, and not tyed vnder paine of damnation to doe ſuche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as thei enioyned and commaunded vs. In this libertie we ought to ſtande, and to maintaine it, neither to ſuffer our ſelues to be drawen from it: but withall, we are to take heede, that wee make not this libertie, a Cloake and pretext of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life. And therefore ſhamefullie and verie vngodlie hath the Pope dealt in this behalfe, in preſumyng to compell and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force menne by his Lawes: for in a Chriſtian people there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought neither can bee a compulſion of any good thyng. For ſtraightwaies decaieth and falleth doune Faithe and all Chriſtianitie, when the Conſcience is bounde with externall Rites, and outward Conſtitutions. For, Chriſtians muſt be ledde and gouerned by the Spirite, that thei maie knowe firſt, how that by Faithe thei alreadie poſſeſſe all thynges neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and appertainyng to their ſaluation, and haue neede of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng els for the obtainyng thereof: and nexte, to knowe, that thei ought to employe and addicte their induſtries and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours to nothing els, but to helpe, ſerue, &amp; relieue their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with all that thei can or maie, euen as Chriſte hath hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, ſuccoured, and relieued theim. And that whatſoeuer good thei thus ſhewe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei doe it freely, freendly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compulſion: And that all thynges maie flowe and ſpryng from a wel willyng and chearfull harte, that humblie thanketh God, and praiſeth his holie name, for all his gracious giftes, ſo largely and bountifully powred vpon them. Vnto this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſerueth that ſaiyng of ſainct Paule, <hi>j. Timoth j.</hi> where he thus writeth: <hi>The Lawe is not giuen to the righteous:</hi> For

thei that be ſuche, doe all thyng es freely, willyngly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either conſtraint or commaundemente, that thei knowe to bee allowed and agreable vnto the good will and pleaſure of God. Now, theſe carnall, irreligious, faithleſſe, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faict Chriſtians, knowing the bondes of humaine Traditions to bee broken, and hearyng true Chriſtian libertie preached, come ſteppyng in, and vaunte themſelues for iollie Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in that thei profeſſe themſelues not to obſerue and keepe the Popes lawes, pretendyng for their excuſe, Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that thei not herevnto tied and bound: and yet in the meant ſeaſon omitte, and leaue vndoen thoſe thynges, whiche true Chriſtian libertie requireth, to witte, chearfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrained helpyng of their neighbor in all thynges to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſte of their abilitie, without reſpecte of any Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: whiche to doe, all true Chriſtians endeuour themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: therefore, thei makyng Chriſtian libertie onely a Cloake for their filthie and wicked impuritie, doe diſgrace and pollute the precious name and excellente title of <hi>Libertie,</hi> whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth onely to true Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>This doeth ſainct Peter in this place forbid vs to doe: and this is the effecte and meanyng of his ſpeeches, as though he ſhould ſaie thus: Although in all outward and externall thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ye be free, becauſe you are Chriſtians, and ought not to be compelled by the lawe to obey the Magiſtrate, for that, the law is not made for the righteous and iuſte, as before is declared: yet ought you (neuertheleſſe) to doe it, willyngly, vnconſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not as by neceſſitie enforced, but euen for the loue that you beare to GOD, and for the benefite of your neighbours. This we read, <hi>Matth. vij.</hi> that Chriſt hymſelf did, when as he beeyng free, and Lorde of all, did (notwithſtandyng) paie Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute or Polle money. So alſo obeyed he Pilate, and ſuffered hymſelf to bee Iudged of hym, whereas (notwithſtandyng) he in the verie ſame place teſtified and ſaied vnto him. <hi>Thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt haue no power at all againſte me, excepte it were giuen thee from aboue:</hi> by whiche wordes he expreſſely and flattly confirmeth Magiſtracie and Power: But he yet ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

hymſelf therevnto, becauſe it ſo pleaſed his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that not forcedlie or by compulſion.</p>
                  <p>We ſee by this, that theſe peeuiſhe counterfaites, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng aſwell the thynges that pleaſe GOD, as the thynges whiche the worlde requireth, and ſtill perſiſtyng in their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full waies and corrupte Iudgementes, haue no right vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding nor knowledge what Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libertie meaneth, brag thei neuer ſo much of their Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vaunt thei the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo gloriouſlie vnder the ſhewes and titles of the Goſpell. Wee are (in deede) freed from all Lawes, howbeeit it is of vs neceſſarily required, that withall wee helpe and relieue the weake and vnſkilfull Chriſtians, our brethren: whiche is the verie office of Loue.

If Pope or any other whatſoeuer, would compell and tye hym vnto their Lawes, and to enioyne hym by commaundement to dooe this or that, he maie ſaie againe: Sir, I will not dooe that whiche you giue vnto me in commaundement to doe, and for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, but for that you would binde me therevnto by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: and by taking awaie from me Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to impoſe a neceſſitie on me: wee muſt deale and doe freely as the Seruauntes of GOD, and not as the Seruauntes of Men, as here in this place ſainct Peter teacheth vs. But if any man whom I might therby benefite, ſhould require any ſuche thyng at my handes, I am (willyngly and of myne owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde) to doe it: not reſpectyng, whether it bee a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or no: But onely conſideryng and waighyng, that Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie loue requireth the ſame at my handes, and aſſuring my ſelf, that it is a thyng right acceptable and pleaſaunte to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie GOD, by ſuche ſeruice and dueties to helpe my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Onely here in this worlde, in this externall and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall life there is ſome difference, for in that reſpecte thei are of leſſe accoumpt and eſtimation, and therein beeyng inferiours and vnderlinges, they are bounde to waite and obeye. Therefore, ſeeyng that God hath called them to that eſtate, thei ought ſo to frame and enure themſelues in their dueties, that thei ſhew their ſubiection and teſtifie their ſubmiſſion vnto their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, honour them, reuerence them, be ſeruiceable vnto them, and carefullie looke to their dealinges and buſineſſe.

That which thou thus doeſt accordyng to the Word of God and Faithe, bee aſſured is acceptable and allowed of God: And therefore theſe are the beſt workes of al others that a man can woorke: ſo that a man maie here perceiue that hee needeth not to got farre to dooe other Woorkes. What thy Maiſter commaundeth his Seruaunt, or the Maiſtreſſe her Maide, that hath God commaunded to be doen of thee. Think it not to bee the bare commaundement of man, although it be vttered and doen by man. And therefore thou oughteſt not to conſider and reſpect, what maner a Maiſter he is, whom thou ſerueſt, whether he be good or badd, gentle and curteous, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and churliſh: but thinke this rather what maner a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſoeuer he bee, yet is it my duetie truely and faithfullie to ſerue hym, and diligently to applie my ſelf in his buſineſſe, and that for Gods ſake, who requireth the ſame at my handes: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membryng alſo that my Lorde Ieſus Chriſte for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and freedome of me, became a Seruaunt.</p>

And this doctrine is of ſuche ſorte, that none can well embrace and like of it, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng onely true Chriſtians, who haue their leſſon for the ſame, out of the Goſpell. And therefore if thou wilt be the true child of God, frame thy mynde ſo to ſerue thy maiſter, as if Chriſte hymſelf were preſent, and commaunded thee euery particuler charge to doe.

Sir, I knowe that the thyng whiche I doe, is acceptable and allowed of God: For I haue the woorde of God, and his expreſſe commaundemente for my warraunte, that I ought to doe theſe thinges. This is ſurelie a ſinguler comforte, an excellente benefite, and a right precious treaſure, of the whiche no man can well thinke hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthie.

For God reſpecteth not the baſeneſſe and vile<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of the woorke, but regardeth the harte, that in ſuche vile dradging labours is obedient vnto him. But it happeneth and falleth out in this caſe, as in al other matters it vſuallie doeth: For, looke what God commaundeth, that is no man willyng to dooe: But that whiche men eſtabliſhe and commaunde and not God: that (I ſaie) euery one ſeeketh after and followeth.</p>

Therefore thinke this with thy ſelf: well, in this my ſeruice I ſhall ſerue my Lorde Chriſte: he requireth at my handes, that I ſhould bee obedient, ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and in eche reſpecte duetifull to my Maiſter, bee he neuer ſo frowarde, ſullen, and vnquiete. If God ſhould commaunde thee to wipe the Shoes of the erranteſt verlett, or Deueliſheſt Rakehell in the worlde, thou oughteſt with a chearfull harte, and willyng mynde to doe it: and this woorke of thyne ſhould bee bothe good and laudable before GOD, and ſo is any other woorke whatſoeuer, of the like ſorte, to bee accoumpted right excellent and commendable: for that, God hath commaunded

it. And therefore in this caſe reſpecte not the perſone, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider onely the good will and pleaſure of GOD, and what he willeth to bee doen. Thy duetie and ſeruice in this ſort, truely and faithfullie performed, ſhall before God farre ſurpaſſe and excell all the woorkes and merites of all Shauelyng Prieſtes and mumblyng Monkes in the worlde, if thei were all layed together on one heape. If there bee any that thinketh not this ſufficiente, in that, it is ſo pleaſaunte and acceptable a woorke before God: it ſhall not muche auaile to vſe any further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to perſwade hym. For there is nothing better, if thou doe it: nothyng worſe if thou forſlowe and omite it.

                  <p>And ſainct Peter doubtleſſe in this place, peculierly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuche Seruauntes, as many were in his tyme, to wit, Slaues, ſuche as in ſome Countries yet to this daie, are bought and ſolde, like brute Beaſtes.

And therefore it was neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that ſuch Apoſtles as S.

Finallie, he had power and aucthoritie enough to haue reuenged hymſelf, if it had ſo pleaſed hym: but he ſuffered hymſelf rather to bee reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, mocked, blaſphemed, and laſte of all, put to death, and yet not once opened he his mouthe. Why therefore ſhouldeſt thou bee any whitte vnwillyng to ſuffer perſecution and wrong, ſith thou art nothyng but Synne?

But thou wilte peraduenture ſaie: Sall I allowe and thinke well of them that deale Iniuriouſly with me, and ſaie that therein thei doe well? I aunſwere: No. But ſaie rather thus

in thine harte: although I haue not deſerued this hard dealing, nor to bee thus wrongfully entreated, yet will I willyngly ſuffer theſe thynges for my Lorde God his ſake, who beeyng moſte innocente, was for my ſake euill entreated, and moſte wrongfully dealte withall.

                  <p>Women haue here greate cauſe to reioyce, in that, thei knowe, what Worke to doe, to pleaſe God withall. For, this is ſuche a greate treaſure, as a wife can not haue a greater, nor more precious: in that, ſhe certainely knoweth, that when ſhe ſheweth ſuche ſubiection and obedience to her houſebande, ſhe highlie pleaſeth God therewith, and doeth that, whiche to hym is right acceptable: then whiche knowledge and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, what can be tide vnto her more ioyfull and gladſome? And therefore, ſhe that is deſirous to bee a right Chriſtian wiſe, let her thus thinke with her ſelf: I will not reſpect, what maner of perſone my houſebande is, with whom I am now coupled in mariage, whether he bee Iewe or Gentile, good or badde: but I will drawe my ſelf to this conſideration and reſpecte onely, that God hath appoincted me to bee this mannes Wife, and linked me vnto hym in the bandes of Matrimonie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I am bounde, ſo will I in all poinctes bee ſubiecte and obedient vnto hym.

or no?

The ſame aunſwere maie wee make here. That it is the duetie of eche godlie woman, to bee in mynde ſo vertuouſlie affected, as that ſhe maie wholly contemne this gaie attire and womanniſhe brauerie: for if thei once linke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in loue therewith, (the nature thereof is ſuche) that thei will daiely ſeeke more and more to prancke theim ſelues, and will keepe neither meane, nor order therein, but wantonly and licenciouſly without ende, couet the continuall maintenaunce of ſuche vaine and diſſolute prodigalitie.</p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian Woman therfore ought vtterly to deſpiſe this outward deckyng, and worldlie gallantiſe: but yet ſo, that if her Houſebande will haue her ſo to dooe, or any other honeſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte require the ſame, it is to bee borne withall, and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Howbeeit it is moſte to bee wiſhed, and thei are moſte eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſo to frame themſelues in their attire and deckyng, as ſainct Peter here teacheth them: to witte, to bee inwardly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and decked with a milde and gentle ſpirite. Thy braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and furniture is gaie and gallant enough, if thou decke and attire thy ſelf, to content and pleaſe thy Houſebande. Chriſte requireth no ſuche thyng at thy handemaie, he is highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if thou trimme thy ſelf to the intent to pleaſe the eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, or becauſe thou ſeekeſt thereby to bee dignified and called faire, louely, or beautifull. But thy cheefeſt care ought to bee, to carie this precious furniture, and incomparable gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement (afore ſpoken of) in thy harte, farre from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as ſaincte Peter ſaieth, and to leade a decent, honeſte, and chaſte life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9409:75"/>It is a ſure token, that thou haſte very ſmall workyng of the Spirite in thee, if thou feele thy ſelf to bee muche giuen to this phantaſtical, worldly and outward brauerie. For if Faith and the Spirite were truly ſettled within thee, thou wouldeſt ſooner ſtampe and treade it vnder thy feete, then to take delite and pleaſure therein. And thou wouldeſt ſaie as <hi>Eſther</hi> did: <hi>Eſth. xiiij. Thou knoweſt Lorde that I hate and haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this Croune whiche I weare on my head, and that I weare this gorgeous apparell euen againſte my will.</hi> If I were not compelled ſo to doe, to pleaſe my Lorde the Kynges eye, I had leifer tread it vnder my Feete. A wife thus myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, can not herein but bee muche the dearer and acceptabler to her houſbande. And therefore Saincte Peter willeth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones and Wiues to ſett their delite in attiryng and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyng themſelues with this <hi>inwarde</hi> furniture, and to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a meeke and quiet Spirite, hauyng their heartes voide and free from all corruption.</p>
                  <p>In aduiſing them to be meeke and gentle ſpirited, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng is not onely, to reſtraine them from licencious gaddyng abroade, and other open and outwarde miſdemeanours of the worlde: but his meaning is, that thei ſhould with muche more heede and carefulneſſe looke to themſelues, that their myndes inwardlie bee incorrupt, and that thei conſtantlie perſeuere in a true and ſincere Faithe, not ſuffryng the ſame any waie to be empayred or violated.</p>
                  <p>And thus it commeth to paſſe, that the hart willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth it ſelf within his limitted boundes, without breakyng out into any diſorder, and be thinketh how it maie pleaſe their houſbande. And ſuche an harte, is an exceedyng pleaſure and acceptable attyre before God. If a woman bee neuer ſo richely apparelled in cloath or beaten golde, and garniſhed all ouer (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the foote) with Gemmes and precious Stones of price ineſtimable, this her apparell muſt needes bee very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſumptuous: but no woman can be any waie ſo richlie and brauely attired, as in any reſpect to be comparable to that vnualuable attyre of the Soule, whiche before God is a thyng
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:9409:75"/>
muche eſteemed and ſet by. Golde and precious Stones in the eye of the worlde are thinges highly eſteemed and of ſinguler price, but before God, thei bee thinges filthie, abhominable and of none accoumpt. That woman therefore is gorgeouſlie and richlie attired before God, whiche hath a quiet and gentle ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: for ſeeyng that before God it is a thyng ſo highly ſet by, it can not but bee a thing of ſinguler greate excellencie and ful of maieſtie. A Chriſtian ſoule alreadie hath whatſoeuer Chriſt himſelf hath: becauſe Faithe bringeth together with it al good thinges. And this is ſuche a precious treaſure and riche attire, that no man can ſufficiently and according to the worthineſſe thereof eſteeme and prize it. For it is highly eſteemed and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by God himſelfe. The perſwaſion and inculkyng of theſe reaſons, will bee muche behouefull, expedient and forcible to drawe womens myndes from the deſire of this worldly pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous apparell, wherevnto thei are by nature otherwiſe muche enclined: and ſo to bring them in loue with this inwarde gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhyng, that thei maie of themſelues willingly loathe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt all worldly and outwarde brauerie. For it can not be, that a vertuous Chriſtian woman hearyng theſe thinges, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in harte digeſting them, but ſhe ſtraightwaies entreth into this conſideration with her ſelf: Beholde, if this braue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and ſumptuous apparell bee nothyng at all regarded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, why ſhould not I alſo contemne and deſpiſe it? But if I muſt needes weare it, I will dooe it onely, to pleaſe my houſbande thereby, whoſe pleaſure it is to haue it ſo: and vnto whom, God hymſelf hath expreſſelie commaunded me to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient.

Such an Organe and meane, muſt a manne haue to helpe hym, and therefore ſaieth S.

frame thy dealinges, then thou wouldeſt doe about any other Inſtrumentes whatſoeuer, that thou haſt neede for any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to vſe: as if thou wouldeſt preſerue and keepe thy knife in a good edge, thou muſt beware that thou cutt no ſtones with it.

God referreth that to the diſcretion and wiſedome of eche peculier ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to vſe his Wife with reaſon and knowledge: and as the nature, wit and diſpoſition of euery one doeth require. For thou arte not allowed to vſe that power and authoritie whiche thou haſte ouer her, accordyng to the deuiſe of thyne owne ſenſuall phantaſie: for thou art her houſbande, becauſe thou ſhouldeſt helpe her kéepe her, maintaine and nouriſh her, and not to ſpoyle and marre her.

And although all thynges in houſholde matters, at all tymes be not handeled accordyngly as thou wouldeſt haue them, but many times contrary to thy mynd and appointment, yet muſt thou remember that thou art a Man, and of more wit, reaſon, and perfection then a Woman: And therefore the defects and miſſehappes, growyng through thy Wiues weakeneſſe and imperfection, thou arte by reaſon to amende and beare with: And what any waie wanteth in her, thou arte to ſupplie: Yea, ſometymes thou muſte winke at matters, and ſeeme not to knowe all thynges: ſometymes to yeeld a little, many tymes to forgiue and pardon thynges amiſſe, and eche waie to giue to thy wife her due honour.</p>

In my opinion, the interpretation of this place, is thus muche in meanyng, that the Houſebande ſhould ſo accoumpt of his Wife, and ſo vſe her, as a Chriſtian veſſell, and the organ or Inſtrumente of God. For thei ought bothe, ſo to frame and diſpoſe their liues, that the Wife muſte obeye, loue, and honour her Houſebande: and again, the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande is to giue vnto his Wife that honour, that is due vnto her. If thei can frame themſelues after this ſorte, thei ſhould liue in moſte amiable peace and loue together, and all thynges would goe well with theim, whereas otherwiſe, if this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and mutuall zeale bee wantyng, all thynges in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried eſtate are lothſome, tedious, cumberſome, and ful of grief.

                  <p>Wee can not all of vs doe one and the ſelf ſame Woorke: euery one muſt worke for hymſelf, and in that vocation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it hath pleaſed God to place him.

Doubtleſſe, Abraham when he would haue Sacrificed his ſoonne Iſaac, beeyng ſo peculiarlie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe by God, did therein a moſte excellente and worthie act: but when the Gentiles and other Nations would imitate his dealyng therein, without any expreſſe commaundemente of God, and ſacrifice their children: that dealyng of theirs was abhominable before God. So did Salomon moſte godlie and well, in buildyng a Temple vnto the Lorde, for the whiche God moſte liberallie recompenced hym: now thervpon ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſtarte vp our blinde fooliſhe and pratlyng Buzzardes, who teache vs that wee alſo muſt builde Churches and Chapells,

whereas in truthe, there is no ſuche thyng commaunded vnto vs of God. And herevpon it commeth to paſſe, that whereas wee ought among our ſelues to haue all one mynde, and one iudgement, but diuerſe woorkes, the caſe is turned cleane vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide doune: and wee all ſeeke to doe one ſelf ſame woorke, and to haue diſagreyng iudgementes, and contrary mindes: which is flatlie repugnaunt to the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>All men are now therefore to be taught, that it is required at all our handes, that wee ſhould thinke all one thyng, bee all of one iudgemente and like affection, but yet that wee muſte woorke diuerſlie: that wee haue one harte, but yet many han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.

That whiche is outward, muſt needes bee diuerſe: ſo that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one muſt abide in that, whiche he is commaunded vnto, and wherevnto he is called. This is a true &amp; ſound doctrine for this life, and needefull of all men to bee throughlie knowen, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuallie practized: for the Deuill is moſte buſie in this poinct, yea, and hath alreadie in many brought his purpoſe to paſſe, that fewe men continue in the function peculierlie incumbent vnto theim, but blindlie runne on, and ſeeke to diſcharge their owne peculier offices by the woorkes of others: wherevppon there hath growen among vs muche iarryng diſagreemente: Monkes ſnappyng at Prieſtes, and Prieſtes kickyng at Monkes, and euery ſeuerall Profeſſion of life, ſpightyng an other. For euery one would haue his owne Profeſſion and trade, to bee accoumpted beſte, and therevppon hath growen vp ſuche a table of ſondrie profeſſed Religions, one ſeekyng to be had in eſtimation before an other. Thus the Auguſtine Friers ſought to outcountenaunce, and deface the Preachyng Friers: and the Carthuſians ſtill grunted againſt the Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: So that thei are all growen to bee ſeuerall and diſtincte Sectes, and in no Profeſſion or trade of life hath there beene leſſe agreemente, then among theſe holie religious Orders, for ſo (ſauyng your reuerence), thei muſt bee tearmed.</p>

                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:9409:79"/>But if one ſhould preache vnto theim, that no Woorke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD excelleth other, but that all thynges by Faithe are made equall, that our hartes ſhould continue vniforme, and that wee all ſhould be alike mynded: or if one ſhould ſaie: This Order or Profeſſion wherin the Biſſhop liueth, is before God of no more acceptation, then the order of life wherein the poore Laiema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liueth: or that the kinde of life that a Nunne hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, is no better then the ſtate of a maried woman, and ſo of the reſidue: I am ſure, thei can not abide to heare it: for euery one ſtriueth to bee accoumpted of greater excellencie then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>Therefore to bee of one mynde and of one iudgement, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that euery one ſhould ſo thinke of his owne worke and profeſſion, as of an other mans: ſo that he accoumpt and think the maried ſtate to bee as good, as the vowed ſtate of chaſtitie and virginitie: and that all thinges are equal before God, who iudgeth accordyng to the hearte and faithe, and not accordyng to the perſones or outwarde workes. And therefore we ought ſo to iudge as God himſelf iudgeth, that is, that we muſt haue all one mynde and one iudgement, that vnitie and concorde maie flouriſhe and remaine in the world: that our hartes may continue vndiſſeuered, and not bee drawen aſunder for theſe outwarde by matters: ſo that we are to deeme allow and think well of the worke that any other doeth, ſo long as the ſame is not of it ſelf, Sinne.</p>
                  <p>Of this Concorde ſpeaketh ſainct Paule <hi>ij<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cor. xj.</hi> where hee ſaieth thus: <hi>I feare, leaſt as the Serpent beguiled Eue through his ſubtiltie, ſo your myndes ſhould bee corrupt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt:</hi> whiche is as muche to ſaie, as, I feare leaſt the Deuill likewiſe deceiue you, and drawe your ſimple heartes and agreing myndes into diuiſion and diſcord.

And why is the Apoſtle ſo carefull for our hartes and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des? Truely becauſe therevpon al other thinges doe depende.</p>
                  <p>For if I once fall into a reprobate ſenſe, and bee poſſeſſed with a peruerſe vnderſtandyng, I make a general ſhipwrack of all together. As if I bee a Monke, and therein fullie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, that my woorkes are more regarded and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before God, then other mens: and ſhould ſaie: I thanke thee O GOD, that I am become a Monke: my profeſſion is farre better then the vulgare ſtate of maried life: therevppon ſtraightwaies neceſſarilie ariſeth a ſwelling arrogancie of the minde: and a vaine puffyng vp of the hart can not but be there, where I ſeeme in myne owne eyes to bee more iuſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous then others be, and in reſpect of my ſelf contenme other men. By whiche meanes I wilfullie beguile my ſelf: for there is no maried woman liuyng in the true and ſincere Faithe of Chriſt, but is muche more eſteemed before God, then I with my lowſie Profeſſion and witleſſe Vowe. Therfore when we acknowledge &amp; aſſuredly knowe that Faithe bringeth with it all thinges that be expedient and needefull for a Chriſtian man to haue, then are wee all of one mynde, heart and iudgement, without makyng any difference of workes, or preferryng one before an other.</p>
                  <p>Thinke therefore that this place of S.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9409:86"/>
I therefore in theſe thinges doe thus glorifie God, and repute his workes as precious and holie. I doe thereby ſanctifie hym in my harte.

But hee that is a true Chriſtian, muſt entierlie aſcribe all iuſtice vnto God, and vnto himſelf (as truthe it is) all iniuſtice: to acknowledge God euer holie, and himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: and ſincerely to profeſſe and confeſſe that God is in all his doinges moſt iuſt and holie.

If he doe not puniſhe me but pardon my treſpaſſe &amp;

For although I haue grieuouſlie ſinned and am guiltie of hainous offences before the Maieſtie of God, yet haue I not thereby wronged hym, that without cauſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mee. Therfore when God giueth leaue to the Deuill and euill perſones to haue power to woorke any harme vnto thee, and to afflict thee, hauyng doen no harme vnto them: knowe this, that God vſeth them as Executioners of his Iuſtice: that thou maieſt thereby learne, that godleſſe perſons and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſes, are to the godlie, thinges bothe good, expedient and profitable.</p>

I will giue vnto hym, the lande of Aegypt for his labour, and it ſhall bee the wages for his Armie, for he ſerued againſte it, and thei wrought for me, ſaieth the Lorde God.</hi> This Kyng had neither right, nor aucthoritie ouer the Egyptians, but GOD had bothe: And therefore it pleaſed hym, by this Kyng and his Armie, as by his inſtrumentes, to take puniſhement on theim. And in this ſorte alſo are euill and graceleſſe perſones the Seruauntes of GOD, and ſerue hym: becauſe thei ſhould not bee fedde at his hande francklie and freelie, without doyng ſomewhat for their liuyng. For God commonlie franketh and pampereth theim full of theſe Temporall pleaſures, and worldlie delightes: in lieu whereof he vſeth their miniſterie and ſeruice, to woorke his will, and that thei ſhould Butcherlie perſecute his Sainc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Whiche purpoſe of God, becauſe theſe bloodie Wolues by their fleſhelie reaſon, can not looke into: thei thereby nozzle themſelues in this errour, that thei thinke themſelues to deale therein verie well and godlie. Whereas in deede thei are in

And therefore if thou pacientlie ſuffer, and ſanctifie God in thy dealynges, yeeldyng vnto hym thankes for all thinges, whatſoeuer it pleaſeth him to ſende vnto thee, there is no doubt but all goeth well with thee, For, he will neuer faile them that vnfeinedlie truſte in hym, but will aſſuredlie throwe and caſte thy perſecutours (excepte thei earneſtlie repent) into hell fire, there to bee perpetually tormented euen for the wronges that thei haue dooen vnto thee: whereas thée he will mercifullie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue into endleſſe bliſſe and felicitie. And therefore be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to let hym iudge and requite: for of hym ſhall euery one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, accordyng to his deſertes.</p>
                  <p>An example hereof wee haue in the holie man <hi>Iob.</hi> Who after that all his goodes were conſumed, his Cattall taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, his Children ſlaine, and al that he had, waſted: brake out into no worſe woordes then theſe: <hi>The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lorde hath taken awaie againe, euen as it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, ſo is it come to paſſe, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.

Firſt the words them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues doe ſounde, as though Chriſte had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto Spirites: I meane, the Soules of them that would not beleeue in the tyme that Noah built the Arke.

Some peraduenture will not ſticke to take theſe woordes ſo, as that Chriſte after his deathe on the Croſſe, went downe into Hell, and preached to the Soules there: with whiche vain opinion I meane not here to enter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. But mee thinkes, theſe wordes doe very well admit an other ſenſe &amp; meanyng, to wit, that our Lorde Chriſt, after his aſcenſion into Heauen, came in Spirite and preached, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeit not bodilie. For hee ſpeaketh not now with any bodilie voyce, as he alſo vſeth none of the other functions of corporall or bodily nature. And therefore, let vs take the wordes to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and meane, accordyng as thei ſounde, that is, in Spirite: and that he preached to the Spirites in that his ſpirituall life. Wherevppon it alſo followeth that his preachyng then was ſpirituall, emplantyng the ſame in their hartes and Soules: ſo that, there was no neede for him to goe in bodie and preache with mouth for the ſame. Theſe words of ſainct Peter proue not, that after he dyed, he went doune vnto the Ghoſts that are in Hell to preache vnto them. For he ſaieth thus: <hi>In whiche he went &amp;c.</hi> Whiche is aſmuche as if he had ſaied: After he was deade accordyng to the fleſhe and quickened accordyng to the Spirite, (that is) after hee had laied doune and left his life in the fleſhe, and all other naturall workes and functions of his bodie, and had now taken vnto him a ſpirituall life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as now he hath and doeth in heauen: then hee went and preached to the Spirites &amp;c. Now it is moſt euident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb facs="tcp:9409:95"/>
that Chriſt deſcended not eftſoones to Hell, after he had receiued this his newe glorified life. And therefore wee muſt vnderſtande, that he made this preachyng, after his Aſcenſion into Heauen.</p>
                  <p>Seyng therefore that the wordes doe well beare to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a Spirituall preachyng: wee are to thinke that S. Peter in this place ſpeaketh, of the Office of Chriſte: for that as the worde is outwardly preached by Voyce, ſo worketh he inwardly in the harte. Hee enioyned his Apoſtles, to preache the Goſpell bodily, but yet is hee hymſelf preſent ſpiritually: and whatſoeuer the Apoſtles vtter in outwarde ſpeeche to the bodily eares of men, that doethe he ſpeake and preache into the hartes and myndes of them inwardlie. And then preacheth hee to the Spirites, whom the Deuill holdeth captiue and in thraldome: ſo that wee take this worde <hi>(went)</hi> and theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>preachyng to the Spirites that are in priſon</hi> accordyng to the accoumpt and computation of God himſelf, becauſe in the ſight of Chriſte thei that haue been long ſince, are euen in the ſame ſtate as thei bee that now preſently liue. For his Kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome reacheth to the deade aſwell as to the liuyng. In that life wherein hee now liueth, the Beginning, the Middle and the ende of the Worlde, are conteined and reckened after one and the ſame accoumpt &amp; all as one: although in this life theſe thinges bee not reckened ſo, but eche thyng accordyng to his orderly ſucceſſion, as the Sonne after the Father, and ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All thinges lye naked to the ſight of GOD, and are as now preſent vnto his eyes: and he in one moment or minute of tyme ouerlooketh and ſurueigheth all that is, was or ſhalbee. <hi>A thouſande yeeres with hym are but as one daie,</hi> as ſaincte Peter in his ſeconde Epiſtle declareth. And therefore the firſt man is as preſent vnto him, as the man that ſhalbe laſt borne, for with one glaunce he beholdeth at once the whole Worlde.</p>
                  <p>Let this therfore be the meanyng of this place: that Chriſt now preacheth not any more corporallie, but is preſent in his Woorde, and thereby preacheth to the Spirites in their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And here wee muſt note, that Saincte Peter vſeth a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9409:95"/>
named <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> which is, when the <hi>whole</hi> is taken for a <hi>parte:</hi> and contrariwiſe, when the <hi>parte</hi> is taken for the <hi>whole.</hi> For hee preached not altogether vnto them alone, but vnto all that are like vnto them, and of ſemblable diſpoſition to theirs: As if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (for example ſake) ſhould now ſaie: This man preached among the Heluetians, who ſometymes were vnder the gouernement of the Dukes of Auſtria. It herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by and by followeth not, that hee preached to theim that ſometymes were Vaſſalles to the Dukes of Auſtria, and are now long ſince dead: but it ſufficeth to ſaie, that he preached to the people dwellyng now, in that Countrie, which afore liued in ſuche ſubiection. And thus vnder the name of the <hi>parte,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> is many tymes vnderſtoode, and the <hi>whole</hi> againe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes is put to ſignifie the <hi>Parte.</hi> And after this ſorte muſt we by this life haue reſpect, and conſideration of the other life.</p>
                  <p>This is the beſte interpretation in my Iudgemente that can bee for this place: howbeit if any manne bryng a better, I will bee glad (as meete it is) to allowe of it. But to be plaine, I can not at any hande bee perſwaded to beleeue, that Chriſte beeyng quickened in Spirite (that is, hauyng now taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym a Spirituall life) did deſcende into Helle, and preache to the Soules there: ſpeciallie, ſeeyng the Scripture is flatte againſte any ſuche matter: affirmyng that when thynges are brought to that poinct, euery one ſhall receiue accordyngly as he hath dooen and beleeued. Againe, it is not certaine in what ſtate the dead remaine. To conclude, the woordes themſelues are againſt any ſuche meanyng for the deade. Now, this is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, that Chriſte is preſente and preacheth in the harte, when as the faithfull Miniſter or vocall Preacher, with fruite vttereth and inſtilleth the Woorde of God into the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: and therefore wee maie boldly and without daunger, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and embrace this interpretation of this place. He to whom God hath reueiled, and opened a better expoſition, I wiſhe to be followed. The verie ſumme therefore of this our Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is this: Chriſte beyng now quickened in Spirite (that is, after he was aſcended into Heauen) preached afterwarde

For as he there generallie exhorted vs to ſuffer affliction and perſecution (if ſo the will of God bee) and for the ſame, ſett Chriſt for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto vs: ſo doeth hee here more largely handle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame, makyng thereof as it were a repetition: ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: Foraſmuch as Chriſt our Graund Captaine and head, ſuffred in the fleſhe for vs, and alſo by his bitter paſſion redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs, and in his ſuffryng became an Example vnto vs, it is moſt meete and our bounded duties are to imitate him, and to bee likewiſe armed and furniſhed. For, the life of Chriſte, and eſpecially his paſſion, is ſet doune vnto vs in the Scriptures after two ſortes. Firſt, as a free Gift giuen vnto vs (as ſainct Peter in the third Chapter afore hath worthilie deſcribed and ſet him doune vnto vs) moſte chiefly labouring to builde vs on him by Faithe, and teaching vs that by the Bloud of Chriſt all our ſinnes are expiated and clearely done awaie, and we freed from the thraldome of our tranſgreſſions, and reſtored to the participation of eternall life: ſeeyng that Chriſte was freely giuen vnto vs: all whiche benefites can of vs bee none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conceiued and apprehended then by Faith onely. And of this hee ſpake afore, where he ſaied, that <hi>Chriſte once ſuffred for our Sinnes.</hi> This is the principall and the chiefeſt poinct of all, and in the holie Scriptures ſet doune as moſt excellent. And ſecondlie, Chriſte was giuen and ſet forthe vnto vs, as an Example or patterne for vs to imitate.</p>
                  <p>For when as wee haue once apprehended and taken holde of Chriſt as a free Gift, by Faithe, wee muſt nexte endeuour our ſelues and bende all our ſtudies to imitate and reſemble him in the whole courſe of his life, vnto paſſion. After this ſorte,
<pb facs="tcp:9409:99"/>
doeth ſainct Peter here commende vnto vs, Chriſtes paſſion. He purpoſelie ſpeaketh not hereof the workes of Loue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ſerue our Neighbour, which bee properly called Good workes (for of them hath he alreadie ſpoken very ſufficiently) but of ſuche workes as concerne our owne bodies: as namely, when wee ſerue our ſelues, and bee ſo carefull of our owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, that our Faithe (while wee mortifie our Sinnes) may be the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, and we our ſelues the fitter to ſerue our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For when as I doe tame and bridle myne owne bodie, and keepe it vnder, that it waxe not wanton and proue to laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiouſnes, I ſhall not haue any delight to enueigle my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wife or his daughter to ſatiſfie my inordinate luſtes. So likewiſe, if I my ſelf kill and quench in mine owne mynd, the flames of ſpightfull enuie and cancarde hatred, am I not a greate deale the fitter to deale louingly and gentlie with my neighbour? I haue oftentymes afore ſaied, that although by Faith we bee fullie iuſtified, and haue Chriſte with all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites fullie our owne, yet ought wee to applye our ſelues to good Workes, and to ſeeke (all that wee can) the benefite and commoditie of our Neighbour. For we are neuer perfectly purged and cleane ſo long as we dwell in this worlde: there is no man but feeleth and findeth in his Bodie a Storehouſe of many euill luſtes and filthie deſires. For Faithe beginneth to mortifie Sinnes, and to bryng with it an heauenly life: but it is not as yet here perfect and ſtrong enough to doe that which it would: Euen as Chriſte reaſoned of the Samaritan, which was not yet wholly reſtored to health, although his woundes were bounde vp, and charge enough giuen for his curyng and looking to: ſo fareth it with vs. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleue, our woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are bound vp that is to ſaie, the infection and diſeaſe which by propagation is deriued into vs from Adam, is begonne to bee healed: whiche is brought to paſſe (as wee ſee) in ſome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſelie and ſlowly, in other ſome, ſpeedily and quickly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as euery one chaſtiſeth himſelf and repreſſeth his fleſh, and hath a fuller meaſure of Faithe giuen vnto hym.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, when we haue attained theſe two, Faithe,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9409:99"/>
and Charitie, our next ſtudie and care ought to be, euen vntill wee dye, to ſkowre and pourge theſe reliques of Synne, yet harboroughyng within vs. And therefore ſaieth ſainct Peter, <hi>Arme ye your ſelues likewiſe with the ſame mynde,</hi> that is, confirme your myndes, and ſtrengthen your hartes in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, to dooe as Chriſt hath dooen afore you. For if wee be right Chriſtians, wee ought thus to thinke with our ſelues. My Lorde GOD hath ſuffred for me, hath ſhew his precious blood for me, and hath ſuffred Death on the Croſſe for me: why ſhould I bee ſuche a baſtarde, to bee vnwillyng to ſuffer any kinde of affliction? For, if our Lorde hymſelf iſſue out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brunte and breaſte of the Battaile, how muche more meete is it for vs, beyng his poore Seruauntes, ioyfully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and vndertake any daunger?

Euen ſo ſaieth Saincte
<pb facs="tcp:9409:100"/>
Peter in this place, that Chriſt ſuffred in the Fleſhe: whereas it is certaine, that his Paſſion was not onely in the Fleſhe but in his Soule alſo, whiche adode that moſte extreme agoine, whereof Eſaie ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>And after the ſame ſorte muſt we alſo take this that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <hi>He whiche ſuffreth in the Fleſhe, ceaſeth from Synne.</hi> For this is not the meaning of it, that he whiche hath his head chopped of, or his bodie onely diſmembred, ceaſſeth from ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but this <hi>ſuffryng in the Fleſhe</hi> comprehendeth in it, what ſoeuer it bee that aggreeueth and vtterly diſcontenteth Man, or that whiche ſhalbee his happe willinglie to ſuffer and beare: what Miſerie, Calamitie, Vexation, or neceſſitie ſo euer it bee. For there are a greate ſorte, that beeyng ſounde in bodie, are (notwithſtandyng) inwardly in mynde greatly perplexed and diſquieted, and in harte greeuouſly tormented. Now, if theſe grieues be laied vpon them, for Chriſtes cauſe, it is good and commobious for them: for he that is afflicted in the Fleſhe (ſaith he) <hi>ceaſſeth from Synne.</hi> For this purpoſe is the Croſſe very profitable, becauſe thereby Synnes are qualified, and greatly alaied. For when a Manne once beginneth earneſtly, and from the verie bottome of his harte to repente, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to ſee, how ſoone and how quickely Luſte, Enuie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and other ſynnes doe vaniſhe awaie and ceaſſe.

                  <p>For as ſoone as wee haue vowed our ſincere Faithe vnto God, and haue giuen our names to ſerue hym: God lingereth not long, neither maketh any delaie, but preſently withall, laieth his Croſſe vppon vs, to trie and confirme vs in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and to make our Faithe the more ſtrong and effectual. The holie Goſpell is a Worde of wonderfull power, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can not ſhewe out his proper force and might otherwiſe, then in Temptation and Affliction. And no manne is euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to declare or to knowe, what the mightie power and vertue thereof is, vnleſſe he haue experimented and taſted the ſame in Tribulation. Whereſoeuer the Croſſe and Affliction bee, there namely doeth the glorious Goſpell of GOD, bothe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaie and exerciſe his force, might and vertue. It is the worde of life, and therefore can not declare out his mightie operation and power, otherwiſe then in Death. And therefore where
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9409:106"/>
there is not a Death and affliction, there is no manne that can tell or trie, what the force and power thereof is, and how farre ſtronger it is then either Sinne or Death. And therefore it is, that he ſaieth [<hi>Whiche is kindled among you to proue you</hi>] that is to ſay: GOD neuer ſendeth vnto you any Affliction or fire, (that is, any Croſſe or tribulation) to make a fierie triall of you, but he doeth it to prooue, whether you will ſticke vnto hym, and depende vpon his holie Woorde and Prouidence, or no.

by other Titles or names, whereof the Scripture maketh no mention at all: But not reſpectyng the order, wherein thinges preſently ſtande, weigh and conceiue the mater thus: When S. Peter or any other of the Apoſtles, came into any Citie wherein Chriſtians were, thei ordeined ſome one or other of theim, ſuche as liued honeſtly and vnblameably, and had wife and children, and alſo ſkilfull in the Scriptures of GOD, to haue the ſuperintendencie and charge ouer the reſt. And them thei called Seniors or Elders, whom afterward bothe ſainct Peter and alſo Saincte Paule called Biſhopps, whereby wee maie note, that Biſhoppes were none others, then the verie ſame, that were <hi>Elders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touchyng this purpoſe, wee reade in the hiſtorie of ſainct Martine, how a ceirtaine man came vnto a place in Apbrica, and there in a poore Cotage found an elderly man, whom thei thought to haue been ſome plaine Countrieman. Within a while, thei ſawe many people come flockyng to hym, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he preached and expounded the Woorde of God, whereby thei perceiued that he was their Paſtour or Biſhopp. For in thoſe daies, there was no difference either in apparaile, or maners betweene the Biſhoppes, and the reſidue of Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The Elders (ſaieth S. Peter) vppon whom the charge lieth, to feede the flocke of Chriſt with the Worde of GOD, and to haue care ouer them in the Lorde, I exhort, whiche am alſo an Elder. Whereby it manifeſtly appeareth, that thei whom he here nameth <hi>Elders,</hi> were ſuche as laboured in the miniſterie of the Woorde, and diligently preached the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges of the Goſpell. For, ſuche as he was that calleth hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their fellowe Elder, ſuche alſo appeareth it that thei were. And here we ſee; how farre he humbleth and abaſeth hymſelf, in that, he taketh not vpon hym the name of a Prelate, (which in reſpecte that he was an Apoſtle of the Lorde he might haue doen) but calleth himſelf a <hi>Fellowe Elder, and alſo a witneſſe of the ſuffrynges of Chriſte.</hi> As if he had ſaied: I doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preache, but I am alſo emong thoſe Confeſſours of Chriſt, that are exerciſed in daiely afflictions.

This worde <hi>(Feede)</hi> the Pope hath raked and haled vnto hym ſelf, whereby he goeth aboute to prooue hymſelf Lorde and Prince of all, and that it is in his owne choiſe and aucthoritie, to deale with the Sheepe as he liſteth hymſelf. But alas, who is ſo ignoraunte that knoweth not, what this woorde <hi>(Feede)</hi> meaneth: To witte, that the Paſtours and Sheepheardes ought to prouide Paſture for their Sheepe, and to ſee theim

                  <p>Furthermore S.

Contrarie to the bold practiſe and cuſtomable dealyng of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Biſhops, whiche accoumpt and call euery one within their Dioceſſe and iuriſdiction, their Sheepe. We are the Sheepe of Chriſte, for he ſaied afore, <hi>Ye are now retourned vnto the Sheepheard and Biſhoppe of your Soules.</hi> Biſhopps are the Miniſters of Chriſte, to keepe his Sheepe, and to giue them meate and paſture. And therefore <hi>to feede,</hi> is nothyng els then to preache the Goſpel, wherwith their Soules maie be fedde, fatted and fructified, that ſo the Shepe maie be nouriſhed with the Goſpell. This is the onely and proper office of a Biſhopp.</p>
                  <p>So ſaied Chriſt vnto Peter: <hi>Feede my Sheepe, Ioh. xxj.</hi> that is, the Sheepe whiche I committe vnto thee to feede, are not <hi>thyne,</hi> but <hi>myne.</hi> Howbeeit theſe woordes haue been ſo canuaſſed and wreſted by my Lorde the Pope, that he thereby vſurpeth and exerciſeth an externall domination and Lordſhip ouer the Churche of Chriſte, whereas neither he, nor any of his ſacrilegious Chapleins, preacheth ſo muche as one worde of the Goſpell.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9409:113"/>
ſake, but yet there is nothyng extant that was written by any of them, whiche is Euangelicall. And yet thei ſtill bragge and crake, that it is their charge to feede, whereas in deede thei doe nothing els but entangle, and clogge mennes conſciences with Lawes of their owne, and make hauocke and ſale of mennes Soules, neuer troublyng theimſelues with preachyng one woorde of Chriſte his ſacred Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that there are many to bee founde, aſwell wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as men, whiche are able to preache, and that with no leſſe dexteritie and ſufficiencie, then he vnto whom that charge and office is peculiarly committed. But becauſe the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the flocke alwaies is of weakelynges, therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that ſome bee appoincted to ſtrengthen and confirme ſuche, and to keepe backe the Wolfe from ruſſhyng in emong them and deuouryng them. For a Preachers office and duetie is not onely to feede, that is, to teache his Sheepe, how thei ought to frame theimſelues to become true and ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but he hath the charge alſo to looke that the Wolfe bee kept out, and that none of the Sheepe be deuoured, or ſeduced by falſe doctrine, and ſo drawen into errour, whiche is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall drifte and practiſe of the Deuill. Now, there bee many that can well enough abide to haue the Goſpell preached, ſo that there might bee no exclaimyng, and ſpeakyng againſte Wolues: I meane, ſo that Preachers in their Sermons, would forbeare railyng and tauntyng againſt Prelates. But although I preache ſounde doctrine, and that whiche is true: and although I feede and teach (my charge) the Sheepe, well and rightly: yet is not that ſufficient: for it is further required at my handes to keepe the Sheepe from daunger, and to haue a carefull regarde vnto theim, that Wolues come not emong theim, to driue theim awaie out of their fertile and wholeſome paſtures. For, to what purpoſe is my building. if when I haue couched and orderly laied my Stones, an other ſtraightwaies come &amp; hurle them doune as faſt againe, and I ſeyng him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde him not? The Wolfe is well enough contented, that the Sheepe bee well fedde, and fatted in good paſture: becauſe the
<pb facs="tcp:9409:114"/>
fatter thei bee, thei pleaſaunter and daintier praie thinketh he to make of them. But that Dogges ſhould inceſſauntly barke and baule at hym, that can he not abide. And therefore it is a matter of no ſmall waight and charge, to feede well, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng as GOD hath giuen in commaundement to doe: and it behooueth eche one in that function carefully to conſider his charge in this behalfe.</p>

And alſo for that it is ſuche an harde matter &amp; of ſo great difficultie, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to diſcharge the office of a godly Paſtor: yea of ſo greate daunger alſo, becauſe it muſt be throughly executed, &amp; that not vnwillingly, or as though it were, <hi>by conſtraint.</hi> True it is, that no man ought to intrude himſelf into that Office: but if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And this is the Exhortation, where with S. Peter encorageth them, to whom the charge and cure of Soules is committed. Whereby is manifeſtly concluded and proued, that the Pope with his Cardinalles and Biſſhoppes is the very Antichriſt, and the profeſſed aduerſaries of Chriſte, for that they dooe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng of all theſe, whiche Sainct Peter here requireth.

Thei neither feede the Sheepe themſelues, neither will they ſuffer others to feede theim: but rather plaie the rauenyng Wolues, deuouryng and murtheryng the Flocke, and yet bragge thei that thei bee Chriſtes Vicars on Earth.

                  <p>And here note, how he ſaieth that the Deuill <hi>walketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</hi> He ſetteth not vpon thee directly before thy face, where he knoweth thou art fenced and garded: but he cowardly lyeth in waite to ſurprize thee behinde at thy backe, or aſlope on the one ſide: he pryeth and tooteth within thee and without thee very diligently to eſpie thee at ſome vauntage, where he maie ſet vppon thee. For when he hath attempted thee one waie (if he ſpeede not of his purpoſe) he ſtraightwaies taketh an other in hande. If he miſſe his purpoſe on this ſide of thee, he flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the other, omitting no ſuttle deuiſe, no craftie ambuſh, no cunnyng pollicie to catche thee in a trippe and ſo to poſſeſſe thee. If he finde thee ſtrongly armed and fenced on one parte, he planteth his batterie to an other ſide: if he bee diſappoincted there, he chargeth vpon thee (and that with incredible ſpeede) in an other place, he neuer ceaſſeth, but is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall practiſe of miſchiefe, for thy ouerthrowe and confuſion: he neuer taketh any pauſe or ſtaie, but ſtill runneth about, not ſuffryng thee to haue any maner of teſt, or intermiſſion.

Againe, that no man ſhould thinke, that Faithe can bee without Good woorkes. For, wee can no ſoner preach of Faith, how that it alone without the helpe of any our Good woorkes, maketh vs iuste and acceptable before GOD, but ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſome are readie to barke againſt vs, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, that then it is needeleſſe and booteleſſe for any manne to doe any Good deedes: and this wee
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9409:122"/>
knowe by daiely experience is the common ſpeech and ſaiyng. On the other ſide, when we vrge and teache Good woorkes, &amp; praiſe them: then Faithe falleth and looſeth muche of her dignitie. So that wee ſee it to bee a verie hard matter, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe to kepe a right meane, ſpeciallie where there is want of painfull and faithfull Preachers.</p>
               <p>Now, the Lorde teacheth vs, that we ſhould attribute all our Iustification before God, vnto a ſincere Faithe in Christe Ieſus. But when wee haue thus ſoundly preached, &amp; inculked this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible doctrine of Faithe, we must alſo teache, that Good woorkes muste needes enſue. Becauſe wee maie not at any hande, (ſo long as wee be in this life) bee idle, without dooyng ſome woorke. All this doeth Sainct Peter in this Epistle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue and diſcourſe vppon at large: meetyng with thoſe, who peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture out of his former Epistle, had foded themſelues with a falſe opinion, and mistaken his meanyng: in thinking Faithe to bee ſufficient, although there be no good VVorkes at all. And vpon this poinct, is the firste Chapter of this Epistle ſpecially written: wherin he teacheth and willeth the godlie to approue and declare the certaintie of their Faithe by their Good workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9409:123"/>The ſeconde Chapter is against them, whiche extoll VVorkes onelie, and throwe doune Faithe. And therfore he warneth vs aforehande of falſe teachers and ſeducers, whiche by newe doctrines of their owne deuiſe, ſhould darken and aboliſhe this aſſuraunce, whiche eche one ought firmely to haue of Faithe: for he ſawe, what detestable iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyng, Apostacie, add departyng awaie from the Faithe would bee in the worlde, whiche euen then beganne: as Saincte Paule ſaieth, ij.

                  <p>Of this knowledge of GOD, aſwell the Apoſtles as the Prophetes dooe verie often and almoſte continually make mention in the holie Scriptures, as <hi>Eſaie the xj. In all my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hill thei ſhall not hurte nor deſtroye, for the Earth ſhalbe full of the knowledge of the Lorde, as the waters that couer the Sea.</hi> That is, The knowledge of God ſhall bee as plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and abundaunt, as the waters of the ſwellyng Sea, when it breaketh out, and ſurroundeth ſome whole Countrey. And here hence ſhall ſuche peace and tranquillitie preſently enſue, that no man ſhal ſeeke to moleſt or damnifie an other. But this is not to knowe God, if thou dooe but onely beleeue that God is Almightie, and that he hath created and made all thynges: and that Chriſt was borne of the virgine Marie, ſuffred death and roſe againe: for thus muche doe the Turkes, Iewes, and Deuilles beleeue. But the true knowledge of GOD is this: That thou haue a feelyng of hym in thyne harte &amp; conſcience, and that thou be certainly perſwaded, that God and his Chriſt is thy God and thy Chriſt: whiche belief the Deuilles and falſe counterfaite Chriſtians haue not, neither can haue. Therefore the knowledge of God is nothing els, then a ſounde and entire Faithe in Chriſt. For when thou thus fullie knoweſt GOD and Chriſte, thou wilte moſte gladlie reſigne, and committe thy ſelf vnto hym, and firmely beleeue and truſt in hym, aſwell in aduerſitie, as in proſperitie, in death aſwell as in life. This ſettled confidence and ſure truſt, can not bee in theim that haue euill conſciences: that is, in theim that want true and ſincere Faithe. For thei knowe GOD none otherwiſe, but that he is the God of S. Peter, and of all the Sainctes in Heauen: But for their God thei dooe not knowe hym, neitheir haue any fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of hym, but haue hym and take hym, rather as their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie tormentour and angrie Iudge.</p>
                  <p>To haue GOD, is to haue all Grace, all Mercie, and all goodneſſe that can bee named. To haue Chriſte, is to haue a

All theſe thynges, thou muſte drawe and applie to thy ſelf, and not doubte but that Chriſt is thyne, and thou Chriſtes. And this is the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt. An vmnaried woman ſeyng a man, maie ſaie: this is a Manne: but ſhe can not ſaie: this is my Manne, or my Houſebande. In like ſort, all of vs can ſaie: This is God: But all of vs can not ſaie, that he is our God: becauſe wee dooe not all of vs beleeue and truſt in hym, and comfort our ſelues one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hym and by hym. This true knowledge of GOD the Scripture tearmeth the face and Countenaunce of the Lorde: whereof the Prophetes ſpeake verie copiouſlie. For thei that ſee not his face, and knowe hym not, doe ſee but onely his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der partes: that is, doe ſee hym as their angrie and diſpleaſed God: whereas if thei ſawe his face, that is, if thei had the true knowledge of hym by Faith, thei ſhould behold and ſee nothing but Grace and Mercie.</p>

But then ſhall the Woorde ceaſſe, and our Soules ſhall open and diſplaie themſelues, and ſhall ſee and feele all thynges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And this is it that bothe S. Peter and S.

For although God doeth raigne for euer &amp; alwaies, yet is not the ſame manifeſtly to vs apparaunced. He ſeeth vs, but we ſee not hym.

A Prophete properlie is hee, that bringeth the glad tidynges of Ieſus Chriſt: and although many of the Prophetes in the old Teſtament, prophecied alſo of other matters to come, yet thei came and were ſent of God peculiarly to this ende and purpoſe, to preache and foretell of Chriſte. All thei that beleeue in Chriſte, are Prophetes: For thei haue the chief head of that thing, whiche Prophetes ought to haue, although al of them haue not the gift of Propheciyng. For euen as through the Faithe of one Ieſus Chriſt, wee are all Brothers, Kynges, and Prieſtes: ſo alſo through Chriſte wee are Prophetes. For wee can all vtter and declare thoſe thinges that appertaine to the glorie of GOD, and Chriſtian life: wee alſo (ſo farre as is needefull and expedient for vs) can foretell of thynges to come, as that there ſhall bee a daie of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Iudgement, and that wee ſhall all riſe againe from the dead: and finally wee vnderſtande the whole Scripture.

                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore ſaieth S. Peter thus: <hi>We haue ſuche a worde of the Prophetes, as is ſure inough of it ſelf:</hi> Onely ſee ye that it bee firme and ſure to you. And ye dooe well, if ye take heede vnto it: As though he ſhould ſaie: It is verie neceſſarie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you to ſtande ſure in it. For, it fareth with vs in this caſe of the Goſpell, muche like as it dooeth with a man that is taken and encloſed in a darke houſe, at Midnight, who had neede to haue Candlelighte, till it bee daie light, that hee maie ſee whiche waie to goe. Euen ſo, the Goſpell is as a Candle at Midnight, and in the darcke: whereas all humaine reaſon and wiſedome, is nothyng but mere errour and blindneſſe. The Worlde is nothyng els but a Kyngdome of darkeneſſe. In this darkeneſſe, God lighteneth vs with his Candle, to wit, his glorious Goſpell: whiche directeth our ſteppes aright, that wee maie ſee whiche waie to goe, and walke in this Worlde, till ſuche tyme as the Mornyng appeare, and the daie dawne.</p>
                  <p>This place doeth alſo mainly oppugne, and beate doune all the fooliſhe tromperies of humaine doctrines. For, ſeyng that the Woorde of God is the Candle and Lanterne, that giueth light in darke corners and obſcure places, wee muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therevpon conclude, that al other thinges be mere darkneſſe. For if there had been any other Light beſide the Woorde, S. Peter would not haue vſed theſe ſpeeches.

When ye therfore haue the true Worde of God, thinke none otherwiſe, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye alſo ſhall haue falſe Teachers. This admonition maie ſtand for a generall and infallibe rule: that whereſoeuer the Worde of GOD is ſincerely preached and taught, there alſo by and by ariſe falſe Teacher's, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyng Hypocrites. The reaſon is, becauſe although the Worde bee preached to all, yet doe not all embrace and beleeue it. Thei that beleeue it, doe followe it, and conforme their liues thereafter. But the greater number, whiche bee thei that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not, dooe conſtrue and take the ſame Woorde in a falſe ſenſe, contrary to the true meanyng of the holie Ghoſte, and thereof it commeth to paſſe, that there ſpryng and growe vp ſo many falſe Teachers.

And thei whiche ſhould and ought to haue kept vs from errour, were the firſte, that taught this doctrine vnto vs. Here wee learne, that wee are vnexcuſable, if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue amiſſe, or followe and allow any falſe and erroneous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines:

ignoraunce ſhall not excuſe vs, ſeeyng wee haue been ſo diligently warned aforehande. And God hath expreſſely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that euery one ſhould bee able to iudge of that whiche is preached, and to giue a reaſon of the doctrine, whiche he hath receiued: if wee neglecte or make ſmall accoumpt thereof, wee are in a forlorne caſe, it ſhal not auaile vs (I ſaie) to plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce. The daunger is no leſſe, then the hazarde and loſſe of the ſaluation of our own Soules. And therefore it behooueth eche one to knowe whiche is the true Woorde of God, that he maie adhere and cleaue vnto it: and whiche is falſe doctrine, that he maie flee and eſchue it.</p>
                  <p>Of ſuche kinde of admonitions, that we ſhould take heede of falſe doctrines, wee haue in many places of the Scriptures greate ſtore. Sainct Paule in the laſte Sermon that he made to the Epheſians, when he tooke his leaue of theim, and was now readie to departe toward Hieruſalem, forewarned theim of theſe thynges, ſaiyng: <hi>I knowe, that after my departyng<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greeuous Woolues ſhall enter in among you, not ſparyng the flocke: And of your owne ſelues ſhall menne ariſe, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng peruers thinges, to drawe Diſciples after them. Act. xx.</hi> Chriſt alſo foreſheweth no leſſe to his Diſciples. <hi>Math. xxiiij. When any ſhall ſaie to you, Loe, here is Chriſt, or there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it not. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſtes and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and ſhall ſhewe greate ſignes and wonders, ſo that if it were poſſible, thei ſhould deceiue the verie electe.</hi> Againe S. Paule <hi>j. Timo. iiij.</hi> hath theſe woordes: <hi>The Spirite ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euidentlie, that in the latter tymes ſome ſhall departe from the Faithe, and ſhall giue heede vnto Spirites of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and doctrines of Deuilles, whiche ſpeake lyes through hipocriſie, and haue their Conſciences burned with an hote yron, forbiddyng to marie, and commaundyng to abſtaine from meates, whiche God hath created to be receiued with giuyng thankes, &amp;c.</hi> As theſe premonitions were bothe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently and ſeriouſly vttered, ſo ought we to haue taken more heede, and to haue been the wiſer in looking to our ſelues.

vs: yea, we haue ſuffred our ſelues ſtill to be wilfully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and nozzeled in errour. Let vs now ſee, who theſe falſe Teachers are, of whom S. Peter here ſpeaketh. Truely I doe thinke it was not without the ſinguler and hidden councell of God, that our Popiſhe Prelacie were called and tearmed by the name and title of Teachers and Maiſters, to the ende eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one might plainly ſee who thei were, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S.

And therefore there is greate difference, betweene preachyng directly againſt Chriſte, and preachyng couertly and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticallie vnder colour of truely worſhippyng Chriſte. As for example, if I ſhould thus preache: Chriſte is the Soonne of God, perfect God and perfect manne, and he that beleeueth in hym, ſhalbee ſaued: this preachyng is true and aduouchable by the Goſpell and Scriptures. Now, if another ſhould come
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:9409:140"/>
and preache thus: Chriſte is not the Sonne of GOD, neither was he euer incarnate, and Faithe doeth not Iuſtifie: this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of preachyng were moſte falſe, and moſte directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto all truthe. But of ſuche plaine and palpable godleſſe doctrine, S. Peter doeth not in this place ſpeake, neither dooe our Papiſtes and Munkiſhe Mawmettes ſo groſſelie deale: but thei priuilie coigne a counterfaicte kinde of doctrine, and foiſte it in among vs, in ſteede of true and ſounde religion. As when thei ſaie thus: It is true that Chriſte is bothe perfecte God, and perfecte Manne, and that he ſuffred death for our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in whom whoſoeuer beleeueth not, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ſaued. Theſe and ſuche like Articles, as thei affirme to bee true, ſo doe thei holde, that thei appertaine and ſerue for the vulgare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſorte of people. Lett vs therefore (ſaie thei) inſtitute ſome perfecter waie and preciſer trade of Life. Let vs binde men by Vowe to Chaſtitie, to Pouertie, and to an Obedience to their profeſſed Rules, let vs teache them to builde Abbaies, Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Celles, and Hermitages, and lette vs flatly perſwade them, that if thei zelouſly and deuoutly doe the ſame, thei ſhalbe ſure, aſſone as the breathe is out of their bodies, to goe ſtraight to Heauen. When theſe and ſuche like dotages are preached, and colorablie inſtilled into mennes myndes, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more excellent &amp; bleſſed then Virginitie: nothing more meritorious then counterfaite &amp; feigned Obedience: that Mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and Freers liue a farre better and perfecter life then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Here in theſe poinctes there is no open defiaunce in flat woordes, made againſt the ſinceritie of Chriſtian doctrine: herein is neither Faithe nor Baptiſme expreſſelie denied, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet doe thei renounce or denie Chriſte to bee the Sauiour of the Worlde: but yet (neuertheleſſe) the doctrine of truthe is here couertly impugned, and clouded with deuiſes of mannes owne inuention: and menne are thereby drawen and ſeduced from the right waie, and are brought to an ouerweenyng and ſelflikyng of theimſelues, truſtyng in their owne Merites, Woorkes, and rotten Ceremonies. Thei beleeue that Chriſt the Sonne of God, in his humanitie ſuffred death, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb facs="tcp:9409:141"/>
the third daie, &amp; that he is the Sauiour of the worlde, &amp;c. but thei doe not firmely and onely truſt in hym: for if thei did, thei would not ſo ſcrupulouſly bee tied to their owne Lowſie traſhe, and beggerly Traditions.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame maner, did thei beare the Laitie in hande, that they could not attaine to ſaluation, except they did after their directions. Ye are Chriſtians (ſaie thei, we confeſſe) but this is not enough: ye muſt doe ſuche and ſuche good workes: ye muſt build Churches in the honor of this and that Sainct: ye muſt erect and founde Monaſteries and Abbayes: ye muſt buie certaine Trentalles of Maſſes to be ſaied or ſong for you: ye muſt pyue awaie your ſelues with faſtyng and ſuche like. Thus haue the ſéely poore people been beguiled, and thus haue thei been perſwaded and brought to ſhew themſelues as well likers of theſe trumperies, thinkyng it to be the Kynges high waie to heauen: and theſe rotten workes of blinde deuotion to be of all workes the beſt, becauſe they ſawe them which caried the tytle of the Church, to allowe and followe the ſame: ſo that in proceſſe of tyme, there grewe to bee as many Factions, Sectes and Religions as there were Cities, yea, almoſte as there were Men. Whereas they ſhould rather haue taught them thus: Ye are Chriſtians, aſwell as thei that bee an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred myles diſtant from you: ye haue all one Chriſt, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, one Faith, one Spirite, one Worde, one God: there is no worke that ye of your ſelues are able to doe towarde your ſaluation, or able to bring you to the perfection of a right Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. If this Doctrine might generally bee preached, men ſhould be kept in the fellowſhippe and vnitie of one Common Faith, neither would there bee any difference at all in thinges appertainyng to God, but all would be alike: and one the ſame that an other is.

For there can not bee twoo Chriſtes to take awaie Synnes. Hee (as good right it is) muſt bee acknowledged to be the onely Redeemer and taker awaie of Sinnes. Whiche beeyng graunted to bee true (as it is moſte true) thou thy ſelf canſt dooe no maner of worke to take away thy ſinnes.

                  <p>Againe, thei bee herein alſo like vnto the old Worlde, who although thei haue the Prophetes, and the Woorde of GOD

For thei now be greate, mightie, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tyrauntes, thei liue of all menne moſte delicately, moſte riotouſlie, and euen as thei liſte theimſelues, thei haue moſte aboundaunt ſtore and plentie of all thynges, thei oppreſſe the Worlde, and with their tyrannous exactions, and bloodie cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties ouercrowe all Chriſtendome: and yet maie no manne ſpeake one woorde, or once open his mouthe againſt them, no not Kynges and Princes. Againe, if thei bee diſpoſed to take a waie a mannes Wife, or his daughter from hym, thei maie with ſuche impunitie dooe it, that no man maie dare ſo muche as complaine of their violence: and if any doe complaine, yet are thei themſelues, the iudges of the matter, and ſo it ſhall be euen as good to ſaie nothyng at all: for amendes hee ſhall haue none at all. Finallie, by all the ſhiftes and driftes, by all the waies and meanes that thei can poſſibly deuiſe to pill and poll, robbe and ſpoile, rake and ſcrape, by coſonage, pillage, exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tribute, commaundementes, licenſes, depredations, and al other ſuttle trickes whatſoeuer, thei hale and pull, thei catche and ſnatche vnto theim, without hoe, without meaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſcience, without ſhame. And if any manne in any ſorte laye his lawfull claime, or touche any thyng, whiche thei pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to be theirs, and whiche thei haue in theirs poſſeſſions, by and by thei bawle and barke, howle and crie againſt hym that the ſame thing ſo claimed is Spirituall liuelihoode, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall patrimonie, &amp; the goods of the Church, which hath and ought to haue and enioye a free immunitie, ſo that no manne may or ought ſo much as once to touche them. But thoſe, that ſincerely preach the worde of God, and charitable reprehende their looſe and diſſolute life, denouncyng and declaryng vnto
<pb facs="tcp:9409:148"/>
them the iudgementes of God, that tarieth them ſuche: prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Iuſtice (I ſaie) can thei not abide to heare, but mocke and ſkorne them: and not onely ſo, but alſo cruelly perſecute, impriſon, baniſh, kill and murther them. But their Style and Tytle [to bee called <hi>Spirituall</hi> fathers] as theſe others in the daies of Noah were called the <hi>Sonnes of God,</hi> thei holde faſt with toothe and naile: and needes will they rule all the roſte with mere violence, force and power, euen as thei liſt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.

                  <p>Thirdly, as the Countrey wherein the Cities of Sodome and Gamorrhe ſtoode, flowed moſte abundantly with ſtoare of all thinges that the Earth yeelded, ſo that the Inhabitants thereof liued ydlie, giuyng themſelues to nothing but banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, drunkenneſſe and belly cheere, without lendyng any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe to the poore: ſo alſo fareth it with the ſtate of this pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Clergie.

And what commoditie is engendred of ſloth and ydlenes (ſpecially when it is ſo rooted in lazineſſe) wee can not bee ignoraunt. The Pope forbiddeth his forked Stalions to marie: and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them keepe a breedyng whore or twaine, that bryngeth foorth children, the Biſſhoppes then (forſooth) becauſe they maie not ſéeme altogether to winke at ſuch notorious crimes, aſſeſſe ſome pecuniarie puniſhment vppon them, and ſo for a little money they are not onely for this fact releaſed, but alſo
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:9409:148"/>
permitted ſtill to keepe their Concubines as afore: as though this were a ſufficient remedie againſt the ſinne of fleſhly luſte.

                  <p>To conclude: wee here ſee how S. Peter accoumpteth the ſtate of theſe Shauelinges no better, nor any otherwiſe then theirs of Sodome and Gomorrhe. For ſuch be the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and dealinges of al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whole table of that viperous broode, that no good groweth from them to any: but catche and get all that thei can to themſelues, vnder a pretence and colour that what ſoeuer is giuen to them, is giuen to God: whom they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in their mouth, the eaſilier to beguile the Worlde. And therefore as Sodome and Gomorrhe were burned to Aſhes, ſo ſhall they in the laſt daie bee conſumed and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng.</p>
