            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>

you ſeeme to have of the integrity and honeſty of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Co<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lonel <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and that his Letter of the 25.th
of <hi>July,</hi> containes nothing but truth, I ſend you here my
Senſe and Opinion concerning his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>And for the clearer explanation of what you demand, and our better
underſtanding of one another, J conceive it neceſſary that we be at a
point upon theſe two things. Firſt, what the Houſe of Commons is;
Next, for what end and purpoſe they are conveened and called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>J beleeve you agree with me, that the Houſe of Commons is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſſe, then the repreſentative body of the People, elected and
ſent up, by the ſeverall Shires and Burroughs reſpectively (<hi>and joyned
with the two other States</hi>) of capacitie to make alter, abrogate Lawes,
as occaſion ſhall require; to heare and relieve the Grievances of the
people, and to reforme what is amiſſe in the Common wealth.</p>
            <p>Here is the Character and deſcription of the Houſe of Commons
(which themſelves (I thinke) will allow of) and here is the end and
purpoſe for which they ſerve.</p>
            <p>In this deſcription you may plainly ſee, two Bodies of the people,
the repreſentative and the repreſented, which together make up the
body of the Common-wealth; and of this later, Lieutenant Collonel
<hi>Lilburne</hi> is an eminent member.</p>
            <p>Now, for any man to imagine that the ſhadow or repreſentative
is more worthy then the Subſtance, or that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113209:2"/>
is more valuable and conſiderable, then the Body for whom
they ſerve, is all one as if they ſhould affirme, that an Agent or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
from a <hi>Prince,</hi> hath the ſame or more authority, then the
<hi>Prince</hi> himſelfe, <hi>which in matters of Proxie for Mariage, I believe no
Prince will allow of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will not undertake to define the limits of power or extent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
having found the practice in my reading more or leſſe,
lengthned or ſhortned (<hi>like a paire of Stirrops</hi>) according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
and Current of times, or the weakneſſe or power of the Prince
under whom they ſerve, who hath for the moſt part ſubjected them
to his will, and made them act his Deſignes.</p>
            <p>Neither will I goe about to caſt the apple of Diviſion betwixt the
People and their agents, who ſhould be linckt together by common
intereſt and mutuall reſpects of common preſervation; yet this much
I cannot forbeare to intimate, that the one is but the ſervant of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Houſe of Commons, I meane of the People, elected by them
to provide for their welfare and freedomes, againſt all in-bred tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
or Foraigne invaſion, which by reaſon of their numbers, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conveniently doe in their owne perſons without hazard both of
confuſion and deſolation.</p>
            <p>But to come to our buſineſſe, Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> complains, that Three
times ſince the firſt of <hi>May</hi> laſt, he hath been impriſoned by Authority
from the Houſe of Commons, before he knew his Accuſer or Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or was ſuffered to ſpeak one word in his own defence: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Theeves and Murtherers, taken in <hi>Flagranti delicto,</hi> in the very
act of a <hi>haynous crime,</hi> are not thus hardly dealt withall.</p>
            <p>This cals to my mind the very words of a Member of the Houſe, Mr.
<hi>Edward Stephens</hi> by name, uttered with paſſion openly in Weſtminſter
hall, in a caſe of the like injuſtice, <hi>viz. That we have not withdrawne
our ſelves from our obedience to the King, to yeild our ſelves ſlaves and
vaſſalls to the Tyrannie of our fellow ſubjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ſhall we mend our ſelves, we have given
our ſelves, lives, liberties, and all into the Parliaments power?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That this free and abandoned confidence of ours,
whereby they are intruſted with all that is deare and precious unto us,
ought the rather to oblie<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e them to a tender and conſcientious care
of the diſpenſation of t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> power.</p>
            <p>Beſides this ſoveraig<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or legiſlative power (which they make uſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113209:2"/>
of) is not lent them for the ruine and deſtruction of our Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
(<hi>no more then the Kings Prerogative</hi>) but for the edification
and ſtrengthning of the ſame in particular, as well as generall.</p>
            <p>The abuſe and overflowing of this power, is odious to God and
man; for Princes, or what State ſoever, when they arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
an unlimited juriſdiction, do degenerate into Tyrants, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>Hoſtes humani generis,</hi> enemies of mankind.</p>
            <p>And the Angels (which would be like to the moſt high) were by
his juſt judgement changed into the moſt wretched of all creatures: It
belongs to God, and to God alone, to rule by the law of his bleſſed
will.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Princes</hi> and States, when they break out into exorbitancy,
and will be immitators of the power of God, in governing by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſcribed
authority, they run themſelves into inevitable miſchiefs,
and the people (whom they ſerve) into unavoidable inconveniencies,
and this comes to paſſe of neceſſitie; for every State governed by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall
and Arbitrary power, muſt needs be floting, inconſtant, and
ſubject to change; beſides, man is naturally ambitious and apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
and uſurpe upon the liberty of his inferiours.</p>
            <p>Hence is derived that excellent maxim, <hi>Melius ſub iniquiſſima lege,
quam ſub aequiſſimo arbitro vivere;</hi> It is better live under a rigorous
and unjuſt Law, then an Arbitrary government though juſt, the reaſon
is, becauſe by the firſt, he is at certainty and knows what he muſt truſt
too, the laſt leaves him uncertaine and ſo in danger.</p>
            <p>But to returne to Lievtenant Collonel <hi>Lilburne,</hi> who ſtands impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by a Vote of the Houſe of Commons for refuſing to anſwere to the
Committees Interrogatories, before cauſe ſhewed of his former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
            <p>J am informed by ſome members that this Vote was obtained by
<hi>Baſtwicke</hi> ſurreptitiouſly, when the Houſe was thinne and emptie; and
therefore I conceive he may appeale from the Houſe thin and emptie,
to the Houſe full and compleat, if this will not be accepted of, why
ſhould he not appeale to the people.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Buchannan</hi> an Author without reproach in his Booke (<hi>De jure
regni apud Scotos,</hi> concerning the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lawes) doth boldly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
affirme, <hi>Supremam poteſtatem eſſe in Populo,</hi> the Supreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to be in the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113209:3"/>
And before <hi>Buchannan,</hi> the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
a patterne and example to all âges both for civill and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
government) I ſay this Common-wealth in its beſt perfection did
allow of this laſt refuge or appeale to the People.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, <hi>Titus Livius</hi> an unreproveable Author, ſpeakes in
theſe tearmes. <hi>Decad.</hi> 5. of his Hiſtory. <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> was the firſt (or one
of the firſt that un<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

or grand Commiſſion, did not ſtand highly upon his birth and degree,
but made his addreſſe to the multitude, and taught them to know and
uſe their Power over himſelfe, and his fellow Senators in reforming
their diſorders: For this the Commons highly eſteemed him, and
the Senators as deeply hated him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I hope the wiſdome and Providence of the Parliament will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
theſe extremities; yet I cannot but put them in remembrance,
that ſmall ſparkles do oftentimes occaſion great fires.</p>
            <p>And that the Engliſh Nation is ſenſible of nothing more then the
breach of their liberties, and of violence offered to the freedome of their
perſons.</p>
            <p>Witneſſe the <hi>Magna Carta</hi> thirty times confirmed by the Princes
of this Jland; and witneſſe the cheerefull readineſſe of the people to
ſerve the publique in this preſent great quarrell.</p>
            <p>And let no man dreame that the Parliament may trench boldly
thereon without check. A ſillie conceit and aggravating the offence;
For a dog that devoureth his owne kind, we account more unnaturall,
then a Lyon or a Beare of another kind; beſides the heart burning
which is eaſily kindled when our owne fellowes domineere over us.</p>
            <p>There are but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uing a people either by feare or love,
the firſt may be more agreeable to Maſter <hi>Corbitt</hi> as ſutable to his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant

is brittle, and will laſt no longer then the fome which ſupports it.
The ſecond of love, is ſafe and durable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camillus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpeakes of it in two words, <hi>Firmiſſunum imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
quo obedientes gaudent,</hi> the moſt ſtable laſting government under
which the people rejoyce and live cheerfully.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lilburnes</hi> caſe is ſingular, that a member of the body repreſented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

both in his actions and ſufferings in this great Cauſe, that ſuch
a ſubject contrary to the tennor of <hi>Magna Carta,</hi> contrary to the late
Covenant and Petition of Right, yet and the direct rule alleaged in
Scripture, ſhould be three times impriſoned without ſhewing cauſe by
a Parliament profeſſing reformation, and defence of our Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and without any urgent or apparent neceſſity of State enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
it.</p>
            <p>This J profeſſe is to me a riddle beyond all that this monſtrous age
hath brought forth; I need not ſay how much the publique libertie, is
wounded in the injurie doubled and trebled upon their fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
nor the conſequences thereof, which if drawne into preſident, who
can count himſelfe free? Nor the conſequences of a wicked ſentence,
(which as Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> ſayes) is infinitely worſe then a wicked
fact, as being held a preſident or patterne, whereby oppreſſion begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon one, is extended as warrantable upon all.</p>
            <p>And this concluſion he draweth out of this place of Scripture, <hi>Fons

falling into the hands of the wicked, is like a fountaine troubled with
the foot, or the urines corrupted in the bodie.</p>
            <p>The horror of this ſentence hath ſtricken the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with amazement, to behold the Kid ſeething in the milke of the
Damme, that is to ſay, the Chambers of juſtice ordained for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
preſervation, and ſafety, unkindly wreſted to enſlave, ruine, and
deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>Surely after-ages when they ſhall ponder theſe proceedings in cold
and ſober blood will be aſhamed to own the actors for their parents or
predeceſſors: And it is to be feared that the ſtones from the pavement,
will riſe in judgement one day againſt the abuſers of the truſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them.</p>
            <p>And let no man deceive himſelfe, to thinke with ſenceleſſe and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
diſtinctions to award the diſhonour and danger, which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
to the Parliament hence; as to ſay that the Great Charter is but
ſuſpended as to <hi>Lilburne,</hi> but not abrogated; and that the duty of the
Parliament is to provide for generalities, but is not at leyſure to
attend particular grievances; theſe anſweres ſatisfie none but Ideots, or
thoſe that ſuck profit under their command.</p>
            <p>J mentioned before the danger and diſhonour ariſing to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113209:4"/>
hereby, which of neceſſity muſt enſue, for ſeeing that <hi>Omne Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium
in conſenſu et aſſenſu parentium fondatur Plinius, Paneg.</hi> All law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Empire or Soveraigne command hath its baſis or firme foundation
in the conſent, approbation and good liking of the people; a rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception.</p>
            <p>What conſent or good liking can bee expected from thoſe who
dayly ſee themſelves abuſed, in their liberties; and ruined in their
Eſtates? Nay, what hope of redreſſe, when as our Petitions will not
be accepted without great friends in the Houſe? To be ſhort, it is not
credible that either people or perſon, in any outward condition under
which they mourne, ſigh, or groane, will continue any longer therein,
then they have occaſion of good termes to be delivered, according to
the ſaying of <hi>Liv. lib. 8. Non credibile eſt illum Populum, vel hominem
denique, in eâ conditione, cujus eum poeniteat, diutius quam neceſſe ſit
manſurum.</hi> Hence it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the multitude
toucht to the quick in their liberties and means of living, will be eaſily
perſwaded to ſhake off all Bonds of obedience, ſo neceſſary to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate;
and to caſt the blame of their ſufferings upon the Authors,
either as falſe to their Truſt, <hi>or uncapable of the great weight of</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
committed unto them: For who but a mad-man will yeild obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto thoſe, who are regardleſſe of their Lawes and Liberties,
or negligent of the means of their Subſiſtance, Livelihood, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
the maine and only ends for which they are Conveened and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together; and not to provide Offices for themſelves, or to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Cauſes of their particular friends, ſometimes the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the State.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you paſſe not lightly by theſe Confiderations as idle and
vaine feares; for who ſhall hinder the multitude, if ſtung with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſence of their loſt Freedoms, and means of ſubſiſting; they ſhall
endeavour the re-gaining thereof by ſome ſudden attempt; ſeeing
that (if the worſt happen) they cannot be in much worſe condition
then they now are: As to the Committee for Examinations (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in Mr. <hi>Lilburns</hi> Letter) which ought to be the Touchſtone,
whereby to diſcern Gold from counterfeit: And in equity and reaſon,
ought to be free, equall, and open as well to the Plantiffe, as Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant;
eſpecially in Criminall Cauſes: But in caſes of Treaſon, or
which concern the Publique ſafety, ought rather to lend an attentive
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113209:4"/>
eare to the <hi>Delators or Accuſers,</hi> then any way to diſcourage them:
For if theſe neceſſary evills ſhall be diſheartned, who will watch over
the ſafety of the State? Beſides, it is more ſafe and tollerable in the
condition wherein we now are, that a miſchief ſhould happen to one
man, then a ruine to the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As to this Committee, I wiſh from my ſoule, that Leiutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
LILBVRNE were the only complainant againſt them: Let
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and other places of Publique mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
inform you; What making of ſides, browbeating of witneſſes,
baffeling of evidences, facing, and out-facing of the truth? What
impertinent diſtinguiſhing and abuſing the Formalities of the Law, is
there complained of? And all this noiſe and turmoile to help a knave
out of the briers.</p>
            <p>It were more for the honour of their juſtice, and the ſatisfaction of
the people, if the uſuall forms of proceeding in caſes of charge of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
were obſerved: That is, that the perſon accuſed, were ſecured;
and the accuſers heard with all equanimity, patience, and attention:
Whereas on the contrary, the accuſed is permitted to ſit down cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as Peer and companion with the Commiſſioners, and to arraign
his accuſers.</p>
            <p>O wretched times! O miſerable <hi>England!</hi> which doeſt labour with
all the ſymptoms, marks, and tokens, of a declining and dying ſtate!
Injuſtice avowed; Treaſon, countenanced; Oppreſſion, become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,
almoſt legall; Oaths, Proteſtations, and Covenants ſolemnly
made in the <hi>preſence of God</hi> and man, ſlighted, and ſet at nought:
Then to fill up the meaſure of our ſorrowes, a Civill War within
our own bowels, nay almoſt in every family: And laſt of all, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
corruption of manners, which aſſures us the malady will be laſting, if
not incureable: What will be the end and iſſue of all this? Seeke to
that Oracle which cannot lye.</p>
