            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is too too observable that when Men have once wickedly complyed with discover'd, or weakly given up their Assent to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search'd Errours, their main business afterwards is, right or wrong, to justify the Principles


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98594:3"/>
which they have imbibed: The Care that should have been taken to prevent, is laid out to hide their Deformity and disguise their Shame. Hence the Writings of Fathers, and perhaps the Decrees of Councils are entituled to them; Scripture is wrested, and Antiquity raked into, to give Patronage to the foulest Misdemeanours.</p>
            <p>Thus of old, St. <hi>Origen</hi> was made use of to defend the Heresie of the <hi>Arians,</hi> St <hi>Cyprian</hi> of the <hi>Donatians,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi> of the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> And of late the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commissioned Zeal of <hi>Gregory Nazianzene,</hi> and the Stories of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> have been cited to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse Disobedience to Princes, and to null the rights of their next Heirs.</p>
            <p>Thus Schism has always fled for Sanctuary to the Altar, and from those who most constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended upon it, (especially in the first Ages of Christianity,) has endeavoured to gain Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and Success.</p>
            <p>Thus also too many in our Days, (though God be praised their number decreases, and was never such as they boasted of) too many for the defence of their Separations, plead that Liberty in which they suppose the Primitive Christians stood fast; and renounce that indispensible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which the Church enjoyns, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that from the beginning it was not so. Whereas indeed, we are assured that the early Fore-runners in the Faith, did not make, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

            <p n="1">I.

            <p n="3">III. I shall enquire how far, now-a days, the Magistrate and those in Authority under him may proceed, in order to the uniting Men in Judgment and Practice, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and the Worship of God.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I shall conclude with an Exhortation to what is here said to have been the Practice of the Primitive Christians, and ought to be ours, that we also be united, and <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>

            <p>At the time when that prodigious effect of Omnipotent Mercy was express'd in the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Redeemer, the distracted World not keeping any regularly traced Path towards Salvation, wandred in Darkness, and in the

Shadow of Death. The <hi>Jews</hi> had made the written Law give way to the oral; they had prostituted their Understandings to the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those blind Guides, which taught for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, and by magisterial Confidence, and precise Hypocrisie, (Qualifications which often come together) so far enslav'd the Judgments of their Proselytes, that if two of them held contradictory Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, each notwithstanding was thought infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Heathens, though the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not suffer them to be ignorant of what was good, yet could not come to the knowledge of the Lord, much less of what he required in the acts of Devotion. The <hi>Jews</hi> had lost their way, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> never knew it.</p>
            <p>But after his coming, whom the Father sent to be a Light to lighten <hi>These,</hi> and to be the Glory of <hi>Those,</hi> the Partition-Wall betwixt <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was broken down, and both united into, and made Members of one Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ is Head. Our Saviour having thus gathered and constituted his Church, and setled an orderly Government in it, the Primitive Christians knew it to be their Duty, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly held Communion with the one, and submitted to the other. They rejoyced to be of <hi>one Fold,</hi> under <hi>one Shepherd,</hi> not loosely <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 16.</note> scattered abroad as Sheep having none: They heard and obeyed his Voice, when he spoke by them, whom <hi>the Holy Ghost made Overseers of</hi>

When the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were but few, <hi>These all continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication,</hi> Act. 1. 14. And when the Word of God mightily grew and prevailed, <hi>The multitude of them that believed were of one Heart and of one Soul,</hi> Acts 4. 32. No foolish Prejudices, uncharitable Surmises, or fruitless search after sarther Purity, excluded them from the Fellowship of their Brethren, from a common Participation of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Prayers, and carrying on the designs of Christianity with joint Endeavours and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

An external Fellowship in the Word and Sacraments with their Brethren, with all their Brethren as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion presented it self was judged necessary; this transient Communion never to cease, 'till swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by that which shall be to everlasting <hi>in the Heavenly Jerusalem, in the general As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>

            <p>No care was neglected to prevent or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile Divisions.

            <p>When that great irreconcileable Controversie arose about the keeping of <hi>Easter, Polycarp</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent from the Eastern Churches to <hi>Anicetus</hi> chief Patriarch of the Western, though they could not agree as to the matter in hot Dispute, yet all other Endearments passed between them, they received the Blessed Sacrament together, and mutually consented in behalf of the Parties for whom they treated; that, however the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness they met about could not be composed, Peace and Communion should not withstanding be religiously maintained.</p>
            <p>Such was the Unity of the then Christian World, even among those of different Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Interests, and that were indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon one another.</p>
            <p>Such from the beginning was, and continued to be the practice of all; except that now and then that fretfull humour called Zeal, (which, when not according to Knowledge, is at best but a well meaning Phrenzie,) or else Ambition, carried on or defeated, made Men forsake the Communion of the Church, and disturb its

Peace (Let the present Troublers of our <hi>Israel</hi> assign which they please, perhaps it would be hard to excuse some of them from either of these Incentives to Separation) By the impulse of the former, the <hi>Catharists</hi> in the East, the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in the West and the <hi>Donatists</hi> in the South all Types of modern Zealots, with a Pharisaical Haughtiness thank'd God that they were not as other Men; and concluded themselves too Holy to join in Prayers and Sacraments with their Brethren.

And however the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> and other learned Men, thought <hi>Arianism</hi> took its rise from an aversion to Pagan Dotages, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant Zeal against many Gods hurrying on to acknowledge but one Person in the God-head; yet <hi>Theodoret</hi> affirms, that <hi>Alexander's</hi> being preferred before <hi>Arius,</hi> incensed the rejected Competitour to set on foot and propagate his detestable Doctrines.</p>

The great Universal Architect, all the Works of whose Hands join together to doe him Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not having put Enmity but requiring agreement among themselves, the early Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the Gospel, the first-Fruits of Christ, thought the Members of his Mystical Body more especially concerned to maintain Unity and Concord in the Church now newly estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd.

But not to insist upon these and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the <hi>Apostles</hi> to keep Men in the true Faith and Orthodox Worship, or upon their extraordinary power of punishing those which abused or forsook either: Not to tell of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> striking <hi>Elymas</hi> with Blindness, St. <hi>Peter's</hi> speaking <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> dead, and such like miraculous Inflictions; let us observe the ordinary regular Discipline used in after-times to engage Men to be tenacious of the Doctrine, and have regard to the Communion of the truly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Church. To this end were frequent Penances, and sometimes Excommunications inflicted not onely upon immoral, but also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on heretical and schismatical Persons. Indeed none of these Offenders could be restrained without authority to punish all: For Men will be apt to run on blindly in the way to Hell, if they do not hearken to such as God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be their Guides towards Heaven; and will soon become vitious in their Lives, when they leave off being found in Faith, or being orderly in Worship: And the Church will not long retain her Purity, if she cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to the Disturbers of her Peace. Some of the greatest Troublers whereof have kept up their Reputation in despite of, and justified their Separation from her, by making a shew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and greater Purity than others; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which Pretences her Censures have fallen heavily and justly upon them.</p>

As a Community she must needs have this inherent Power to correct the Members of her Society that offended against the Laws of it. Without the right exercise of such Authority, Christ's Religion would in its Infancy have been buried in Weakness, and have had no hopes of ever imitating him by rising again in Glory. But the Influence of the forementioned Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made the Christians that lived under a due awe of them to shine as Lights in the midst of a wicked and perverse Generation, to be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Instances of Holiness in their Lives, lest they should be such of Terrour in their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To weak-sighted Men who could not be so heartily affected with the <hi>Reversion</hi> of Joy or Misery, <hi>present</hi> Penalties were, and always will be the chief Sanctions of the Evangelical Law, most strongly fence and secure it from Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Distress, no penitentiary Humiliations were tedious to them: With Tears, Sighs and Groans that cannot be utter'd they constantly begg'd, and at last gain'd Absolution in the end of the <hi>appointed</hi> time; this was seldom short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, except when danger of Death, great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, the Number, Dignity, or Infirmity of Criminals, induced the Church to mitigate her Sentence towards them. The most scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ossenders, Hereticks and Apostates upon a thorow Repentance were admitted to publick Penance and the Sacraments, and the <hi>Novatians</hi> condemned who would have them excluded from both.

Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was propagated in Purity and Holiness, and often without disturbance; became victorious and triumphant over the Temptations of its Sp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and the Rage of its Temporal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>'Twas then as much as now morally impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that all Men should be of the same Mind, as to Faith and Worship; yet the open avowing of their Dissent was thought necessary to be restrained.

those former, yet this will follow, that both being mightily destructive to the good of the Community ought to be suppressed as far as may be, though there be no hopes of totally rooting them out.</p>
            <p>This will be farther evidenced in my third General next to be spoken to. Wherein,</p>
            <p n="3">III. I am to enquire how far, now-a-days, the Supreme Magistrate, and those in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under him may proceed, in order to the uniting Men in Judgment and Practice, as to matters of Religion, and the Worship of God, to the keeping them <hi>stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged that the Prince of Peace would have his Gospel taught, as himself establish'd it, with Meekness and Gentleness; would have Gain-sayers <hi>convinc'd,</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of unreasonable Men put to silence by the Power of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> That the noblest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest which is <hi>quietly</hi> gain'd over Minds revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God and Reason; Force may enslave the <hi>Man,</hi> but this fetters his <hi>Will,</hi> and captivates his Understanding. Wherefore that restless un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Fury, wherewith some Men carry on the business of Religion in a violent sanguinary way, is not a Christian agreement to propagate our Saviour's Doctrines, but a conspiracy of


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98594:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Traytours against him; not the Zeal of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but the rage of Lunaticks.</p>
            <p>But here let me not be mistaken, as if I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to wrest the Sword out of the Magistrate's Hands, who is the Minister of God, a Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to execute Wrath upon them that <hi>doe</hi> Evil. That <hi>doe</hi> Evil I say; for as long as Men keep their <hi>Thoughts</hi> to themselves, they are indeed, can be accountable onely to the Searcher of Hearts. But when Pride, Obstinacy, Faction, or suppose we, Folly broaches their Opinions to the disturbance of Church or State, to the dangerous violation of the Laws of either, here Christianity does not forbid, nay commands the publick execution of Justice. Even the mischievous Fool (though the designing Knave should not lurk under, as he too often does) may be justly punished. Otherwise the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate would bear the Sword in vain, would not have Power to take edged Tools out of the Hands of those that ought not to be entrusted with them, and really would be placed as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded Sheep in the midst of Wolves.</p>
            <p>Whatever be pretended on the part of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when the Publick lies at stake, Mercy to the Troublers of it is the greatest Cruelty to the Innocent, is the tenderness of Children and Fools, is to destroy the whole Body in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to a few corrupted Members. He that without very good reason winks at Crimes, though perhaps in their own Nature small, yet


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98594:11"/>
in their Tendency of fatal Consequence, has more to answer for than he that committed them; because it is less excuseable to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Offences in cold Bloud, than to act them in hot.</p>
            <p>I appeal to the Consciences of those who now think themselves Wronged, and have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates (it were to be wish'd I could not say among our selves) that complain they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by the due execution of Laws, whether they can imagine it to be a thing indifferent, of no concern to the Honour of God, and the Peace of the State, whether Men be of one Heart and of one Soul or not? Whether when every one says, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and I of Cephas,</hi> such Divisions do not natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow as crucisie Christ asresh, and put him to open Shame? And certainly to conceive that our Redeemer would in his Houshold, the Church, be so much less faithfull than <hi>Moses</hi> as to leave such necessary things out of order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Power somewhere to settle them, would be no less absurd than to fancy with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that the wise the gratious Father of all, has abandoned the Orphan World to the blind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chance.</p>
            <p>This goodly Frame of the Universe, might as soon have jumpt together casually, and be kept so, as Men will be joined together (as they should be) without an over ruling Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, without a coercive Power. The most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

Persuasives (we dayly see) cannot pierce and break the Obstinacy that is rooted by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, Peevishness or Design. The Madness of the People is sometimes such that it won't be stilled by any Words, except of him who spoke the World into a Being, and the roaring of the Sea into a Calm. What then, shall Men be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to embrace and publish what Opinions they please, though such as influence their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Hazard of Ecclesiastical or Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? God has not so left himself without a Witness; but besides establishing Divine Laws, has authorized Humane whenever not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the other <hi>to give knowledge of Salvation to his People, to give Light to them that sit in Darkness, and to guide their Feet into the way of Peace.</hi> He demands not onely the Purity, but also the humble Submission of the Heart, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the Resignation of the Will and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to him and his Vicegerents. These he has impowered to add to, yea upon occasion to take from, what his own Wisedom had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God appointed the <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 12.</note>

            <p>And certainly, since They are commissioned to <hi>lay</hi> Injunctions, it will be the Subjects Duty to perform, and theirs to require, yea force Obedience to them. For Authority supposes a


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98594:12"/>
right to assert it; and the power of enacting Laws, implies an Obligation to make, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to execute the Sanctions of them.</p>
            <p>It is not here designed to whet the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate's Sword and Rage, to put him upon using the one, and laying out the other in Cruelty and Oppression. No; there should be a Fellow-feeling among the Members of Christ. He that punishes Offences, may and ought to pity the Offenders. The Bowels may yern, while the Hand strikes. The Father corrects in kindness; and by the bye, he spoils his Child if he spare the Rod. God himself in Mercy thinks upon Wrath: the several Chastisements of the Lord, whether immediately inflicted or onely permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him (as all Penalties should) chastise past miscarriages in order to prevent future; the Sufferer's Obliquity is always the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cause, his or others Amendment the Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. And surely those that are deputed by him to doe Justice and to shew Mercy upon the Earth, may be kind as our heavenly Father is, that is, punish with design to reclaim.</p>
            <p>And if gentler Methods will not prevail, if every Indulgence from the higher Powers onely encourages Men to be more sawcy in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; if a Factious Seditious Party be manifestly hatching and carrying their treasonable Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to introduce a tyrannical Commonwealth in the place of the best setled Monarchy, and a novel Religion instead of the truly Apostolical;

When Christians were engaged in private Differences too busie to attend the Motions and obviate the Designs of the common Enemy, then the <hi>Turks</hi> overrun so much of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> When <hi>Pelagian</hi> Pride endeavoured to advance the depraved Power of Nature, the feeble Essays of Reason, and the corrupted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Man's will above the necessity, and against the onely sufficiency of Divine Grace, and upon this and other Heresies Dissensions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose; then did God empty the full Vials of his Wrath, raised up the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> the <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> and other Instruments of his Vengeance to chastise the unhappy Litigants.</p>
