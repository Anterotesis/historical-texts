            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S best deserving Precedency I beginne
at you, whose short Character may be
this: One who is accomplished with
such endowments as make an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
man, the meanest whereof would
blow up some men with self-conceit,
selfe-love, selfe-praise, and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
disparaging of others abilities; He hath learned that
God distributeth not his gifts to all men, and makes good
use of it; for he derideth, despraiseth, nor condemneth
any man, nor his workes nor actions as being conscious
that God might have endued him with that mans spirits,
to have produced no more admirable thing: He reades
many bookes; though he may serve for a library himselfe,
yet his censure of these bookes he measureth by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
abilitie, good intention, and the profits it may yeeld
to meaner Capacities than his, but so discreetly, that his
words favour more of Commendation than reproach: In
<pb facs="tcp:14966:24"/>
a word, he is one that escapeth not the Venemous bites of
the ignorant Rable, but hath Antidotes against it, Yea hee
is one, who when he considers my Travells, studies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences,
and painefull observations, and withall that my
tenne yeares travell abroad hath taught me almost to forget
my Native Language, and that the importunitie of friends
made me put this to the view of the world which I
thought ever to suppresse, as being for the most part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in the Countrey, farre from the conversation of the
learned which is the cheefe helpe to the perfectioning of
such workes; he is one I say, that will then give such a
Candide censure of me and it, that the most rigide Critick
will be strucke dumbe from Calumnie; But before I leave
him, let him give me leave to tell him ingenuously, that to
him onely I present this worke, and promise that ere long
he shall be gratified with a present farre more worthy of
his excellently well qualified goodnesse. As opposite in all
the former expressions to the courteous, I addresse my selfe
to the carping Reader; He is not a naked but a ragged
pretender to all wit and learning and hath a smattering of
many some things: He is so conceited of himselfe that he
is not content to discommend some of the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of another mans creature, as not elegant enough
or uniformely composed, but will lay most vile and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
asperations on the whole body of it whilst in his
owne conscience he findes his to be but prodigious mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
if ever he had a sparke of <hi>Promethean</hi> fire in him to
give a short life to any thing: When hee meetes with
any ignorant men, then the Peacockes taile of ostentation
spreads abroad and they silly creatures admire the Varietie
of its colours even to the disparagement of more perfit
and more sweetly singing Birds: but presently that falls,
and the most ignorant then perceive the harshnesse of his
note: He feedes all the world with large promises of some
rare worke to proceed from him ere long, and thereby hee
so long feedes and drinkes; till both he and it and his name
<pb facs="tcp:14966:24"/>
doe all die: and none to sing his <hi>requiem;</hi> Now being
loath to resuscitate so peccant a humour, I leave him too
without an Epitaph in hope never to heare of his successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or his ghost wandring after this.</p>
            <p>For the ignorant Reader, hee hath such a qualitie, to
make himselfe appeare wittie, that he will commend eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that he doth not understand and so I am sure of his
approbation; but <hi>Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

I leave him to admire and wish for better proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Lastly, to the view of all in generall; I expose this
booke into the world; upon this confidence that if the
most discreet and Iudicious give it but that auspicious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
that many worthy and learned gave it before it
sufferd the Presse; for the rest my care is taken; yet shall I
to all (but in a different manner) ever be</p>

Thereby, in a manner, to make men partakers of their

(the patronesse and president of wisdome) to
have issued from <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s braine, and the Muses (nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

that <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeo,</hi> and <hi>M. T. Cicero,</hi> do so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
extoll the knowledge of it, giving to it the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of the Searcher of vertue, the Expeller, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser

can reach) of all the secrets that Mother Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth

within or upon them.</p>
                  <p>What time can we better spend here on Earth, than

GOD, the Maker of Nature; for the knowledge of
naturall things, and of their causes, leadeth us (as it
were) by the hand to the search of their Author and
Maker. This the Poet points at, when he sang,

not represent unto us the Image and Power of the

properly we call Philosophy, or Physick, which in
this Treatise I intend most to handle; and by which,
as by one of the principall parts of Philosophy, the
reader may have an insight in the Cabals and secrets
of Nature.</p>
                  <p>The Philosophers and Learned sort reserved, in a

more necessary to be knowne, and lesse irreligious to

                     <p>And because the Heavens, of all the parts of the
World are most conspicuous, as that wheretoever we
bend our eyes, being the most glorious Creature of all
the Creators workes; at it I will begin: but as I said,
I would alwayes have the Reader to understand that
I propound these questions not so absolutely of mine
owne braine to solve them,<note place="margin">The way how these questions are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> as to give him a view of

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> First then, I aske of what matter are the
heavens composed?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Diverse have beene the opinions of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
upon this subject: For <hi>Averroes</hi> in his first
booke of the heavens, and there in Text 7. and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14966:29"/>
tenth, holds it to bee so simple a body that it is free
from all materiall substance; which opinion of his,
by this may be refelled, that with <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the eight
booke of his <hi>Metaph. chap.</hi> 2. and in his first booke
<hi>De coelo,</hi> and Text 92. What ever things falles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the compasse of our senses, these same must bee
materially substantiall: But the heavens are such, and
therefore they must be materiall. Besides that all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
Essences consist of matter and forme, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
in his second booke of Physicke <hi>chap.</hi> 1. hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.<note place="margin">Diverse opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens substance.</note>
But so it is that the heavens are movable, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot be free of matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> Seeing then it is evinced by argument, and
concluding reasons, that the heavens doe consist of
matter; I aske now, what kinde of matter are they
compounded of?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The Philosophick Schooles in this point
are different: Some of them maintaining, a like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be common with them, and the sublunarie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that is, that they were composed of the foure
elements, of which all things here below doe exist.
Neither lacked there some Sects that gave forth for
truth, that the heavens were of a fierie and burning
nature,<note place="margin">What is the true matter &amp; substance of the firmament.</note> which opinion <hi>Aristotle</hi> confuteth by many
reasons in his first Book, <hi>De coelo chap.</hi> 3. establishing
his owne, which have beene held for truth not only by
his Sectaries the Peripateticks, then; but ever since
have beene approved; which is, that the matter of
the heavens being distinct in nature, from that of the
foure elements of which all other sublunarie things
are framed, must bee composed of a quintessence;
which opinion of his he thus maintaineth against the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14966:29"/>
                        <hi>Platonists</hi> and all others who maintained that it was
framed of the most pure and mundified part of the
foure elements: for (saith hee) All simple motion
which we finde in nature, must belong unto some sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
body; But so it is that we finde a circular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in nature which no wayes appertaineth unto any
of the elements, in regard that in direct line, they
either fall downeward, as the waters and earth; or else
they ascend upward, as the ayre, and fire: And it is
certaine that one simple body, cannot have more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and naturall motions than one. Wherefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
of necessitie, that seeing none of the elements
have this circular motion as is before verified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there must be a distinct simple body from them,
to which this motion must appertaine, and that must
be the heaven.</p>
                     <p>As for those who enforce identitie of matter in kind,
betwixt the heavens and these elementarie things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and consequently would involve them under
corruption, which is peculiar to all other things; their
warrant is of no validitie: for although they take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, to demonstrate, by their late <hi>Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
observations in the <hi>Aetherian</hi> region, new prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
not observed nor remarkable heretofore, which
both <hi>Ruvius</hi> and the <hi>Conimbricenses</hi> give forth to
proceed from a corruption, and defect of the first
cause from whence they flow; They mistake: in so

that I thinke it free from all change, but

                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> You conclude then that the heavens are of

are,<note place="margin">What is the substance of the stars.</note> because in simple and not composed bodyes their
parts doe communicate with that same nature, and
matter whereof the whole is; so that the heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a most simple body, and the Starres, her parts or a

must be, for besides, that we discerne them so with

round. But so it is, that all Starres are of a like forme

of that light wherewith shee shineth unto us at the

we may better conceive the weaknesse of her light in
her eclipses; when the earths shadow, interposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Sun and her directly, vaileth and masketh
her face; which then appeareth blackishly browne,
yet not altogether destitute of light. Now as the
light of the Sunne is the fountaine of warmenesse

is the purenesse, subtilenesse, and simplicity (if I may

rolling about in a per-ennall whirling and rotation,
doe lance forth their power upon the Earth also.<note place="margin">The neerest cause.</note> The
neerest Physicall or naturall cause againe, must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to be cold and heate; heate from these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
bodies, to rarifie or attenuate the vapors of the
Earth, whereby they may bee the easier evaporated
by the Sunne; or heate, to draw fumes and vapours
from the Earth upward; cold againe, to condensate
and thicken those elevated vapours in the Ayre; to
thicken them, I say, either in clouds, raine, or snow, or
the rest.</p>
                     <p>Thus,<note place="margin">Their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test matter.</note> as the Meteors have a twofold cause as you
have heard, so have they a two fold matter. The first
and remotest, are the two Elements, but of them
chiefly Earth, and Water: the neerer cause or matter
are exhalations extracted from these former two.
Which exhalations I divide in fumes and vapours:
fumes being a thin exhalation hot and dry, elevated
from the Earth; and that of their most dried parts, by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14966:34"/>
the vertue of the heavenly Starres, and the Sunnes
warmenesse elevated, I say, by the vertue and warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Sunne and Stars, from the driest parts of
the Earth, even the Element of fire, from whence, and
of which, our Comets, fiery-Darts, Dragons, and
other ignean Meteors doe proceed; although later
Astronomers have found and give forth, some of the
Comets formation to be above the Moone.</p>
                     <p>Whereas vapours are exhalations,<note place="margin">Matter and cause of the moist Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors.</note> thicker, and
hotter, swifter drawne up from the Seas and Waters
by the power of the Sun and Stars; of which vapors,
thither elevated, are framed, our raines, snow, haile,
dewe, wherewith (they falling back againe) the Earth
is bedewed and watered: When, I say, that these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
are hot and moist; thinke it not impossible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the waters, their mother, be cold and moist;
for that their warmnesse is not of their owne innate
nature, but rather accidentall to them by vertue of the
Sunne and Starres warmnesse; by whose attractive
power, as the efficient cause, they were elevated. Now
then as of fumes, elevated to the highest Region of
the Ayre, the fiery Meteors are composed: so of their
watery vapours which are drawne no higher than
the middle Region, proceeds raine, clouds, snow, haile,
and the rest; or if they passe not beyond this low Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
wherein we breath, they fall downe into dew, or
in thick mysts.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt fumes and vapours.</note> that these vapours are of a middle or
meane nature, betwixt the Ayre and the Waters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they resolve in some one of the two easily; even
as fumes are medians betwixt fire and earth, in respect
that they are easily transmuted or changed in the one
or the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:14966:34"/>
And thus as you have heard the efficient and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
causes of Meteors:<note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the Meteors.</note> So now understand that their
forme dependeth upon the disposition of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for the materiall dissimilitude, either in quantity,
or quality, in thicknesse, thinnesse, hotnesse, drinesse,
aboundance, or scarcity, and so forth, begetteth the
Meteor it selfe, different in species and forme, as if
you would say, by the aboundance of hot and dry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled
fumes, from the Earth, and the most burnt
parts thereof are begot the greater quantity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
winds, thunders; and contrary-wayes by the
aboundance of moist vapours, elevated by the force
of the Sunne from the Seas and waters, we judge of
aboundance of raine, haile, or snow, or dew, to ensue,
according to the diverse degrees of light in the Ayrie
Region whither they are mounted.</p>
                     <p>Now, when I said before, that hot exhaled fumes
are ever carried aloft, to the highest Region of the
Ayre; take it not to be so universally true, but that
at times, they may be inflamed even in this low Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ours here; and that through the Sunnes defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of heate, for the time: for as the uppermost Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is alwayes hot, the middle alwayes cold, so is
the lower, now hot, now cold, now dry, and againe
moist, according to the Sunnes accesse, or recesse

and 3. as he imputeth the ebbing and flowing of
the Sea to the Moone, so he ascribeth the cause of its
saltnesse to the Sunne, by whose beames the thinnest
and sweetest purer parts of it, are extenuated and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
in vapors, whilest the thicker and more terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall
parts (which are left behind by that same heate)
being <hi>adust</hi> become bitter and salt; which the same
Author confirmeth in that same place before cited, by
this, that the Southerne Seas are salter, and that more
in Summer, then the others are; and inforceth it by
a comparison in our bodies, where our urine by him
is alleadged to be salt in respect that the thinner and
purer part of that moistnesse, by our inborne warme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is conveyed and carryed from our stomack
(wherein by our meate and drinke it was engendred)
thorough the rest of the parts of our body: Neither
leaveth he it so, but in his Problems <hi>Sect 23. &amp;</hi> 30.
for corroboration hereof he maintaineth, that the
lower or deeper the Sea-water is, it is so much the
fresher, and that because the force of the Suns heat
pierces and reaches no further, then the Winter Cold
extendeth its force for freezing of waters unto the
uppermost superfice only, and no further.</p>
                     <p>If it bee true then that the Seas are salt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are not lakes and rivers by that same reason, salt

that many ascribe the cause of his death to
have beene a deepe melancholy contracted for not
conceaving the cause aright of the often flowing and
ebbing of Euripus a day, rather than to the not
knowing the true cause of the Seas ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chiefly, seeing Meteor. 2 &amp; 3. he ascribeth it to
the Moone the mother and nurse of all moist things;
which is the most receaved opinion, and warranted
with the authoritie of <hi>Ptolomee</hi> and <hi>Plinius</hi> both, as
depending upon her magnetick power, being of all
Planets the lowest, and so the neerer to the Sea; which
all doe acknowledge to bee the mistris of moisture,
and so no question but to it it must be referred, which
may bee fortified with this reason. That at all full
Moones and changes, the Seas flowing and swelling
is higher then at other times, and that all high
streams and tydes are observed to bee so, seeing the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14966:37"/>
Moone doth shine alike upon all Seas, what is the
cause that the Mediterranean Sea, together with the
West Indian-Seas, all along <hi>Hispaniola</hi> and <hi>Cuba</hi> and

to a world of extent, hath no ebbing nor flowing, but

thus I adventure.</p>
                     <p>And first, why the Adamant which for hardnesse

<hi>Sect.</hi> 8. giveth no other reason than that absolutely,
it is one of the greatest miracles and secrets of Nature;
and therein refuteth their opinions, who alleage the
Analogie and agreement of the common principles
of Nature; which are common to the bloud and to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14966:43"/>
the Adamant together,<note place="margin">The true cause how the hard Adamant is dissolved in a dish of Goats bloud.</note> to be the cause; yet I thinke
for my owne part, that if any naturall reason may be
given in so hidden a mystery, it may be this; That
Goates (as we all know) live and feed usually on cliffie
Rocks wheron herbs of rare pearcing and penetrative
vertues and qualities grow; (neither is the derivation
of that herbes name Saxifrage other, than from the
power it hath to breake stones asunder) Goates then,
feeding on such rockie-herbes as these, no wonder
that their bloud having Analogie and proportion to
their food, be penetrative, and more proper to bee
powerfull in vertue, than otherwayes convertible in
fatnesse, for wee see them of all grazing Beasts the
leanest.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> Now by what power draweth the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ. Aristotle</hi> in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Booke of his Physicks
which almost al other Philosophers do affirme,<note place="margin">What maketh the Loadstone draw Iron.</note> That
the Loadstone attracteth Iron unto it by their simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and likenesse of substances; for so you see they
are both of a like colour: and that must be the cause
how the false-Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> his Chest of Iron,
wherein his bones are, doth hang miraculously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supported
of any thing, because either the pend or
some verticall stone of the Vault where it is kept, is of
Loadstone: and thus with <hi>Iulius Scaliger, Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
151.</hi> I disallow <hi>Caspar Bartholinus</hi> his opinion,
who alleageth that the Loadstone doth not meerely

but for that it is nourished and fed by Iron; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Here also it will not be amisse to adde the reason
why the Needles of Sea-compasses (as these of
other Sun-Dyals) being touched by the Loadstone,
doe alwayes turne to the North;<note place="margin">What maketh the Needle in a Sea compasse turne ever to the North.</note> and this is the most

                     <p>The opposites on the other side doe thus maintaine
their breathing; all living creatures not onely breath,
but so necessarily must breath that for lack of it they
dye, as experience sheweth: nay, that the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects,
or (as you would say) demi-creatures, they must
breathe: but fishes are living Creatures, therefore
they must breathe. The Aristotelians answering this,
distinguish the major proposition, restraining the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
of it but to such Creatures as live in the
Aire, whereas there is no Ayre in the water, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it not admitting place for Ayre as the Earth
doth, which being opened with any Instrument, as
with a Plough or Spade, may admit Ayre; whereas
the waters will fill all the void presently againe, as
we may see by buckets, boxes, or any other materiall
thing, being put into the water, and taken out againe,
doe leave no <hi>vacuum</hi> behinde them; for the waters
doe straight wayes reincorporate: seeing then there
is no Ayre in the Fishes Element, they cannot nor
need not be said to breath; for contrariwise wee see
that being drawne from the waters to the Ayre they
doe incontinently dye.</p>
                     <p>For answer to both extreames,<note place="margin">What way fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es may be said to breath.</note> I could allow for
fishes a kind of respiration called refrigeration, which

nothing properly can be said to breath but that which

the beasts of the earth, and the fishes of the Sea, at

hee made of all these kindes <hi>Amphibia.</hi> And as
there are foure footed beasts and fowles of double
kinds, living promiscuously on land and water, why
may there not be fishes of that nature also? of which
hereafter. So hath hee indued the Aire (as the more
noble element of the three) with that prerogative;
that in it, either fowles or watery creatures might be
engendred; out of vapors either moist or terrestriall,
or extracted from standing lakes, stanckes, marishes,
myres, or the like oyly and marshie places; which

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> What have you to say to this, that as there

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Fowles they cannot be,<note place="margin">Apodes, or fowles without feet or Plumes.</note> because fowles
are defined to be living creatures feathered and two

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Their generation is beyond the ordinary
course of nature, in so much that ordinarily one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
begetteth another; but so it is, that this fowle is
engendred of certaine leaves of trees, out of which in
a manner it buddeth, and ripeneth; Now, these trees
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14966:46"/>
growing upon the bankes of lakes, doe, at their due
time, cast these leaves, which falling into the lake, doe
there so putrifie, that of them is engendred a Worme,
which by some secret fomentation &amp; agitation of the
waters, with the Suns helpe, groweth by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to be a fowle somewhat bigger than a Mallard, or
wild Duck; and in those waters they live and feed,
and are eaten by the inhabitants thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>First then, I resolve their questions who argument
against the possibility of this generation, and then I
shall cleare you of that doubt you have proposed:
thus it standeth then with these Argumentators; when

is more perfect, and these are our Bees, waspes, flyes,
midges and so forth, which are engendred of some

our Insects are not a like to the putrified earth or

to be alike, that is, in some respect, in so farre as they
communicate in this, that they are produced of the

colder, according as the reverberation of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:14966:55"/>
Sunnes heat from the earth affecteth it: although I
grant, that the ayre, of its owne nature, is hot; yet
that hindereth not, but accidentally, it may be heated
also, yea sometimes made hotter then of its nature it
is. To this question I answer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> That the subtilty and rarefaction of the
ayrs humidity hindereth the Sunne from exhaling
of it; for although some parts of the moist ayre be
grosser than others, yet the same grosser parts are
more subtile then any vapor, which the Sun extracteth
from the earth or waters: for not all subtile humidity
is evaporable, but that of water only, as that which
may more easily be apprehended by heat.</p>
                     <p>As then,<note place="margin">The lowest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the aire is hot and moist, both by nature and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</note> the lowest and first region of the ayre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

by nature and accident; as I was saying, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation
of the sunne-beames, upon solid and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible
bodyes, and heated by the exhalation of
fumes from places or things that are apt to be kindled,
even so, the uppermost region is hot and dry, both by
nature, and accident; and almost more, or rather
by accident then by nature, <hi>propter viciniam ignis;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the supreme region must be hotter then the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note place="margin">The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most region hot and dry.</note>
both in respect of the propinquity of it, to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of fire, (even as the lowest region by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood

                     </argument>
                     <p>NOW remaines to know in which of these
Regions any of these Meteors are framed:<note place="margin">In what region of the Ayre the Meteors are composed.</note> and
first, whether or not Clouds be generated in
the middle Region of the Ayre? It is most likely, that
not there, but in the lower; because in it diverse

                     <p>To which, not so much cold is requisit, as to the
other two; yet the nature of Clouds being considered,
we shall finde them to be generated in the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
onely.</p>
                     <p>For, seeing Clouds are nothing else but vapours
mounted, and thickned by condensed cold; then sure
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14966:56"/>
they cannot bee framed in the uppermost Region of
the Ayre,<note place="margin">What clouds are.</note> because in it the Sunnes rayes are directed,
lacking reflex, beside the circular and Spherick moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it hath, by vertue of the proximity of the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
fire, which warmeth it againe: this thickning or
condensing cold cannot be in the lower region, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the heate of it through the reverberation of the
Suns rayes, beating upon the solid bodies of the earth,
and waters: so there resteth the middle Region, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
the reflex faileth, &amp; the vertue from above too of the
direct Sunnes rayes; so that naturally it being cold, in
it only these vapours must be condensed to a cloud.<note place="margin">Clouds are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned in the middle region.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas I was saying before that it should
seeme that the Clouds are begotten in the lowest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
in respect that in it, Waters, as Dew and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
at least their matter and forme are brought
forth, that alwayes cannot hold; because that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and Rivers, are rather bred in the concavities,
and hollow places of the earth, than of it, or rather
flow and have their source from the Seas.</p>
                     <p>Neither must my words be mistaken, when I say
that the middle Region is naturally cold, seeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have set downe the Ayre, naturally to be hot
and moist; for when I say that it is cold, it must bee
understood, but respectively, in regard of the other
two, as wanting the reflective heate of the lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the circulative heat by the <hi>ignean</hi> or fiery

                     <p>Now if it be objected that seeing the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

                     <p>Finally it may be said here, that clouds not onely
may bee seene beneath us to inviron the tops of our

Alpes, at <hi>Genoa,</hi> have seene them below me along the
sides of the Mountaines; they likewise may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to glide over the Plaines, and swimming over
our Lakes and Rivers: yet that serveth not to prove,
that they are generated in the lowest Region;<note place="margin">The foggy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours which we see like clouds skim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our lakes are but ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to frame the cloud.</note> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

gathering of them together; of which the clouds
must bee coagulated and no otherwise, as that they

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of falling Starres, Fleakes in the Ayre, and other such
fiery Meteors.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere be foure Elements as all know; the Fire hot
and dry, the Ayre hot and moist, the Earth dry
and cold, the Waters cold and moist. Now as of the
moisture of the Waters, whether in their owne Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or on the Earths superfice, are composed all
watery vapours, as clouds, raine, dew, haile, snow,
and hoare-frosts, &amp;c. Even so, from the dry parts of
the Earth, calefied, or made hot by the Sun-beames
doe proceed fumy exhalations, whereof the fiery and
burning Meteors are generated.</p>
                     <p>But so it is,<note place="margin">The matter and forme of fiery Meteors from whence they proceed.</note> that of these vaporous exhalations,
whereof all the ignite and fiery Meteors or impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are composed, all are not framed alike; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the diversity of the dispositions of their
matter they are either round or long, or more long
than round, or more round than long; for if by the
efficient and materiall causes, which are the Sunne-beames
exhaling these fumous evaporations from the
driest part of the Earth, these spumeous exhalations
are such as are combustible and capable to bee kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
(if it be of a like length and breadth:) then in that
case, it shall be seene to burne in the uppermost Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Ayre like a blazing fire of straw: if it bee
longer than broad, then is it taken for those long fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Stars, which by the Meteorologians are called
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:14966:58"/>
                        <hi>Dall.</hi> If otherwayes broader than long, then are they
called fiery inflammations, which seeme to reele in
the Ayre, as it were, and to shoot hither and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And because sometimes these exhalations (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
dry) have some coldnesse in them; therefore
the ejaculation of that cold matter, maketh the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor
to seeme by that extrusion to fall;<note place="margin">What are our falling-stars.</note> as being in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to expell it; whence more properly are our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

at other times strait downe, or upward, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as their matter is for the time either disposed or

                     <p>And if it be objected how contrary to their nature
can they descend or fall downe,<note place="margin">What maketh them fal dovvn seeing they are light?</note> their matter being
light and not ponderous? I told before, that that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by expulsion, and by way of projection; for

we have of Thunder, whose bolts and claps light at
times, even at our feet; otherwhiles what in our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

in the middle Region of the Ayre, not by exusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any kindled hot matter, but rather by a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an expelling cold; meane while this cold
thickning and coagulating it selfe together with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
in a manner detrudeth the hot matter, which
with it was thither drawn up, and maketh such a noise
and terrible din, the time of that expulsion, that not
only the Ayre seemeth to bee rent asunder, but the
very Earth also appeareth to tremble at its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:14966:58"/>
Iust so, as the matter of the falling Stars is placed,
they fall either straight down, aside, or upward, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I noted. Even so is it with the Thunder.</p>
                     <p>Now, as those vapors, thickned in the ayre, doe
produce the afore-said effects; so shall it not bee

are exhaled, or drawne up out of the earth by
vertue of the Sunnes rayes, beside the smoake of
our fires, which ascending to the ayre also augments
these fiery Meteors.</p>
                     <p>First vapors hot and dry, not having so much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity
in them, as may be able to overcome them;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14966:59"/>
but rather such, as may make this dry vapor to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
for no earthly thing can continue without moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, cold and dry, which altogether are of
the earth's nature, virtually cold, albeit formally all
vapors are hot.</p>
                     <p>The third are those vapours which are hot and
moyst, where humidity predominateth over the
heat.</p>
                     <p>The fourth kind of vapors which ascend, are cold
and moyst, in which absolutely watry moystnesse
beareth rule, and this vapor virtually is called cold.
These foure sorts of vapors then are the neerest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all our meteors.</p>
                     <p>The first whereof, <hi>viz,</hi> hot and dry vapors, doe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
through the ayre quickly, even to the concavity
of the firy and ignean element; where being enflamed
and enkindled, it becommeth the right generation and
propagator of our fiery Meteors: whereas, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
being hot, and moyst, doth not ascend so high;
and because it is easily resolved,<note place="margin">Ayre what.</note> it commeth to bee

                     <p>The other two cold and dry, and cold and moyst

and moyst are converted to raine; and the other cold
and dry to wind, or this falls downe with the pluvious

are foure kindes of vapors and exhalations, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the foure elements which make up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of these Meteors; in such sort, that as there are

hot, and dry exhalations, and cold and dry, even so
there are hot vapours and cold and humid ones also.</p>

falling stars and inflammations in the ayre, let us heare
what can bee objected: One demands, what is the

their matter and manner of composing is almost
alike.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Because the cloud which throweth away
and expelleth them, invironeth not them in her belly,
as their clouds doe, in which the matter of the thunder
is; for the thunder bursting thorough the cloud occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioneth
the clappe.</p>
                     <p>

inflammations, which at some times in the night are
seene, either amongst our horse feet when we ryde, or
about their maines, or sometimes like the glaunce of a
candle light before, a little above or about us? The
answer is, that these dry exhalations, as diverse other
things, are of severall degrees; some elevated to the
highest region, others to the middle region, and these,
which ascend no higher then this low region where
we inhabit, being composed of a more oleagenous,
or oyly substance, doe inflame sooner, than these of
the middle region doe, as being invironed with cold.</p>
                     <p>Or if it be asked?<note place="margin">Why are they not seene in the day time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

but the greater light obfuscateth the lesser.</p>

nothing else, but the vapors and exhalations, carryed
up to the ayre, which are condensed and thickned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
where, by accident, if in the midst of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation,

the Meteorologians answer not so fully satisfactorie
as theirs, who treate of spirits, whom I may well call
Physiognosticks: for the Albertists, upon this place,
say, that the cause is, the multitude of exhalations,

                     <p>COmets, being of the number of Ignean and fiery
Meteors; No question, they are composed of a
like matter; the difference being in the quantity of
that matter more or lesse, to wit, dry, clammie and hot
exhalations, in their framing being condensed, and by
reason of the motion of the superior bodyes, in the
fiery element beginning to kindle, doe make these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets;
and thus they differ from the fiery Dragons,
and falling sttars; for these Meteors, once kindled by
way of exustion, and extrusion, or projection, are
throwne downe suddenly, and so vanish; where, on
the other side, the dry and hot exhalations, whereof
Thunder is composed by way of detrusion, (the
cloud renting asunder, in whose body it was enclosed)
doe presently vanish, as lightnings (their forerunners)
doe.</p>

neither the firy kindling of them may soone consume
it, by the greatnesse and violence of it; neither must
their matter be so weake and thinne, that the fire may
on a sudden overcome it, but such as may endure at
least for a little season, both with the quality of the
fire, and the disposition of the matter condensed and
thickned; and yet so as the exustion or kindling of
the matter and condensed exhalation, beginning at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:14966:61"/>

Moone, and in effect, are but in the troubled Ayre,
with aboundance of exhalations and vapours, thorow
which, the Sunne and Moones rayes, making way to
themselves, do fashion these circles about them there.
Whereas these circles or long beards of the Comets,

                        </gap>e directly under, yea, sometime above the concave
of the Moone; and thence to the first Region of the
Ayre they are conveyed with the Comets of that
same matter of exhalation, and nature; although our
moderne Astronomers, now averting this <hi>Aristotelian</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:14966:61"/>
opinion, have found out some Comets place to bee

                     <p>This being briefly spoken of the matter and forme
of Comets,<note place="margin">What course the Comets observe.</note> it may be asked what course they have?
to which I answer; first, that the motion of Comets
is common with that naturall course of the world;
for either it is from the Orient to the Occident, or
from the West to the East: at times most frequently it
declineth to the South, and at other times to the
North; now high, then low, now seeming neere to
the Earth, then remote from it.</p>
                     <p>And if it be said, how can Comets have so many
different courses,<note place="margin">Answer for the diverse courses of Comets.</note> seeing a simple body can have no
more but one motion of it selfe? To this I say, that
as the Sphere of fire and the supreme Region of the
Ayre, by the heavenly motions are wheeled about
from the Orient to the Occident; thus the Comets
exist above the first Region, and so naturally with it
they should keepe the same course: in respect that
conformably a thing placed, must turne with the
place, in which it existeth. So if this first Region by
the rapidity of the Heavens be moved; much more
should Comets, they being neerer to it than the first
Region.</p>
                     <p>Now albeit the Heaven, Fire, and Ayre move in
a circular motion, yet they move not all alike, for by
certaine degrees the course of the one is swifter than
the other; so that the Ayre as neerest to the Earth,
is flower than the other two. By this subdeficiency
then, the Ayre, and they within it, seemes but to goe
about fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Occident to Orient of its own proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
having regard to the swiftnesse and velocity of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14966:62"/>
the superior course. And whereas I say, that they
move high and low, to and fro; that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in so far that every thing perfectible striveth to
attaine to its owne perfection; which consisteth in the
approximation and neere attaining and touching of
the generant, which chiefly beareth rule in the place,
whereat they aime or tend; whether that thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
bee a Star, or any other celestiall vertue,
whereunto this subdeficient striveth to attaine.</p>
                     <p>Now the reason wherefore most commonly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
doe reach,<note place="margin">What maketh the Comets commonly move from the South to the North.</note> either to the South, or North, is to
be attributed to the speciall influence of some other
Star drawing them thitherward; as the Loadstone
maketh Iron turne towards it: and whereas sometimes
they appeare low and neere the Earth; at other times
farther remote from it: that must be appropriated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the inflamation of the Comets matter, either
at the neerer or farther end, or else to the height, or
lownesse of the Region, above which it is elevated:
for none of the three Regions, but have in them their
owne degrees and stations, some parts in them being
higher than others are.</p>
                     <p>The place of their appearing is most frequently

of things here below, and whether over parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
persons or Countries in generall? To this the
Philosophers (who will have all things,<note place="margin">The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers deny it, admitting them but as naturall things.</note> either above
or below, to be and exist by naturall reasons, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no prodigies or things beyond nature) make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that Comets are but meere naturall things, no
way fore shewing evils to come.</p>
                     <p>Because (say they) when <hi>Iupiter</hi> fals to bee in the
signe of <hi>Pisces,</hi> or in the signe of <hi>Cancer,</hi> if then the
Comets appeare, it foretokeneth aboundance, and
wealth, as in the dayes of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> there was one
seene; which neverthelesse had no evill ensuing
upon it; as it may bee seene in <hi>Albertus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

                     </p>
                     <p>Besides this say they, when Comets are seene, then
these evils which follow them, and which they por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
should fall forth through all or very many parts
of the Earth, seeing they are seene by all, or most: the
contrary whereof is knowne.</p>
                     <p>Besides, that burning Lances or Speares which
now and then also are seene in the Ayre; and other
fiery impressions, which are of that same matter with
these Comets, should foretell evils to happen, as well
as they which are not.</p>
                     <p>But above all,<note place="margin">Other of their reasons why they can por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no evill to come.</note> seeing it is oftenest thought, that
Comets either foretoken great winds, or raines; none
of which can be, say they: not winds, because the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
whereof the winds behoveth to be, which are dry
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14966:63"/>
exhalations, are converted towards the framing of
the same Comets themselves.</p>
                     <p>Not raine; for no one thing can be a signe of two
opposite contrarieties. Thus seeing Comets portend
drouth, they cannot likewise preaugurate inundations,
and overflowings;<note place="margin">Other reasons of theirs.</note> finally, much lesse the death of
Princes and Monarchs no more than of other private
men; seeing the same constellation and ascendent may
be equall, and have regard to meane men as well as to
them, in a like distance.</p>
                     <p>Which reasons, with diverse moe albeit at first
view, they may seeme forcible; yet being better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
their insufficiency will soone appeare: for
none of the naturall Philosophers but doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their Prognostications, for some one thing or
other; albeit the Astrologicall Philosopher particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizeth
them more punctually.</p>
                     <p>And thus they say,<note place="margin">The contrary is seene by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> that a Comet circumbeamed
about with that which they call long hayre (to say so)
invironing it as we see, about the Sunne, Moone and
Starres; before a storme and great tempest, doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
and portend great debording of waters; whereas
if it bee but radiant in one side, that is a sure signe of
terrible and destructive drougth, and consequently of
famine and scarcity; because without humidity and

                     <p>Now as high winds move and stirre the Seas with

                     </argument>
                     <p>AS hot and dry exhalations are the matter and
cause of Meteors in the upper region of the aire,
of which before: Even so, cold and moist vapors are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14966:65"/>
the causes of these; after this manner; vapors eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up into the ayre, by force of the Sunnes beames;
and being separated from the heat which accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them; either, by that heat's ascending higher, and
leaving the grosser vapors; or the subtillest of that
heat being extinguisht by the grossenes, &amp; aboundance
of cold and moist vapors, which mounted up with it
in the ayre: or else by the coldnesse of the place, the
middle region of the ayre. These grosser vapors I say
segregated from that heat,<note place="margin">The first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of raine</note> which accompanied it, and
being thickned and carried about in the ayre for a
time, fall back againe to the earth; but being first
coagulated in a cloud,<note place="margin">The way how raine falleth downe.</note> which dissolving, falleth down
to the place from whence it ascended: so that by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion first the waters resolving in vapors, the
vapors thickning in a cloud, then that dissolving back
againe into waters, imitateth in a manner the circular
motion of the Sunne, by whose approximation as
these vapors are elevated, even so by his elongation
(if I may say so) they doe fall backe againe.</p>
                     <p>Now, as this is the generall cause of these moyst
Meteors, so is it the particular cause of the falling of
Rayne: for Raine being a watery vapor, carryed up
by heat into the Ayre, and there that heat leaving it,
resolveth and falleth downe againe in great or lesser
showers, according to its quantity.</p>
                     <p>Dew and Hoare-frost are not so generated,<note place="margin">The matter &amp; manner how dew is engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> for
why? When there is not such quantity of vapors ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
in the day time (through want of heat to draw
them up, or through great drowth upon the earth,)
they are not carried high: in hoter countreys they
fall downe againe before the day be spent, and that by
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14966:65"/>
them is called <hi>Serene,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What is that which in France we call Serene.</note> as in France particularly: So
when these elevated vapors are thickned in waters,
without either so much heat as may dry them up, or
so much cold as to congeale them; then I say the
dew appeareth.</p>
                     <p>Now the Hoar-frost happeneth otherwise;<note place="margin">The matter &amp; manner how Hoare-frost, are fashioned.</note> as,
when the like exhaled vapours are congealed, before
they be condensed; whereby you may see that dew
falleth in temperate times and places, whereas Hoare-frosts
fall in Winter and in the colder parts of the
earth: and the reason may be alleadged, that, seeing
vapors are hoter than water; in respect of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitating
heat, whereby they are carried up; no
question, but more cold is required, for the congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vapors, then of waters: and so if in cold sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and places, waters congeale, and harden, much
more may we say of vapors congealable into Hoare-frost.
Thus we have touched the materiall and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
causes of dew and Hoare-frost; so it shall not be
amisse to shew that the time when the Sun ingendreth
these Meteors in the ayre, by the drawing up of these
vapors, from out the earth and waters, must be, when
the lowest region of the ayre is, calme, serene and
cleare, without wind raine, or cooling clouds; for
they being mounted thither may either hinder their
ascending or condensation and thickning; as also the
stirring winds would hinder their condensation, or at
least their congregation or gathering together.</p>
                     <p>Now that both dew and Hoare-frost are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of vapors not carryed high in the ayre,<note place="margin">The place where dew and hoare-frost are framed.</note> by this it
may be knowne; because we see little Hoare-frost or
dew, in the higher mountaines, where it seemeth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14966:66"/>
likeliest, they are made and doe recide in regard of the
cold there; which is so much the more probable in
this, that the heat, which elevateth these vapors from
low and Marshy places, carrying (as you would say) a
burden heavier then their hability can comport
with, leaveth them ere they can ascend any higher.</p>
                     <p>Besides that, we may say, that the second region of
the ayre, being higher than these mountaines, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
about; and in a manner drawne after the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
wheeling about of the heavens, dissolveth these
vapors by its motion; and by this meanes maketh the
dew and Hoare-frost, for so I expound <hi>Pruina.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, a greater motion is required, to
disgregate and sunder apart heavy and many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors,
then few and light ones; now seeing the matter
of Snow, and Raine is greater and containeth a great
many more vapors then the matter of dew and
Hoare-frost: Therefore it is, that in exceeding high
Mountaines,<note place="margin">Some more good observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of dew and Hoar-frost</note> neither raine, dew, nor Hoare-frost fall;
because of the violent motion and great flux of the
ayre there: for that matter is rather even wheeled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with that violent motion, whereas in the lower
Mountaines againe, because of the lesser flux and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ayre snow and raine falls, but not deaw nor
Hoare-frosts.</p>
                     <p>To end this part in a word then, I say, That dew and
Hoare-frost have a like matter common to both, <hi>viz,</hi>
moyst vapours exhaled from the earth and waters, but
not highly elevated in the ayre; and (except in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity)
they differ not, but onely in this, that dew is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
of moderate cold, the other is begotten by a
more violent.</p>

                        <p>Of Snow: its cause, matter and nature.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe matter of Snow,<note place="margin">What Snow is?</note> is a cloud, composed
of an aereall substance, whereby it may bee
made some way hot; and of a terrestriall and earthly
matter, whereby when it is dissolved, it leaveth some
muddy substance behind it; but the most speciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it is of the vapors exhaled from the waters dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
over the earth. Their place, is in the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
where violent colds are; which excessive cold
must not be thought their generation only, but then,
when that cold is dispersed through the whole ayre;
for then this cold is not so sharpe and piercing, as that
cold is, which, by the dispersed heat in the ayre, is
reenforced and crowded into one place. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such colds are not spread abroad through the
whole ayre, but at certaine times, as in winter, in the
end of Autumne, and in the beginning of the Spring;
therefore it is that in winter in the tayle of Autumne
or in the beginning of the Spring, Snow falleth (at
least then) most frequently.<note place="margin">Much Snow in the Northerne climats, and Why?</note> And because the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Climats are coldest and farthest remote from
the hot Zone, as there where the Sunne beames hath
least reflex;
<q>—Quod sol obliqua non nisi luce videt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore it is also, that in these places snow is
most usually seene.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be said, how can it be, that the snowy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14966:67"/>
cloud must be of a hot ayrie disposition, seeing the
other two ingredients are earthly and waterish vapors
which naturally are cold, for by this I should include
contrarieties in one subject? To which I answer;
that there are no absurdities in that; for in this case,
the one is as ingredient, the other as egredient, the one
over-comming, the other remitting something of its
dignity: for as the cold holdeth together this snowy
cloud, till it dissolve into water; so, before this cloud
begin to dissolve into snow, we find the ayre which
before was marvailous cold, during the time of the
congealing of this cloud, to wax somewhat hoter by
reason of the aery heat, which leaveth the cloud and
disperseth it selfe through the ayre.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Snowy cloud and the rainy one.</note> From whence
likewise we may gather the reasons why the snowy
cloud, before it dissolve in the ayre, is cleare, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the earth also: Whereas the rainy clouds doe
both dimme the sky and earth, &amp; are exceeding cold
immediately before the rayne fall downe? That is,
because the rainy cloud, hath nothing but grosse and
heavy earth and watrish vapors in it; whereas the
snowy one, hath besides them, the ayre inclosed,
which being by nature warme, and then being thrust
out of the cloud by the predominancie of the other
two, cleareth and warmeth both.</p>

                        <p>Of Windes, their true cause, matter and nature, &amp;c.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the former part of this treatise, we have heard
that there are two sorts of exhalations, whereof all
Meteors above us, in the Ayre, are composed: one of
them moist, called vapours; the other dry, called
fumes or smoke; not that any of these are so either
wholly dry or moist, or that they have no mixture of
others, for that is not: but that the predominancy of
the one above the other, in the compound, maketh
the denomination.</p>
                     <p>Now as the heat of the Sun, extracting these two
from the earth and waters is their efficient cause, so
they againe are the materiall causes of the Meteors
made up by them, <hi>viz.</hi> vapours, the causes of raine,
haile, snow, dew, clouds and so forth. As the dry and
fumous exhalations are the causes of winde in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
as also of the hot Meteors above mentioned.
Hot and dry exhalations then are matter and causes
of the wind;<note place="margin">The matter and cause of winde.</note> and as they are elevated in the Ayre by
the force of the Sunne; so no question but from that
same Ayre, the winds begin to blow, and not from
the Earth first; which in this may be discerned; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the highest Mountaines (I meane, if they
exceed not the first Region) Towres, Trees, Steeples,
and so forth, are more agitated with winds, then the
lower and baser are, as being neerer the ayre.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Feriunt summos fulmina montes.</l>
                        <l>Saepius ventis agitatur ingens</l>

                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:14966:68"/>
And the reason is, because straining to mount aloft
conformable to their nature, they are reverberated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the middle region, their opposite (being cold
and moist) to their hot and dry nature.</p>
                     <p>Now as the beginnings and first springs of Rivers
are small, but by corrivation of other lesser ones they
increase:<note place="margin">The beginning of wind is but small, but it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth in blowing.</note> Even so the first beginnings and principalls
of windes are commenced but with few exhalations;
no question but their increment floweth from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unition
and combination of more exhalations;
Whence it is, that some yeares are more windy and
some seasons too, then others; and commonly the
dryest Summers maketh the windiest and most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous
winters.</p>
                     <p>It is said in Scripture, that the wind bloweth where
it pleaseth, and that none knoweth, either whence it

to speake particularly, we feele it and find it, we know
it evanish away into the many vast and spacious intur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the ayre; but from what particular place it
floweth, we know not well: for as they are small in
their principalls, so no doubt, but they receive aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
in their progresse. Here then it may be
inferred, that winds and raine are not procreated of the
selfe same matter, as some foolishly doe maintaine;
which by this only may bee evidently confuted, that
often times the windes are abated by raine; and
commonly after raine we have windes:<note place="margin">What maketh raine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly follow winde.</note> The first for
this naturall reason, because that violence of winds
blowing clouds together, and the invironing cold
condensing and thickning them together, makes them
dissolve into water.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:14966:68"/>
The other is because of waters or raine falling
from the clouds,<note place="margin">And what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter raine.</note> by which meanes the Ayre is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and consequently the Earth; which maketh it
yeeld aboundance of hot exhalations for the Sunnes
rayes to transport upward to the Ayre, wherewith
wind is framed againe.</p>
                     <p>And if it be objected,<note place="margin">What maketh some windes cold, other hot seeing one matter is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both.</note> that exhalations are common
causes of winds, and yet of the same winds, some are
cold, as the North, and East, whereas the Southerly
and Westerly are commonly hotter? To this may be
answered, that the exhalations themselvs are not the
occasion of that, but the disposition of the Climats
from whence they flow; the Suns heat never aproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the North Climat, but afarre off, and obliquely,
or side-wayes; occasioning the cold of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of the winds blowne from thence.</p>
                     <p>Whereas more perpendicularly it glanceth on the
other Meridian and Westerne parts; by which means,
as the Earth is warmed, so are the winds.</p>
                     <p>And if it be asked, why in the height of Summer
(the Sun being in <hi>Cancer</hi>) that then are fewest and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
winds, as in the extremity and cold of Winter there
are few likewise, as by experience may be seene:</p>
                     <p>To that may be answered,<note place="margin">What maketh that in the heat of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer there are fewest winds, seeing then there should be most.</note> That as in all things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
are vicious, even so in this matter; for great
heat and drought in <hi>Iune, Iuly,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> doe keepe
back the winds and their matter, as extremity of cold
doth in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Earth in that time of Summer, being burnd up
with scorching heate, hindereth the winds to rise; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the earth then is burningly dry w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of moistnesse; out of which drougth of the earth,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14966:69"/>
without some moistnesse no fumes can be exhaled.</p>
                     <p>So the Ayre clogged with cold, thick, heavie, and
lumpish clouds of raine and waters, holdeth (as it
were) the winds within their Precinct; hindring them
to blow then, till the Ayre be disburdened of that
load, and doe give way to the winds to sport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the spring, recompensing their long captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with licencious unbridled blasts.</p>
                     <p>Or to know how the wind bloweth is this:<note place="margin">The way how the wind bloweth.</note> First,
the exhalations whereof it is composed, are carried
from the Earth, high up to the middle Region of the
Ayre, but so, that when it is there, it is encountered
and repercussed, tossed and moved with cold and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed
Ayre; finally it is put aside, from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by violence it is throwne downe by the cold
predominating in that Region, so it striketh upon this
lower Region of the aire, in the descent of it; not right
and diametrically downe, but slentingly; which ayre
againe beating the Earth, by the superiour impulsion,
and the earths repelling it upward or back againe,
maketh it (following the round circumference of the
Ayre) to blow about, filling it with its noise.</p>
                     <p>As for the number of the winds, what Countries be
subject to such or such winds, what maketh the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
winds to blow dry, the Southerly moist; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the first to Sea-men, whose experience is surer
than our contemplation: the other are soone solved
by a good Naturalist; for the Sunne shining upon the
South Countries more kindlie and hotter than upon
the North, maketh the winds conforme to the Ayre
of the Countries, hotter there, than in the North, and
moister.</p>

                        <p>Of Earthquakes, their cause and nature.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THIS question dependeth upon the knowledge
of the former; for the nature and matter of
winds being well understood will cleere this
the sooner. I formerly said then that cold and dry
exhalations, by the force of the Sun elevated up in
the Ayre, and from thence by predominating cold
beaten aside, and from that through the Ayre down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the Earth back againe whirling upon the face
of it,<note place="margin">Againe, the way how the wind bloweth.</note> and round about through this lowest Region,
are the matter and nature of the winds; which cold
and dry exhalations, I say, are the matter of these
winds, which often times so lowdly blow upon the
superfice of the Earth; that not onely Ships on the
Seas, Trees in the Woods are overturned by their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence;
but likewise high Steeples and Towers are
made to shake and tremble in such sort, that even Bels
have beene blowne out of the one, the roofe of the
other uncovered; our fruits and cornes beaten downe
to the terror and amazement of the beholders.</p>
                     <p>Even so dry and cold exhalations,<note place="margin">The matter and forme of Earthquakes.</note> but these more
grosse, and not so Elementary as the first, enclosed
within the bowels and concavities of the Earth, (for
Nature hath no vacuity) and there converted into
winds, doe struggle and strive as it were, to burst up
through this earth to attaine to its owne right place,
which is upwards; and that is the cause of this trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14966:70"/>
and motion of the Earth which we call Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</p>
                     <p>And because the Southerne Countries are hotter
than the Northerne,<note place="margin">What makes the Southerne countries most subject to these earthquakes.</note> in respect of the Suns approach
to them, I meane in its perpendicular beholding of
them, they (I say) are consequently more apt to bee
enflamed, and so to be concaved and wasted within;
yea, and to be more capable of the engendring and
reception of these exhalations and winds, and their
effects: therefore it is, that these Countries are more
subject to the motions and tremblings of the earth
(whereof their particular Histories afford us testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
enough) than the more Northerly are; for they
having grosser and lesse matter evaporated from them
by the Sunnes heat, doe admit lesse concavities, and
so fewer exhalations: so then, both winds and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
are of one selfesame matter and subject, <hi>viz.</hi>
of cold and dry exhalations, wherof they are framed;
and they differ onely in this; That the exhalations

                     <p>Neither is this called in question by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the same matter,<note place="margin">A very fit comparison.</note> 
                        <hi>Lib. 3. Meteor.</hi> Where his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator
<hi>Albertus Coloniensis</hi> compareth this motion
of the Earth by the power of these inclosed vapours
in the bowels and cavernes of it, to the motions and
tremblings of our pulse, by the <hi>Systole</hi> and <hi>Diastole</hi> of
our spirits, in and above our hearts, and so within the

And yet, not content with this comparison, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in the duration and continuance of the Earths
motion, saying, that even as the tremblings where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
our bodies are agitated (during the fits of a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
doe continue so long as the faulty and peccant
humour reigneth in our veines,<note place="margin">As our bodies are stirred with a hot ague, even so the earth with an inclosed wind.</note> and accordingly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
its proportion, as the matter occasioning the
feaver impaireth: even so it is with this trembling of
the earth, having respect to the multitude of vapours
and to their declining; for the more these vapours are,
the Earthquake lasteth the longer, and is more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
but when they spend and decline, its violence
and continuance is remitted.</p>
                     <p>I know now the Philosopher and Naturallist (who
admit nothing done in nature, to bee otherwise than
by naturall meanes) will admit nothing beyond the
reach of Nature when they are posed.</p>
                     <p>How is it then that commonly after Earthquakes,<note place="margin">A remarkable question.</note>
Plagues, Pestilences, and death of Bestiall doe ensue?
To this they answer, That the exhalations which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Earths motion, having burst up through the
Earth, infecteth our Ayre with the infective breath
of it, which it contracteth when it was incarcerated
within the bowels and wast places of the said Earth?</p>
                     <p>Likewise they ascribe some such or not farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

of his wrath to ensue; to the effect, that if they
will amend, and turne to their God by humiliation,

of Nature, with their solution.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND first concerning Thunder. <hi>Quest.</hi> What
can bee the causes of the lightning, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleakes,
which in Latine are termed <hi>Fulgura,
&amp; coruscationes,</hi> either in the clouds themselves, from
whence Thunder proceeds,<note place="margin">What is the matter of lightnings.</note> or wavering in the ayre?
Whether or no the exhalations, inclosed within the
cloud from whence they doe proceede, be the cause,
and occasion, both of the Thunder it selfe, it's sound,
and of the coruscation and lightning also?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea; but diversly, and by it's owne course;
for first by the agitation, and motion of it, within the
cloud, it causeth the sound after this manner: The
dry exhalation, (whereof this sound, thunder it selfe
and lightnings are generated) ascending upward, in
the vapour, to the middle region of the aire, is engros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a cloud, through the coldnesse of the place: so
it is compacted, and this exhalation coarcted within
the belly of that thickned and condensed matter:
which dry, or firy exhalation, thus inclosed, (by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperistasis</hi>
or contrariety) by the environing cold, in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14966:71"/>
the outward body of the cloud, striveth to get out,
and make way for it selfe; at last, with much reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,<note place="margin">The right cause of the noyse of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after the lightning.</note>
overcomming the environing cold, maketh that
hideous and horrible noyse, wherewith here on earth
wee are so terrified, that sometimes Women are
strooke in such feare by it, that they part with child;
So by that same agitation it kindleth too, being of a
combustible substance, <hi>viz.</hi> of a dry, terrestriall, and
inflamable matter; which, once kindled by <hi>Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristasis,</hi>
expelleth it selfe, with violence, through that
cold thickned cloud: but first in, and about the cloud
it maketh these flashes and coruscations spoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
so in lightnings, it disperseth it selfe, here, and
there through the aire, both clearing the cloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and the aire beneath.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be asked;<note place="margin">Why we see the lightning before wee heare the noyse.</note> What is the cause, why we
see sooner the lightning then we heare the thunder
clap? That is because our sight is both nobler, and the
eye is sooner perceptive of its object, then our eare;
as being the more active part and priore to our
hearing: beside the visible species are more subtile,
and lesse corporeal then the audible species, this being
reall, the former intentionall, as the skilfull in Opticks
know: and this is the reason why likewise we see the
flash, ere we heare the noyse of discharged gunnes.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> (To that as before:) Because it is extru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by violence from its abode.<note place="margin">And why do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> it descend se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is light.</note> Besides this, it being
accoupled to a matter contrary to its owne nature, and
that matter predominating, <hi>viz.</hi> A dry terrestriall
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14966:72"/>
substance, in which it existeth; that I say, this terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall

perforce with it: which may be perceaved by a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
charcoale throwne out of ones hand, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth
the fire along with it.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if it be expostulated, what can be the cause
of the admirable effects of this thunder? at some
times bruising the blade of a sword,<note place="margin">The cause of the admirable effects of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> the sheath un-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
melting mony and gold in a pocket, the pocket

his cloathes; And what maketh things touched by it
smell of sulphure and brimstone? And to kill a man
in such sort, that the bolts shall bruise all his bones,
the flesh never a whit hurt, nor by appearance touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and the like.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for answer. The thunder which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
or extruded from blacke clouds, is more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and hath greater force,<note place="margin">Why the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of blacke clouds are more terrible, then those of White.</note> than that which is ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the whiter clouds. This thunder then by
nature subtile, and pearcing, but much more purified in
it's distent, when it mixeth with the aire, is far more
subtilized: And againe being by the fire, and heate of
the thunder repurged of all grossenesse, it is made so
purely spirituall, that is pearceth suddenly, and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
as it were, almost all porous bodyes, and never
exerciseth it's force till it finde resistance: And hereby
it appeareth plainely how the skin is, as it were, untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
when the bone is broken, which may serve for
all accidents in this kinde.</p>
                     <p>But when it onely toucheth the outward of things
without any great hurt, it betokens the weaknes, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14966:72"/>
imbecillity of the matter.<note place="margin">Why those that be thunder beaten smell of brimstone.</note> And where commonly
bodyes, so thunder beaten, doe smell of sulphure and
brimstone, the matter of Thunder giveth the reason,
for it is composed of dry, and sulphureous exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as of the smoake of <hi>Sulphur-terrae</hi> by <hi>Naples;</hi> of
hot smoke in bathes, and rocks there; of <hi>Monte de
Sommi;</hi> of <hi>Aetna</hi> in <hi>Sicilie:</hi> of the burning hills at <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico</hi>
in <hi>America:</hi> of our <hi>Hecla in Island,</hi> and such like
chalkie, lymie and sulphureous places; so vapors ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
out of these and the like places, must make
thunder which is composed of them, to savour of
them.</p>
                     <p>Now to those, who aske which is the place where
thunder is procreated,<note place="margin">The true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thunder.</note> and begotten: answere may be
made, from the grosse humidity, having in it some ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall
glutinous, and viscous humor not easily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from it that it existeth in; which being thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a cloud in the highest part of the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
whither they are elevated, above all other
clouds, composed of other moist vapours; from
thence (I say) by the invironing cold, by <hi>Antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
or a stronger opposite part, they are extended and
throwne downe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> Again, if any demand why blacke clouds are
conjectured most to containe, and send forth thunder
bolts most fearefull?</p>
                     <p>I answer, indeed as blacke clouds, flashes, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,<note place="margin">The reason why the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of black clouds are most dangerous.</note>
are little to be regarded, in respect that the blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of them argueth but little firy matter to bee
within; But contrarywayes that it aboundeth in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish
vapours; So commonly after thunder great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14966:73"/>
raines, ensue; the cloud being dissolved, and the fire
expelled. But indeed, if the lightning bee not much
to be feared of such a blacke cloud, yet the thunder
bolt of it is terrible, as being violently expelled by the
predominating cold, even as the great charge of a
Cannon enforceth the bullets flight, and causeth the
roaring noyse of it.</p>
                     <p>Of reddish, or whitish coloured clouds, the bolt is
but weake in regard of the rarity, and paucity of
cold vapours to expell it; but the flashes and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
will be found dreadfull, in respect of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of exhalations, wherewith, after their owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
the cloud is dyed.</p>
                     <p>But leaving these fiery and hot Meteors, we betake
us againe unto the moyst and watery ones, as more
consonant and frequent to our climate.</p>
                     <p>First, if it bee asked whether our moyst Meteors,
such as snow, haile, and raine, have one common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whereof they are generated; and if they have
one, what can be the cause of their different shapes
and formes;<note place="margin">All weake Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors have one common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> for we see the snow broad and soft, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieways
haile, round and hard. No question but
one matter is common to all, <hi>viz.</hi> Waters; from
which, by vapours they are elevated to the aire; and
in which they are dissolved againe: but the difference
standeth here.<note place="margin">Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in forme, and place.</note> That the neerest matter (to say so) of
snow, is vapours congealed in a cloud, which hath in
it a great mixture of aire; by which meanes, being
some way heated, when the snow dissolveth, you see
it holdeth, open and soft, by reason of that aire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
haile hath no airy substance in it, and thus qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by experience, that we see haile fall downe on a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14966:73"/>
suddaine, and ofttimes with violence, because of the
terrestriall heavinesse of it, whereas snow falleth but
leasurely.</p>
                     <p>The reason why haile is round may be this,<note place="margin">Why haile is round.</note> because
falling down from the middle region where it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed,
by the way it reencountereth with some circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and round drop of raine or water, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
by the rolling about of the haile it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
hard likewise; more especially, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any hot place, but the cold aire to fall through,
till it light on our lowest region; which accidentally
hot, for the time, you see, maketh them immediately
after their lighting upon the earth, to dissolve quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or at least not long after. And as these two are
formed in the highest of the middle regions, and for
the extreame cold which is there are congealed:<note place="margin">Why raine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in drops.</note> so on
the other side because the clouds from whence raine
issueth, doe not ascend so high, therefore they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
in drops before they can be congealed. And so
by degrees, dew and Hoar-frost, because they are not
mounted so high as the matter and clouds of raine;
Therefore they fall sooner, and softlyer then raine
doth; so one matter is common mother unto all of

causes.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere ariseth a question here not unworthy of
our consideration. Whether the Springs and
Rivers, in and on the earth have their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
from the waters of the Sea, by <hi>subterranean</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
or from the waters on the superfice of the earth
which is caused by raine; or finally from the huge
and unmeasurable caverns, and hollow places of the
earth,<note place="margin">From whence fountains have their courses.</note> in whose bowells are monstrous lakes, pooles,
and other standing waters, created of the ayre, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
enclosed, which not having any vent to ascend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but being condensed there, dissolveth it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these waters. Now before we enter into the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this question, we must understand, that when I
speake of the vast and endlesse caves, like valleys
within the bowels of the earth, wherein waters are,
that it is no invention of mine own: for <hi>Seneca,</hi> &amp; with
him <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Meteorologicks</hi> in the 19 booke
of his naturall questions instanceth it, saying, <hi>Quid

all w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hee confirmeth in that same place by authority
of <hi>Theophrast,</hi> whom hee bringeth in saying, That
since the Earth hath swallowed Townes, Cities, and
houses, who can doubt but that there are within her
bowels, Brookes, Caves, Dens, and Valleyes? which
seeing they cannot be empty, must of necessity bee
full of waters. Seeing then all things are composed
of all the Elements, as of their common causes; (For
water is a thickned ayre; and the Ayre againe a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
water:) How then can these subterranean hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
places, but be full of waters, since the Earth doth
dissolve in waters,<note place="margin">That there is waters within the earth.</note> to fil them up? For the earth being
delved or digged but a very few footsteps downe, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth straight appeare, earth and water being of as
great affinity as ayre and waters are: howbeit <hi>Zeno</hi>
and others doe contradict this opinion, saying; That
the Earth is a massie,<note place="margin">The Sea the mother of fountaines.</note> solid, and <hi>homogenean</hi> body. I
say, that absolutely the Sea (as a common Mother to
all waters) is she, from whence all Rivers, and Springs
have their source, but yet not so wholly, but that
they may be augmented by raine and water, as wee
see by experience; that after huge raines, both Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and rivers doe accreasse. And if it bee asked,
how water being of its owne nature heavie, can leave
its owne element and centre, and bee conveighed to
the tops of Mountaines and high places, as may bee
daily seene almost every where?</p>
                     <p>To this first,<note place="margin">How Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are on the tops of mountaines.</note> I say, that the Sea being some way high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the Earth, most easily, by its owne conduits,
and channels, it may make passage unto it selfe, as
through so many veines.</p>

                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:14966:75"/>
Besides this, the vapours which the Suns heat, and
the power of some other Planets, raiseth from the
waters even under the earth, are not ever exhaled and
carried aloft to the Ayre, but sometimes are even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for a long time in solid places of the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
parts of the earth; where gathering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the concavities thereof, they boile upward
by the force of the said agitation, as a pot upon the
fire, by the force of an under heare: so these waters
bubling up through the earth cause our fountaines;
which running downeward againe, to the Valleys
and Plaines, doe make our Brookes, Rivers, and
Springs. And of this opinion is venerable <hi>Albertus
Coloniensis,</hi> commenting <hi>Aristotle</hi> upon this question,
<hi>Dubio nono &amp; decimo.</hi> Or it may be said, that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
and concavities of the earth, being filled up with
waters, which distill from the want of the caved earth
above, are procured by the grosse Ayre there inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and converted into waters, which issuing out of
the rarer or voider parts of the Earth, above, do oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
these Springs, Rivers, and Brookes.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded if steepe Mountaines do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
and send downe waters to feed our Springs
and Rivers;<note place="margin">How moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth water unto fountains.</note> there is no question, for in their concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of certaine, there are treasures of waters, which
bursting out at their lower parts, doe yeeld plenty
enough, to bedew the lower Countries; not that
these waters are gathered there by raines which fall
(for raine-waters penetrate not so deepe into the
earth) but rather that the Mountaines themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spongeous, doe attract and draw together, their
whole dissolved waterish matter, to the frontiers and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:14966:75"/>
concavities; from whence surging and breaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
through orifices, they grow into springs, brooks
and sometimes rivers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> What causeth some Fountaines to last lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than others? certainly, that must proceed from
the copiousnesse and aboundance of the veine and
and waters, such long-lasting ones have, above the
others.</p>
                     <p>Or finally, if it be demanded what can be the cause
that some Rivers, and Springs, which formerly did
flow in large swift currents, do lessen, and sometimes
totally dry up? That must not be imputed to the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
or change of the Starres,<note place="margin">Why some springs cease running.</note> as some suppose; by
which (say they) all places in the world are altered;
but rather unto the decay of the veine: peradventure,
because the earth preasing to fill up voidnesse, hath
sunke down in that place, and so choaked the passage,
and turned, the course another way.</p>
                     <p>Neither can there be a fitter reply given unto those
who aske;<note place="margin">What maketh two fountaines a little distant, one hot and another cold.</note> what maketh two Springs or Fountaines
which are separated onely by a little parcell of
ground, to bee of a contrary nature? yea, one sweet
and fresh, the other brackish and salt; one extreame
cold, another neere adjoyning to it, to bee luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme.</p>
                     <p>Then the diversity of Oares or Metals, through
which these waters doe runne, which is the cause of
their different tasts and temperatures; as on one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of ground some flowers and herbs salutiferous
and healthfull; others venemous, and mortall may
grow.</p>
                     <p>The Moone is often said to bee the efficient cause
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14966:76"/>
of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; now if so be (as
universally all the Learned hold) what is the cause,
seeing shee is universally seene by all Seas in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
(and I may say equally) that therefore all Seas
flow not and ebbe not alike?</p>
                     <p>To this I thinke no better reply can be given, than
that some Seas there are which be rather Lakes, in a
manner, and of fresher water than Seas, in respect of
the incessant running of endlesse Rivers into them,
whereof they make no account againe (to say so) by
subministring matter to Rivers, Fountaines, Brookes,
or Lakes, as the Ocean doth: the invironing bankes,
and shoares being higher almost than they: such are
all Sounds, Gulphs, and (it may be) the Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sea also. Or yet we may say, that the profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and deepenesse of some Coasts hindereth the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then it doth upon shallow and ebbe sands
and other valley and low bankes.</p>
                     <p>Now the cause of our hot Baths neere <hi>Bristoll,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The veines through which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters run ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them salt, hot, or cold.</note> in
<hi>Flanders, Germany, France, Italy,</hi> and else where, is
onely the sulphureous and a brimstony Oare, or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
through which their waters runne; as the salt
earth through which some waters doe runne, is the
cause of their saltnesse, such as the Salt-pits in <hi>Poland,</hi>
and <hi>Hungarie,</hi> out of which Salt is digged, as our Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coales,
and stones are digged out of Quarries. And
no question but these waters are heated too by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
through such earth.</p>
                     <p>These, and the like, are the reasons given by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
for such secrets of Nature, as either here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have touched, or may handle hereafter: and
howbeit, by humane reason men cannot further pry
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14966:76"/>
into these and the like, yet no question but the power
of the great Maker,<note place="margin">Gods power outreacheth mans wisdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> hath secrets inclosed within the
bowels of Nature, beyond all search of man: To
learne us all to bend the eyes of our bodies, and minds
upward to the Heavens from whence they flow, to
rest there in a reverent admiration of his power, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, by and above nature; and that by a way not as
yet wholly manifested unto mortall men.</p>
                     <p>By all which, and many more we may easily espie
as the power, so the wisdome of this our Maker, in
disposing the forme of this Vniverse, whether the
great World, or the little one, MAN; in both which
there is such a harmony, sympathy, and agreement,
betwixt the powers above, which wee see with our
eyes, as the Heavens, and the distinguished Regions
of the Ayre in the greater World, with the Earth and
Seas; or of the soule, minde, life, and intellect of
Man; the heaven in him comparatively, with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the Earth, and such like, of the one with the other;
that is the great and little world together, as is a
wonder.<note place="margin">The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great &amp; little world.</note> For as in the Ayre, how the lower parts are
affected, so are the superiour; and contrarywise, as the
superior is disposed, right so the inferiour. So we see
that not onely a heaven of Brasse, maketh the Earth
of Iron, but likewise waterish and moist earth, causeth
foggy and rainy ayre: as a serene or tempestuous day
maketh us commonly either ioyfull or melancholy:
or as a sad and grieved minde causeth a heavie and

                     <p>OVr Politicians,<note place="margin">If Princes may hazzard their persons in a field or not.</note> of latter times, have made it
a great question, whether a Soveraigne
Prince should hazard his person in battell or
not, considering the great losse that ensueth either by
his death, or captivitie; a thing never doubted of in
former ages; no not by such Kings who though sickly
and diseased, have caused to carry their bodyes from

of a King in his Armie, rather than to devolve
that charge on Deputies; it is not to bee understood,
that therefore hee should play or act the part of a

palpable hazard, which are onely for common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;

betwixt <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> each vindicating to himselfe
the honour of captivating the <hi>Numenian Iugurtha:</hi>
they commonly were sent, so, that either alternatively
they should beare rule; or the younger was accoupled

or finally these Consuls were so attemperated in that
charge,<note place="margin">Their foresight and prudence herein.</note> that one of a slow and procrastinating dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

in so farre, that they may not in a jot transgresse the

                     <p>For in wars it may be, that the opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

tyed unto their hornes bundles of vine branches, like
little fagots, which he kindled, and therewith cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them along the Mountaines. Now they being so

the <hi>Roman</hi> army, which lay in the valley, being asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
at such a sight, (it being in the night) when all

think I, but for all the fame of these ancient illustrious
deeds registrated in their records, but if either they
had chanced to have adoe with the people of these
ages, where the acts of warre are better refined, and

                        <p>The difference betwixt the ancient manner of warrefare;
and the moderne: how farre the moderne engines of
Warre exceed those of the ancient Greekes and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN marshalling of our armies, and Battels, our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
plans jump almost with those of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
yet our Sieges, beleaguring of townes, and
instruments of war doe far exceede theirs, whether by
Sea, or by land.</p>
                     <p>And first that the forme of drawing up of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<note place="margin">A comparison of drawing up of our armies with the Old Romans.</note>
is not far different from theirs, appeareth in this.
Our armies consist of so many regiments, the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so many companies, and our companies of so
many Souldiers; then, subdivided amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Our armies, in whole, having their Generalls
commanding them, our Regiments their <hi>Colonells,</hi>
our Companies their Captaines, and every one of
these their <hi>Lievtenants</hi> and under-officers, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto the stations of their charge, such as <hi>Sergeant
Majors, Quarter-masters, Ancient Corporalls, Serjeants</hi>
of companies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Even so the Roman armies were composed of so
many legions; the legion made up of 6000. soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
over which a <hi>Tribune</hi> had command: these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
were subdivided into so many Cohorts: the
Cohorts into so many Manipuli, which being redivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Centuries, were againe subdivided in <hi>Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneys</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:14966:88"/>
which were the meanest company in a legion.
These had a Captaine, a Lievtenant, and Ensigne
bearer, wherefore they were called <hi>Subsignarii Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus two centuries made up a Manipulus, 3. Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli
a Cohort, 10. Cohorts a legion, and so many
Legions an armie lesse or more according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie
of their affaires. When a Legion stood in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
array, the least squadron of it, was a Manipulus
wherein was two Ordaines conjoyned together ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
10. in front, and their Lievtenant in the reire: this
excellent order of the old Roman warre-fare, is
well nigh imitated by our moderne warriours, as I was
saying in the fields, when, both then, and elsewhere
their armies, were like well governed Citties. Yet on
the other side the Roman sieges and all their engines
of warre, come short in comparison of our manner
of beleaguring now adayes, notwithstanding their <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studines,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">If the Roman field malice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ours, yet our beleagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of warre exceed theirs.</note>
                        <hi>vineae, aggeres,</hi> and <hi>Turres,</hi> which were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells
and plankes of Timber, built in such sort that
Souldiers might securely fight under them, or like
Mounts of earth rolled before them, under which
they might make approach unto Walles, either for
scaling, or undermining; these and all others of
this sort, when they come in comparison with our
fire workes, but chiefly our thundring Cannons, they
are found to be but of little availe.</p>
                     <p>But what shall we say? Truly we may conclude
that in these dayes, true valour and strength had their
just assayes, <hi>cum latus lateri, dextra dextrae, pes pedi,</hi>
as <hi>Plautus</hi> saith, were opposed to one another. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

For they were either into a straight front, by

else the manner of imbattelling observed by <hi>Caesar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Spaine called <hi>acies sinuata,</hi> in manner of halfe Moone,
whose points were advanced, as the Sea-battells spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before: And his reason of marshalling of them
thus was, because he understood his enemies best men
to be placed in the middle of their army, and so by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
his cornets he discomfited, and put their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions
unto confusion, before the better Souldiers

hee should reveale that secret to none living,

were witnesses to it, but more especially seeing it was
not through lack of courage on his part, nor of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

himselfe was the onely revealer of his disgrace and
that secret; (notwithstanding <hi>Hierome Anca</hi> certainly

begged at his Majesties hands, that it might please

him for the recovery of his reputation now in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to grant him a publike combat with his enemy,

the matter, whereof he made a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall:
whereunto the Emperour after many instant

first,<note place="margin">Conditions granted by the Emperour whereupon they should fight.</note> they should fight armed: next, that when hee
should throw in betwixt them a golden rod, which at

                     <p>IN the former combats Spanish was more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

authorize Duells;<note place="margin">What way combats per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missible if they should be at all suffered.</note> hereafter the contrary shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
But thus much I may say; If any sort of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
should be tolerated in a Common-wealth, I thinke
that that which is performed after this manner
(wherein as in his <hi>Miles gloriosus, Plautus</hi> speakes, <hi>Pes
pedi, dextra dextrae, latus lateri opponitur</hi>) it is more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
then otherwise to permit men to butcher one
another; true valour, strength, dexterity and courage
being then put to the essay, although with the hazard
of their lives, yet not with the infallible losse of any
or both, as in other Combats.</p>
                     <p>These two examples I have brought in out of the
French and Spanish Histories, brieflier couched here
then in their owne Countrey Registers, Where they
are at length and in their smallest circumstances set

Now as here I allow of the Spanish sort of Duells
(if any way to be tolerated) so can I not but disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the second his admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and permitting of a Duell, not betwixt two men
of a privat estate, nor by themselves in private, neither
for any remarkable injury done by one to another;
but in the face and presence of himselfe and Court in
their shirts, and so to inevitable death of either, or
both, and for nothing but a leger or slight French
quarrell, as a <hi>demanti</hi> betwixt two notable persons, of
two illustrious houses, <hi>Iarnak</hi> and <hi>Chastaigneray;</hi> where
the fortune of the fight favouring the weaker for

                     <p>To say here; What shall a Prince doe when hee is

                     <p>I answer, that by such meanes both God and the
King are tempted; for if God hath reserved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the discovery of what by all searching cannot be
discovered, is not that an intolerable importunity, to
pry or search any farther in that, but that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate

whom <hi>secundum allegata &amp; probata</hi> hee findeth inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and refer to the all-seeing and all knowing God,
the punishment of him who is guilty, seeing in his

about a punishment on him, whom peradventure the

Chapter <hi>De probatione Vulgari</hi> in the <hi>Decretalls:</hi> for
there saith the <hi>Canonist;</hi> If any crime such as that
could not be proved, and that the accused or suspected,
cryed that he was innocent, and so stood forth in the
avouching of his innocency, hee was forced for the
more and farther proofe thereof, either bare footed
to tread on hot yron, or else to wash his hands in hot

for in that case, <hi>si bellum sit licitum, quid ni &amp;

crime whereof he is innocent, is neverthelesse borne
downe by power of adverse parties, if then by the
Magistrates authority (to whom he complaineth) a
Duell be offered, to decide the question, in that case,
hee admits these fights to bee permissible: for why
(saith hee) if we may safely fight with a Rogue, who
would rob us of our goods, why not with him who
would doe so with our honour, it being alike to him,
at least the odds not being great, whether he dye by his

with one of the adverse party, with permission of the

Articles with his promise, yet it was so, that often he
protested even there (neither did he smother it) that
promise what he would, performe them he could not,
neither legally might he. So that being set at liberty,
his two sonnes accepted in hostage for him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home; he was charged by the Emperour for
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14966:102"/>
the performance of the points subscribed by him:
whereto he answered, That it was not in his power,
no more than in any other Kings to alienate things
belonging to the Crowne,<note place="margin">The occasion of the quarrell.</note> without the consent of his
whole States obtained thereunto. And for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
he said, That seeing extraordinary conditions
had extorted them from a Prince in close prison, and
his consent to them violently wrung from him, they
must consequently be infirme, for promises accessory
to such like compulsions cannot be of better force and
value. Which with the like and better replyes, when
they came to the Emperours eares, he forthwith chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
the King by his Heraulds of breach of faith,
and offered in single combate to fight with him in the
quarrell, which the <hi>French</hi> king accepting, desired
him to appoint day and place, giving him the lye as
often as he would say, that he had falsified his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
But as their severall stories disagree upon the
particulars, so every one doth vindicate their owne
Prince, from all aspersion and staine of breach.</p>

                     <p>That I as the Elder doe take upon me to speake first,
impute it not to any presumption I have of my worth,
but to the priority of my yeares. Wee reade in the

charge, in conjunct offices, let us lay downe all
former grudges under this stone, now if thou please,
at our returne, lift thou it up againe and reassume
them: you may advise; but for the present I thinke
this best, which was agreed unto to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the younger.</p>
                     <p>So say I to thee, if it please thee for so petty and
frivolous a quarrell, that wee expose our lives and
estates to the hazard of a doubtfull fight and of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
fortune, I will not decline it: For as none doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of your courage; So I trust, that none dare call
mine in question; so then if you list Cavalier, with the
worthy Roman, let us bury in this Boule of wine our
yesternights rash words: so we shal procure <hi>Gods</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon our soules and bodies, and our Prince his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
by our good examples to his quarrelling cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers;
and withall indissolubly tye our loves together

reputation; which being accepted by the younger,
and related to the King, they were by him in presence
of the whole Court condignely praysed, as most due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they deserved.</p>
                     <p>Now albeit it be not of those or the like voluntary
duels I treat of here, but of these which are tolerated
by permission of the Prince or Magistrate for the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing
of murther &amp; greater bloud-shed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
upon apparent conject res of wrongs
received, yet I thought it not altogether imperinent
to insert this story. Now for the other. Although
some have permitted them, as of old <hi>Fraton</hi> King of
<hi>Denmarke,</hi> and are yet tolerated in <hi>Muscovia:</hi> yet we
finde that <hi>Rhotaris</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> absolutely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14966:107"/>
them: and although his successor for the
inconvenience which thereafter ensued licensed them
againe, yet hee protested that it was against his will
and conscience: and as these good Kings inhibited
them; so, many of the French Kings, as <hi>Philip le bel,
Lewis</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Charles</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. King <hi>Henries 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> and 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.
and many moe of the best governed Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
have done the like. Which maketh mee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
why <hi>Bodin</hi> in his 7. Chapter of his 4. Booke of
<hi>Republick,</hi> giveth way to their toleration; they being
both repugnant to the Law of God, and contrary to
the Civill and Canon Lawes, and the constitutions
of best governed Kingdomes. Indeed, the said <hi>Bodin,</hi>
admits them onely to be permissible, when legall
proofes are wanting, provided, that they be only for
matter of honor, not wealth; and consequently among
persons honourable, for the preventing of further
bloud-shed, averting of kinsfolkes murthers, and such
like evils w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> might ensue: to which if he had subjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Charles</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. his condition of fighting armed,
I thinke his reasons might have beene more passable.</p>
                     <p>But however in elder times, duels were tolerated
by certaine Kings, which by appearance, the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of those times required; as common Stewes were
for eschewing of greater inconveniencies; yet they
being practises so ill-grounded, so unnaturall, and so
farre both against the Lawes of God, and Man; Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Kings (in every Nation almost) have enacted
most strict Lawes against them, with most exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
punishments, to be executed on the rash infringers
of them: all which, being well knowne every where,
were superfluous to be inserted in this small Treatise.</p>

no more honorable Sepulchre, abhorring the others
burning into ashes as a thing unnaturall; which might
well be seene at the time that <hi>Alexander</hi> had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

renting their cloathes, haire, and faces, it seemeth that
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his worke <hi>De cura pro mortuis ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benda,</hi>
aymed at them; for in that whole worke, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave
nothing that maketh much for praying for
them, but chiefly he willeth all men to moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Griefes mournings and howlings for
them, seeing they rest from their labours; and his
conclusion is good, that if prayers for the dead be not
meritorious for them, yet at least that they are some
way comfortable for the living; <hi>Si non subsidia mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum</hi>

<hi>De Purgatorio,</hi> denyeth it not, but onely he refuseth
such prayers to have beene subsidiary or helpfull to
them, but rather congratulatorie, for that they were
released from all their miseries; which he instanceth
by the funerall Oration of Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> upon the
deaths of the Emperors, <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi>
where there is no mention of praying for their soules
to ease or shorten their paines in Purgatory.</p>

a true God, and of this people who encounter mee
this day, and that they honour and serve thee, shew
it by the equity of this cause, which by his obtaining
of that dayes victory was plainly manifested: and it
is manifestly seene, that the breach of faith plighted
to the two <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and their burning unto ashes,
was so far from smothering the faults whereof they
complained; that on the contrary, diverse worthy
and learned men after them, blowing this coale, by
them then kindled, have made its flame to blaze
through all the world: as the bloudy wars through
many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> for maintaining of their cause;
at least their opinions, can to after ages beare record.</p>
                     <p>It is true indeed, this word Peace sounds sweet in

the Angell from heaven proclaimed peace on earth,
and towards men good will: in a word, <hi>Beati pacifici,

thought so gracious, but that a necessary warre was
to be preferred unto it, if it was dishonestly violated,

(although for the time but coldly enough reconciled
unto him,) and was spoken unto by the Pilot, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

                     <p>The philosophicall reason given for not mourning
for the dead, I thinke neither allowable to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
nor to a meere naturallist; for they say, that it is
but lost time and action, seeing death is remedilesse,
common, necessary; and teares cannot prevaile to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
them againe, and therefore availe nothing: for
such like arguments are rather to reinforce sorrow,
than otherwayes to mitigate griefe: and so much the
rather, because there is no remedy for it: for as another
Philosopher replieth to one who reprooved him for
lamenting so heavily the death of his sonne, since
(said he) you know that there is no remedy for it; and
therefore (replied the other) doe I weepe: yet some
of the wisest sort of them agreed unto this mourning
for the dead, as a kind, naturall duty; in so farre, that
they who wept not for their parents death, were by
them said,

<hi>Mercator,</hi>

                     <p>NOw lastly, to conclude this treatise with Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
curiosity, instead of many, I will onely touch
that so fortunate and so much famed one of Columbus
in the discovery of <hi>America;</hi> He was an <hi>Italian,</hi> borne
in <hi>Genoa,</hi> whose most pregnant, curious and searching
wit, farre excelled all that ever were before him, in the
like attempts;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Columbus</hi> first intention, and motive to his voyage.</note> This worthy <hi>Columbus</hi> (I say) imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that since the Globe of the universe, the celestiall
Spheares, Aire, Waters, and all superior bodies were
round, concluded with himselfe that the earth could
not bee triangular, as in a manner it then was when hee
knew no other lands, but <hi>Europe, Africk, Asia,</hi> but cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and round also; as the rest of the Elements; and
so consequently that there behooved to be some vaste
tract of land, yet unknowne, which should extend it
selfe from South West to North West; Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of his he thus fortified.</p>
                     <p>That seeing of three hundred and sixty degrees,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Columbus</hi> his reason.</note>
which the world containeth in longitude, there being
onely one hundred eighty filled up with land; that
the Almighty Creator would not have suffered from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14966:141"/>
all beginning the waters to overflow all the rest.</p>
                     <p>But not content with this contemplation onely, he
never gave over till he put the tryall of it in practise;
wherefore in the yeere of God, 1492. aided and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
furthered by the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he set to sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
his course to the <hi>Canary</hi>-Islands (whereat
from <hi>Spaine</hi> he first arrived) towards the Southwest:<note place="margin">His voyage.</note>
but having spent many dayes upon the Sea without
sight of land, to the great toile, labour, and anguish
of his men, who began to mutine amongst themselves
and despaire of ever returning home, much lesse of
attaining their adventure; he was driven to his wits
end, whereupon politickly, (and as it were propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally)
he strove with all probabilities to assure them
that within two or three dayes, at furthest, they
should discover land;<note place="margin">His policy.</note> which the more confidently he
undertooke, because (saith my Author) he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the colour of the clouds then tending towards
him, to bee more white and more purified like land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouds,
from whence they behoved to come, then
those that meerely proceeded from the seas; which
conjecture of his proved true;<note place="margin">The cause of dearth since <hi>Columbus</hi> voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> for it pleased God, that
the third day thereafter they discovered this land
they sought for, of which, with its length, bredth,
nature, &amp;c. there are whole volumes extant; and
from this countrey it is, that the gold, money and
ware be transported, which hath caused our dearths;
all things in the dayes of our forefathers, being barte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one for another as common merchandises.</p>
                     <p>This mans spirit (no question) was warmed with a
more celestiall fire than ordinary; who first of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14966:141"/>
him, did both invent and execute so glorious a
designe, and profitable an enterprise, as the discovery
of a new world. Neverthelesse, there hath not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
some; who, to bereave him of this honour, doe

had found in ancient Monuments, some mention of a
terrible great Island, called <hi>Atlantida,</hi> which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit,
or went off and on, with the straits of <hi>Gibaltar,</hi>
of old called <hi>Hercules Pillars;</hi> but that it was taken

sonnes of men, before <hi>Columbus,</hi> did ever adventure
to discover it? nay who so thinketh it to be an Island,
mistaketh farre: for our moderne navigators have
found it to be continent almost, and firme land; as
joyning to the East-Indies on the one hand, and to
those Lands under the two Poles on the other: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
whereas <hi>Sicily</hi> is removed from <hi>Italy</hi> but a very
few miles (if ever they were conjoyned) as <hi>Ireland</hi> is
from <hi>Britanne;</hi> this <hi>America,</hi> or, as they would have
it, <hi>Atlantida,</hi> is distant from the mouth of the straights,
where (they say) it was taken away, some thousands

from his love, nor his love from the knowledge
of him. Wherefore it must consist of both joyntly.</p>
                     <p>But if by one of the two simply a man were made
happy, then he could not totally, but diminitively be
called so, which should not be thought; seeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is not entire ought to be attributed to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
because it should not be defective in any thing:
whereupon we may conclude,<note place="margin">What, and wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the old Philosophicall felicity, so much spoken of, being that whereof we now treate.</note> that the perfect felicity

that Will, almost even in the most regenerate
is so depraved, that without the grace of God, we
cannot so much as will any good thing, without the
preceding judgement of reason, in regard that Will is
defined to be a rationall appetite; consequently it is,
that even in those who say that their will standeth for
a reason, yet in their judgement there wanteth not
their judiciary election.</p>
                     <p>For S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his worke of Grace and Free-will
affirmeth; that Will, to what hand soever it
turne it selfe, hath reason accompanying it; yet not
that it is alwayes guided with true reason, but that
at least it is never without its owne reasons. These
considerations being had, it would appeare, that this
our happinesse should be placed in the understanding,
and not in the actions of our will; except we take them
so, as they have a reference to reason or understanding,
in which they are rooted, or (at lest) should be.</p>
                     <p>But if that be true on the otherside,<note place="margin">It would seem that our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse did not co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> affirmeth, that our
happinesse perfecteth it selfe by the most noble ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the most excellent part upon the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
subject; sure it is, that the noblest part of a man
is his soule, the most excellent faculty whereof is his
free-will; whose most lively operation is love, and
whose most worthy object is God: so that from
thence it would follow, that our happinesse consisteth
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14966:145"/>
in the love of God, consequently in the operation of
our will.</p>
                     <p>Now that the will hath the more excellent power
then the understanding, is cleare; because that faculty
(whose habits,<note place="margin">Reasons in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Will.</note> operations and objects are more
noble than the others) surpasseth the other: but so
it is, that will surpasseth in all these, for knowledge and
wisedome must give place to love and charity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it were better never to have knowne God, then
having knowne him not to love him.</p>
                     <p>Besides all this, seeing the actions, which are done,
doe depend upon the nature of the agent, the actions
of the will, are so much more noble, then those of the
understanding, in how far the Intellect may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
by the object of it, and by forcible and
convincing reasons, which it cannot withstand;
whereas will is free and cannot bee forced; for
then it should rather bee a nilling (to say so) then a
willing.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in good Philosophy an argument taken
from the nature of opposites is forcible: by the like
reason I say then, if the understanding were better
than the will, that then the contrary to the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
were worse than the contrary to the will; seeing
contraries are the consequences of contraries: but so
it is not; for the contrary of will is worse than the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Intellect; because the hatred of God,
which is opposite to the love of God, which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
upon the action of will, is worse than the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of him. <hi>Epist. 2. Pet.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
                     <p>Now as the actions of the will doe surpasse them
of the understanding, so doth the object of it; for

goodnesse which is the object of the will excelleth
verity the object of the intellect,<note place="margin">The actions of the will, the object of it seemes to bee more noble then these of the intellect.</note> as farre as deeds doe

                        <p>Liberty and compulsion defined; that the will is prompted

God.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ARguments in the behalfe of will, are grounded
most upon the freedome of its operations,
whereas these of the understanding are coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and limited as is said. Yet when all is spoken,
our understanding wanteth not its owne liberty, at
least in so farre as liberty is opposed to compulsion.</p>
                     <p>For if there were nothing compelled but that
which is repugnant to the inclination of the thing,
certaine it is that inclination to any thing agreeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well with the intellect.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas it is said that the object of will
which is good,<note place="margin">Will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding how coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> supposeth that of the intellect, which
distinguisheth the veritie of the thing: we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
that the will of it selfe could not have willed
that, except first by the understanding it had knowne
it to be such; so by this meanes the will hath no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regard to the object of it, in so farre as it beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
felicity and happinesse, then the intellect hath;
and although, by way of understanding, it bee made
the adaequate or proper object of the will, yet it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not to bee the object of the understanding also;
as having all things that are, and which may fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14966:147"/>
our capacity, for object; and consequently, it shold
be thought nobler and freer then the will, in regard
of the boundlesse object which it hath in its extent.</p>
                     <p>But to leave the decision of this question to better
Divines,<note place="margin">This question of felicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in will and understan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding is coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with that Theologicall question, of Faith &amp; good workes.</note> seeing it falleth neere on the controversie of
faith and good workes (by which together wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
salvation, as by the operations of will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
we attaine felicity)</p>
                     <p>I say, that all men naturally doe desire for the
well of their will, to be happy and have contentment;
and for the exercising of their understanding to have a
marke to ayme at, which all Philosophers allow to
be true; yet few of them came ever to the just point
of both. It is necessary then to have a butt, and to
have that good, and to have one, because GOD hath
given us an understanding whose perfection is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and so one; to which as at a marke our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
addresseth all her powers, and bendeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectually
all her forces: againe to have it good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee hath given a will whose perfection is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>And certainely, God who is wisedome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
himselfe, had an eye unto both these in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all things: For seeing the Philosophers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that nature doth nothing amisse, what should
then bee thought of God, whom nature serveth, is
but as a handmaid.</p>
                     <p>Now as GOD who is the beginning, middle and
end of all things, hath had no other end in his workes
But himselfe: Even so, we his Creatures, should have
no other ayme nor end in our actions but him only,
seeing we have both our beginning, continuing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14966:147"/>
from him: Naturally all reasonable creatures
doe wish well to themselves, and therefore propose
some marke which they ayme at as their peculiar
good: which can be nought else but the end for which
man was created, to wit the glory of God, who hath
made all things for it: So that in striving to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hee attaineth to his owne proper end and good,
which is the good hee aymeth at and naturally see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
                     <p>By this meanes if we find either the principle butt
of mans ayme or our Soveraigne good, wee have
found both, the butt hee shooteth at as the object of
his understanding, and his good for the object of the
will; hee therefore should apply all his endeavours to
this end, and all his desires to this his good.</p>

<hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> alleadgeth two sorts of

shewen that they and all the others were onely dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
opinions, and have concluded, that the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of man consisteth in the knowledge and union of
us with God: but little knew they that the first knot
of our union with this God was united, and therefore
the question is harder now; how we are to be reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againe.</p>
                     <p>To cast up here the opinion of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
our happinesse in Venery; or of <hi>Diodorus,</hi> in the
Privation of paine; of <hi>Calypso,</hi> and <hi>Dinomachus</hi> in
Pleasure and honesty together: of <hi>Herullus,</hi> in the
knowledge of Sciences, esteeming that thereby we
might live both contentedly and prudently: of <hi>Zeno,</hi>
in living according to nature; and so forth in the rest;
might bee enough to try the readers patience:
seeing of these things which they esteemed happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14966:150"/>
some were common to us with the Beasts;
others were not common to all, and so they failed in
the rules of our felicity.</p>
                     <p>This being so,<note place="margin">Finally, what our true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, and wherein it doth consist.</note> let us now at least finde it out, and
so in a word conclude. Briefly, as all happinesse
at first consisted in the union of man with God; so
our happinesse renewed, consisteth in the reunion of
us with the same God, from whom we have fallen;
by which reuniting, we shall both contemplate his
face, and love him, in whom we shall have our joy
accomplished, wherewith the heart of man can never
here be satiated, beyond which we shall crave no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
this felicity is not peculiar to the great ones of
this world above the meaner, but equally obtainable
of all who in humility of heart, and uprightnesse of
conversation, doe imbrace IESVS the Sonne of
GOD, by whom onely we may be reunited, since he
is the onely and soveraigne Mediator, blessed from all
eternity.</p>
                     <p>The conscience, which hath its assurance grounded
upon this foundation, and rock of verity, may call it
selfe truly happy, because it hath the earnest in this
life, of that great felicity which is to come, whereby
it possesseth it selfe in peace which passeth all naturall
understanding (one of the surest tokens of this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
neither perturbed with the terrors of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,
nor yet with the carelessenesse and lulled se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Atheist; but in a sweet harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two extremes,<note place="margin">By this sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine felicity, a man liveth in tranquility, and dieth in peace.</note> it retaineth the golden me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity.</p>
                     <p>This is that soveraigne felicity to my judgement,
whereby a man liveth contentedly here, whatsoever
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14966:151"/>
befalleth him; and dyeth in peaceable assurance of
that happinesse which is to come; which soveraigne
felicity we shall attaine unto, if by a lively faith wee
embrace the Sonne, and live according to his will;
and so put in ure and practise that great Canon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to live and beleeve well; espousing by that
meanes our will and understanding together.</p>

doe live every one by their owne life; so the
world as of greater dignity then any of the rest, hath
a more noble life whereby it moveth, then they:
And in effect, many pithy reasons he produceth both
in his <hi>Epimenides,</hi> in <hi>Timaeo,</hi> and in the 10. Booke of
his Lawes, to prove the world to bee an animall, both
from the constant and perpetuall course of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
from that naturall heat of the Sun, seeing the
Sun and man ingender man, to which, as to all the
Starres, he attributeth a soule, by which they live;
but so, that as they are of a delicate and transparent
body, so live they a most blessed life: yet not that
they are moved with an other life then the whole
world is.</p>
                     <p>For as in the body of man the soule, whereby our
sinewes, bones, flesh, bloud and all, are moved is one
and the same, notwithstanding all the members be not
alike vivificated; so is it there.</p>
                     <p>For what reason is there (saith he) that man who is
called a little world, and encompassed of the foure
elements, as well as the great world is, should be said
to live, and in the meane time to deprive the greater
one of life; Seeing the motion of the heavens, and
of her lights, the moving of the Seas, the seasons of
the yeare, all keepe their equall and constant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?
Alwayes as <hi>Plato</hi> here before setleth a Trinity in
the God-head, the Father; the minde, or <hi>mens</hi> which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:14966:153"/>
is the Son; and the life of the world flowing from
them as the Spirit, and as brightnesse from light: So
in his <hi>Timaeo</hi> he avoucheth that there is in the heavens
one certaine <hi>Ens,</hi> which is ever alike unto it selfe,
without beginning or ending, which neither needeth,
nor taketh helpe of any; which can neither be seene
by mortall eye, nor yet perceived by any mortall
sense, but onely to be contemplated by our minde
and understanding. So <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Metaphysicks,
and in his workes <hi>De mundo,</hi> esteemeth this <hi>Ens,</hi> sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternall,
unmeasurable, incorporeall, and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
not resting in this habitable world, but above it,
in a sublime one, unchangeable, not subject unto any
passion or affection; who as hee hath of himselfe a
most blessed and perfect life, so without errour may it
be said of him, that he giveth life unto all other things
below; and it is to be observed, that as in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
hee acknowledged this God, so in his dying-houre,
he made his writings and words jumpe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which is so much the rather to be remarked:
because, whereas many Christians did professe a sort
of religion in their life-time, which on their death-beds
they did disclaime: yet this man as he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
God in his writings; so dying, he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his soule unto him in these words, <hi>Ens entium, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serere
mei.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And particularly in his Booke of the Heavens, the
9. <hi>cap.</hi> as is cleere; there (saith he) without the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
heavens there is no place, vacuity, or end: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
those that are there, are not apt or meet to bee
in place; neither yet maketh time them any older,
nor are they subject to change, or alteration, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exempted
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14966:154"/>
from all passion, affection or change: they
leade a most blessed and eternall life.</p>
                     <p>And in the 12. of his Metaphysicks, <hi>cap.</hi> 7. but

                     <p>Yet for all this, I say, <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timaeo,</hi> speaking
of the procreation of the world, and of the vertues of
the heavens, proved that the world had a beginning,
and consequently that it shall have an end. And that
this is true (saith he,) it is aspectable, and may bee
seene, it may be handled, it hath a body: whence
followeth, that it hath beene begotten, and seeing it
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14966:155"/>
is begotten, it must bee by some preceding cause:
Now, saith hee, as it is a great worke to search out
this causer of it, so by our enquiry having found him,
to divulge him unto the vulgar is not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
Further he saith, that God willing to beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this world, as his chiefe worke, made it a living
creature subject to our sight; containing within the
inclosure of it, all other living creatures, according
unto their severall species and kindes; whereas he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth
neerer the minde and sense of our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Platos</hi> opinion of propagation and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all things.</note>
than his fellow <hi>Aristotle:</hi> so directly in his <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeo</hi>
he maintaineth, that as God created or begat the
world, so he infused in it a procreative power; which
by divine or heavenly heate, induced from above,
might propagate and procreate every thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto the owne kinde of it, whether living or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable,
whether above or below. And as the great
Prophet, and servant of God, <hi>Moses,</hi> bringeth in
God speaking unto his creatures after their creation
was finished,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Platos</hi> termes not far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> words.</note> 
                        <hi>Increase and multiply,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Plato</hi> in
his <hi>Timaeo,</hi> bringeth in God speaking of the world, and
all contained therein, in these words; All ye who
are created by mee, give eare to what I am to say, I
will give you seed and a beginning of being; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
doe ye for your parts beget, and bring to light
living creatures after your kinds: augment and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
them with food, and when they shall cease to be,
let the earth receive them back againe from whence
they came. And to this <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his 2 Book <hi>De ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratione
&amp; corruptione, cap.</hi> 10. giveth way where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
in that place generation unto corruption, hee
saith, that it is more worthy to be, then not to be;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14966:156"/>
seeing properly to be appertaineth onely unto God,
and not unto creatures.</p>
                     <p>After the fabrick of the universe was accomplished,
it should have beene for no purpose, if creatures had
beene wanting in it: therefore lest God should seeme
to have forgot it, he infused in every one, according
unto their owne kind, a procreative power, by which
the generation of things might be perpetuated.</p>
                     <p>But how did he this? saith hee, First generally,
having spread abroad in the Heavens, and Starres his
divine seed (for they claime a part in our generation)
Then particularly, in every thing the owne proper
seed of it: all which he avoucheth in the 12. Booke

                        <p>Ancient Philosophers attributed the framing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of all sublunary Creatures (as we Christians
doe) unto God; with a recapitulation of severall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonancies
betwixt us and them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> places and severall others of their workes,
as these worthy men have ascribed the cause of
the being of all things unto God; contrary to the
opinion of these other frivolous preceding Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;
who imputed the cause of it unto the concourse
of Atomes: So ascribe they the government of all
these sublunary things unto the powers above, with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14966:156"/>
us Christians: and not unto chance or fortune, as these
former Philosophers did.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the first of his Meteorologicks;
It is necessary, saith he, that this whole world which
environeth the earth, should be continuated with the
superior conversions, or revolutions of those celestiall
circles, and bodies, which roll, and wheele above:
because the whole vertue of it dependeth from
thence. Neither is it probable, that he, who hath
created the world, and all that is within it, should
abandon and leave it so: but that as the frame of the
fabricke was his, so likewise the guiding and ruling of
it should be ascribed unto him also.</p>
                     <p>Which is more cleerely exprest by the said <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
in his booke <hi>De mundo.</hi> Where he saith that it
is an old saying, and left by tradition from our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers;
that all things both are of God, and likewise
sustained by him; and that there is no nature of it selfe,
left unto it's owne Tutory able to attaine well being
(for so I interprete <hi>Salutem</hi>) without his assistance or
helpe: wherefore his opinion is, that God holdeth the
beginning, middle, and end of all things. So <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast</hi>
saith, that all things have a divine beginning, by
which they are and doe subsist.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionysius</hi> likewise in his booke <hi>De divinis nominibus</hi>
avoucheth, that nothing hath subsistance, but by the
omnipotent power of God: with whom, <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
that the governour of nature is the Creator of it:
neither will he forgoe that Ship which hee hath built:
Hence GOD is said by the ancients to bee divided
through all natures, as if all were full of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

invoke, and sacrifice unto him not only the calves

                     <p>Causes of sleep are two fold, Primary and secondary:
The true, Primary, Philosophicall, and immediate cause
of sleepe may be said to be this; the heart, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and seat of life, having much adoe to furnish
every part of the body with the streames of vitall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
hath most adoe to furnish the braines, which are
the greatest wasters of them, in regard of the many and
ample employments it hath for them,<note place="margin">Causes of sleep</note> as for Pensing,
Projecting, consulting, reasoning, hearing, seeing and
so forth; which functions of the braine doe so exhaust
the animall spirits, sent up thither <hi>per venas carotides,</hi>
through the <hi>veines organs;</hi> after by circulation in that
admirable <hi>Rete,</hi> or net of the braine, they are there set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
that of all necessity either our life in the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth
to cease, or it must betake it selfe to rest againe,
for the recollection and drawing backe of her spent
vitall spirits, to refurnish the braines with a new
<hi>recrew</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondary causes of sleepe are divers;<note place="margin">Secondary.</note> as excessive
labour, agitation of the body, repletion, as by excesse
of meates or drinkes, inanition, as by Copulation and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14966:161"/>
many more of this kinde, which doe so waste the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that of necessity, there behooveth a cessation to be
for a time, that new spirits may be recollected for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
of it; <hi>Ausonius</hi> wittily chiding his servants
lasie drowsinesse, imputes it to excesse of meate and

                     <p>VVE reade that great men and Commanders
upon the most important poynt of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploytes
and affaires, have sometime fallen in so deepe
sleepes, that their servants and followers have had
much adoe to get them to awake, the like formerly
being never perceaved in them. <hi>Iustinus</hi> and <hi>Quintus
Curtius</hi> in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great relate of
him: That, in the morning of that day appoynted for
that memorable battell betwixt him and <hi>Darius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> the great his sleep.</note> he fell
in so deepe a sleepe, and slept so long, that, on the very
shock of the battell, very hardly could his favorite
<hi>Parmenio,</hi> after two or three tryalls get him to awake.
It is agreed upon that hotter constitutions are least
subject to sleepe, and all his actions and proceedings
marke him out to be such an one; so it could not be his
constitution that brought that sleepinesse on him; but
he being then in hazard either to loose or conquer
a field, whereby both his Crowne, Countrey, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
lay at the stake (motives to keep a man awake)
had so, no question, toyled his minde and body in the
right preparing and ordering of all things befitting
a man of his place, for the encounter; that being at a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14966:162"/>
resolution, he gave himselfe to sleepe, which his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
thoughtfulnesse and paines did augment upon
him; and not, as some would have it, the terror of his
enemies forces: as <hi>Marcus Anthonius</hi> objected to
<hi>Augustus</hi> in that Navall combat against <hi>Pompey</hi> in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie,<note place="margin">

that he had not courage enough to behold the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the battell; for indeed he fell asleepe and slept so
long till the Victory was his, which he knew not of
till <hi>Agrippa</hi> with much adoe had awaked him.</p>
                     <p>But indeed I construe both their courages rather to
have beene so great (as their former and succeeding
actions may witnesse) that they disdayned that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

should seeme) would have opened the eyes of any
mans reason and understanding, so farre as not onely to
abhorre his first so ill-sett resolution, but totally to
extirpate a future thought of so damned an intention:

illustrations to that purpose; but so many having hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
those theames, and I studying so much as I can
brevity, and to shun tautologies, I remit the Reader to
them; and will now by the way touch upon dreames:
And they are either Naturall,<note place="margin">Division of dreames.</note> Accidentall, Divine or
Diabolicall.</p>
                     <p>Naturall are caused either by the Predominant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
humor or affections in us: As the Cholericke, who
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:14966:164"/>
dreameth of fire, debates, skirmishes and the like;
The Sanguine, of love-sports and all joviall things;
The Melancholicke on death,<note place="margin">Natural which</note> dangers, solitudes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
where the flegmaticke dreameth of Waters, Seas,
drowning and the rest.</p>
                     <p>These dreames which proceed from our Naturall
or predominant affections are either of love, jealousie,
feare, avarice, envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the first we may Presage
and judge of the sickenesses which may ensue upon the
superaboundance of such and such humors; (because
they being the effects of the redundancy of these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
have a connexion in Nature with them, as all
other effects have in their causes.) By the latter dreams
we may presage, and judge of the affections, and
passions of the mind, and so consequently of the vices,
consisting in their extreames; So the avaricious dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of gold, the lover of his Mistris, the Iealous of his
corrivall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if not ever, yet for the most part,
this happeneth true or at least in part.</p>
                     <p>Accidentall dreames,<note place="margin">Accidentall.</note> are caused either by dyet, by
feare or joy conceaved in the day time; or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
desire to have such or such a thing to come to
passe, and the like: Thus oft times a vicious soule will
figure to it selfe in dreames the terrors that it feareth:
As <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> who dreaming that the Scythians were
fleaing off his skinne, thought that his owne heart mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
this unto him: Wretched man that thou art!
I am the occasion of all these thy evills which thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durest.</p>
                     <p>Divine dreames are those,<note place="margin">Divine.</note> whereby it pleaseth God
to give either a warning or insight of things to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Butler, and Baker, <hi>Genesis</hi> forty: of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Diabolicall dreames cannot fore-shew any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                        </note> they may give a shaddow or representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of things past unto us, but not otherwise: Then
seeing there is little connexion of things past and to
come, therefore can there be no foresight by them;
for although the Divell knoweth many things, and at
some times even speaketh the truth of things to come,
thereby to inveigle our credulity, when in effect he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lyeth to deceave us; yet unto them we ought to give
no regard or faith. Now how Naturall or accidentall
dreames can portend or foreshew future things, it is

                        </gap> why, any wayes cleerely enough, to my
understanding.</p>
                     <p>For the dreames that GOD sendeth upon a man,
I understand to be mysticall, and portending somthing
touching his service: Our spirits it cannot well bee;
for when we are awake, we cannot foreshew any thing
to come, at least without praemeditation, not by any
Philosophicall ground whatsoever. Neither can
they be moved by the divel, for he is a deceaver, and all
his workes impostures: It must be then some other
spirit, that infuseth these accidentall dreames whereof
we will instance examples heereafter; to my mind, it
must be rather some peculiar extraordinary inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the dreamer for the time, than <hi>Anima Mundi,</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:14966:165"/>
or <hi>spiritus universitatis,</hi> although many learned men

                     <p>THe History, I say, of this unfortunate man,
and rich couzener, made me the more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and desirous to know the nature of so
rare a thing as that which they call the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
Stone, which if men might attaine to, the
West <hi>Indes</hi> should not bee so much frequented as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14966:187"/>
they are; but O how great is the wisedome and
power of the Creator of all, who reserveth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of so high a secret to himselfe, and
imparteth it but to very few, knowing the insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of the heart of man; and to these who

                     <p>So far as I can learn, I find that the Philosophicall
stone (by the <hi>Arabes</hi> called <hi>Elixir</hi> )is the very true
and just seed that engendereth and begetteth gold:
For gold is not procreated (as I may say) either of
Brimstone, nor of Mercurie, nor of any such thing
as fraudulently some suppose and give forth; but
it is to be search't and found out of gold it selfe, and
that most purified: for there is nothing in Nature
which hath not of it, or rather in it the seede of its
owne kinde, whereby it may be multiplied; but yet
hardly by Art may it be drawne out, by reason that
the greatest and most vigorous strength of that
seede consisteth in a certaine oylie substance,<note place="margin">The true matter of gold.</note> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adhereth to it; which, whensoever by fire
wee goe about to draw out, or segregate from the
substance it selfe, it consumeth away; which not
being so in gold, because by the violence of no fire
it can be so burnt away, but that it may abide the
whole strength and force of Art; therefore out of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14966:187"/>
it onely that seede or <hi>Elixir</hi> may bee extracted,

                        <p>That the making of the Philosophers Stone is lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive
and laborious than many things wee both
use and weare; why the makers of it enrich not
themselves and others.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe true making of that Stone is neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive,
nor long, nor wearisome to those
that have the dexterity of it.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt the Barley graine that must be sowne,
and the <hi>aquae vitae</hi> that is made of it, there is both a
longer time, and many more points of labour: And
betwixt the linnessed, and the linnen cloath wee
were, there is a longer time, and much more labour
than in the framing of Philosophers Stone, as these
blowers would have the world beleeve.</p>
                     <p>It is true, many chymicall Philosophers so soone
as they attained this precious Stone, the very
knowledge of it delighted them more than world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gaine; and they made more use of it in Physick
than in projection. And if any would aske; what
was the cause they made not themselves and all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14966:189"/>
their friends most excellently rich. It may be well
answered, they lacked not, they had contentment,
they delighted more in theory than practick: they
<hi>disdained</hi> to bee gold-makers to those that were
greedy, or to those that were through idlenesse
needy, and were <hi>afraid</hi> to be made a prey and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
slaves to avaricious and cruell tyrants: these
things and such like made them obscure and hide
from the world what they knew or could doe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
rather to have by the Philosophers Stone
a balsamick universall medecine than the feminary
of gold.</p>
                     <p>Many have written divers treatises of this subject
some one way some another way, some more my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically

to such as are diligent Readers of the <hi>Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>

                     <p>ANd first, these principles and grounds for

1. Every mettall consists of Mercury as a
common versatill and flexible matter of the which
all mettalls are, and unto the which all may bee by
Art red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ced. 2. The <hi>species</hi> of mettals, and their
specifick and essentiall formes are not subject to
transmutations, but onely the <hi>individuals of the
species.</hi> 3. All mettals differ not in their common
nature and matter, but in their degree of perfection
and purity. 4. Art surmounteth and over-reacheth
Nature, for Art assisted by Nature in a short space
may perfect that which Nature otherwise by it
selfe was a thousand yeares in perfiting and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing.
5. God hath created every mettall in its
owne kinde, and hath implanted in them (specially
in the perfect mettall) a seed whereby they may be
by Art multiplied.</p>

And lastly, of the beginning and ending of this

Orbes, of which eight; seaven Plannets have their
spheares betwixt the starrie firmament and the
ayre: but so set that every ones orbe is lesser than
the other, untill they reach the Moones; which is
the least, last, and lowest spheare of all.</p>
                     <p>The eight orbe which is the starrie firmament
comprehendeth all the rest of the fixed starres,<note place="margin">The division of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Coelestiall Spheares.</note> and
under it the planetary spheares before mentioned;
But yet so, that it againe is environed by one grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                     <p>The tenth spheare or <hi>primum mobile,</hi> is that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by whose perennall revolution, the starrie fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament

the Sunne; but by reason of their changing by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradation

It strange although the change fall not untill the 29.
and a litle more; the reason being, that during the
time of 27. dayes wherein the Moone goeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

in that same Zodiack;<note place="margin">Cause of the Moones change.</note> which space the Moone

                     <p>All these motions of the Starres, our Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

for a peculiar motion allotted to them besides, it is
a thing of some further consideration. <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
and the Astronomers of that age doe teach, that
the eight Spheare, commonly called the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

upon the Poles of the World, and in the same space
drawing about with it the nine inferiour heavens;
and the ninth heaven upon the Poles of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,
making a slower motion to the East, measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
but one degree in one hundreth yeares, and
therefore cannot absolve its course before six and

<hi>Iewes,</hi> as particularly <hi>Albumazar</hi> a <hi>Cabalist,</hi> have
by all likelihood conjectured best the time of its

                     <p>For, within these few hundred yeares they have
discovered the Caball and secret of the trembling
motion of the eight Orbe, that it doth not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
its course but in seven thousand yeares; which
in Analogy and relation is some way answerable to
the seventh yeares rest of the Earth, the seventh
dayes rest from labour: So that indeede by <hi>Leo
Hebreus</hi> his opinion,<note place="margin">When pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it may be thought to take an end.</note> the world should last but 6000
years, &amp; rest the seventh; which opinion is founded
upon the <hi>c. helck,</hi> in the <hi>Iewish Sanhedrim;</hi> where it
is written, 6000 yeares the world shall last, &amp; then
it shall decay: which <hi>Lactanctius lib. 7. cap.</hi> 14. il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrateth,
comparing the six thousand yeares to
the six dayes of the weekes labour, the seventh to
the Saboaths rest: our ancient both Poets and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours

they all, I say, almost knew generally that its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

added it to the rest of the parts of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
chiefly for two causes, as <hi>Fonseca</hi> well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in the 6. chapter of the Preface to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14966:216"/>
upon the Metaphysicks.</p>
                     <p>First,<note place="margin">The first.</note> because in the Physicks these substances
are considered, which are composed of bodily
matter and forme; and in the Mathematicks, they
are said to be <hi>accidentia abstracta à materia secundùm
rationem;</hi> yet truely and really in their beeing or
existence they have a necessary dependencie from
bodily matter, and therefore are called <hi>Accidentia
materialia,</hi> because they have their beeing in, and
from grosse and bodily substances. Now besides
these, there are some things meerely immateriall,
that is, neither composed of bodily matter and
forme, nor yet any way depending from bodily
matter, (which therefore are in the Schooles said
to be <hi>abstracta à materia &amp; secundùm rem &amp; secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
rationem</hi>) as God, the Angels, spirituall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<hi>&amp; caet.</hi> And therefore, as materiall substances
are considered in the Physicks, and materiall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in the Mathematicks; so it was requisite, that
there should be a third kinde of Science, to wit, the
Metaphysicks, for the consideration and handling
of things meerely immateriall, and independing
from bodily matter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The second cause.</note> there are some generall degrees and
conceptions of entity or beeing, as also some attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
properties, principles, and some divisions
or distinctions, which are common to all things,
whether they be bodily and materiall, or spirituall
and immateriall, as <hi>ens, essentia, existentia, unitas,
veritas, bonitas,</hi> and the divisions of <hi>ens,</hi> in <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,

                     </p>
                     <p>Now these things are transcending, and doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the limits of particular and inferiour Sciences,<note place="margin">Metaphysick excelleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sciences.</note>

comprehendeth and taketh in all things under the

is Metaphysick, of which we are now speaking.</p>

and the Reasons wherefore.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have spoken already of the divers names and
titles of this Science, of the reasons wherefore it
was invented, as also of the necessity of it: Now
in the last roome I will speake something of the
excellencie and dignity of it. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the 1.
Booke of his Metaphysicks 2 chapt. saith, two
things which serve very much for manifesting or
declaring the excellencie of this Science, first hee
saith, that it is a Science more fit and suitable for
God than for men; or to give you it in his owne
words, that <hi>ejus possessio non existimari debet humana,</hi>
that is, that man is not sufficiently worthy to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
or enjoy this Science, and that because this
Science,<note place="margin">That Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physick is free from all subjection to other Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> of all Sciences, is most free; yea it onely
is free from all subjection to other Sciences, and
from all reference to any higher or more eminent
knowledge: for all naturall knowledge can equall,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14966:218"/>
and much lesse exceede the sublimity of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
speculation; and therefore this Science re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a minde free and sublime, that is, a minde
not depressed with base cogitations,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> nor distracted
with worldly cares, as ordinarily the mindes of
men are, in respect of the manifold wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
into which they are subject in this life.
Seeing then God only is free from such distracting
and depressing cares, therefore in <hi>Aristotles</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this Science is more suitable for him than for
men. Secondly hee saith, that this Science is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all Sciences the most honourable, because
it is most divine:<note place="margin">Why the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physick is most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> And that it is most divine, hee
proveth by two very forcible reasons, first because
this Science <hi>versatur in rebus divinis,</hi> it contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plateth
divine and heavenly things: and this hee
proveth, because it considereth God himselfe as he
is the first <hi>principium,</hi> and the supreame cause of all
things. Secondly, because <hi>Haee Scientia maximè à
Deo habetur,</hi> the perfect and exact knowledge of
this Science most truely and properly is attributed
to God: for this Science in a manner, vieweth and
considereth all things, it hath an especially eye to
spirituall and invisible substances, and amongst
these it especially and chiefly contemplateth God
himselfe, as the highest degree of entity, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
cause of all things.</p>
                     <p>Now to take a full view of all the rankes, orders,
and degrees of things to have a positive and distinct
knowledge of that invisible world, the world of
Angels, and above all, to have a perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14966:218"/>
knowledge of that boundlesse Ocean
of beeing and goodnesse which is in God, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not a finite ingine or understanding, but an
infinite capacity and an unspeakable sharpenesse of
wit.</p>

wee may see this Science to be most excellent
in three respects.</p>
                     <p>First, because of the universality and amplitude
of the object or subject of it; for in the Spheare or
circuite of it, all rankes, orders, and degrees of
things are comprehended, so that looke how farre
the knowledge of the whole celestiall Globe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
the knowledge of one constellation,<note place="margin">Comparison.</note> and
the knowledge of the universall Mappe or table of
the whole Earth exceedeth in dignity the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Mappe of one Province or Countrey,
as farre doth Metaphysick (which is as it were one
universall Carde or Mappe, presenting to our view
all rankes, orders, and degrees of beeing) exceede
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14966:219"/>
in dignity these particular delineations and descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things, which are set downe in inferiour
Sciences.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The first respect, for the universality.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>SEcondly, because of the dignity of the subject
of it; for, not onely is this Science exercised
about the speculation of the highest and most
generall causes,<note place="margin">Christian Philosophers.</note> principles, and attributes of things,
but also it descendeth into a speciall consideration
of the most noble and excellent things of the
world, that is, of God and of his Angels: for, not
onely doe Christian Philosophers now in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks
dispute of them,<note place="margin">Aristotle.</note> but also <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his Metaphysicks, especially in his 12
Booke, doth most excellently discourse of them.
And truely it is more than marvellous, that an
Heathnick or Pagan-philosopher should, by the
light of Nature, have penetrated so farre into the
knowledge of God. For to passe by that which he
writeth in the 10. chapter of that Booke <hi>De unitate

                     <p>THere are some who thinke, that not onely
the contemplation of God, and of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
doe belong unto the Metaphysicks, but
also the contemplation <hi>De anima humana seu ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nali;</hi>
and that, because it is a spirituall or immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
substance. <hi>Suarez</hi> in the first Tome of his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks,
Disput. 1. Sect. 2. Parag. 18. most justly
condemneth this opinion; and that 1. because

unam &amp; eandem scientiam pertinet.</hi>

the consideration of the soule of man, which is
a part of man, belongeth also to Physick or naturall
Philosophy. 2. Albeit the soule of man be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall
substance in it selfe, and although in the
reall beeing of it, it hath not a necessary dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
from bodily matter, yet God hath appointed,
that the ordinary and naturall existence or beeing
of it, as also the operation of it, should be <hi>in mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria

It is farre more probable, that which is affirmed
by <hi>Ruvins</hi> and <hi>Conimbricenses</hi> in the Frontispiece
of their Treaties <hi>de anima separata à corpore,</hi>

operation of the soule <hi>in statu separationis à corpore,</hi>
after death untill the day of the generall resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
doth belong not to Physick, but in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to Theologie, and in other respects to Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physick.</p>
                     <p>For the handling of these questions, <hi>[An status

the handling, I say, of these questions doth belong
