         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </l>
               <l>Which of late was invented by Foes to our <hi>King;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A Phanatical Pamphlet was printed of late,</l>
               <l>To fill honeſt hearted Affections with Hate:</l>
               <l>But here lies the thing. God hath ſent Us a King,</l>
               <l>That hath Wiſdom enough to extinguiſh their Sting;</l>
               <l>And therefore I wiſh all Allegeance be given,</l>
               <l>To Him that directly was ſent Us from Heaven.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The Phanaticks do tell Us in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>A parcel of Chriſtians as they call them there,</l>
               <l>Did meet for to worſhip their unknown <hi>Apollo;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But mark! for their baſeneſs, hereafter doth follow:</l>
               <l>I have taken the pain, without any gain,</l>
               <l>The truth of this matter to you to explain:</l>
               <l>And therefore believe not this flattering thing,</l>
               <l>But ſtick cloſe to your duty you owe to your King.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Here now comes the matter which I am to declare,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where Brother and Siſter being privately met,</l>
               <l>They ſay a rude multitude did them beſet:</l>
               <l>But Villains beware, and of this have a care,</l>
               <l>Leſt you with true Subjects ſhould have no ſhare:</l>
               <l>For the King is reſolved their Rights to reſtore,</l>
               <l>And therefore Phanaticks plot Treaſon no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>After this Multitude had them beſet,</l>
               <l>They went to a Juſtice his Warrant to get,</l>
               <l>Deſiring his aid and aſſiſtance therein,</l>
               <l>But he being honeſt diſowned their ſin:</l>
               <l>He bid them depart, if they had their deſert,</l>
               <l>They deſerv'd to be whipt at the arſe of a Cart:</l>
               <l>But yet through their policie they do Us tell,</l>
               <l>That the Judgment of God on that Juſtice befel.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And for to bring this purpoſe about,</l>
               <l>One of their own Congregation went out</l>
               <l>Into the fields, where by chance he did ſee</l>
               <l>Of Frogs and of Toads a great company:</l>
               <l>But this they do ſay, that in battle array,</l>
               <l>To the Juſtice his houſe they ſtraight took their way:</l>
               <l>O do not believe them! my Friends have a care,</l>
               <l>For this is an <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> Snare.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet I'le not deny but that there was ſtore</l>
               <l>Of Frogs and of Toads at the Juſtice his dore,</l>
               <l>Which was <hi>Anabaptiſts, Browniſts,</hi> and thoſe,</l>
               <l>Which ever were known to be the Kings Foes:</l>
               <l>But thanks be to God they are under the Rod,</l>
               <l>That never intended to do any good:</l>
               <l>O do not believe them, my friends, leaſt that they</l>
               <l>Should delude you into their moſt damnable way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Beſides, they do tell Us the Juſtice his Maid</l>
               <l>Were the cauſe that theſe Frogs and theſe Toads were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyd,</l>
               <l>Which before at the Juſtice his windows had been,</l>
               <l>Was after diſpierſt, and never more ſeen:</l>
               <l>But let them have a care, it will fall to their ſhare,</l>
               <l>That ſuch Frogs and ſuch damnable Toads as they are,</l>
               <l>E're long will be baniſht, and never more ſeen,</l>
               <l>Which too long in this Chriſtian Nation have been.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I wonder, me thinks, how they can be ſo bold,</l>
               <l>To continue their impudent Actions of old:</l>
               <l>It hath been their practice ſince <hi>Oliver's</hi> days,</l>
               <l>To plot and foment how diſſention to raiſe;</l>
               <l>Not calling to mind, how gracious and kind,</l>
               <l>Our Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles</hi> they do find:</l>
               <l>And as for their Pamphlet I wiſh you beware</l>
               <l>How you do believe, and of them have a care.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O I wiſh you conſider their Actions of late,</l>
               <l>How they turn'd a brave Kingdom into a baſe State,</l>
               <l>Throwing the Pillars quite out of the Socket,</l>
               <l>And ſtriving to get the coin into their pocket:</l>
               <l>No man I'le name, then do not me blame,</l>
               <l>But, Gentlemen, this I do ſpeak to their ſhame,</l>
               <l>That all their <hi>Intentions</hi> was onely this <hi>Thing,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To hedge in the Kingdom, and murder the King.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come, come <hi>Independent,</hi> and caſt off thy hate,</l>
               <l>Conſider the workings of God here of late,</l>
               <l>How miraculouſly he hath brought it about</l>
               <l>To bring in the King, whom you thought to keep out:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Presbyter</hi> and the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> man</l>
               <l>May ſafely rejoyce now, becauſe that they can</l>
               <l>Freely enjoy what is duly their own,</l>
               <l>That's to have their Eſtates, and the King have his Crown.</l>
