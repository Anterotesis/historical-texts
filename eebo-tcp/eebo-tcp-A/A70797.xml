            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat there hath been now eighteen years ſpent in Civill Warrs, aboundance of Blood ſhed, and more Ruine and miſery brought upon the Kingdom by it, then all the ſeverall Changes, Conqueſts, and Civill Warrs it hath endured from the time of <hi>Brute,</hi> or the firſt Inhabitants of it; every mans wofull experience (ſome onely excepted who have been gainers by it) will eaſily aſſent unto.</p>
                  <p>No marvell therefore that many of thoſe (who if all they alledge for themſelves, that they were not the cauſe of it, could be granted to be true) might either have hindred or leſſned it, would now put the blame of ſo horrid a buſineſs from themſelves, and lay it upon any they can perſwade to bear it: And that the Conquerours, who would bind <hi>their King in Chains, and their Princes with Fetters of Iron;</hi> and think they have a Commiſſion from heaven to do it (the guilt of it being neceſſarily either to be charged upon the Conquerours or Conquered) are not willing to have their <hi>Triumphant Chairs,</hi> and the glories (as they are made believe) that hang
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:39279:6"/>
upon their ſhoulders defiled with it; but do all they can to load their Captives with it: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, though the ſucceſs and power of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath frighted it ſo far out of queſtion as to charge it upon the King, and take away his life for it; by making thoſe that muſt of neceſſity be guilty of the fact; if he ſhould have been (as in all reaſon he ought to have been acquitted of it) the only Judges of him.</p>
                  <p>It may well become the judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of every man that will be but either a good Subject or a Chriſtian, not to lend out his Soul and Salvation ſo much on truſt, as to take thoſe that are parties, and the moſt ignorant ſort of mens words for it: but enter into a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious examination of the matter of Fact it ſelfe, and by tracing out the foot-ſteps of Truth, ſee what a concluſion may be drawn out of it. In purſuance whereof (for I hope the Originall of this Sea of Blood will not prove ſo unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as the head of <hi>Nile),</hi> we ſhall enquire firſt of all who raiſed the fears and jealouſies. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, repreſent and ſet down the truth of the matter of Fact, and proceedings betwixt the King and Parliament; from the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ſeditious coming of the people to the Parlament and White-Hall, untill the 25 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1642. when he ſet up his <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and from the ſetting up of his <hi>Standard</hi> untill the 13 of <hi>September</hi> 1642. when the Parlament by their many Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a Negative and Churliſh anſwer to his propoſitions, might well have put him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39279:6"/>
out of hope of any good to be obtained from them, by meſſages of peace ſent unto them. Thirdly, whether a Prince or other Magiſtrate, labouring to ſuppreſs or puniſh a rebellion of the People, be tyed to thoſe rules are neceſſary to the juſtifying of a War if it were made between e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals. Fourthly, ſuppoſe the War to be made with a neighbour Prince, or between equalls, whether the King or Parlament were in the defenſive or juſtifiable part of it. Fifthly, whether the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their pretended Magiſtracy have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leſſer occaſions to puniſh or provide againſt inſurrections, treaſons, and rebellions as they are pleaſed to call them. Sixthly, who moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Peace, and offered fairlieſt for it. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who laboured to ſhorten the War, and who to lengthen it. Eightly, whether the conditions proffered by the King, would not have been more profitable for the People if they had been accepted, and what the Kingdom and People have got inſtead of it.</p>

of the prorogation of the Parliament, the Commons demanded he might be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty according to their priviledges: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Judges being asked their Councel therein, made anſwer, <hi>That general ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of Parliament there was none; but ſpecial ſuperſedeas there was; in which caſe of ſpecial ſuperſedeas, every member of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Commons ought to enjoy the ſame, unles in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Treaſon, Felony, or breach of the Peace,</hi> or for a <hi>Conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mnation</hi> before the Parliament: After which anſwer it was determined, that the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Thorp</hi> ſhould lie in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Commons were required on the behalf of the King to chooſe a new <hi>Speaker,</hi> which they did, and preſented to the King accordingly. That Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> was aſſured by her Judges, that ſhe might commit any of her Parliament during the Parliament, for any offence committed againſt her Crown and Dignity, and they ſhewed her precedents for it; and that <hi>primo &amp; tertio Caroli Regis,</hi> upon ſearch of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the ſeveral great caſes of the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> very much inſiſted and ſtood upon, the Houſe of Peers in Parliament allowed of the exception of Treaſon, Felony, and breach of the Peace.</p>
                     <p>For indeed it is as impoſſible to think there can be any priviledge to commit Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to think that a King ſhould priviledge all his Nobility, and every one of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that could get to be elected into the

Houſe of Commons in Parliament, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treaſon, and to take away his life in the time of Parliament, whenſoever their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or malice, or intereſt ſhould finde the opportunity to do it; or that, if it could be ſo, any King or Prince would ever call or ſummon a Parliament to expoſe himſelf to ſuch a latitude of danger, or give them leave to ſit as long as they would to breed it: or that priviledges of <hi>Treaſon</hi> can be conſiſtent with the name or being of a Parliament to conſult or adviſe with the King for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Him and his Kingdome; or that when Felony and breach of Peace are excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their priviledge, Treaſon, that is of a far higher nature, conſequence, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſhould be allowed them; or if there could have been any ſuch priviledge, and a meaner man than their Soveraign had broke it, a ſmall underſtanding may inform them they could not, without breach of the Peace, have fought for it againſt a fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and then alſo could not their priviledges have reached to it, but the King might have puniſhed them for it: and if they cannot upon a breach of priviledge (as it was adjudged in <hi>Halls</hi> caſe) without the Kings Writ, and the cauſe firſt certified in Chancery, deliver one of their own ſetvants arreſted: It is not likely any warrant can be found in Law to inforce the King to reparation, though he himſelf ſhould have broken it; but to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King for an allowance of that, or

any other priviledge, as well in the middle, as any other time of their ſitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they alwayes doe at the preſenting of their Speaker in the beginning of it. Wherefore, certainly the people never gave the Parliament Commiſſion (if they could have given a Commiſſion to make a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Soveraign) to claim that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver due to them, or to fight for that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet fought for by any of their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor ever underſtood to be taken from them, much leſs for their ayrie innovated <hi>pretences</hi> rather than <hi>priviledges,</hi> which have ſince eaten up all the peoples Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, as well as a good part of their lives and eſtates with it, and are now become to be every thing their Repreſentatives will and and arbitrary power have a mind to make it; who have ſo driven away their old legal priviledges by ſetting up illegal and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick kind of <hi>Priviledges</hi> (as they are pleaſed to call them) inſtead of them, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left of the <hi>Parliament</hi> like a <hi>Parliament,</hi> neither matter, nor form, nor any thing at all remaining of it; For, the upper and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſes have driven away and fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, who was their <hi>Head:</hi> the the lower after that, have driven away the <hi>upper,</hi> and 45. of the Houſe of Commons (whereof eleven are great Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army) have after that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned and driven away four hundred of their fellow-members: And from degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

the King, and he afterwards proved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtrumental in his Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance through the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>But here at <hi>Briſtol</hi> the chief deſign they had in hand failed them; for though there were a little Barque lay there, judged moſt convenient for the buſineſs, yet the Maſter would for no reward tranſport a ſingle perſon, though he was ſo honeſt as only to deny it and made no further ſearch or inquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſon, which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have tended to a diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>This deſign here failing, his Majeſty deſired to be brought ſome miles Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the houſe of a worthy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom he knew to be a truſty friend; where coming in he finds the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the field with his ſervants; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcovered himſelf to him, he was by him conveyed to a convenient ſtand till night, (having firſt taken leave of his true friends, who had thus far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him with the danger of their Lives and Eſtates,) from whence he was in the dusk conveyed into the houſe, and there carefully concealed for a week, till ſuch time as preparation could be made in ſome Weſtern Port of a paſſage for him; but coming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

there where it was provided, chancing to dine with a Parliament Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell then there, he thought it the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to looſe the benefit of that paſſage, then adventure to imbarque himſelfe ſingly, which might breed ſuſpicion, and perhaps have been the means after ſo many deliverances to have betrayed him into the hands of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>This paſſage then likewiſe failing him he then returned back to the place from whence he came, and concealed himſelf three weekes longer, till in the end it being reſolved on, he by the aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Ph.</hi> was conveyed through the moſt by-ways they could imagine to a gentlewomans houſe in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where he lay till a perſon of true worth and honour made proviſion of a faithfull Maſter, who with a ſmall Veſſel wafted him to a ſmall Creek in, <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> to the great content of the Kings ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, and all his Loyall Subjects and to the honour of the Maſter with due reward, as in time may appear.</p>
