         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THis being an Invitation of Love and Life (learned
Counſel indeed) from him that hath been tryed in
the deeps, a follower of the Lamb in many Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
where-ever he went, who was baptized into his
death by the Holy Ghoſt, and by Fire; made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him through ſufferings, who is the Captain of our
Salvation; cloathed upon with his Virtues and Graces, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
unto every good and perfect work: For he had the mind of God,
and the Secrets of the Almighty did abide upon his Tabernacle; and
he propheſied of this day which is now come, and what ſhall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whiEh is not convenient to be uttered; but the day will declare and
make all things manifeſt; For he that doeth buſineſs in great waters,
ſeeth the wonders of the Lord, and declareth of the working of his
mighty Power, who wrought mightily in him; he brake the Bonds, and
cut the Cords aſſunder, and led him by the hand of his Power through
the Fire and the Water, and ſet his feet in a plain path, and brought
him forth in the midſt of his Enemies, and ſtood at his right hand that
he could not be moved; yea before the faces of them that had perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his righteous Soul, and had ſaid his God had forſaken him, and caſt
him off for ever; but the Lord did never leave him or forſake him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Satan had power to winnow him as wheat; yet his precious life
was hid with God, and the evil one could not touch it; and the Tryal
came not upon him for his own ſins onely, nor the ſins of others; but it
was to try ſome, that all Fleſh may be ſilent, and that none ſhould glory
in his preſence, who ſetteth up, and caſteth down, who kills and makes
alive, according to the good pleaſure of his own will; and who ſhall ſay,
Why doſt thou thus? For the Potter hath power over the Clay, to make
a Veſſel of honor, or of diſhonor: For I am God All-ſufficient, and
man as the duſt of the Ballance, and as the drop of the Bucket; and let
all men know, that the Moſt High ruleth in the Heavens, and doth
whatſoever he will in the Earth; for the Lord alone does all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let none glory in his own wiſdom or ſtrength; for all Fleſh is as
graſs, and the glory of it as the Flower of the Field, which ſoon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
away, and cometh to an end; therefore let him that ſtands, fear
<pb facs="tcp:29528:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fear alwayes, leſt he fall into temptation; for none can ſtand in the Day
of Tryal, nor dwell with everlaſting Burnings, but he that lives and
walks in the Spirit, and puts no Confidence in the Fleſh: <hi>[Mark this]</hi>
He was ſet as a Sign for the Riſe and Fall of many, that the Secrets of
many hearts might be made manifeſt, and for to prove that Generation
that then had Power in their hands, but improved it not, but went on
in the Counſel of their own corrupt Hearts to perſecute the Innocent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but the Lord God who hath pleaded the cauſe of the needy, a helper of
him who had no helper in the Earth; I ſay, the Lord God hath plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that generation of men which now are paſſed away, and their
very memorial is become an evil ſavour; for they ſhewed no mercy;
Therefore in the day of their diſtreſs they could find no mercy, but the
merciful God, whoſe mercies are above and over all his works, He did
remember his Captive, and did not leave his ſoul in the Grave, but did
deliver his Lamb from the devouring Wolves, and ſtopped the mouths of
the Lyons which greedily roared, and gave him his life for a prey, that
he might magnifie and exalt his unexpreſſible abundant loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and unutterable love of the Lord to him; that all that fear the
Lord might truſt in the God of his Salvation, who ſaved him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt;
this is the God of the living: O let all the holy Saints that know
the breath of life, praiſe him that liveth for ever: For all Dominion,
Honor and Glory is his, and unto him let it be aſcribed for ever and
ever.</p>
            <p>But he hath finiſhed the work his Father gave him to do, and hath
run the Race that was ſet before him, and is come to the End of all
things; the Antient of Dayes, the Judge of all; although the outward
Tabernacle be gone to its place, yet he lives, and ſhall never dye; and
the reſurrection of his moſt holy Life is riſen, and ſhall ariſe in many;
a Name he hath among the living, which can never be blotted out, and
the bleſſing of the Lord is upon the Seed that hath been raiſed by his
preaching of the Word of Reconciliation and Peace, and his Off-ſpring
ſhall declare his Generation for ever; for the Seed is ſtill multiplying,
his Childrens Children are ready to bring forth, ſtill raiſing up Seed to
the Elder Brother, the true Husband in the Reſurrection; but now none
can add to him, or take from him; for Immortal is his Crown, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
is his glory; and in all that was done unto him, the Lord never ſmote
him, as he hath, and will ſmite them that ſmote him; for he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them with a great Breach, and ſo ſhall it be with all Zions Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<pb facs="tcp:29528:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for her King is in the midſt of her, the Lord of Hoſts is his
Name, who will ſmite the Hoſt of the Egyptians; and fear, horror
and trembling ſhall take hold on <hi>Iſrael's</hi> enemies, and he will ſmite
the Earth with a Curſe for his Elect ſake, and he will plague hard-hearted
<hi>Pharoah,</hi> that will not let the Seed go free to ſerve the Lord
in the Spirit, and the Truth; and with <hi>Amalek</hi> (which will not let
<hi>Iſrael</hi> paſs through his Land) will he make War for ever, and in the
deſtruction of his Enemies will he get himſelf a Name, and his
Name ſhall be dreadful to all them that know him not; but all that
know his Name they put their trust in it, and unto them it is a ſtrong
Tower of Defence, and into the Ark of his Strength will he gather all
the Righteous ſouls, whilſt he eaſe and avenge himſelf of his enemies;
and for ever bleſſed are all they that hold out unto the end, and keep the
Word of his Patience, they ſhall be hid in the hollow of his hand, kept
ſafe in his Pavilion, and a defence will he make about his people, and
Zion ſhall be the praiſe of the whole Earth, a beautiful City, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,
compaſſed about with ſalvation for Walls and Bulwarks, and the
Mountain of his Holineſs ſhall be on the top of all Mountains, and no

For under all theſe your Beloved ſuffers, while theſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

Children</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> and ſo in time your
old Iniquities overtake you again.</p>
            <p>For whatever <hi>of the old man</hi> comes out of the fire <hi>unconſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
dead</hi> and <hi>buried</hi> in this Baptiſm, wil be a continual <hi>Cank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29528:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſee your deſire; for though the World have conceived a
Faith in the air, and ſo bringeth forth nought but ſeveral
ſorts of Winds ſtriving upon the Earth, without Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo builds nothing to perfection; <hi>Yet with you it muſt
not be ſo;</hi> for <hi>to you</hi> the Light is ſprung up which leads to the
Foundation of God; and <hi>you</hi> have received a <hi>Faith</hi> that gives
you a <hi>ſight</hi> of the Stone which the Builders <hi>ſee not;</hi> and to you
<hi>it is given not onely to believe in him, but to</hi> ſuffer <hi>for his ſake in the
behalf of him;</hi> and ſo <hi>to run, as to win him,</hi> ſo <hi>to ſtrive,</hi> as <hi>to obtain
him,</hi> his <hi>Name,</hi> his <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Nature;</hi> for this is that your ſoul
groans for, to poſſeſs and inherit his Power, his Love, his
Meekneſs, his Patience <hi>in all Tribulations;</hi> his <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>all fears,</hi>
and to have the Power <hi>of all his Grace</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> living in
you, whereby you may be men of able Spirits, rightly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
to every good work, and againſt all evil, that in him
you may overcome when you are tryed, and be more then
Conquerors; and your Work is to war againſt whatever would
keep you from coming to this Foundation and Corner-ſtone.
And it is not beating the air, that will fight your Battel; for
it's againſt all theſe deceits you are to fight, and airy notions,
and all ſpirits that would poſſeſs you with <hi>words</hi> and <hi>forms,</hi>
without <hi>the Power</hi> of Righteouſneſs, and what ever lyes under
the power of ſin; the true Light gives you to ſee <hi>the curſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt</hi>
that lyes in all this, and that theſe are the ſubtile paths
of the deſtroyer; and nothing leſs then Victory <hi>over ſin</hi> and
<hi>ſubtilty</hi> will ſatisfie your ſouls; ſo that it's onely <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi>
that can give you peace, and therefore yours is <hi>work,</hi> and
not <hi>vain words;</hi> and that which ſtrikes at the root <hi>of ſin,</hi> is your
beſt Weapon: So it is not <hi>Fleſh</hi> that profits you, it's the <hi>spirit</hi>
that muſt quicken through <hi>hardſhip,</hi> that which <hi>eaſe</hi> hath
ſlain, ere you come to perfect peace.</p>
            <p>For though the Letter tell of a Child <hi>that is heir of all things,</hi>
and gives this Inheritance to all in whom he is formed, whoſe
Name is, <hi>Wonderful in Counſel and Strength,</hi> yet is not this
brought forth without <hi>hard labour</hi> and <hi>travel,</hi> and the pangs of
death gone thorow; for when you come to the Lord <hi>for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi>
and feel that there is two manner of Seeds in the Womb,
then will you ſee that great Work is to be done ere you come
to reſt; There is the <hi>ſtrong man</hi> to be bound before the Babe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29528:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can reign; and ſtrongly is he armed with all manner of Wiles
to ſave himſelf; and it's not <hi>words</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> that will caſt
out the <hi>Mother</hi> &amp; <hi>her Son</hi> which muſt not inherit; and this muſt
be done, or all is in vain: He that is born of Fleſh, is in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to things here below; this cannot inherit Immortality,
for ſin hath power <hi>in him,</hi> and dye he muſt, that the Son of
Righteouſneſs may ariſe to life <hi>in you,</hi> and bring your life to
light <hi>with him,</hi> as he appears; and though the Light be <hi>above</hi>
the Tranſgreſſor, yet the Son <hi>is lowly</hi> that gives it.</p>
            <p>So being faithful in the Light which from the Son cometh,
which condemneth all the lofty wayes of the firſt-born, you
will beled into ways lowly, to croſs your life in him; through
Watchings and Faſtings, and great Tribulations, muſt he be
famiſhed, into which the Spirit will lead you, where there is
nothing for the Luſt to live on, nor for that Wiſdom to walk
in that loves it ſelf, or ſeeks its eaſe and pleaſure. Then be
faithful to your Guide, however he ſtorm that is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And with all diligence preſs into that which calls in the
wandering mind, and give heed with <hi>watching</hi> and <hi>wreſtling</hi> to
get abiding therein, which as you are faithful therein, it will
be enlarged, till it become a habitation for your pure minds
to dwell in, and take up its reſt, which hath been toſt to and
fro as in a Wilderneſs; and by killing in the Watch all that
would draw you out, and ſinking down into <hi>this meekneſs</hi> and
ſtedfaſt <hi>lowlineſs,</hi> you will come to feel the Plant of God that
brings forth <hi>this meekneſs</hi> and <hi>holineſs,</hi> and ſprings of living
virtue; and there will you meet the Lord in his Kingdom on
Earth, where he delights to walk as in a Garden; for in theſe
things he delights, and in ſuch as delight therein, and there
wait to feel his fellowſhip, and receive his Counſel in purity
and coolneſs, in which he will let you ſee whatever it be that
would break his Covenant with you, and whatever leadeth
out from the Eternal Life, and will with his Spirit lead you
out to war againſt it; in vvhich Spiritual War <hi>being faithful,</hi> you
ſhall not fail of Victory, till every cumbrance in your minds
be caſt out, and ſo heavenlineſs become a quiet habitation,
that in the meek ſpirit you may feed upon the heavenly food
and not to have that ravenous earthly ſpirit to ſteal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it from the ſoul.</p>
            <p>

And as you get an entrance into this heavenly Manſion, ſo
diligently watch, and in the Light ſtand armed againſt the
Thief, and keep out whatever would enter into your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or deſires, under what pretence ſoever; for if it enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

pure innocent Plant; and this is <hi>Adultery, Treachery</hi> and
<hi>Whoredom,</hi> which you muſt <hi>wreſtle againſt</hi> in the power of his

            <p>And with willingneſs of mind to put off <hi>all the old Idols</hi>
out of your affections, what ever hath any place there; for by

all haſt,</hi> and that which ſeeks its own eaſe; and ſo in all
things with deſire, drinking in of the Heavenly Virtue from
above, whereby you may become ſtrengthned with <hi>all might,</hi>
to ſtand <hi>all aſſaults of the Enemy, within</hi> or <hi>without;</hi> and ſo in the
croſs come to put on every meaſure, Chriſt Jeſus, the great
Power of God unto Salvation, and Well-ſprings of Eternal
Life and Glory, which is done by ſinking down into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
feeling, contrary to the Will of the exalted Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you will be overſhadowed from above, from whence the
Saviour is looked for, to overcome things below.</p>
            <p>And as you come into the feeling of theſe Virtues, hold
them faſt till he come who is the fulneſs, and with that you
have, wreſtle againſt what ever would draw out your minds
from it; for with that of him muſt you make War againſt
whatever is contrary thereto; and as you are faithful to abide
therein, you wil feel every high thing fall before you; for that
which cleanſeth the Veſſel of all corruptible things, <hi>is your
Weapon;</hi> and that which ſprings up in a contrary nature, <hi>is your
life.</hi> The beholding whereof as it riſeth, and keeping your
eye conſtant in the Faith and Hope of attaining to his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
will make your Work the Work <hi>of Love,</hi> your obedience
<hi>delightful,</hi> and all your ſufferings <hi>eaſie,</hi> and your loſs of your
former glory will in that eye appear <hi>great gain;</hi> and this is
your acceptable ſervice, and that Faith which vvorks by Love,
vvhich avails much vvith God, and being follovved, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the World, and ſets free from it in all things.</p>
            <p>So vvith the Light mind to be led dovvn into that Life that
is not of this World; come to him that ſeeks not himſelf, vvho
hath not his reſt in things on earth, vvho is rejected of men,
denyed of his ovvn kindred, and forſaken of all; and as you
come to him, you vvil come to be proved vvhether you can
forgo all theſe for him alone, and that he may make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in you, and cover you vvith himſelf, his contempt
and reproach, and his patient povver to bear all; for it's he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29528:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that can bear all things, that ſhall never be moved; and he
that thus overcomes, ſhall know the <hi>white ſtone,</hi> and that
Rock which breaks the Nations, but builds the Houſe of
God.</p>
            <p>But in all your Journey take heed of the <hi>Adulterous mind,</hi>
for it ſecretly devoureth the precious Life; Wherefore take
heed of that which looketh out, give not way to that eye not
for a moment; for if you conſent to it upon any pretence
whatſoever, you enter into a Covenant therewith, againſt
the holy Seed, to deſtroy the chaſt mind; but whether it be
<hi>rough</hi> or <hi>ſmooth,</hi> yet hold it as an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and that which if it
get in by conſent, muſt out by ſuffering double to the delight
it brings with it; but if as an Enemy you withſtand it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and patient reſiſtings, it will flye, and grow weaker up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every aſſault; and he that giveth you victory, will grow
more in your eſteem and delight.</p>
            <p>Wherefore think it not ſtrange (ſo long as any of the old
leaven is within, unpurged out) That the nearer you draw to
God in <hi>the lowly-ſuffering-meekneſs,</hi> the deeper you ſink <hi>into tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,</hi>
and your ſuffering encreaſe upon your fleſhly part,
for that is the Sons way to perfection; and the wondrous
works of the Father are learned in the deep; for by the hand
of God upon you (being faithful in ſuffering to the end) ſhal
you ſee the old Foundation of the World, the root and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of all Wickedneſs, how it came to be laid, and how the
Lamb is ſlain, and what he is; and the Foundation of God
ſhall you ſee and feel, upon which the Saints were raiſed up
and built in the Spirit, and how all the <hi>Chaff, Hay</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi>
comes to be cleanſed off; for his fan is in his hand, and the
words of his mouth are a conſuming fire to that Nature, who
refineth the Gold, and quickeneth the Soul, and divideth the
clean from the unclean. And the nearer you draw to God,
the nearer will he draw to you in Righteouſneſs, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Truth, to make an end of ſin, and bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Righteouſneſs, and to eſtabliſh you in his inheritance
who appear in his Temple through the Refiners fire, and Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
Sope, the end of all ſufferings, and entrance into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
joy, purity and peace, and weight of Eternal glory, to
which there is no other way but through affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:29528:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But as you come down to the Foundation of God, watch
with all fear and diligence, that nothing exalt you, or lift
you up in <hi>mind, conceit,</hi> or <hi>comprehenſion,</hi> faſter then with that
Foundation you are builded; for many temptations of haſte
will preſent themſelves with <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>diſtruſt,</hi> to get you from
off the Foundation of Life; but if you keep lowly, <hi>ſteadfaſt</hi>
and <hi>faithful</hi> thereto, with it you ſhall be raiſed out of the Pit,
and ſet above the Earth. And for that end is it laid <hi>within
you,</hi> that in Spirit you may be built thereon, in order like the
Corner-ſtone, a <hi>new man,</hi> not the ſame that <hi>goes down,</hi> and none
knoweth the way of his riſing, but as he keepeth to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and mindeth the head of the Corner, which as you
diligently mind, you ſhall know the ſure Foundations of the
holy City, even from the Word of the beginning of Chriſt,
as you grow to his fulneſs, the Foundations of Repentance,
of Faith, of Doctrines, of Baptiſms, of the Reſurrection of
the dead, and of eternal Judgement.</p>
            <p>And as with the Foundation of Life and Power you come
to be edified, you will be led thorow the dominions of Death,
where you ſhall learn wherein it hath its power, and by what
it reigns, and how it captivates the Seed, and how its Bouds
are broken, and with what he is taken and chained, who
hath the power of death; and ſo come to ſee <hi>what binds,</hi> and
<hi>what looſes; kills,</hi> and <hi>makes alive;</hi> the Life of the Lavv, the Life
of the Prophets, and the Life of the Apoſtles, as they paſſed
before you, vvill you come to knovv, their in heritance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to poſſeſs, and vvith them in Spirit have fellovvſhip, as they
paſſed the time of their Pilgrimage here, that to the Life of
Chriſt you may come, for the fulfilling of the Word of God,
vvhich endureth from Generation to Generation: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end of all the travels of the ſouls of <hi>righteous men</hi> and
<hi>women</hi> here belovv, vvhich that they might attain the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thereof, and ſo return in peace to him from vvhence they
came, cloathed on vvith their heavenly Houſe, for which prize
they counted all things loſs here below, caſting off the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaſures,</hi> and killing every affection thereto, eſtranged
therefrom in all their vvalking vvhile they are here, knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the love to the <hi>earthly things,</hi> is the enemy <hi>to their
spiritual aſcending,</hi> and that the Earthly Adulterous Spirit dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29528:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hunts to devour the precious Life, and to keep the ſoul in
things below; preſenting daily its delights carnal, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pathes of the deſtroyer, with pleaſures to the carnal
eye, which whoſoever joins to, cannot aſcend into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Inheritance, but with the dark World daily go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
who are degenerated from the Life of God, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from it, even from the Womb; ſo that they are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to attain the knowledge of God, nor in truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
to call him Father, nor to ſay they came out from
him, nor ever to him can return; This they being willingly
ignorant of, that no man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he
that came down from heaven, who is born, not of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Seed, nor begotten, but by the Word of God which
liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
            <p>But with you it is not ſo, (neither are you going that way)
who feel the heavenly motion drawing your minds out of all
earthly delights, the taſte of the <hi>Heavenly Life</hi> overcoming
<hi>the Earthly</hi> in your affections; ſo that to the World you dye
daily, and you feel ſomething quickned in you, that cannot
feed <hi>on earthly pleaſures,</hi> but hunger after righteouſneſs, and
ſee a beauty in holineſs, and thirſt daily after the Heavenly
Virtue: So to that ſink down into its likeneſs, which is yet
in the bonds of death, and hunger with it, and ſuffer with it,
and join to it in all its counſel, ſo that with it you may be
raiſed; for that is it which is on the foundation of God; and
coming to him as a living ſtone, you will be built on the ſame
Foundation, the ſame Spirit being your Head; by whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
all the Vails will be done away, the Vail of Death,
the Vail of the Law, the Vail of the Prophets, and the whole
myſtery of godlineſs will be unſealed, and the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
opened by him, even the <hi>ſlain Lamb,</hi> who hath his power
from the midſt of the Throne of God, even for you, if you
join to him in his ſufferings and aſcendings, who maketh the
way betwixt Heaven and Earth, and keepeth it open in all
them who mind him, therewith to poſſeſs the Veſſel in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and fear towards God, ſo that nothing ſhall hinder
your prayers from coming to the Throne of God,
nor the dew and bleſſing of Heaven from falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Seed; and here is Heaven opened, and the way of grace
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29528:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſalvation for the wayfaring man here on Earth to walk
in; in which if you wholly exerciſe your minds, you ſhal not
err; nor ſhall any thing be able to hinder you from receiving
Gifts from the Father, ſo long as nothing of a contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſtops his own from ariſing to him in praiſes, and you
with it.</p>
            <p>So let nothing cut off <hi>your Communion with God</hi> in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you already have received; but let the breathings of your
ſouls, and your hearts be continually open towards him, and
therein you ſhall not onely <hi>receive,</hi> but become <hi>faithful impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of what you have, by the bleſſing that is the Covenant
that is with all that love him that dwells in the Light; for
where the converſation is in Heaven, there the Earth becoms
fruitful.</p>
            <p>Wherefore give all diligence, that nothing have <hi>your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
here below,</hi> or ſtop your heavenly mind from its conſtant
aſcending; for that is the ſpirit of Bondage which hath got
power, by letting ſome carnal thing in upon you, to preſs you
down; which Spirit waits upon you continually to enſnare
the Heavenly Life, and get above it in your minds, and ſo as a
weight beſet you in your way, leſt that which comes from
Heaven ſhould have free paſſage through a clear Veſſel to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Seed, free from <hi>cares, cumbrances,</hi> and <hi>earthly pleaſures,</hi>
and from Earth to the Heavens; for it's he that comes from
above, which declareth to man <hi>his way,</hi> and <hi>his wants,</hi> preſents
<hi>his prayers,</hi> and receives <hi>the anſwer;</hi> and by him alone doth God
work all his Works <hi>in you,</hi> &amp; <hi>for you,</hi> in Heaven, and in Earth:
Now if you join to <hi>another,</hi> and give your ſtrength of heart
and mind <hi>to his Enemy,</hi> then the Work of God ceaſes, the way
being ſtopt; for the <hi>Adulterer,</hi> the <hi>Covetous,</hi> the <hi>Idolater,</hi> the
<hi>Wanton,</hi> the <hi>Sloath,</hi> or what ever of that Nature you join to
your conſent giveth him ſtrength to ſtop the Way of Life:
And this is your condemnation, witneſſed with the Light;
and herein had Death its power at the firſt, which can be no
Head, but where he is hearkned to, let in, or obeyed, (but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſiſted, flyes) but being let in, he ſeateth himſelf in the
Heavenly way, with much policy and power, and is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
got out, nor ſeen to be what he is; ſo when you feel your
way darkned, or affections <hi>grow cold</hi> towards Heaven, then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29528:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
take heed <hi>with all diligence</hi> in the pure Light <hi>to ſearch,</hi> for <hi>your
Enemy</hi> hath got ſome entrance, which by faithful and patient
waiting in the Light, you will come to ſee, and through the
power of the Croſs to kill that life, and caſt out that in which
it was conceived, for that muſt not abide in the Houſe with
him that is Heir of the Heavenly Inheritance, but is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to his coming; for it is he that letteth till he be taken out
of the way, which while he is in the way, dulls the affections,
and clogs the Heavenly mind, that it cannot aſcend: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which you have received of the Holy One, his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hold faſt till he come, and with it ſtand armed againſt
whatever would enter to lead out to any outward obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but with all diligence obſerve that which you have of
his in Spirit, which the adverſary ſeeks ſo much to draw you
forth from, leaſt you ſhould encreaſe your Lords money, and
herein you maintain your daily watch, and war with that
you have of Life and Power, and not with that you have
not; ſo are you faithful Stewards, and are accepted in what
you have, and not in what you have not; for the World is in
darkneſs, and ſo wait for they know not what, and have no
ground for their Faith, nor power to prepare his way to his
coming, further then words of others, or their own concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
but are not in him who is true; but you are in him who
is true, who have his Light received, and are in it to obſerve
hhis appearance in all things, and the Meſſenger of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
you know, who goeth before his face <hi>to prepare his way,</hi>
turning your hearts from every evil way, and out of the
paths of the deſtroyer, that you may be fruitful upon earth,
that ſo he may receive you into himſelf vvhen he cometh to
ſmite the Earth vvith a Curſe, which that which brings forth
Bryars and Thorns is nigh unto, whoſe Seed is not of himſelf,
his root and off-ſpring at his coming, which is begot in the
Adulterous mind.</p>
            <p>For the mind feeding from without upon any knowledge,
form, or obſervation (but what the life leads to in Spirit and
power) is the ground of the myſtery of iniquity, &amp; the woman
of Witch craft, which hunteth for the precious life of the holy
Child, ſeeking to draw your ſtrength of affections from him
after the harlot, that ſo he may fall &amp; die daily in your hearts
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29528:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and affections, while the Luſt goes out to another, covered
with ſome fair pretence, whereby the worldly Spirit gathers
ſtrength daily, as you ſhal feel who are watchful and diligent
in the Spiritual War, ſo ſhal that Truth appear to you; That
as your love waxeth cold, ſo wil iniquity abound, with an
unreſiſtable power, whatever you know to the contrary, which
is not in the life; Or whatever you believe without that faith
which works by love to the life of Truth more then to the
knowledge of Truth: So let your wreſtling be into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and life of God, and thereon feed, and your life ſhal indure
for ever, and your ſtrength and virtue ſhal be daily renewed:
But you read of ſome who had the form of Knowledge, and
of the Truth, but being out of the life of Truth, held the
Truth in Unrighteouſneſs; and ſuch when they knew God
did not glorifie him as God in life: So he gave them up, who
became vain in their imaginations, who retained not the life
in the knowledge, turned the Truth of God into a Lie: So
that knowledge could not keep them from being filled vvith
unrighteouſneſs, which ſtood not in the life and povver of
righteouſneſs, and who received not that Truth in that Faith
which loves to live the life of it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let your food be in the life of what you know,
and in the power of Obedience rejoice, and not in what you
know, but cannot live; for the Life is the Bread of your ſouls,
which crucifies the fleſh, and confounds that which runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Croſs. So let your labour and diligence be in that
which preſſeth into the Heavenly Being, and ſeeketh a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to Chriſt in obedience of what you believe, and
hearken in love to that, not in that mind which would ſave
your own lives, nor feed you where you are; but in love to
that which ſeperateth you from ſelf-life, and changeth you
into his life whom you wait for from above; ſo in receiving
his commands in that which loves to be like him in life, your
Faith works by love, and his Commands are joyous through
love: That Faith worketh obedience, quickneſs and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
it worketh out the old, and worketh into the new; and
ſo through the hope of that which you love, and obedience
of Faith, the entrance is made with the Life, into the holy
Kingdom, and the Immortal Glory is put on, which in the
Light is ſeen, and in the Life obtained, as with the Word of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29528:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Faith the ſeparation is made, and the Life that's Mortal put
off, whoſe Life is without the Vail, and is for death, with that
Life who makes the entrance through his Blood, and through
his Fleſh; a living Way, a Way of Life, a new Way to all who
are ſeeking the Door <hi>in old Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Traditions,</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Obſervations,</hi> feeding their minds with <hi>thinking</hi> or <hi>talking</hi>
of what <hi>others did</hi> long ſince, or what may <hi>be done</hi> in times to
come, and ſo are in <hi>Times,</hi> but out of <hi>that Life</hi> which endures
for ever, and onely hath the promiſe of the Father, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to make the entrance to him, from whom all the World
are driven, who are <hi>in the Luſt,</hi> and in that Nature <hi>which loves it
ſelf,</hi> and worketh iniquity; yet wearying themſelves to find
the Door, without the Light of that Life which is not of this
World.</p>
            <p>And as you mind onely to feed on the Plant of Life, you
will come to know the Work of the Father in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
and who the faithful Labourer is, and what muſt be his
Work; and the ſloathful ſervant, and what his Work bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth; and the cauſe why the field of the ſluggard is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-grown
<hi>with evil fruits,</hi> and why his Vine bringeth not
Fruit to perfection. For you will find many Plants beſides
the Tree of Life, all which ſeek to be fed and ſtrengthened
in the mind and affections, and many grown Trees tall and
ſtrong, which have got faſt rooting, ſpread and bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
after their ſeveral kinds; and all theſe preſent
themſelves to the eye of the mind, to be fed from thence,
which is as the feet, fetching food from far, without which
they cannot <hi>live long,</hi> but muſt <hi>pine away,</hi> and fall, as they dye
in the affections, and as the mind is withdrawn from ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
as they are fed withall. So the Work of him that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
is to number theſe <hi>to the Axe,</hi> and <hi>to the fire,</hi> and not to
ſuffer theſe <hi>any place</hi> in the mind, how ſtrongly ſoever they
tempt, and try every way to ſpread Root to keep life; that ſo
through the death of theſe, the Vine may grow alone in the
clean affections, and holy mind, and honeſt, chaſte heart,
which is the <hi>good ground,</hi> and where the pure Plant will bring
forth of it ſelf in all, where it is not cumbred with that which
is contrary to it; Which contrary fruits all that mind the
Light may ſee; but the ſluggard not being diligent to dig up
the <hi>Root,</hi> as well as to condemn the <hi>Fruit,</hi> therefore they are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29528:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
daily growing, and the good ground ever cumbred with
them; and ſuch ever know what they ſhould do, but are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to abide there, their life being loſt in the midſt of
this Wilderneſs, and over-grown with wild Plants.</p>
            <p>But you being diligent in your Watch, you will ſee that the
cauſe of all your troubles and confuſion (when you come to
the true labour indeed) is not for nothing; for you will
find many plants of ſeveral kinds (for the World is in the
heart of man, as he is droven from God) And every kind
hath its ſeveral life, which lives have their ſeveral feedings,
all which you may feel in the Light, by their temptings to
lead out your minds; and though they are of ſeveral motions,
and live upon ſeveral objects, yet the leaſt of them being fed
by conſent in your mind, will over-run the Vine, and in time
bury it, by growing up in your affections: Wherefore all muſt
down, that Truth alone may riſe in your affections, and the
Word of Life have place in your hearts, who is purer then to
dwell in the Adulterous minde, and whoſe eye cannot
behold iniquity, who hath no communion with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
nor fellowſhip where any Idol ſtands in the Temple.</p>
            <p>So this is your faith in your labour, even that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the World, and ſuffereth nothing thereof to take place
in your minds, but with the Spirit of Life to watch, and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
againſt <hi>every luſt,</hi> and kill <hi>every affection</hi> that would go out
for <hi>food;</hi> for what-ever goes out, betrayes the innocent; and
every pleaſure of the fleſh, as a Canker doth <hi>eat out the Life of
the holy and juſt one;</hi> but by Faith <hi>the Juſt lives,</hi> and in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>doth he judge,</hi> and make War againſt all his Enemies, in
every one who are exerciſed therewith.</p>
            <p>And in this Work, mind what you follow; follow nothing
raſhly, but prove all things with the fire; and that which will
not endure the Temptation, and bear the Croſs, is the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
who will look out every way for eaſe; and the Serpent
wil preſent many <hi>likely wayes</hi> to her under <hi>fair pretences,</hi> which
ſhe that would live at eaſe, will haſtily <hi>hearken to;</hi> and if you
hearken to her, you will betray the Work of Life, which
is bringing forth in hard travel and labour, which is flain in
the birth, where eaſe and ſloath is conſented to; and with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at eaſe and pleaſure, hath the Life been ſlain from the
beginning of the world, and hath been kept under by her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29528:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sorceries, who fares deliciouſly upon Earth; and by conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to her pleaſures hath the Election been loſt, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Seed of Wickedneſs, which God hates, which
Wars after the fleſh, and luſts after the fleſh, to ſtrengthen it
ſelf above the holy ſpiritual Seed; but minding to make that
ſure to you which calls in your mind, and being obedient
thereto, it will lead down by the Power of the Croſs, through
that which is above, to the feeling of the Election; and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
being made betwixt that which God chuſeth in this
Working-Power, and what he condemneth, you will come
thereby to know to what <hi>to join,</hi> and from what <hi>to withdraw,</hi>
that you may be Workers together <hi>with him,</hi> and not <hi>against
him,</hi> which the ſubtile one will lead you to do, till with the
Light the ſeparation be made; and ſo joining to it in faith
and obedience, the Election will ariſe, and by diligence
thereto it will be made ſure.</p>
            <p>And once feeling the Innocent to move under the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
give your ſelves <hi>no reſt</hi> until the ſtrong man bow; for with
great Plagues <hi>upon that Nature,</hi> and with a ſtrong hand <hi>againſt
that will</hi> muſt the Seed of Promiſe be redeemed from under
his Power, which like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> if he get but reſt, will not let
<hi>Iſrael</hi> go from under his Power; and if you keep with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and hearken low, it will let you ſee what muſt be the
Plagues you muſt pour upon him, till he be brought dovvn,
that a little Child may lead him, and reign over him; and
he that was oppreſſed by the Beaſt, may ride upon him: And
as that Nature got head and ſtrength by having its Luſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
ſo it muſt be ſubdued by having its Luſts <hi>famiſhed;</hi> which
if you be not faithful to the ſeed of God herein, you ſell your
Birth-right, and betray your own redemption, and are found
deceitful Workers againſt God and your own Souls.</p>
            <p>Wherefore run not with that which is in haſt, but lye
down in that which is meek, lovvly and patient, that vvhich
is vvilling to vvait the Fathers time, and ſeeks to obtain by
the obedience of Faith, and not in the Will that vvould have
in its ovvn hand; For a Nature there is vvhich runs out for
help, and raveneth abroad to be ſatisfied, vvhich God vvill
famiſh; And this vvill ſeek to lead the mind, if it be follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

<hi>hast,</hi> vvhich is its firſt vvay after Convincement; Or elſe vvhen
it gets not its ends there, then into <hi>ſloth</hi> and <hi>idle careleſneſs,</hi> and
both theſe keep it alive in ſtrength above the Seed; but a ſtraight
Way there is betvvixt theſe, in vvhich the Seed ariſeth, vvhich is

onely the diligent mind holdeth the true living Treaſure; but
the ſloathful and diſobedient are leaking Veſſels.</p>
            <p>So as wiſe in the Light, prove your Freedom, from that nature
which is <hi>high,</hi> and <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>haſty,</hi> or any way above the <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
for therein ſtands your perfect Redemption to know that,
that you are not ſervants to that nature; for it's the ſame that
haſteth into the greedineſs after worldly things, and fears, and
diſtruſts, if it hath not in its ſight and poſſeſſion what it luſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which being convinced of an inheritance in heaven, would
have that alſo in all haſt by Sight; but not through Faith, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and obedience; which if it may not obtain into its own
ſight, and in its own way and time, it will be ready to faint and
diſtruſt, and this will never ſtrip himſelf of all, in hopes of an
inheritance it hath not ſeen; ſo this is in Bondage, and not to be
Heir; <hi>but the juſt live by Faith,</hi> whoſe Birth <hi>is free</hi> from this
World, &amp; your redemption from the other into the leadings of
this, wchwil bring to the inheritance of the purchaſed poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore prove your Freedom in all things, that you may
not glory in vain, but in the Liberty of ſons; Do not ſay; <hi>All
things are lawful, all things are pure, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo ſit dovvn and ſay,
<hi>You are redeemed, and have right to all;</hi> but firſt paſſe through <hi>all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29528:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things,</hi> one after another, as the Light leadeth you; and with
a true meaſure ſee, if you be from under the power of any;
when you have proved this throughout all things, and found
your freedom, then may you ſay, <hi>All things are lawful,</hi> and
know <hi>what is expedient,</hi> and what edifies your ſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the Reſt to reign over, without Bondage thereto:
And this is the Liberty of the Sons of the new Creation,
born again, not in Bondage; whoſe Liberty is glorious above
all created things; and <hi>theſe are the pure,</hi> to whom all things <hi>are
pure,</hi> who have proved all things with that which is pure, and
hold faſt onely that which is good, and the reſt are free from.</p>
            <p>And this ever mind, That whatever Freedom you obtain
through the ſufferings and patience of Chriſt in Spirit, you
part not with it to pleaſe the fleſh, but hold it as your everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poſſeſſion purchaſed for you, <hi>not with corruptible things;</hi> ſo
that which is <hi>dearly purchaſed,</hi> let not <hi>lightly go;</hi> but remember
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> who was redeemed out of <hi>Aegypt with much hardſhips,</hi>
and <hi>many ſigns</hi> and <hi>ſufferings,</hi> but ſoon in haſt got up that which
ſaid, <hi>Let us return back again;</hi> and this grieved God above all:
And this you will find ready to riſe upon every further hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and want, as it was with them. Wherefore ſtand faſt in
that which you have proved to be Liberty indeed, and by no
means look back nor hearken to that which is behind, to let
it overtake you again: Remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; and the
Wrath of God will ever be upon that mind which looks back
into old things, which are judged in the Light, and led out
of with the Life: Wherefore ſtand ſingle in your mindes to
follow nothing <hi>new</hi> or <hi>old,</hi> but what the Holy Spirit leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
for the Work is a Work you know not, nor the Way you
know not, but as it is learned in the obedience by which the
Soul is purified and cleared by purging out the <hi>old Earthly
Leaven,</hi> which hath darkned the Temple of God, and God's
Work is not ſeen in that Nature.</p>
            <p>Wherefore give all diligence to the Spirit's motion &amp; lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
what it moves againſt, and what it leades to; for now wil
God make all things <hi>new; A new Creation, new Heavens,</hi> and
<hi>new Earth,</hi> and <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> and a <hi>new Law,</hi> a <hi>new
Man to walk therein with his Maker with chearfulneſs,</hi> as the old
Bonds are broken by the Spirits leading, and to ſerve in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29528:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Spirit. And as you mind the pure Leadings of the
Spirit, and willingly follow and obey, you will come to know
your Creator in the dayes of your youth, and how he makes
the Worlds by the Word of his Holineſs; and how he is your
Father, and in what; and how he begets you again into the
Heavenly Delights, who was gone out from him, and drove
into the Earth with your hearts and affections, and ſo thoſe
will lead out ſtill further from God, if you look into them,
but can never come into God again, but muſt dye, and be
changed by the Spirit; and the new Creature is accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, the new Heart, and Mind, and Spirit, which is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after God, by following of his Spirit who createth him.</p>
            <p>And this Work will be darkned to your underſtanding, if
your minds come not clear <hi>out of the old,</hi> into <hi>the new:</hi> For
Wrath will ariſe, and confuſion will be to that mind which
is double, where the eye is not ſingle, kept forward in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Spirit onely, but looks back into the loſs, and to
that which is dying and condemned; there is the <hi>ſmoke,</hi> and
<hi>darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> and <hi>temptations,</hi> being enticed back into
the old; but if the eye be ſingle, the whole body is full of
Light, and the Faith ariſeth to endure to the end of the world,
and to look to the beginning and finiſhing of the new Work
of Regeneration. And ſtanding ſingle to God herein, though
the World paſs away with Thundering, Earth-quakes, and a
mighty Noiſe, yet ſhall ye not fear nor faint, abiding in the
meek, patient, and ſuffering-ſpirit, and the leadings of that
which endureth all things to win Chriſt: And coming out of
<hi>Babel,</hi> you ſhall not fall with her, nor be darkned with the
ſmoke of her torments, as all that abide in her muſt, and of
her Plagues muſt partake; but the pure mind rejoiceth over
her in midſt of all.</p>

            <p>IT is in my heart to praiſe thee, O my God; let me never forget thee what thou haſt
been to me in the Night by thy Preſence, in the Day of Trial when I was beſet in
darkneſs, when I was caſt out as a wandring bird, and when I was aſſaulted with
ſtrong Temptations, then thy preſence in ſecret did preſerve me, and in a low eſtate
I felt thee near me, when the floods ſought to ſweep me away, thou ſet'ſt a compaſs for
them how far they ſhould paſs over; when my way was through the Sea, and when I
paſſed under the Mountains, there wer't thou preſent with me, when the weight of
the hills was upon me thou upheldſt me, elſe had I ſunk under the earth, when I was
as one altogether helpleſs, when tribulation and anguiſh was upon me day and night,
and the Earth without foundation; when I went on the way of wrath, and paſſed
by the gates of hell; when all comforts ſtood afar off, and he that is mine enemy had
dominion; when I was caſt into the pit, and was as one appointed to death; when
I was between the milſtones, and as one cruſhed with the weight of his adverſary:
as a father thou wer't with me, and the rock of thy preſence when the mouth of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
roared againſt me, and fear took hold on my ſoul in the pit, then I called upon
thee in the night, and my cries were ſtrong before thee daily; thou anſweredſt me from
thy habitation, and delivered from thy dwelling place, ſaying, I will ſet thee above

all thy fears, and lift up thy feet above the head of oppreſſi in: I believed, and was
ſtrengthened, and thy word was ſalvation: Thou didſt fight on my part when I
wreſtled with death, and when darkneſs would have ſhut me up, then the light ſhone
about me, and thy banner was over my head; when my work was in the furnace, and
as I paſſed through the fiery ſpirits, thy faith ſtaied me, elſe through fear I had fallen;
I ſaw thee, and believed, ſo the enemy could not prevail: VVhen I lookt back into
thy work I was aſtoniſhed, and ſee no end of thy praiſes: Glory, glory to thee, ſaith
my ſoul, and let my heart be ever filled with thankſgiving; whilſt thy works remain
they ſhall ſhew forth thy power: then didſt thou lay the foundation of the earth, and
feddeſt me under the waters, and in the deeps didſt thou ſhew me wonders; and the
forming of the world by thy hand: Thou leaſt me in ſafety, till thou ſhewedſt me the
pillars of the earth; then did the heavens ſhower down, they were covered with
darkneſs, and the powers thereof were ſhaken, and thy glory deſcended; thou fill'dſt
the lower parts of the Earth with gladneſs, and the valley was opened, thy ſhowers
deſcended abundantly, ſo the Earth was fill'd with virtues. Thou madeſt thy Plant
to ſpring, and the thirſty ſoul became as a watered Garden: then didſt thou lift me
out of the pit, and ſet me forth in the ſight of mine enemy; thou proclaimedſt liberty
to the captive, and called my acquaintance near me, they to whom I have been a
wonder; and in thy love I obtained favour in thoſe who had forſaken me; then did
gladneſs ſwallow up ſorrow, and I forſook all my troubles. And how good is it that
man be proved in the night, that he may know his ſafety, that every mouth may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

But that is the Child of his Love, and Son of his

Eternal Reſt, and Quietneſs ſhall fill thy dwelling, and the
God of Peace and Holineſs will delight in thee, and in the
end thy Fruit ſhall break out, and thou ſhalt not long be hid,
but thy God in whom thou delighteſt, ſhall cover thee with

the ſelf ended Spirit will wither, and that which lifts up it
ſelf, will fall to nothing; and back-biters, and whiſperers, and

who hath ſought his praiſe from God, and not from men;
Therefore take heed to your ſpirits in Gods fear, and keep

Wherefore dearly beloved in my ſoul, above what I can write,
this I lay upon every one of you in particular, and warn you,
That you prove and examine your ſelves herein, what ſpirit

Spirit which ſteals your minds into earthly things, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

works after the power of the Prince of the Air; and in this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
all have fellowſhip with the world, &amp; are in the Power wch

ſerve God, nor have fellowſhip with him in the Light; for it
is carnal and devilliſh, and ſhut out from God the Father of
Light, and ſo becomes a Vagabond, wandering, chaffie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not capable of God's Counſel nor Service; nor can you
have fellowſhip with the Brethren in the Light and Power of

this muſt be judged in every motion of it, that it may be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and put under foot, leſt being once enlightened, you

you faithful to God who judgeth you, and gird up the loyns

you may be born thereof, and rule therein over your ſelves,
and ſo overcome the world, that you may walk at liberty in
