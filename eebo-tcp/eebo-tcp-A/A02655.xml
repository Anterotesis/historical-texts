         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <salute>TO THE ADVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRERS, FAVORERS, AND VVELVVILLERS OF THE EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERPRISE FOR THE INHABITTING and planting in Virginia.</salute>
            <p>Since the first vndertaking by Sir Walter Ralegh to deale in the action of discouering of that Countrey which is now called and known by the name of <hi>Virginia;</hi> many voyages hauing bin thiter made at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times to his great charge; as first in the yeere 1584. and afterwardes in the yeeres 1585. 1586. and now of late this last yeare of 1587. There ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bin diuers and variable reportes with some slaunderous and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full speeches bruited abroade by many that returned from thence. Especially of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery which was made by the Colony transported by Sir Richard Greinuile in the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re 1585. being of all the others the most principal and as yet of most effect, the time of their abode in the countrey beeing a whole yeare, when as in the other voyage before they staied but sixe weekes; and the others after were onelie for supply and transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing more being discouered then had been before. Which reports haue not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne a litle wrong to many that otherwise would haue also fauoured &amp; aduentured in the action, to the honour and benefite of our nation, besides the particular profite and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te which would redound to them selues the dealers therein; as I hope by the sequele of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents to the shame of those that haue auouched the contrary shalbe manifest: if you the aduenturers, fauourers, and welwillers do but either encrease in number, or in opinion continue, or hauing bin doubtfull renewe your good liking and furtherance to deale therein according to the worthinesse thereof alreadye found and as you shall vnderstand hereafter to be requisite. Touching which woorthines through cause of the diuersitie of relations and reportes, manye of your opinions coulde not bee firme, nor the mindes of some that are well disposed, bee setled in any certaintie.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore thought it good beeing one that haue beene in the discouerie and in dealing with the naturall inhabitantes specially imploied; and hauing therefore seene and knowne more then the ordinarie: to imparte so much vnto you of the fruites of our labours, as that you may knowe howe iniuriously the enterprise is slaundered. And that in publike manner at this present chiefelie for two respectes.</p>
            <p>First that some of you which are yet ignorant or doubtfull of the state thereof, may see that there is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause why the cheefe enterpriser with the fauour of her Maiestie, notwithstanding suche reportes; hath not onelie since continued the action by sending into the countrey againe, and replanting this last yeere a new Colony; but is also readie, according as the times and meanes will affoorde, to follow and prosecute the same.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you seeing and knowing the continuance of the action by the view hereof you may generally know &amp; learne what the countrey is, &amp; ther vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider how your dealing therein if it proceede, may returne you profit and gaine; bee it either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitting &amp; planting or otherwise in furthering thereof.</p>
            <p>And least that the substance of my relation should be doubtful vnto you, as of others by reason of their diuersitie: I will first open the cause in a few wordes wherefore they are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6773:5"/>so different; referring my selue to your fauourable constructions, and to be adiudged of as by good consideration you shall finde cause.</p>
            <p>Of our companie that returned some for their misdemenour and ill dealing in the countrey, haue beene there worthily punished; who by reason of their badde natures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue maliciously not onelie spoken ill of their Gouernours; but for their sakes slaundered the countrie it selfe. The like also haue those done which were of their consort.</p>
            <p>Some beeing ignorant of the state thereof, notwithstanding since their returne amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest their friendes and acquaintance and also others, especially if they were in compaine where they might not be gainesaide; woulde seeme to knowe so much as no men more; and make no men so great trauailers as themselues. They stood so much as it maie seeme vppon their credite and reputation that hauing been a twelue moneth in the countrey, it woulde haue beene a great disgrace vnto them as they thought, if they coulde not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue saide much wheter it were true or false. Of which some haue spoken of more then euer they saw or otherwise knew to bee there; othersome haue not bin ashamed to make ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute deniall of that which although not by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet by others is most certainely a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifully knowne. And othersome make difficulties of those things they haue no skill of.</p>
            <p>The cause of their ignorance was, in that they were of that many that were neuer out of the Iland where wee were seated, or not farre, or at the leastwise in few places els, during the time of our aboade in the countrey; or of that many that after golde and siluer was not so soone found, as it was by them looked for, had little or no care of any other thing but to pamper their bellies; or of that many which had little vnderstanding, lesse discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more tongue then was needfull or requisite.</p>
            <p>Some also were of a nice bringing vp, only in cities or townes, or such as neuer (as I may say) had seene the world before. Because there were not to bee found any English cities, nor such faire houses, nor at their owne wish any of their olde accustomed daintie food, nor any soft beds of downe or fethers: the countrey was to them miserable, &amp; their reports thereof according.</p>
            <p>Because my purpose was but in briefe to open the cause of the varietie of such spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; the particularities of them, and of many enuious, malicious, and slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous reports and deuises els, by our owne countrey men besides; as trifles that are not worthy of wise men to bee thought vpon, I meane not to trouble you withall: but will passe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, the substance of that which I haue to make relation of vnto you.</p>
            <p>The treatise where of for your more readie view &amp; easier vnderstanding I will diuide into three speciall parts. In the first I will make declaration of such commodities there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie found or to be raised, which will not onely serue the ordinary turnes of you which are and shall bee the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters and inhabitants, but such an ouerplus sufficiently to bee yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or by men of skill to bee prouided, as by way of trafficke and exchaunge with our ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nation of England, will enrich your selues the prouiders; those that shal deal with you; the enterprisers in general; and greatly profit our owne countrey men, to supply them with most things which heretofore they haue bene faine to prouide, either of strangers or of our enemies: which commodities for distinction sake, I call <hi>Merchantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the second, I will set downe all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities which wee know the countrey by our experience doeth yeld of it selfe for victuall, and sustenance of mans life; such as is vsually fed vpon by the inhabitants of the countrey, as also by vs during the time we were there.</p>
            <p>In the last part I will make mention generally of such other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities besides, as I am able to remember, and as I shall thinke behoofull for those that shall inhabite, and plant there to knowe of; which specially concerne building, as also some other necessary vses: with a briefe description of the nature and maners of the people of the countrey.</p>

                  <head>THE FIRST PART, OF MARCHAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TABLE COMMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DITIES.</head>
                  <div type="commodity">
                     <head>Silke of grasse or grasse Silke.</head>
                     <p>There is a kind of grasse in the countrey vppon the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des where of there groweth very good silke in forme of a thin glittering skin to bee stript of. It groweth two foote and a halfe high or better: the blades are about two foot in length, and half inch broad. The like gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in Persia, which is in the selfe same climate as Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, of which very many of the silke workes that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me from thence into Europe are made. Here of if it be planted and ordered as in Persia, it cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be otherwise, but that there will rise in shorte time great profite to the dealers therein; seeing there is so great vse and vent thereof as well in our countrey as els where. And by the meanes of sowing &amp; pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting in good ground, it will be farre greater, better, and more plentifull then it is. Although not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there is great store thereof in many places of the countrey growing naturally and wilde. Which also by proof here in England, in making a piece of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Grogran, we found to be excellent good.</p>

                     <p>In manie of our iourneyes we found silke wormes fayre and great; as bigge as our ordinary walnuttes. Although it hath not beene our happe to haue found such plentie as elsew here to be in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey wehaue heard of; yet seeing that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey doth naturally breede and nourish them, there is no doubt but if art be added
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6773:7"/>in plantig of mulbery trees and others fitte for them in commodious places, for their feeding and nourishing; and some of them carefully gathered and husbanded in that sort as by men of skill is knowne to be necessarie: there will rise as great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in time to the Virginians, as there of doth now to the Persians, Turkes, Italians and Spaniards.</p>

                     <head>Flaxe and Hempe.</head>
                     <p>The trueth is that of Hempe and Flaxe there is no great store in any one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce together, by reason it is not planted but as the soile doth yeeld it of it selfe; and howsoeuer the leafe, and stemme or stalke doe differ from ours; the stuffe by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of men of skill is altogether as good as ours. And if not, as further proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe should finde otherwise; we haue that experience of the soile, as thas there canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee shewed anie reason to the contrary, but that it will grow there excellent well; and by planting will be yeelded plentifully: seeing there is so much ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some may well be applyed to such purposes. What benefite heereof may growe in cordage and linnens who can not easily vnderstand?</p>

                     <p>There is a veine of earth along the sea coast for the space of fourtie or fiftie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, whereof by the iudgement of some that haue made triall heerein England, is made good Allum, of that kinde which is called Roche Allum. The richnesse of such a commoditie is so well knowne that I neede not to saye any thing thereof. The same earth doth also yeelde White Copresse, Nitrum, and Alumen Plume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, but nothing so plentifully as the common Allum; which be also of price and profitable.</p>

And first of such as are sowed and husbanded.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pagatowr,</hi> a kinde of graine so called by the inhabitants; the same in the West Indies is called <hi>Mayze</hi>: English men call it Guinney wheate or Turkie wheate, according to the names of the countreys from whence the like hath beene brought. The graine is about the bignesse of our ordinary English peaze and not much different in forme and shape: but of diuers colours: some white, some red, some yellow, and some blew. All of them yeelde a very white and sweete flowre: beeing vsed according to his kinde it maketh a very good bread. Wee made of the same in the countrey some mault, whereof was brued as good ale as was to bee desired. So likewise by the help of hops therof may bee made as good Beere. It is a graine of marueilous great increase; of a thousand, fifteene hundred and some two thousand fold. There are three sortes, of which two are ripe in an eleuen and twelue weekes at the most: sometimes in ten, after the time they are set, and are then of height in stalke about sixe or seuen foote. The other sort is ripe in fourtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and is about ten foote high, of the stalkes some beare foure heads, some three, some one, and two: euery head co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining fiue, sixe, or seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred graines within a fewe more or lesse. Of these graines besides bread, the inhabitants make victuall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6773:13"/>eyther by parching them; or seething them whole vntill they be broken; or boyling the floure with water into a pappe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Okindgíer,</hi> called by vs <hi>Beanes,</hi> because in greatnesse &amp; partly in shape they are like to the Beanes in England; sauing that they are flatter, of more diuers colours, and some pide. The leafe also of the stemme is much different. In taste they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as good as our English peaze.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wickonzówr,</hi> called by vs <hi>Peaze,</hi> in respect of the beanes for distinction sake, because they are much lesse; although in forme they little differ; but in goodnesse of tast much, &amp; are far better then our English peaze. Both the beanes and peaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ripe in tenne weekes after they are set. They make them victuall either by boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them all to pieces into a broth; or boiling them whole vntill they bee soft and beginne to breake as is vsed in England, eyther by themselues or mixtly together: Sometime they mingle of the wheate with them. Sometime also beeing whole soddeu, they bruse or pound them in a morter, &amp; thereof make loaues or lumps of dowishe bread, which they vse to eat for varietie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Macócqwer,</hi> according to their seuerall formes called by vs, <hi>Pompions, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,</hi> and <hi>Gourdes,</hi> because they are of the like formes as those kindes in England. In <hi>Virginia</hi> such of seuerall formes are of one taste and very good, and do also spring from one seed. There are of two sorts; one is ripe in the space of a moneth, and the other in two moneths.</p>
                  <p>There is an hearbe which in Dutch is called <hi>Melden.</hi> Some of those that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it vnto, take it to be a kinde of Orage; it groweth about foure or fiue foote high: of the seede thereof they make a thicke broth, and pottage of a very good ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste: of the stalke by burning into ashes they make a kinde of salt earth, wherewithall many vse sometimes to season their brothes; other salte they knowe not. Wee our seiues, vsed the leaues also for pothearbes.</p>
                  <p>There is also another great heaŕbe in forme of a Marigolde, ahout sixe foote in height; the head with the floure is a spanne in breadth. Some take it to bee <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Solis</hi>: of the seedes heereof they make both a kinde of bread and broth.</p>
                  <p>All the aforesaide commodities for victuall are set or sowed, sometimes in groundes a part and seuerally by themselues; but for the most part together in one ground mixtly: the manner thereof with the dressing and preparing of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, because I will note vnto you the fertilitie of the soile; I thinke good briefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.</p>
                  <p>The ground they neuer fatten with mucke, dounge or any other thing; neither plow nor digge it as we in England, but onely prepare it in sort as followeth. A fewe daies before they sowe or set, the men with wooden instruments, made almost in forme of mattockes or hoes with long handles; the women with short peckers or parers, because they vse them sitting, of a foote long and about fiue inches in bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adth: doe onely breake the vpper part of the ground to rayse vp the weedes, gras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, &amp; old stubbes of corne stalkes with their rootes. The which after a day or twoes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6773:14"/>drying in the Sunne, being scrapte vp into many small heapes, to saue them labour for carrying them away; they burne into ashes. (And whereas some may thinke that they vse the ashes for to better the grounde; I say that then they woulde eyther disperse the ashes abroade; which wee obserued they doe not, except the heapes bee too great: or els would take speciall care to set their corne where the ashes lie, which also wee finde they are carelesse of.) And this is all the husbanding of their ground that they vse.</p>
                  <p>Then their setting or sowing is after this maner. First for their corne, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in one corner of the plot, with a pecker they make a hole, wherein they put foure graines with that care they touch not one another, (about an inch asunder) and couer them with the moulde againe: and so through out the whole plot, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such holes and vsing them after such maner: but with this regard that they bee made in rankes, euery ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke differing from other halfe a fadome or a yarde, and the holes also in euery ranke, as much. By this meanes there is a yarde spare ground betwene euery hole: where according to discretion here and there, they set as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Beanes and Peaze: in diuers places also among the seedes of <hi>Macócqwer, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and <hi>Planta Solis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground being thus set according to the rate by vs experimented, an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Acre conteining fourtie pearches in length, and foure in breadth, doeth there yeeld in croppe or ofcome of corne, beanes, and peaze, at the least two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don bushelles: besides the <hi>Macócqwer, Melden,</hi> and <hi>Planta Solis.</hi> When as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land fourtie bushelles of our wheate yeelded out of such an acre is thought to be much.</p>
                  <p>I thought also good to note this vnto you, if you which shall inhabite and plant there, maie know how specially that countrey corne is there to be preferred before ours: Besides the manifold waies in applying it to victuall, the increase is so much that small labour and paines is needful in respect that must be vsed for ours. For this I can assure you that according to the rate we haue made proofe of, one man may prepare and husbane so much grounde (hauing once borne corne before) with lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foure and twentie houres labour, as shall yeelde him victuall in a large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a twelue mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eth, if hee haue nothing else, but that which the same grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d will yeelde, and of that kinde onelie which I haue before spoken of: the saide grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d being also but of fiue and twentie yards square. And if neede require, but that there is ground enough, there might be raised out of one and the selfsame ground two haruestes or ofcomes; for they sowe or set and may at anie time when they thinke good from the middest of March vntill the ende of Iune: so that they also set when they haue eaten of their first croppe. In some places of the countrey notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they haue two haruests, as we haue heard, out of one and the same ground.</p>
                  <p>For English corne neuertheles whether to vse or not to vse it, you that inhabite maie do as you shall haue farther cause to thinke best. Of the grouth you need not to doubt: for barlie, oates and peaze, we haue seene proof of, not beeing purposely
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6773:15"/>sowen but fallen casually in the worst sort of ground, and yet to be as faire as any we haue euer seene here in England. But of wheat because it was musty and hat taken salt water wee could make no triall: and of rye we had none. Thus much haue I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed and I hope not vnnecessarily: nowe will I returne againe to my course and intreate of that which yet remaineth appertaining to this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>There is an herbe which is sowed a part by it selfe &amp; is called by the inhabitants Vppówoc: In the West Indies it hath diuers names, according to the seuerall places &amp; countries where it groweth and is vsed: The Spaniardes generally call it Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co. The leaues thereof being dried and brought into powder: they vse to take the fume or smoke thereof by sucking it through pipes made of claie into their stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cke and heade;from whence it purgeth superfluous fleame &amp; other grosse humors, openeth all the pores &amp; passages of the body: by which meanes the vse thereof, not only preserueth the body from obstructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; but also if any be, so that they haue not beene of too long continuance, in short time breaketh them:wherby their bodies are notably preserued in health, &amp; know not many greeuous diseases wherewithall wee in England are oftentimes afflicted.</p>
                  <p>This Vppówoc is of so precious estimation amongest then, that they thinke their gods are maruelously delighted therwith: Wherupon sometime they make hallowed fires &amp; cast some of the pouder therein for a sacrifice: being in a storme vppon the waters, to pacifie their gods, they cast some vp into the aire and into the water: so a weare for fish being newly set vp, they cast some therein and into the ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: also after an escape of danger, they cast some into the aire likewise: but all done with strange gestures, stamping, somtime dauncing, clapping of hands, holding vp of hands, &amp; staring vp into rhe heauens, vttering therewithal and chattering stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge words &amp; noises.</p>
                  <p>We our selues during the time we were there vsed to suck it after their maner, as also since our returne, &amp; haue found maine rare and wonderful experiments of the vertues thereof; of which the relation woulde require a volume by it selfe: the vse of it by so manie of late, men &amp; women of great calling as else, and some learned Phisitions also, is sufficient witnes.</p>
                  <p>And these are all the commodities for sustenance of life that I know and can remember they vse to husband: all else that followe are founde growing naturally or wilde.</p>

                  <head>THE THIRD AND LAST PART, OF SVCH OTHER THINGES AS IS BE HOO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for those which shall plant and inhabit to know of; with a description of the nature and manners of the people of the countrey.</head>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of commodities for building and other necessary vses.</head>
                     <p>Those other things which I am more to make rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of, are such as concerne building, and other mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall necessarie vses; as diuers sortes of trees for house &amp; ship timber, and other vses els: Also lime, stone, and brick, least that being not mentioned some might ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene doubted of, or by some that are malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the contrary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Okes,</hi> there are as faire, straight, tall, and as good timber as any can be, and also great store, and in some places very great.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Walnut trees,</hi> as I haue saide before very many, some haue bene seen excellent faire timber of foure &amp; fiue fadome, &amp; aboue fourescore foot streight without bough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firre trees</hi> fit for masts of ships, some very tall &amp; great.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:6773:22"/>
                        <hi>Rakíock,</hi> a kind of trees so called that are sweet wood of which the inhabitans that were neere vnto vs doe commonly make their boats or Canoes of the form of trowes; only with the helpe of fire, harchets of stones, and shels; we haue known so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me so great being made in that sort of one tree that they haue carried well xx. men at once, besides much baggage: the timber being great, tal, streight, soft, light, &amp; yet tough enough I thinke (besides other vses) to be fit also for masts of ships.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cedar,</hi> a sweet wood good for seelings, Chests, Boxes, Bedsteedes, Lutes, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, and many things els, as I haue also said before. Some of our company which haue wandered in some places where I haue not bene, haue made certaine affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cyprus</hi> which for such and other excellent vses, is also a wood of price and no small estimation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maple,</hi> and also <hi>Wich-hazle,</hi> wherof the inhabitants vse to make their bowes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Holly</hi> a necessary thing for the making of birdlime.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Willowes</hi> good for the making of weares and weeles to take fish after the English manner, although the inhabitants vse only reedes, which because they are so strong as also flexible, do serue for that turne very well and sufficiently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beech</hi> and <hi>Ashe,</hi> good for caske, hoopes: and if neede require, plow worke, as also for many things els.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Elme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sassafras</hi> trees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ascopo</hi> a kinde of tree very like vnto Lawrell, the barke is hoat in tast and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, it is very like to that tree which Monardus describeth to bee <hi>Cassia Lignea</hi> of the West Indies.</p>
                     <p>There are many other strange trees whose names I knowe not but in the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> language, of which I am not nowe able, neither is it so conuenient for the present to trouble you with particular relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: seeing that for timber and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceslary vses I haue named sufficient: And of many of the rest but that they may be applied to good vse, I know no cause to doubt.</p>
                     <p>Now for Stone, Bricke and Lime, thus it is. Neere vnto the Sea coast where weedwelt, there are no kinde of stones to bee found (except a fewe small pebbles about foure miles off) but such as haue bene brought from farther out of the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. In some of our voiages wee haue seene diuers hard raggie stones, great pebbles, and a kinde of grey stone like vnto marble, of which the inhabitants make their hatchets to cleeue wood. Vpon inquirie wee heard that a little further vp into the Countrey were of all sortes verie many, although of Quarries they are ignorant, neither haue they vse of any store whereupon they should haue occasion to seeke any. For if euerie housholde haue one or two to cracke Nuttes, grinde shelles, whet copper, and sometimes other stones for hatchets, they haue enough: neither vse they any digging, but onely for graues about three foote deepe: and therefore no maruaile that they know neither Quarries, nor lime stones, which both may bee in places neerer than they wot of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:6773:23"/>In the meane time vntill there bee discouerie of sufficient store in some place or other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, the want of you which are and shalbe the planters therein may be as well supplied by Bricke: for the making whereofin diuers places of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey there is clay both excellent good, and plentie; and also by lime made of Oister shels, and of others burnt, after the maner as they vse in the Iles of Tenet and She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and also in diuers other places of England: Which kinde of lime is well knowne to bee as good as any other. And of Oister shels there is plentie enough: for besides diuers other particular places where are abundance, there is one shallowe sounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the coast, where for the space of many miles together in lenght, and two or three miles in breadth, the grounde is nothing els beeing but halfe a foote or a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te vnder water for the most part.</p>
                     <p>This much can I say further more of stones, that about 120. miles from our fort neere the water in the side of a hill was founde by a Gentleman of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a great veine of hard ragge stones, which I thought good to remember vnto you.</p>

                     <head>Of the nature and manners of the people</head>
                     <p>It resteth I speake a word or two of the naturall inhabitants, their natures and maners, leauing large discourse thereof vntill time more conuenient hereafter: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we onely so farre foorth, as that you may know, how that they in respect of troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our inhabiting and planting, are not to be feared; but that they shall haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se both to feare and loue vs, that shall inhabite with them.</p>
                     <p>They are a people clothed with loose mantles made of Deere skins, &amp; aprons of the same rounde about their middles; all els naked; of such a difference of statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res only as wee in England; hauing no edge tooles or weapons of yron or steele to offend vs withall, neither know they how to make any: those weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, are onlie bowes made of Witch hazle, &amp; arrowes of reeds; flat edged trunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also of wood about a yard long, neither haue they any thing to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues but targets made of barcks; and some armours made of stickes wickered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thread.</p>
                     <p>Their townes are but small, &amp; neere the sea coast but few, some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taining but 10. or 12. houses: some 20. the greatest that we haue seene haue bene but of 30. hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:if they be walled it is only done with barks of trees made fast to stakes, or els with poles onely fixed vpright and close one by another.</p>
                     <p>Their houses are made of small poles made fast at the tops in rounde forme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner as is vsed in many arbories in our gardens of England, in most tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes couered with barkes, and in some with artificiall mattes made of long rushes; from the tops of the houses downe to the ground. The length of them is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double to the breadth, in some places they are but 12. and 16. yardes long, and in other some wee haue seene of foure and twentie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:6773:24"/>In some places of the countrey one onely towne belongeth to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Wiróans</hi> or chiefe Lorde; in other some two or three, in some sixe, eight, &amp; more; the greatest <hi>Wiróans</hi> that yet we had dealing with had but eighteene tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and able to make not aboue seuen or eight hundred fighting men at the most: The language of euery gouernment is different from any other and the farther they are distant the greater is the difference.</p>
                     <p>Their maner of warres amongst themselues is either by sudden surprising one an other most commonly about the dawning of the day, or moone light; or elsby ambushes, or some suttle deuises: Set battels are very rare, except it fall out where there are many trees, where eyther part may haue some hope of defence, after the deliuerie of euery arrow, in leaping behind some or other.</p>
                     <p>If there fall out any warres betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs &amp; them, what their fight is likely to bee, we hauing aduantages against them so many maner of waies, as by our discipline, our strange weapons and deuises els; especially by ordinance great and small, it may be easily imagined; by the experience we haue had in some places, the turning vs of their heeles against vs in running away was their best defence.</p>
                     <p>In respect of vs they are a people poore, and for want of skill and iudgement in the knowledge and vse of our things, doe esteeme our trifles before thinges of greater value: Notwithstanding in their proper manner considering the want of such meanes as we haue, they seeme very ingenious; For although they haue no such tooles, nor any such craftes, sciences and artes as wee; yet in those thinges they doe, they shewe excellencie of wit. And by howe much they vpon due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall finde our manner of knowledges and craftes to exceede theirs in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and speed for doing or execution, by so much the more is it probable that they shoulde desire our friendships &amp; loue, and haue the greater respect for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and obeying vs. Whereby may bee hoped if meanes of good gouernment bee vsed, that they may in short time be brought to ciuilitie, and the imbracing of true religion.</p>
                     <p>Some religion they haue alreadie, which although it be farre from the truth, yet beyng at it is, there is hope it may bee the easier and sooner reformed.</p>
                     <p>They beleeue that there are many Gods which they call <hi>Mantóac,</hi> but of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sortes and degrees; one onely chiefe and great God, which hath bene from all eternitie. Who as they affirme when hee purposed to make the worlde, made first other goddes of a principall order to bee as meanes and instruments to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the creation and gouernment to follow; and after the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, as pettie goddes and the instruments of the other order more principall. First they say were made waters, out of which by the gods was made all diuersitie of creatures that are visible or inuisible.</p>
                     <p>For mankind they say a woman was made first, which by the woorking of one of the goddes, conceiued and brought foorth children: And in such sort they say they had their beginning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:6773:25"/>But how manie yeeres or ages haue passed since, they say they can make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, hauing no letters nor other such meanes as we to keepe recordes of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities of times past, but onelie tradition from father to sonne.</p>
                     <p>They thinke that all the gods are of humane shape, &amp; therfore they represent them by images in the formes of men, which they call <hi>Kewasowok</hi> one alone is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Kewás</hi>; Them they place in houses appropriate or temples which they call <hi>Mathicómuck</hi>; Where they woorship, praie, sing, and make manie times offerings vnto them. In some <hi>Machicómuck</hi> we haue seene but on <hi>Kewas,</hi> in some two, and in other some three; The common sort thinke them to be also gods.</p>
                     <p>They beleeue also the immortalitie of the soule, that after this life as soone as the soule is departed fiom the bodie according to the workes it hath done, it is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the habitacle of gods, there to enioy perpetuall blisse and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, or els to a great pitte or hole, which they thinke to bee in the furthest partes of their part of the worlde towarde the sunne set, there to burne continually: the place they call <hi>Popogusso.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the confirmation of this opinion, they tolde mee two stories of two men that had been lately dead and reuiued againe, the one happened but few yeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our comming in the countrey of a wicked man which hauing beene dead and buried, the next day the earth of the graue beeing seene to moue, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; Who made declaration where his soule had beene, that is to saie very neere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Popogusso,</hi> had not one of the gods saued him &amp; gaue him leaue to retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne againe, and teach his friends what they should doe to auoid that terrible place of tormenr.</p>
                     <p>The other happened in the same yeere wee were there, but in a towne that was threescore miles from vs, and it was tolde mee for straunge newes that one beeing dead, buried and taken vp againe as the first, shewed that although his bodie had lien dead in the graue, yet his soule was aliue, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd had trauailed farre in a long broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de waie, on both sides whereof grewe most delicate and pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t trees, bearing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re rare and excellent fruites then euer hee had seene before or was able to expresse, and at length came to most braue and faire houses, neere which hee met his father, that had beene dead before, who gaue him great charge to goe backe againe and shew his friendes what good they were to doe to enioy the pleasures of that place, which when he had done he should after come againe.</p>
                     <p>What subtilty soeuer be in the <hi>Wiroances</hi> and Priestes, this opinion worketh so much in manie of the common and simple sort of people that it maketh them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue great respect to their Gouernours, and also great care what they do, to auoid tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after death, and to enioy blisse; althought notwithstanding there is punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordained for malefactours, as stealers, whoremoongers, and other sortes of wicked doers; some punished with death, some with forfeitures, some with beating, according to the greatnes of the factes.</p>
                     <p>And this is the summe of their religion, which I learned by hauing special fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6773:26"/>with some of their priestes. Wherein they were not so sure grounded, nor gaue such credite to their traditions and stories but through conuersing with vs they were brought into great doubts of their owne, and no small admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ours, with earnest desire in many, to learne more than we had meanes for want of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vtterance in their language to expresse.</p>
                     <p>Most thinges they sawe with vs, as Mathematicall instruments, sea compasses, the vertue of the loadstone in drawing yron, a perspectiue glasse whereby was she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed manie strange sightes, burning glasses, wildefire woorkes, gunnes, bookes, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and reading, spring clocks that seeme to goe of themselues, and manie other thinges that wee had, were so straunge vnto them, and so farre exceeded their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities to comprehend the reason and meanes how they should be made and done, that they thought they were rather the works of gods then of men, or at the least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they had bin giuen and taught vs of the gods. Which made manie of them to haue such opinion of vs, as that if they knew not the trueth of god and religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, it was rather to be had from vs, whom God so specially loued then from a people that were so simple, as they found themselues to be in comparison of vs. Whereupon greater credite was giuen vnto that we spake of concerning such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>Manie times and in euery towne where I came, according as I was able, I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de declaration of the contentes of the Bible;that therein was set foorth the true and onelie <hi>God,</hi> and his mightie woorkes, that therein was contayned the true doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of saluation through Christ, with manie particularities of Miracles and chiefe poyntes of religion, as I was able then to vtter, and thought fitte for the time. And although I told them the booke materially &amp; of itself was not of anie such vertue, as I thought they did conceiue, but onely the doctrine therein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained; yet would many be glad to touch it, to embrace it, to kisse it, to hold it to their brests and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and stroke ouer all their bodie with it; to shewe their hungrie desire of that knowledge which was spoken of.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Wiroans</hi> with whom we dwelt called <hi>Wingina,</hi> and many of his people would be glad many times to be with vs at our praiers, and many times call vpon vs both in his owne towne, as also in others whither he sometimes accompanied vs, to pray and sing Psalmes; hoping thereby to bee partaker of the same effectes which wee by that meanes also expected.</p>
                     <p>Twise this <hi>Wiroans</hi> was so grieuously sicke that he was like to die, and as hee laie languishing, doubting of anie helpe by his owne priestes, and thinking he was in such daunger for offending vs and thereby our god, sent for some of vs to praie and bee a meanes to our God that it would please him either that he might liue or after death dwell with him in blisse, so likewise were the requestes of manie others in the like case.</p>
                     <p>On a time also when their corne began to wither by reason of a drouth which happened extraordinarily, fearing that it had come to passe by reason that in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6773:27"/>some thing they had displeased vs, many woulde come to vs &amp; desire vs to praie to our God of England, that he would preserue their corne, promising that when it was ripe we also should be partakers of the fruite.</p>
                     <p>There could at no time happen any strange sicknesse, losses, hurtes, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crosse vnto them, but that they would impute to vs the cause or meanes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof for offending or not pleasing vs.</p>
                     <p>One other rare and strange accident, leauing others, will I mention before I ende, which mooued the whole countrey that either knew or hearde of vs, to haue vs in wonderfull admiration.</p>
                     <p>There was no towne where we had any subtile deuise practised against vs, we leauing it vnpunished or not reuenged (because wee sought by all meanes possible to win them by gentlenesse) but that within a few dayes after our departure from euerie such towne, the people began to die very fast, and many in short space; in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me townes about twentie, in some fourtie, in some sixtie, &amp; in one sixe score, which in trueth was very manie in respect of their numbers. This happened in no place that wee coulde learne but where wee had bene, where they vsed some practise aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inst vs, and after such time; The disease also so strange, that they neither knew what it was, nor how to cure it; the like by report of the oldest men in the countrey neuer happened before, time out of minde. A thing specially obserued by vs as also by the naturall inhabitants themselues.</p>
                     <p>Insomuch that when some of the inhabitants which were our friends &amp; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Wiroans Wingina</hi> had obserued such effects in foure or fiue towns to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their wicked practises, they were perswaded that it was the worke of our God through our meanes, and that wee by him might kil and slai whom wee would wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout weapons and not come neere them.</p>
                     <p>And thereupon when it had happened that they had vnderstanding that any of their enemies had abused vs in our iourneyes, hearing that wee had wrought no reuenge with our weapons, &amp; fearing vpon some cause the matter should so rest: did come and intreate vs that we woulde bee a meanes to our God that they as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that had dealt ill with vs might in like sort die; alleaging howe much it would be for our credite and profite, as also theirs; and hoping furthermore that we would do so much at their requests in respect of the friendship we professe them.</p>
                     <p>Whose entreaties although wee shewed that they were vngodlie, affirming that our God would not subiect him selfe to anie such praiers and requestes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that in deede all thinges haue beene and were to be done according to his good pleasure as he had ordained: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that we to shew our selues his true serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make petition for the contrarie, that they with them might liue together with vs, bee made partakers of his truth &amp; serue him in righteousnes; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in such sort, that wee referre that as all other thinges, to bee done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his diuine will &amp; pleasure, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as by his wisedome he had ordained to be best.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:6773:28"/>Yet because the effect fell out so sodainly and shortly after according to their desires, they thought neuerthelesse it came to passe by our meanes, and that we in vsing such speeches vnto them did but dissemble the matter, and therefore came vnto vs to giue vs thankes in their manner that although wee satisfied them not in promise, yet in deedes and effect we had fulfilled their desires.</p>
                     <p>This maruelous accident in all the countrie wrought so strange opinions of vs, that some people could not tel whether to think vs gods or men, and the rather because that all the space of their sicknesse, there was no man of ours knowne to die, or that was specially sicke: they noted also that we had no women amongst vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we did care for any of theirs.</p>
                     <p>Some therefore were of opinion that wee were not borne of women, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore not mortall, but that wee were men of an old generation many yeeres past then risen againe to immortalitie.</p>
                     <p>Some woulde likewise seeme to prophesie that there were more of our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration yet to come, to kill theirs and take their places, as some thought the purpose was by that which was already done.</p>
                     <p>Those that were immediatly to come after vs they imagined to be in the aire, yet inuisible &amp; without bodies, &amp; that they by our intreaty &amp; for the loue of vs did make the people to die in that sort as they did by shooting inuisible bullets into them.</p>
                     <p>To confirme this opinion their phisitions to excuse their ignorance in curing the disease, would not be ashemed to say, but earnestly make the simple people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, that the strings of blood that they sucked out of the sicke bodies, were the strings wherewithal the inuisible bullets were tied and cast.</p>
                     <p>Some also thought that we shot them our selues out of our pieces from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce where we dwelt, and killed the people in any such towne that had offended vs as we listed, how farre distant from vs soeuer it were.</p>
                     <p>And other some saide that it was the speciall woorke of God for our sakes, as wee our selues haue cause in some sorte to thinke no lesse, whatsoeuer some doe or maie imagine to the contrarie, specially some Astrologers knowing of the Eclipse of the Sunne which wee saw the same yeere before in our voyage thytherward, which vnto them appeared very terrible. And also of a Comet which beganne to appeare but a few daies before the beginning of the said sicknesse. But to exclude them from being the speciall an accident, there are farther reasons then I thinke fit at this present to bee alleadged.</p>
                     <p>These their opinions I haue set downe the more at large that it may appeare vnto you that there is good hope they may be brought through discreet dealing and gouernement to the imbracing of the trueth, and consequently to honour, obey, feare and loue vs.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:6773:29"/>And although some of our companie to wardes the ende of the yeare, shewed themselues too fierce, in slaying some of the people, in some towns, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> causes that on our part, might easily enough haue been borne withall: yet notwithstanding because it was on their part iustly deserued, the alteration of their opinions gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally &amp; for the most part concerning vs is the lesse to bee doubted. And whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer els they may be, by carefulnesse of our selues neede nothing at all to be feared. The best neuerthelesse in this as in all actions besides is to be endeuoured and hoped, &amp; of the worst that may happen notice to bee taken with consideration, and as much as may be eschewed.</p>

                  <head>The Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>Now I haue as I hope made relation not of so fewe and smal things but that the countrey of men that are indifferent &amp; wel disposed maie be sufficiently liked: If there were no more knowen then I haue mentioned, which doubtlesse and in great reason is nothing to that which remaineth to bee discouered, neither the soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, nor commodities. As we haue reason so to gather by the difference we found in our trauails: for although all which I haue before spoken of, haue bin discouered &amp; experimented not far from the sea coast where was our abode &amp; most of our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing: yet somtimes as we made our iourneies farther into the maine and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; we found the soyle to bee fatter; the trees greater and to growe thinner; the grounde more firme and deeper mould; more and larger champions; finer grasse and as good as euer we saw any in England; in some places rockie and farre more high and hillie ground; more plentie of their fruites; more abondance of beastes; the more inhabited with people, and of greater pollicie &amp; larger dominions, with greater townes and houses.</p>
                  <p>Why may wee not then looke for in good hope from the inner parts of more and greater plentie, as well of other things, as of those which wee haue alreadie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered? Vnto the Spaniardes happened the like in discouering the maine of the West Indies. The maine also of this countrey of <hi>Virginia,</hi> extending some wayes so many hundreds of leagues, as otherwise then by the relation of the inhabitants wee haue most certaine knowledge of, where yet no Christian Prince hath any posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or dealing, cannot but yeeld many kinds of excellent commodities, which we in our discouerie haue not yet seene.</p>
                  <p>What hope there is els to be gathered of the nature of the climate, being answerable to the Iland of <hi>Iapan,</hi> the land of <hi>China, Persia, Jury,</hi> the Ilandes of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> and <hi>Candy,</hi> the South parts of <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of many other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and famous countreis, because I meane not to be tedious, I leaue to your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne consideration.</p>
                  <p>Whereby also the excellent temperature of the ayre there at all seasons, much warmer then in England, and neuer so violently hot, as sometimes is vnder &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween the Tropikes, or nere them; cannot bee vnknowne vnto you without farther relation.</p>
                  <p>For the holsomnesse thereof I neede to say but thus much: that for all the want of prouision, as first of English victuall; excepting for twentie daies, wee liued only by drinking water and by the victuall of the countrey, of which some sorts were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry straunge vnto vs, and might haue bene thought to haue altered our temperatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in such sort as to haue brought vs into some greeuous and da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous diseases: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of English meanes, for the taking of beastes, fishe, and foule, which by the helpe only of the inhabitants and their meanes, coulde not bee so suddenly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6773:31"/>and easily prouided for vs, nor in so great numbers &amp; quantities, nor of that choise as otherwise might haue bene to our better satisfaction and contentment. Some want also wee had of clothes. Furthermore, in all our trauailes which were most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and often in the time of winter, our lodging was in the open aire vpon the grounde. And yet I say for all this, there were but foure of our whole company (being one hundred and eight) that died all the yeere and that but at the latter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de thereof and vpon none of the aforesaide causes. For all foure especially three we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re feeble, weake, and sickly persons before euer they came thither, and those that knewe them much marueyled that they liued so long beeing in that case, or had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured to trauaile.</p>
                  <p>Seing therefore the ayre there is so temperate and holsome, the soyle so fertile and yeelding such commodities as I haue before mentioned, the voyage also thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to and fro beeing sufficiently experimented, to bee perfourmed thrise a yeere with ease and at any season thereof: And the dealing of <hi>Sir Water Raleigh</hi> so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in large giuing and grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting lande there, as is alreadie knowen, with many hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and furtherances els: (The least that hee hath graunted hath beene fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred acres to a man onely for the aduenture of his person:) I hope there remaine no cause wherby the action should be misliked.</p>
                  <p>If that those which shall thiter trauaile to inhabite and plant bee but reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably prouided for the first yere as those are which were transported the last, and beeing there doe vse but that diligence and care as is requisite, and as they may with eese: There is no doubt but for the time following they may haue victuals that is excellent good and plentie enough; some more Englishe sortes of cattaile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hereafter, as somehaue bene before, and are there yet remaining, may and shall bee God willing thiter transported: So likewise our kinde of fruites, rootes, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbes may bee there planted and sowed, as some haue bene alreadie, and proue wel: And in short time also they may raise of those sortes of commodities which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue spoken of as shall both enrich them selues, as also others that shall deale with them.</p>
                  <p>And this is all the fruites of our labours, that I haue thought necessary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise you of at this present: what els concerneth the nature and manners of the inhabitants of <hi>Virginia:</hi> The number with the particularities of the voyages thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made; and of the actions of such that haue bene by <hi>Sir Water Raleigh</hi> there in and there imployed, many worthy to bee remembred; as of the first discouerers of the Countrey: of our generall for the time <hi>Sir Richard Greinuile</hi>; and after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, of our Gouernour there Master <hi>Rafe Lane</hi>; with diuers other directed and imployed vnder theyr gouernement: Of the Captaynes and Masters of the voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made since for transportation; of the Gouernour and assistants of those alredie transported, as of many persons, accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and thinges els, I haue ready in a discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6773:32"/>by it self in maner of a Chronicle according to the course of times, and when time shall bee thought conuenient shall be also published.</p>
                  <p>Thus referring my relation to your fauourable constructions, expecting good successe of the action, from him which is to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the authour and gouernour not only of this but of all things els, I take my leaue of you, this moneth of Februarii, 1588.</p>

                  <p>The manner of makinge their boates in Virginia is verye wonderfull. For wheras they want Instruments of yron, or other like vnto ours, yet they knowe howe to make them as handsomelye, to saile with whear they liste in their Riuers, and to fishe with all, as ours. First they choose some longe, and thicke tree, accordinge to the bignes of the boate which they would frame, and make a fyre on the grownd abowt the Roote therof, kindlinge the same by little, and little with drie mosse of trees, and chipps of woode that the flame should not mounte opp to highe, and burne to muche of the lengte of the tree. When yt is almost burnt thorough, and readye to fall they make a new fyre, which they suffer to burne vntill the tree fall of yt owne accord. Then burninge of the topp, and bowghs of the tree in suche wyse that the bodie of the same may Retayne his iust lengthe, they raise yt vppon potes laid ouer cross wise vppon forked posts, at suche a reasonable heighte as rhey may handsomlye worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yt. Then take they of the barke with certayne shells: thy reserue the, innermost parte of the lenn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, for the nethermost parte of the boate. On the other side they make a fyre accordinge to the lengthe of the bodye of the tree, sauinge at both the endes. That which they thinke is sufficientlye burned they quenche and scrape away with shells, and makinge a new fyre they burne yt agayne, and soe they continne somtymes burninge and sometymes fcrapinge, vntill the boate haue sufficient bothowmes. This god in dueth thise sauage people with sufficient reason to make thinges necessarie to serue their turnes.</p>

                  <p>The townes of this contrie are in a maner like vnto those which are in Florida, yet are they not soe stronge nor yet preserued with soe great care. They are compassed abowt with poles starcke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste in the grownd, but they are not verye stronge. The entrance is verye narrowe as may be seene by this picture, which is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the forme of the towne of Pomeiooc. Ther are but few howses therin, saue those which belonge to the kinge and his nobles. On the one side is their tempel separated from the other howses, and marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter A. yt is builded rownde, and couered with skynne matts, and as yt wear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed abowt. With cortynes without windowes, and hath noe ligthe but by the doore. On the other side is the kings lodginge marked with the letter B. Their dwellinges are builded with certaine potes fastened together, and couered with matts which they turne op as high as they thinke good, and soe receue in the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and other. Some are also couered with boughes of trees, as euery man lusteth or liketh best. They keepe their feasts and make good cheer together in the midds of the towne as yt is described in they 17. Figure. When the towne standeth fare from the water they digg a great poude noted with the letter C. wherhence they fetche as muche water as they neede.</p>

They haue also groaues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin thei take deer, and fields vherin they sowe their corne. In their corne fields they builde as yt weare a scaffolde wher on they sett a cottage like to a rownde chaire, signiffied by F. wherin they place one to watche. for there are suche nomber of fowles, and beasts, that vnless they keepe the better wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, they would soone deuoure all their corne. For which cause the wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheman maketh continual cryes and noyse. They sowe their corne with a certaine distance noted by H. other wise one stalke would choke the growthe of another and the corne would not come vnto his rypeurs G. For the leaves therofare large, like vnto the leaues of great reedes. They haue also a seuerall broade plotte C. whear they meete with their neighbours, to celebrate their cheefe solemne feastes as the 18. picture doth declare: and a place D. whear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue ended their feaste they make merrie togither. Ouer against this place they haue a rownd plott B. wher they assemble themselues to make their solemne prayers. Not far from which place ther is a lardge buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge A. wherin are the tombes of their kings and princes, as will appere by the 22. figure likewise they haue garden notted bey the letter I. wherin they vse to sowe pompions. Also a place marked with K. wherin the make a fyre att their solemne feasts, and hard without the towne a riuer L. from whence they fetche their water. This people therfore voyde of all couetousnes lyue cherfullye and att their harts ease. Butt they solemnise their feasts in the nigt, and therfore they keepe verye great fyres to auoyde darkenes, ant to testifie their Ioye.</p>

                  <p>The people of this cuntrie haue an Idol, which they call Kiwasa: yt is carued of woode in lengthe 4. foote whose heade is like the heades of the people of Florida, the face is of a flesh colour, the brest white, the rest is all blacke, the thighes are also spottet with whitte. He hath a chayne abowt his necke of white beades, betweene which are other Rownde beades of copper which they esteeme more then golde or siluer. This Idol is placed in the temple of the towne of Secotam, as the keper of the kings dead corpses. Somtyme they haue two of thes idoles in theyr churches, and somtine 3. but neuer aboue, which they place in a darke corner wher they shew tetrible. Thes poore soules haue none other knowledge of god although I thinke them verye Desirous to know the truthe. For when as wee kneeled downe on our knees to make our prayers vnto god, they went abowt to imitate vs, and when they saw we moued our lipps, they also dyd the like. Wherfore that is verye like that they might easelye be brongt to the knowledge of the gospel. God of his mercie grant them this grace.</p>
