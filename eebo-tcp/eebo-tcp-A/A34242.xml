            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>BEcause many true believers are weak, and do much doubt if ever they shall be sure of the soundness of their own Faith and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, or made certain of their Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation, when they see, that many, who profess faith, are found to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; let us see how every believer may be made strong in the faith, and sure of his own Election and Salvation upon solid grounds by sure warrants and true evidences of faith. To this end among many other Scriptures, take these following.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For laying solid grounds of faith, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>

                        <hi>In which words</hi> the Apostle teacheth us these four things, for help and direction, how to be made strong in the faith.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That such as believe in Christ Jesus, and are fled to him for relief from sin and wrath, albeit they be weak in the faith, yet they are indeed Children of the same Father with the Apostles: for so he accounteth of them, while he called them <hi>brethren.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That albeit we be not sure, for the time of our effectual calling and election, yet we may
<pb facs="tcp:44091:110"/>
be made sure of both, if we use diligence: for this he presupposeth, saying, <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That we must not be discouraged, when we see many seeming believers prove rotten branches and make defection, but we must the rather take the better heed to our selves <hi>Wherefore the rather, brethren,</hi> saith he, <hi>give all diligence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p>To this same purpose, consider, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi> ver. 2. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life, in Christ Iesus, hath made me free from the Law of sin and death.</hi> ver. 3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinfull flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh.</hi> ver. 4. <hi>That the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. That the fountain and first ground from whence our freedom from the curse of the Law doth flow, is the Covenant of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, past betwixt God, and God the Son, as incarnate, wherein Christ takes the Curse of the Law upon him for sin, that the believer, who could not otherwise be delivered from the Covenant of Works, may be delivered from it. And this Doctrine the Apostle holdeth forth in these four branches. 1. That it was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> impossible for the Law, or Covenant of works, to bring righteousness and life to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner because it was weak. 2. That this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and inability of the Law, or Covenant of Works, is not the fault of the Law, but the fault of sinfull flesh, which is neither able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay the penalty of sin, nor to give perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law (presuppose by-gone sins were forgiven) the Law was weak (saith he) <hi>through the flesh.</hi> 3. That the righteousness and salvation of sinners, which was impossible to be brought about by the Law, is brought to pass by sending Gods own Son, Jesus Christ <hi>in the flesh,</hi> in whose flesh sin is condemned and punished, for making satisfaction in the behalf of the Elect, that they might be set free.
<pb facs="tcp:44091:111"/>
4. That by his means the Law loseth nothing, because the righteousness of the Law is best fulfilled this way: First by Christ, giving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect active obedience in our name unto it in all things: Next, by his paying, in our name, the penalty, (due to our sins) in his death. And lastly, by his working of Sanctification in us, who are true believers, who strive to give new obedience unto the Law, and <hi>walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi>

                     <p>Which Covenant he declareth, shall be in substance the assignation, and the making over of all the saving graces, which <hi>David</hi> (who is Jesus Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.34.) hath brought for us in the Covenant of Redemption, <hi>I will make a Covenant with you</hi> (saith he) <hi>even the sure mercies of</hi> David. <hi>By sure mercies</hi> he means saving graces, such as are righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, Adoption, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Glorification, and whatsoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Godliness, and life eternal.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. To confirm and assure us of the real grant of these saving mercies, and to perswade us of the reality of the Covenant betwixt God and the believer of this word, the Father hath made a fourfold gift of his eternal and only begotten Son.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein the Apostle teacheth us these nine Doctrines.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the elect World, or the World
<pb facs="tcp:44091:115"/>
redeemed souls, are by nature in the estate of enmity against God. This is presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the word <hi>Reconciliation</hi>; for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, or renewing of friendship, cannot be, except betwixt those that have been at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That in all the time by-past, since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of God, as Mediator, and the Father in him, hath been about the making friendship (by his word and Spirit) betwixt himself and the <hi>elect World, God</hi> (saith he) <hi>was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the way of reconciliation was in all ages one and the same in substance, <hi>viz.</hi> by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving the sins of them who do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their sins, and their enmity against God, and do seek reconciliation and remission of sins in Christ, for God (saith he) <hi>was in Christ reconciling the world to himself,</hi> by way of <hi>not imputing their trespasses unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That the end and scope of the Gospel and whole word of God, is threefold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It serveth to make people sensible of their sins, and of their enmity against God, and of their danger if they should stand out, and not fear Gods displeasure.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The word of God serveth to make men acquainted with the course which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for making friendship with him through Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> That if men shall acknowledge the enmity, and shall be content to enter into a
<pb facs="tcp:44091:115"/>
Covenant of friendship with God, through Christ, then God will be contented to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with them freely.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The word of God serveth to teach men how to carry themselves towards God, as friends, after they are reconciled to him, <hi>viz.</hi> to be loath to sin against him, and to strive heartily to obey his Commandments, and therefore the <hi>Word of God</hi> here is called <hi>the Word of Reconciliation,</hi> because it teacheth us, what need we have of reconciliation, and how to make it, and how to keep the reconciliation of friendship, being made with God through Christ.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That albeit the hearing, believing, and obeying of this word, doth belong to all those to whom this Gospel doth come, yet the Office of preaching of it, with authority, belongeth to none but to such only as God doth call to this ministry, and sendeth out with Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for this work. This the Apostle holdeth forth, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. in these words, <hi>he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us the word of Reconciliation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Ministers of the Gospel should behave themselves as Christs Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and should closely follow their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission set down in the word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. and when they do so, they should be received by the people, as Ambassadours from God: for here the Apole, in all their names, saith, <hi>we are Embassadours for Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:44091:116"/>
as though God did beseech you by us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. That Ministers in all earnestness of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions should deal with people, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their sins, and their natural enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God more and more seriously: and to consent to the Covenant of Grace and Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Christ more and more heartily; and to evidence more and more clearly their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation by a holy carriage before God. This he holdeth forth, when he saith, <hi>we pray you be reconciled to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. That in the Ministers affectionate dealing with the people, the people should consider, that they have to do with God and Christ, requesting them by the Ministers to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, now there cannot be a greater induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to break a sinners hard heart, than Gods <hi>making request</hi> to him for friendship: For when it became us, who have done so many wrongs to God, to seek friendship of God, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth, and (O wonder of wonders!) he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questeth</hi> us to be content to be reconciled wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> him: and therefore most fearful wrath must abide them, who do set light by this request; and do not yield when they hear Ministers with Commission, saying, <hi>We are Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs stead be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. To make it appear, how it cometh to pass that the Covenant of Reconciliation should be so easily made up betwixt God and
<pb facs="tcp:44091:116"/>
a humble sinner fleeing to Christ, the Apostle leads us unto the cause of it, holden forth in the Covenant of Redemption; the sum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this. <hi>It is agreed betwixt God and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Iesus Christ the Son of God Surety for the redeemed, as parties contractors, that the sins of the redeemed should be imputed to innocent Christ, and he both condemned and put to death for them upon this very condition, that whosoever heartily consents unto the Covenant of Reconciliation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered through Christ, shall by the imputation of his obedience unto them, be justified and holden righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, for God hath made Christ who knew no sin, to be sin for us</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence may a weak believer strengthen his faith, by reasoning from this ground after this manner.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Wherein the Apostle teacheth these seven Doctrines.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the obedience of the Law must flow from love, and love from a pure heart, and a pure heart from a good Conscience, and a good conscience from Faith unfaigned, this he maketh the only right channel of good works, <hi>the end of the Law is Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the end of the Law is not that men may be justified by their obedience of it,
<pb facs="tcp:44091:124"/>
as the Jewish Doctors did falsly teach: for it is impossible that sinners can be justified by the Law, who for every transgression are condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law: <hi>for the end of the Law is</hi> (not such as the Jewish Doctors taught, but) <hi>love out of a pure heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the true end of the Law, preached unto the people, is that they, by the Law, being made to see their deserved condemnation, should flie to Christ unfaignedly, to be justified by faith in him: So saith the Text, <hi>while it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth love to flow through faith in Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. That no man can set himself in love to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Law, except in as far as his conscience is quieted by faith, or is seeking to be quieted in Christ, <hi>for the end of the Law is love of a good conscience, and faith unfaigned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. That faigned faith goeth to Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reckoning with the Law, and so wants an errand; but unfaigned faith reckoneth with the Law, and is forced to flie for refuge unto Christ as the end of the Law, for righteousness so often as it finds it self guilty for breaking of the Law: <hi>For the end of the Law is faith unfaigned.</hi>

                     <p>I <hi>Am the true vine, ye are the branches, he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein Christ in a similitude from a vine tree teacheth us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That by nature we are wild barren briers till we be changed by coming unto Christ, and that Christ is that noble vine tree having all life and sap of grace in himself, and able to change the nature of every one that cometh to him, and to communicate spirit and life to as many as shall believe in him: <hi>I am the vine</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:44091:125"/>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 That Christ loveth to have believers so united unto him, as that they be not separated at any time by unbelief: and that there may be a mutual inhabitation of them in him <hi>by faith and love,</hi> and of him in them, <hi>by his Word and Spirit,</hi> for he joyneth these together, <hi>if ye abide in me and I in you,</hi> as things inseparable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That except a man be ingrafted in Christ and united to him by faith, he cannot do any the least good work of his own strength: yea, except in as far as a man doth draw spirit and life from Christ by faith, the work which he doth is naughty and nul <hi>in the point of goodness</hi> in Gods estimation, <hi>for without me</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye can do nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4.

That we have heard the joyful sound of the Gospel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king offer of Christ to us who are lost sinners by the Law. 2. That we have heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the gracious offer of Christ. 3. That by receiving of him we are become the sons of God, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.12. And are incorporated into his Mystical body, that he may dwell in us as <hi>his temple,</hi> and we dwel in him as in the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>of righteousness and life,</hi> So our abiding in Christ importeth other three things.
<pb facs="tcp:44091:125"/>
1. An imploying of Christ in all our addresses to God, and in all our undertakings of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever peece of service to him. 2. A content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness with his sufficiency, without going out from him to seek righteousness or life, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture in any case, in our own or any of the creatures worthiness. 3. A fixedness in our believing in him, a fixedness in our imploying and making use of him, and a fixedness in our contentment in him, and adhering to him, so that no allurement, no tentation of Satan or the World, no terror nor trouble may be able to drive our spirits from firm adherence unto him; or from constant avowing of his truth and obeying his commands, who hath loved us and given himself for us: and in whom not only our life is laid up, but also the fulness of the God-head dwelleth bodily, by reason of the substantial and personal union of the Divine and Humane nature in him.</p>
