            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>Demands</hi> of his Excellency the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the Generall Councell of the Army, in prosecution of the late Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance to the two Houses of Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He incompetency of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in its present constitution, to give an absolute and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Judgment for the whole (especially to be the sole Judges of their own performance, or breach of Trust) doth make the juster way for such an Appeal, so indeed we see no other way left for remedy, in regard the present unlimited continuance of this Parliament doth exclude the orderly succession of any other more equal formal Judicature of men, to which we might hope in due time other ways to appeal.</p>
            <p>Thus then we apprehend our selves in the present case, both necessitated to, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in an Appeal from this Parliament, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93966:3"/>
the present constitution as it stands, unto the extraordinary Judgment of God and good people; and yet in the prosecution of this Appeal, as we shall drive it on, but to the speedy obtaining of a more orderly &amp; equal Judicature of men, in a just Representative, according to our Remonstrance (wherein to acquiesce) so in the present procuring of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice with the peoples ease and quiet, and in the setling of the Kingdom upon a due, safe and hopefull succession of Parliaments: It is our hearts desire, and shall be our endevour, that so much, both of the matter and form of the present Parliamentary authority may be preserved, as can be safe, or will be useful to these ends, until a just and full Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, both for matter and form (suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the publique ends it serves for) can be introduced.</p>
            <p>And therefore first, It should be our great rejoycing (if <hi>God</hi> saw it good) that the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the present House of Commons were become sensible of the evil and destructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their late way, and would resolvedly &amp; vigorously apply themselves to the speedy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93966:3"/>
execution of Justice, with the righting and easing of the oppressed people, and to a just and safe settlement of the Kingdom upon such foundations as have been propounded by us and others for that purpose, &amp; would for the speedier and surer prosecution of these things, exclude from Communication in their Councels, all such corrupt and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized Members as have appeared hitherto, but to obstruct and hinder such matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Safety and publique Interest, and to pervert their Councels a contrary way, and have therein so shamefully both falsified and forfeited their Trust.</p>
            <p>But however, we shall, secondly, desire, That so many of them as God hath kept up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and shall touch with a just sense of those things, would by Protestation, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise acquit themselves from such breach of Trust, and approve their faithfulness, by withdrawing from those that persist in the guilt thereof, and would apply themselves to such a posture, whereby they may speedily and effectually prosecute those necessary and publique ends, without such Interruptions, Diversions, or Depravations of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93966:4"/>
from the rest, to their endless trouble, oppression, and hazard of the Kingdom as formerly, and for so many of them, whose hearts God shall stir up thus to do; we shall therein, in this case of extremity, look upon them as persons having materially the chief Trust of the Kingdom remaining in them, and though not a formal standing power to be continued in them, or drawn into ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Presidents; yet the best and most right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that can be had, as the present state and exigence of Affairs now stand; And we shall accordingly own them, adhere to them, and be guided by them in their faithfull prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Trust, in order unto, and until the introducing of a more full and formall power in a just Representative to be speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endevoured.</p>
            <p>Now yet further to take away all jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in relation to our selves, which might withhold or discourse any honest Members from this courage, as we have the witness of God in our hearts, that in these proceedings we do not seek, but even resolve we will not take advantages to our selves, either in point of Profit or Power; and that if God did open
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93966:4"/>
unto us a way, wherein with honesty and faithfulness to the publick Interest, &amp; good people engaged for us, we might presently discharged, so as we might not in be our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Employments look on, and be accessory to, yea supporters of the Parliament, in the present corrupt, oppressive and destructive proceedings, we should with rejoycing, and without more ado, embrace such a discharge rather then interpose in these things to our own vast trouble and hazard; so if we could but obtain a rationall assurance for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall prosecution of these things, we shall give any proportionable assurance on our parts, concerning our laying down of Arms, when, and as we should be required: But for the present, as the case stands, we apprehend our selves obliged in duty to God, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and good men therein, to improve our utmost abilities in all honest ways, for the avoyding of these great evils we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, and for profecution of the good things we have propounded; and also that such persons who were the inviters of the late Invasion from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the instigaters and incouragers of the late Insurrections
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93966:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
within this Kingdom, and (those forcible ways failing) have still pursued the same wicked Designs by treacherous and corrupt Councels, may be brought to publique Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, according to their severall demerits. For all these ends we are now drawing up with the Army to <hi>London,</hi> there to follow Providence as God shall clear our way.</p>
