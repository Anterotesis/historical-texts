            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is but very requisite that J should begin this short Treatise with the words of our Saviour, that a Kingdome divided can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stand. Oh then poore <hi>England</hi> in what a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate art thou groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning under the burthen of so many Divisions.</p>
            <p>Thy Townes and Cities are filled with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Verilies,</hi> whose tongues and harts doe as much differ as truth and errour, they plead for conscience forsooth, &amp; they will hazard their eares rather then loose the truth, they stand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance against Bishops, and the Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer with them is abhominable, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hath too many by's in it, in which judgement (in my opinion) they sell their reputations and pawne their credits to the Arch-Broker the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, who at the last day, the day of judgement
<pb facs="tcp:96289:3"/>
will require more then ten in the hundred of them. The Tap as they professe is abhominable, and yet they doe Jdolize the Tub, which as they suppose doth consecrate their devotion instead of a Pulpit, the Congregation being assembled, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dissembled in a Barne top.</p>
            <p>They affirme that Papists are damned, Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians shall not enjoy Heaven, for why, they are like to a greene stick which doth bowe too much.</p>
            <p>They pitty Adamites and doe proffer them gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments because they know they will not receive them, they seeme more innocent then Do<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es, and yet will be accounted as wise as Serpents.</p>
            <p>They professe they will honour all teachers vnlesse the Pope, and yet will be ready to raise an vnnaturall siege against their owne Father if hee doe but crosse them.</p>
            <p>They would be accounted all friends to Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but yet cannot effect plaine Dealing or <hi>Tom-tell-troth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They love their Neighbour as themselves, they say, but they must not then if Males be Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowers or being married have vnhandsome wives.</p>
            <p>They say they would have Religion reformed, and the true Church onely to be adored, adored say I, the Parson may chance to have a scrape on the Sunday morning, and it shall be accounted no prejudice to their Hobnayles, otherwise all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship and Ceremony, and that their see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Piety doth spit, at the name of Jesus no knee must bow except that of the heart, although hee
<pb facs="tcp:96289:3"/>
that saved the one, saved the other, and hee that made the one made the other.</p>
            <p>This sort of people were not once a handfull, and then crept in corners, but now they are like to the AEgyptian Locust covering the whole-Land, and they will rule Religion, nor Religion them, or else they will goe against Religion, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did to meet our Saviour with Swords and staves, and there is not amongst them onely one <hi>Iudas,</hi> but many which seeke to betray it.</p>
            <p>And yet are there amongst this holy assembly (as they tearme themselves) as many severall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, as men, which will easily be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by their last Congregation in the Malt-house of one <hi>Iob</hi> a Brewer, the number being about se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venscore, there had every one a Religion by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and every one a nigher way to Heaven than the other, each shewed his opinion, which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it would be too tedious, but their ambitious zeale was so hot, that in snuffe each left the other, but not long after the Reverend Box-maker eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as high as little St. <hi>Bartholmewes</hi> Pulpit, where he threw more stones against the Bishops and the booke of Common Prayer, then little Boyes use to doe Snow-balls in the time of Winter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What shall I say of this sort of people? Shall I commend their Actions? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They goe about to rob <hi>Levi</hi> of his due, and it is to be feared least that vnawares they deceive the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Twice have their troopes been collected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:96289:4"/>
armed with Swords and staves, and what place have they gone to besiege, a place of no lesser consequence then the Parliament house. The first day was upon Thursday the 4. of Decemb. the second upon Friday the 12 of December, upon the first day the Trayne Band ceazed upon them, not knowing otherwise but that they came against the Parliament house, but their plea was they came to defend the truth, but it was very true that many of them were committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Vpon Friday notice was given to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how that their number was so great, so that instantly there was warrants sent vnto each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable to command sufficient men, with swords, and Halberts, to guard the Parliament house from Schismaticall oppression; all shcismaticks good Lord either convert, or confound, that this Kingdome may conclude of nothing, but what may be pleasing In thy sight.</p>
