            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

OF
POPERY,
In a Second Letter written upon the Discovery
of the Late PLOT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu are pleased to tell me that my last Letter has
had some good effect; and that many who were
before carried away with the false colours of the
<hi>Romish</hi> Religion, are now a little awakned, and
seem not unwilling to examin things, which they took
formerly upon trust: and therefore you desire me, since
you are not Master of so much spare time your self, to
set down the most material and convincing reasons, and
in as few words as may be, that are most likely to open
the eyes of honest and simple persons, that have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
misled, and are now willing to be instructed.</p>
            <p>In all such cases I first consider the temper of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to be dealt with: Such as take up their Religion out
of interest or humour, and think it point of honour to
continue in it, and so will examine nothing are not to be
spoken to. Others that are naturally superstitious and
credulous, are very hard to be wrought on; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
every thing that is said on the one hand, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
all that is told them by any body else. Some of
those have a vanity in coming to talk with Divines, but
it is an endless labour to deal with them; for at every
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47937:3"/>
time one must begin of new. But the only persons to be
dealt with, are those that are sincere and inquisitive, that
having been bred in that Religion, or brought over to it
by some specious pretences, are now willing to hear rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and resolved to follow it wherever they find it. And
therefore in the first place, their minds must be disinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from these unjust prejudices, that they conceive of
our Religion: and such just prejudices must be offered
them against the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, as may at least beget
in them some jealousies concerning it, by which they
may be brought so far, as to think the matter suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
If then there be such reasons offered them, for sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
foul dealing from their Priests and Church, as
would make them suspect an Attorney, Physician, or any
other person with whom they were to deal, they will
be prepared to hear reason; which is all that we desire:
and upon this Head these following Considerations may
be laid before them.</p>
            <p>1. All people that pretend to great Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over our consciences, are justly to be suspected.
If any man designed to make himself Master of any
of our other Liberties, we would examine his Title,
and suspect all his other motions, when we see they tend
to subject us to him: Therefore a Church that designs
to keep all her Votaries under an absolute obedience, is
justly to be suspected: and our Church that pretends to
no such power, is more likely to deal fairly.</p>
            <p>2. A Church that designs to keep her Members in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
is more to be suspected, than a Church that
brings every thing to a fair Trial. A Church that denies
the use of the Scriptures in a known tongue, except to
a few, and wraps up their Worship in a Language that
is not understood, is reasonably to be suspected, more
than a Church that gives the free use of the Scriptures to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47937:3"/>
all persons, and worships God in a Language, which the
people understand.</p>
            <p>3. A Church whose Opinions tend to engross the
Riches of the world to its Officers, is more to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
than a Church that pretends to nothing but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
maintenance of the several Officers in it. The
Redeeming Souls out of Purgatory, and the Enriching
the Shrines, or Reliques of Saints, Pardons, Jubilees,
and many more Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are so
calculated for enriching their Societies; that every cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
man must needs suspect some design in it: which
he cannot charge on a Church that has none of these
Arts to get money.</p>
            <p>4. A Church that has carried on its Designs, by the
most dishonest methods possible, the forging of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and Deeds, of Miracles, Visions, Prophesies and
other things of that Nature, is more justly to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
than a Church that cannot be charged with any
such practices. The Forging so many Epistles for the
Popes of the first Ages, which are now by themselves
confest to be Spurious, with many other Forgeries, were
the Engines by which the Papal Power was chiefly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.
The Legends and Extravagant Fables of
which they are now ashamed, were the chief Motives of
Devotion for many Ages. And by these, Saints and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
were so much magnified, and Monasteries so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched.
A Noted Liar after a Discovery is no more to
be trusted.</p>
            <p>5. Any that considers the present State of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
manner of Electing Popes, the Practices of that Court,
and the Maximes they move by, must see that every
thing there is secular, corrupt, and at best directed by
rules of Policy. But to fansie the Holy Ghost can come
upon any Election so managed, as their own Books shew
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47937:4"/>
that is, is the most unreasonable thing that can be devised.
Therefore a Church that neither pretends so high, nor
can be charged with such proceedings, is more likely to
be the true Church.</p>
            <p>6. A Church that teaches Cruelty against poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
people, that differ in opinion; and sets on Plots,
Conspiracies, and Rebellion against Princes, that are
judged Hereticks, is more likely to be corrupted, than
a Church that is so merciful, as to condemn all capital
proceedings for difference of Opinion, and teaches an
absolute Submission to the Soveraign Power, even when
it persecutes and oppresses them.</p>
            <p>7. A Church that is false to her own Principles, is not
so likely to Instruct her members aright, as a Church
that is in all things consistent to her self. The great
Foundation of their Doctrine, is, That there must be a
speaking Judg to decide all Controversies: Now they
have no such Judg, for it is not of Faith, that the Pope
is this Judg, or is Infallible: And for a general Council,
they have had none these 112. years, nor are they like
to see another in hast. So they have no Speaking infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judg among them. And thus they deceive people
by a false Pretence: whereas we appeal to nothing, but
what we really have among us, which are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>8. A Church that appeals to Marks, which are not
possible to be searcht out, is more likely to mislead peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than a Church that pretends to nothing but what
can be certainly proved. The great thing they appeal to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is the Constant Succession of the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
their other Pastors. This cannot be known, no not
by a probable conjecture. But there are on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as great grounds for History to deny it in the See
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as in any other Ancient See whatsoever: but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47937:4"/>
though they have it, both the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and our
Church has it likewise.</p>
            <p>These are such plain things, and the Truth of them
is so notoriously known, that I should ask any of that
Communion, whether upon the like reasons he would
not be Jealous of any person or sort of persons whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
And if these grounds of jealousie would work in
other matters, it is much more reasonable, that they
should take place in matters of Religion; In which as
an Error is of far greater Importance; So Impostors in
all Ages have studied to make gain by Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is most just upon these violent presumptions, to
look about us, and take care we be not cheated.</p>
            <p>But before I would descend to particulars, there is
one General prejudice that works most universally, on
weaker minds to be removed, which is, that the true
Church cannot Erre. If then it be made appear unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably,
that the true Church may Erre, and that in a
most weighty Point, all these Arguments fall to the
ground.</p>
            <p>That the Church of the <hi>Iews,</hi> in our Saviours days
was the true Church, cannot be denied; for our Saviour
owned it to be such. He joyned with them in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
He sent the Lepers to the Priest, He commanded
them to hear the Doctors that sate in <hi>Moses Chair,</hi> and
himself acknowledged the High Priest. This is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to prove that it was the true Church, and yet this
Church erred, in a most Important point, whether Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the true Messias, in whom the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
were fulfilled or not? they Judged falsly: The High
Priests with all the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> declared him a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and condemned him guilty of Death. Here the
true Church expounds the Scriptures falsly, and erred in
the Foundation of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47937:5"/>
And it is well known, that the chief arguments which
they of the Romish party bring to prove, that a Church
cannot Err, do agree as well to the <hi>Iewish,</hi> as the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church: the one being the true Church, under that
dispensation, as well as the other is now. If then this
Decision made by the true Church in Christs time, did
not oblige all in that Church, to go on in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but private persons might have examined their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and depart from them upon it; then upon the
same reasons, though we acknowledge the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> a true Church, yet we may examine her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and separate from her errors. This grand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
being thus removed, there are two things in the
next place to be laid before them.</p>
            <p>One is, that the Scriptures, being acknowledged to
come from Divine Inspiration, on all hands, can only
decide the Controversies among us: and the places I
shall make use of, shall be cited according to the <hi>Doway</hi>
Translation, to which, being made by themselves, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
except.</p>
            <p>Another is, that a man must judg of things as they
appear plainly to his reasonable Faculties. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all reason to say that because it is possible for a
man to be mistaken, therefore he ought to doubt his
Judgment in things that are clear to him. This must
turn a man Sceptical both to all Religions, and all the
concerns of human life: Therefore every man must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Judgment, when after a diligent Inquiry, any
thing appears plain to him.</p>
            <p>And now to come up close to those of that perswasion,
they are to consider, that the chief parts of Religion
are, <hi>First,</hi> Articles of Faith: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Rules of Life:
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> The worship of God chiefly in the Sacraments:
And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Government of the Church. If
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47937:5"/>
then in every one of these Heads, the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
agrees clearly with the Scriptures, and the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> does either manifestly contradict them, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
matterially from them, in all these points, in which
we and they differ; then the Resolution of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Whether a man ought to joyn himself to our
Church, or theirs? will be easily made.</p>
            <p>For Articles of Faith, if either the Apostles Creed or
the Creeds of the First 4. General Councils, contain
a just abstract of the Faith; then we who receive every
Article in these Creeds, do agree more exactly to the
Apostolical Doctrine, than they who have added many
new Articles to their Creed.</p>
            <p>The chief Article of Faith, is, The Covenant made
between God and Man through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by which
upon the Account of his Merits and Intercession, all
who follow the Rules of the Gospel, may expect the
Blessings of it,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 21.</note> both here, and hereafter. <hi>Pennance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, and Faith towards our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
being the conditions upon which we hope for Eternal life.
This we plainly teach, without Addition or Change:
But in how many things have they departed from this
Simplicity of the Gospel? <hi>First,</hi> In teaching People to
address to God, for the Merits and by the Intercession of
the Saints: From whom these things are asked, for which
the Scriptures direct us only to God and Christ. And
in the very words pronounced after absolution, <hi>The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints,</hi> are joined with
the passion of Christ; as the grounds on which
we obtain pardon of Sin, Grace, and Eternal
life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In perswading People, That a Simple
attrition with the use of the Sacraments, without any
real conversion of the Soul or change of life, is sufficient
to Salvation. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In perswading People, That
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47937:6"/>
there is a Communication of the Merits of Saints to
other Persons, though the Scriptures mention only the
Communication of Christs Merits. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> by Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that tho our sins are pardoned thorough Christ; yet,
there are terrible and long lasting torments to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
in another State. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> that saying Masses, and
going of Pilgrimages can Redeem from these. Now in
all these, the two chief Designs of the Gospel are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contradicted: Which be; <hi>First,</hi> To Change our
hearts and lives: <hi>Secondly,</hi> To perswade us to a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Dependance upon Christ, and an high acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him: But these Doctrines of theirs as they shew
us a way to be sure of Heaven, without a real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
so they take off so much from Faith in Christ
as they carry us to trust to somewhat else.</p>
            <p>These are Errors of great Importance: Since they
corrupt the Fountain, and overthrow the chief design of
the Christian Religion. They are also late devices
brought in, in the dark and ignorant Ages.</p>
            <p>No mention is made of praying to Saints, in any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Liturgie. There is a great deal against it in the
most Ancient Authors. And though in the Fourth
Century, upon the Conversion of many Heathens to
the Christian Faith, to humour them in their conceit,
of some Intermedial Agents, between the Divinity and
us Mortals, there was a Reverence for the Saints set up,
to drive out the worship of those Secondary Deities;
yet, this was no direct Adoration, though they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to use Rhetorical addresses to Saints like prayers:
Yet, even in <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great his time (in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Seventh Century) we find no Prayers made
to them in all his Liturgies. And for the Belief of a
simple Attrition being sufficient with the Sacrament, no
body ever dreamed of it, before the Schoolmen found
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47937:6"/>
out the Distinction, between <hi>Attrition</hi> and <hi>Contrition</hi>
in the later Ages. For the Communication of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Saints, the whole Fathers in one voice, speak only
of the Merits of Christ being Communicated to us. The
Fryers first invented it, to invite People at least to die
in their habits, by perswading them, that all the merits of
the Saints of their Order, were shared among the
whole Order. And for Redeeming out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
the first Four Ages knew nothing of it. In
the beginning of the Fifth Century St. <hi>Austin</hi> plainly
speaks of it as an Opinion <hi>which some had taken up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any ground, and that it was no way certain, nor
could we ever be sure of it.</hi> And though in <hi>Gregory</hi> the
Great's time, the Belief of it was pretty far advanced;
yet, the Trade of Redeeming out of it, by saying Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for Departed Souls was not even then found
out.</p>
            <p>So that all these are both gross Errors, and late Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The next Branch of Religion, is the Rule of human
life: which one would think could be taken from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Standard so certainly, as the 10. Commandments:
and the Expositions given of these in Scripture, chiefly
our Saviours Sermon on the Mount. Let Malice it self
appear, to Declare wherein our Church strikes at any
of these: or Teaches men to disobey even the least of
them. If then our Rule of life be exactly the same; with
that which the Scriptures prescribe, we are safe as to this,
which may be well called, The most important piece of
Religion. For it is to be considered that God making
man <hi>after his own Image,</hi> the end of his Creation was,
that he might be made like God. The Attributes of
God to be Imitated, are Goodness, Mercy, Justice,
Wisdom and Truth. And it is certain that the Design of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47937:7"/>
Revealed Religion was to give men clearer Notions of
these Moral perfections, to press them by stronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and encourage cur Endeavours by suitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and punishments. So that if any Religion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
these Moral Duties, we are sure it is false; for the
Revelation of God's will must be designed to make us
better than we would otherwise be, following barely
the Light of Nature, and not worse. If then the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> over throws Morality, and contradicts any of
the Ten Commandments we are sure it is not of God.
And how far it has done this, they may judge by these
Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whatever Church offers cheap and easie pardons
for sin, does take off so much from our sense of the evil of
sin. We cannot have a very ill opinion of any thing that
is easily forgiven. Now what are the Popes Pardons, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,
Jubilees, Priviledged Altars, the going of
Pilgrimages, the saying of some Collects, the wearing of
<hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, Peebles, or other such like trash, but so
many Engines to root out of mens minds any deep hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
or great sense of sin. Is not this the very thing which
the People of the <hi>Iews</hi> of old offered at, to bring Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Rams, Ten Thousand Rivers of Oyl, their
First born, or the fruit of their Body, to offer for their
sins? All which were rejected in the name of God in
these words, <hi>I will shew thee O man what is good, and
what our Lord requireth of thee:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Micha 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Verily to do Iudgment,
and to love mercy, and to walk solicitous with thy God.</hi>
This is a Moral matter and unchangable; therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
go to beat down the sense of sin, by the offer of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
on any other terms, but the sincere change of a
mans life, destroy Morallity, which is the Image of God
in man. If from this general Consideration we descend
to Examine the Commandments in particular, we shall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47937:7"/>
find matter enough for a severe Charge against their
Church.</p>
            <p>Is not the First Commandment broken when Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are offered to Saints which Import their being <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient,
Omnipresent and Almighty;</hi> that are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable
Attributes of the God-head: and when
pardon of sin, preservation, Grace against Temptations,
and Eternal life, are immediately begged from Saints.
It is true, they say the sence of these prayers, is only
that we desire their assistance at Gods hands for these
blessings. But the words of their Offices import no such
matter. And though for above One Hundred and Sixty
Years these things have been complained of; and in the
Correction of their Offices, some of them were cast out;
yet, many of them do still continue: In which the plain
sence of the words of their Offices is Idolatrous:
Only they make a shift with another and forced sence
put on them, to defend themselves from that charge.
And for such Devotions they can shew no Warrant for
the first Thousand years after Christ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Commandment is so openly and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
broken by them, that many of them maintain, it
does not all oblige Christians: but belonged only to
the Jewish Dispensation. And in all their Catechisms it
is left out, which was done very wisely; (with what
honesty let them answer) for it was not fit the people
should look on that as a Commandment, which they
saw so notoriously broken throughout their whole
Church: A great trade being also driven by the breach
of it. That this was not in the Primitive Church, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
confess: all the Books the Fathers wrote against
the Idolatry of the Heathens, demonstrate this. Nor
were Images so much as set up in Churches before the
Sixth Century. And then care was taken that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47937:8"/>
should not be worshipped: and not before the Eighth
Century were they worshipped in any place of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the Popes power of Relaxing of
Oaths, and discharging men from the Obligation of
them, joyned with the practice of their Popes for above
800 years, is as formal an Opposition to the <hi>Third</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
as can be Imagined. This was also begun in
the <hi>Eighth</hi> Century.</p>
            <p>The vast multiplication of Holy-days, made the
Observation of the Lords day of necessity slacken.</p>
            <p>They have destroyed the Order of Societies, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the <hi>Fifth</hi> Commandment; by the Power they
allow the Pope to Depose Princes, and absolve Subjects
from their Alleageance.</p>
            <p>They teach the murdering and burning all Hereticks,
that is to say, all that will not submit to their Tyranny:
by which Infinite numbers of Innocent persons have been
murdered, against the <hi>Sixth</hi> Commandment. And these
two Doctrines of deposing Princes, and putting Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
to death, were abhorred by the Church for the
first <hi>Eight</hi> ages, and were brought in by the Popes since
that time.</p>
            <p>The frequent practice of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in
granting Divorces, on the pretence either of Spiritual
kindred, or of Degrees not forbidden, either by the
Law of Nature, or the word of God, and allowing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Marriages to both Parties, upon such Divorces, is
an avowed breach of the <hi>Seventh</hi> Commandment.</p>
            <p>The setting on, some Princes to Invade other Princes
in their just Rights, is the Doctrine, as well as it has
been the practice of their Church for some Ages. And
as their Popes have wrested many Territories from
Temporal Princes, so for many Ages they set on Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47937:8"/>
Robbery against the <hi>Eighth</hi> Commandment.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Equivocating, both taught, and
practised, the breaking of safe Conducts, and publick
Faith decreed by their General Councils, is also against
the <hi>Ninth</hi> Commandment.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Tenth</hi> I shall say nothing of it, because the
meaning of it is not so generally agreed on. But thus
we see all the Rules of Morality are contradicted by
that Church.</p>
            <p>It might be justly added to swell up this Charge;
that of late there have been Doctrines published to the
world by the approved Casuists of that Church, with
Licence, which subvert all Justice, destroy all security,
and take away the most sacred ties of mankind. By the
Doctrines of Probability, and of Ordering the Intention
aright, there is no crime how black soever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a man
may adventure on it with a good conscience. These
things were long and openly taught amongst them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Censure. And when many of the <hi>French</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
complained of these at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (perhaps
more out of spite to the Jesuits, than zeal for the Truth)
it was long before these so just Remonstrances, were
heard. And in conclusion a trifling Censure was past on
them: by which they were declared <hi>Scandalous</hi> (neither
Impious, nor Wicked) and all were forbidden to teach
them any more, but they stand yet, in the Books for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
published with Licence.</p>
            <p>After all these particulars, is it to be wondered at, if
the morals of the men of that Church be vitiated, when
their Doctrine is so corrupted, for peoples practices are
generally worse than their Opinions. And thus the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>
point is made good, that in our Church, we teach
the same Rules of Living that are in the Scriptures,
which are grosly corrupted by their Doctrines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47937:9"/>
The <hi>Third</hi> Branch of the Christian Religion is the
Worship of God and that chiefly the use of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For the Worship of God, let it be considered that
we pray to God, and praise him only, for all these things
about which the Scriptures command us to address to
him. Our worship is in a Language that all the people
understand, and so are edified by it according to St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> who has enlarged so much on this matter,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> in a
whole Chapter, that it is strange, how any who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
the Authority of that Epistle, can deny it. Our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies
are such, that the Romanists cannot except to
any part of them: Our ceremonies are few, and these
be both decent and useful: So that in all the parts of
our Worship, we do so exactly agree to the Rule of the
Scriptures, and the Primitive Church, that they cannot
blame us for any one Rubrick or Collect in it. But for
their worship, It is in a Language not understood by
the people: who to be sure can receive no Edification,
from that they understand not; nor can they say <hi>Amen</hi>
to such Devotions. This is as it were in spite to St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> who took special care that as long as his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was in any esteem in the Church, such an abuse should
never creep into it. Nor is there a shadow of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for such a practice, from the Primitive Church, in
which for many Ages, the Worship was still in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Tongues.</p>
            <p>Next their Worship is so overcharged with many Rites
and Ceremonies, that the seriousness of Devotion must
needs be much alloyed by them. A great part of the
Worship is so whispered, as if they were muttering
Spells. Their Books of Exorcisms are the most indecent
things that can be: full of Charms and other ridiculous
Rites. And for the <hi>Pontifical</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> of their
Church, they may match with Heathenism for Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47937:9"/>
Their Offices are so various, and numerous, and
the Rubricks seem so full of disorder, that a man may as
soon learn a Trade, as know all the several parts of them.
How this can be reconciled to the Simplicity of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
or the Worshipping God in spirit and truth, may
be easily judged by those who can compare things.</p>
            <p>For the Sacraments, we have the Two that Christ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
Baptism, and the Lords Supper; And for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Confirmation, Ordination and Marriage, we have
them also among us, as they were appointed by Christ
and his Apostles: though we do not call these Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
For Extream Unction we find no warrant at all
for it, as a sacred Ordinance: and we are sure the Church
for many Ages did not think of it.<note place="margin">Matt. 28. 19.</note> For Baptism it is done
among us, in the very Form our Saviour appointed: and
this they do not deny. But among them they cannot be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that they are at all Baptized: since according to the
Doctrine of the necessity of the Intention of the Priest,
to the Being of a Sacrament, they cannot be assured of
it: for an Atheistical Priest can spoil their Baptism, so
that unless they can be certain of that, which is impossible
for them to know, I mean the Intention of the Priest,
they are not sure that they were ever truly Baptized.</p>
            <p>But for the Lords Supper, if any person will so far
trust his own Reason and senses, as to compare all the
Warrants we have in Scripture for that Ordinance, with
the Practice of our Church and theirs, they will soon
see who agree most to them.<note place="margin">Matt. 26. 26, 27. 28. ver.</note> 
               <hi>Christ took Bread which
he blessed and gave, saying, This is my Body which is
given for you. He also took the Chalice and said, Drink ye
all of it,</hi> &amp;c. All this we doe, and no more, so that it
is indeed a <hi>Communion</hi> among us: and those who have
read the account that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> gives us of the Rites
in the Communion in his days, would think he were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47937:10"/>
reading the very Abstract of our Office. But in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> besides the less material things, of the
Form of the Bread, the Consecration of Altars and Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
with the numberless little devices in the Canon of
the Mass, that they seem not of such importance
let these considerable changes they have made be looked
into.</p>
            <p>1. They have brought in the Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
against the clearest Evidence both of sense and
reason, against the nature of a Sacrament, and its being
a Memorial of Christs Death, and that by the very words
of Consecration, the Bread and Wine are Christs <hi>Body
and Blood,</hi> as the one was <hi>given for us,</hi> and the other <hi>shed
for us,</hi> on the Cross: and not as he is now at the Right
hand of God. The belief of this crept in by degrees,
from the eighth Century, in which it was first set on foot,
but much contradicted both in the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi>
Church: and was not fully setled till the 13th Century.
We are sure it was not the Doctrine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Asia, Antioch,</hi> nor <hi>Africk</hi> in
the 5th and 6th Centuries, by express Testimonies from
the most esteemed Authors of that time, <hi>Gelasius, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,
Ephrem, Theodoret,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They deny the Chalice to the Laity against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words of the Institution; and contrary both to the
Doctrine and Tradition of the Church for 1300 years.</p>
            <p>3. They have declared the Priests saying Mass, to be
an Expiatory Sacrifice for the Dead, and the Living,
though the Scripture plainly says, <hi>That Christ was once
offered for us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26, 28.</note> It is true the Primitive Church used the
words <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Oblation</hi> as our Church yet does, but
their meaning by that, was only in the general sense of
these terms, as Prayers, Praises, and Alms are called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:47937:10"/>
4. They have brought in a new piece of Worship,
which is the hearing of Mass, without receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
and it is now the great Devotion of their
Church. Though by the Institution, it is as express as can
be, that the Consecration is only in order to its being
a Communion. And by the Apostolical Canons, which
some in their Church believe to be the work of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and are by them all acknowledged to be a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Rites of the first Ages, all persons that were
present at the Worship, and did not communicate were
to be severely censured.</p>
            <p>5. The adoring the Sacrament, the exposing it on the
Altar, and carrying it about in solemn Processions, to be
worshipped, as they are late Inventions; so if Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
be not true, they are by their own confession
the grossest Idolatries that ever were,</p>
            <p>And are not these considerable variations from the first
Institution of this Sacrament?</p>
            <p>As for their own Sacraments, though there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to equal them, to either of these that were instituted
by Christ; yet some of them we use, as they were at first
appointed.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 17.</note> Persons Baptized, are Confirmed with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of hands, the only Ceremony used by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
            <p>We allow the use of Confession, and do press it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cases; and give the benefit of Absolution: but we
do not make this an Engin to screw peoples secrets from
them. For which there is no warrant in Scripture;
nor was it thought necessary for many Ages after the
Apostles. Confession of publick Scandals was enjoyned,
and for private sins it was recommended: but this latter
was not judged simply necessary for obtaining the pardon
of sin. And what noise soever they make of the good
that Confession, and the enjoyning of Pennance, may do,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47937:11"/>
if well managed, we need only appeal to some of
their own best Writers, now in <hi>France,</hi> whether as they
have been practised, they have not rather driven all true
Piety out of the world. If these abuses had been only
the faults of some Priests, the blame could not have been
justly cast on their Church; but when the publick Rules
given to Confessors, printed with Licence, are their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
for so doing, then their Church is in fault. So
that nothing is more common among them, than for
persons after a confession made of their sins, with a slight
sorrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some trifling pennance undergone, together
with the Priestly Absolution, to fancy themselves as clean
from all sin, as if they had never offended God. And this
being the Doctrin of their Church, it both lessens the
sense of sin, and takes men off from making such earnest
applications to God through Christ, as the Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>For Orders they are among us with the same Rites
that Christ and the Apostles gave them first:<note place="margin">Morinus.</note> And a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man of their own Church has lately published the
most ancient Forms of Ordinations he could find: From
which it appears, that all the Ceremonies in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations,
for the want of which they accuse us, were
brought in since the eighth Century: so that even by their
own Principles these things cannot be necessary to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
otherwise there were no true Orders in the
Church for the first eight Ages.</p>
            <p>For Marriage we honour it as Gods Ordinance;<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> and
since the Scriptures declare it <hi>honourable in all,</hi> without
exception, we dare deny it to none who desire it. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> delivers the Duty of Clergy-men towards their
Wives,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2. 4. 11.</note> with Rules for their Wives behaviour, which had
been very impertinent if Clergy-men might have no
Wives. We find a married Clergy in the first ten Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47937:11"/>
And we know by what base Arts the Caelibate of
the Clergy was brought in; and what horrid ill effects
it has produced. Neither do we allow of any devices to
hinder Marriage, by degrees of kindred not prohibited in
the Law of God, or the trade that was long driven in
granting Dispensations in those degrees, and afterwards
annulling these, and avoiding the Marriages that followed
upon them, upon some pretences of Law.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, how they have corrupted the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Sacraments, together with the Worship of
God.</p>
            <p>The last head of Religion is <hi>Government;</hi> and as to
this, we can challenge any to see what they can except
to us. First in reference to the Civil Power, we declare
all are bound for conscience sake to obey every lawful
Command of the Supream Authority, and to submit
when they cannot obey. We pretend to no Exemption
of Clarks from the Civil Jurisdiction, but <hi>give to Caesar
the things that are Caesars.</hi> We do not obey the King only
because he is of our Religion: much less do we allow of
Conspiracies or Rebellions upon our judging him an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,
so that we deliver no Doctrin that can be of any
ill consequence to the Society we live in.</p>
            <p>And for the Ecclesiastical Government we have Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Priests, and Deacons, rightly Ordained, and in
their due subordination to one another; every one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
these Offices due to his Function, which has
been the Governemnt of the Christian Church, since
the times of the Apostles. So that we have a clear vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Pastors among us, from whose hands every
person may without scruple receive all the Sacraments
of the Church.</p>
            <p>But for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how unsafe is the Civil
Government among them? not to mention the Doctrin
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47937:12"/>
of deposing Princes, for which I refer you to my former
Letter; What a security does the Exemption of Clerks
from the Civil Courts in cases criminal, give to loose
and debauched Church-men; and what disturbance must
this breed to a Common wealth? The denying the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate power to make Laws that concern Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or oblige Churchmen, takes away a great deal of
his Rights; for scarce any Law can be made but wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and ill-natur'd Churchmen, may draw it within
some head of Religion. And that this was frequently
done in former Ages, all that have read History know.
The quarrels that were in the beginning of this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury
between the Pope and the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> were
a fresh Evidence of it.</p>
            <p>But for the Ecclesiastical Government, they have spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in all the parts of it. The Pope has assumed a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of so vast an extent, and so arbitrary a nature, that all
the ancient Canons are thrown out of doors by it. We
know that originally the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were looked on
by the rest of the Church, as their Colleagues and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Bishops. The Dignity of the City made the See
more remarkable; and the belief of St. <hi>Peters</hi> having
founded it, with his suffering Martrydom there, with
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> made it much honoured: so that when the
Empire became Christian, then the Dignity of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
City made the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> be acknowledged
the first Patriarch. From this beginning they arose by
many degrees to the height of pretending to a Supremacy
both Civil and Spiritual: and then they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
appeals, which was all they at first pretended to,
but set up Legantine Courts every where, made the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
swear Obedience and Homage to them, and the
Arch-Bishops receive the Pall from their hands, in sign
of their dependance on them: Exempted Monasteries,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47937:12"/>
and other Clarks from Episcopal Jurisdiction, broke all
the Laws of the Church by their Dispensations: So
that no shaddow of the primitive Government does now
remain. And though <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great wrote with as
much indignation against the Title of <hi>Vniversal Bishop,</hi>
as ever any Protestant did; yet his Successors, have since
assumed both the Name and thing. And to that height
of Insolence, has this risen, that in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
all the Papal Party opposed the Decree that was put in,
for declaring Bishops to have their Jurisdictions by Divine
Right. The Court Party not being ashamed to affirm,
that all Jurisdiction was by Divine Right only in the
Pope; and in the other Bishops, as the Delegates of the
Apostolick See; and they were in this too hard for the
other Party. So that now a Bishop, who by the Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
ought to <hi>feed the Flock,</hi> can do no more in
that, then as the Pope gives him leave. The greatest
part of the Priests have no dependence on their Bishops.
The <hi>Monks, Fryars,</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> being immediately subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to the Pope; so that they do what they please,
knowing they can justifie any thing at <hi>Rome,</hi> and they
fear no Censure any where else.</p>
            <p>From this so many abuses have crept in, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists
have found out, so many devices to make them
Legal, that there is no hope of Reforming these at <hi>Rome.</hi>
The whole State of Cardinals is one great Corruption,
who, from being Originally the Parish Priests of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and so under all Bishops, have raised themselves so high
that they do now trample on the whole Order; and
pretend to an Equality with Princes. The giving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
to Children, the unlimitted Plurality of Benefices
in one Person; the Comendam's, the reserved Pensions,
with many other such like, are gross, as well as late Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
And no wonder if all men despair of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47937:13"/>
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> when these abuses are become
necessary to it, by which the greatness of the Cardinals and
the other Officers, or Ministers there, is kept up.</p>
            <p>I need not mention the gross <hi>Simony</hi> of that Court,
where all the world knows, every thing may be had
for money. The Popes themselves, are often Chosen by
these Arts: and if their own Rules be true, such Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with every thing that follows on them are void.
The Infinite Swarmes of the Inferiour Clergy, do plainly
drive a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Trade, by the Masses they say for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Souls, for Money. And for Publick Pennance,
they have Universally let it fall, in stead whereof private
Pennance is now in use. And if their own Writers say
true, this is made an Engine to serve other ends, when
by enjoyning slight and easie Pennances, they draw the
People after them; upon which the Jesuites have been
loudly accused, these Forty Years last past. In Sum,
all the Corruptions or rather defects, that are in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of our Church, are only such as they brought
in and have not met yet with such effectual remedies,
as must cure the Church of these inveterate Distempers,
their ill Conduct did cast her into.</p>
            <p>If any of that Party will review these Particulars, and
so far trust their own Reasons, as to judge according to
the plainest Evidence, they cannot resist the conviction
that they must needs meet with: when they see the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of our Faith, the Morality of our Doctrine, the
Purity of our Worship, and our Primitive Government;
and compare it with their vast Superfetation of Articles of
Faith, the Immorality of their Rules of living, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
if not Idolatry of their Worship, and the
most extravagant Innovations in Government, that are
in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed these things are so clear that few could
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47937:13"/>
resist the force of so much plain truth, if it were not
for some prejudices, with which they are so fettered that
they cannot examine matters with that freedom of mind,
that is necessary. Therefore much care must be taken, to
clear these, in the most familiar and demonstrative man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that is possible.</p>
            <p>They may be reduced to these Five chief Ones. <hi>First,</hi>
That the true Church cannot Err. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That out
of the true Church there is no salvation. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
the case of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is much safer than ours
is; since the Church of <hi>England</hi> acknowledges a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of salvation in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which they on
the other hand deny to the Church of <hi>England. Fourthly,</hi>
That unless there be a Supreme Judg set up, we can be
sure of nothing in Religion, but must fall into many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Parties. And <hi>Fiftly,</hi> That the Reformation was
but a Novelty begun in the former Age, and carried on
in this Nation, out of an ill design; and managed with
much Sacriledge.</p>
            <p>The First of these seemed necessary to be cleared in
the beginning of this Discourse, and I am deceived if it was
not done convincingly. And for the Second we agree
to it, That out of the true Church there is no Salvation.</p>
            <p>But then the Question comes, What makes one a
Member of the true Church? The Scriptures call the
Church the <hi>Body of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22, 23.</note> of which he is <hi>the Head.</hi>
So then whoever are joined to Christ according to the
Gospel, must be within the true Church. But the deceit
that lies hid under this, is, That from hence they fancy
that the Unity of the Church, does consist in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Communion with the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And upon
that they calculate, that there must be an Unity in the
Body of the Church: And that cannot be, except all
be joined to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now, we grant there is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47937:14"/>
but one Church, but this Unity consists not in an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Communion, though that is much to be desired,
but consists in an Unity of Belief, about the essentials of
Christianity.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more evident, than, that even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their own Principles, other Churches are not
bound upon the hazard of Damnation to hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> for it is not an Article of
Faith, nor certain according to their own Doctrine,
That the Pope is Infallible: And except that were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
we cannot be obliged to hold Communion under
such a Sanction with that See. For if it be possible that a
Pope may become an Heretick or Schismatick (which
many of them confess, and all agree that the contrary is
not of Faith,) then other Churches are not in that case
obliged to hold Communion with that See. If therefore
the possiblity of Error in that See be acknowledged,
then holding Communion with it, cannot be the measure
of the Unity of the Church. So we bring it to this Issue,
It is not Heresie to say, The Pope may Err: Therefore
this is no just prejudice against our Church, because we
have departed from Communion with him, when he
imposed his Errors on us. So all the high things they
boast of that See, come to nothing, except they say,
This Proposition is of Faith, <hi>That the Pope is Infallible.</hi>
And for these Meetings that they call General Councils;
they were at best but the Councils of the <hi>Western</hi> Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate
artificially packt, and managed with much Art;
as appears even from Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini's</hi> History of the
Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Third Prejudice, It is the most disingenuous
thing that can be; Because our Church is charitable, and
modest in her Censures, and theirs is uncharitable, and
cruel in her Judgments; therefore to conclude, That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47937:14"/>
with them is safer, than with us. If confidence,
and Presumption, Noise, and Arrogance, are the marks
to judge a Church by, we must yield to them in these:
but if Truth, and Peace, Charity and holy Doctrines,
be the better Standards, then we are as sure, that our
Communion is much safer. Let this Rule be applied to
the other concerns of human life, and it will appear how
ridiculous an abuse it is to take measures from so false
a Standard. If a man were sick, the Question comes,
Whether he shall use an approved Physitian, or a Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks.
On the one hand, the Montebank says, He will
certainly cure him, and the Doctors will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
kill him. On the other hand, the Doctor modestly
says, he will undertake nothing, but will do the best
he can; and for the Montebank he tells him, It is very
dangerous to trust to him, though he will not deny but
sometimes great cures are done by them. The Insolence
of the Montebank will never carry it against a Doctors
modesty, but among weak and credulous People; and
such must they also be, who are taken with this Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bankry
in Religion.</p>
            <p>But if this be taken to pieces, the folly of it will yet
appear more manifest. For <hi>First,</hi> the reason we give
for a possibility of Salvation in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is,
because we look on such and such things as the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
of Christianity, which are yet retained in that
Church: And either this Reasoning is true or false. If
it be true, then it is as true, that we may be saved,
who retain these Essentials of Christianity: If it is false,
then no Inference can be drawn from it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though
we yield a possiblity of Salvation in that Church, we
declare that they are in great danger, by many opinions
among them, which if fully understood and believed,
do even vitiate the Essentials of Christanity; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47937:15"/>
that Foundation of Religion, The Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man thorough Christ, formerly insisted
on. So that we declaring a Certainty of Salvation to
those who sincerely follow the rules of our Church, and
a great danger in their Church, the preferring their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
to ours, upon this account, is, as unreasonable, as to
sleep without shutting our Doors, because it is possible
we shall not be robbed, in so doing: Or when we are at
Sea to prefer a Cock-boat to a good clean Ship. These are
such absurdities, that an ordinary measure of weakness
cannot swallow them down. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are not so
forward as they imagine in yielding a possibility of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their Church. For our concession amounts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to this, that we do not deny it, than that we positively
affirm it: And therefore they have no reason to draw
these advantages from it.</p>
            <p>4. A great difference is to be made between what God
in the Infiniteness of his mercy may do, and what he is
bound to by the Covenant made with man in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
for the former we acknowledg, it is impossible to
fix the limits of that mercy which is as far above our
thoughts, as the heavens are above the Earth. And
how far it extends to all sincere minds, we are not so
presumptuous as to define; therefore we will not Damn
at pleasure, as they do, but we do assert, Their Church
is guilty of such gross Corruptions, by which the vitals
of Religion are vitiated, that they have not that reason
to claim the Mercies of the Gospel due by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>5. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has a dark and fair side; the
dark side is, what the true consequence of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is, the fair side is, what some witty men have devised
to palliate these corruptions with, and to deceive the
Vulgar by. We know many of that Communion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47937:15"/>
do not at all know these corrupt Doctrines, or
have such a fair representation made of them, that they
are thereby both more easily and more innocently misled.
From hence it is that we are inclined to hope more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
concerning some, that are abused by them. But
for those that have examined things more fully, or that
having been bred among us, yet reject the Truth, and
go over to them, we are not so much enclined to have
so good hopes of them, as they imagine: So this is a
weak and ill grounded conceit in all the parts of it.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Prejudice, is concerning the necessity of
Submitting to some Common Judg, of distrusting our
own reasons, and believing the Church, without which
there must be many Sects and Divisions: and this they
aggravate from the many different Parties that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us.</p>
            <p>But these are only specious pretences to deceive weak
people by. For First, If-it is necessary that there be a
Common Judg, it is most necessary that it be known,
who this Judg is, otherwise it is to no purpose to talk
of a Judge, if they cannot point him out. This is like
him that came to discover a huge Treasure that he knew
was hid under ground; but being asked in what place
it was? he answered he did not know that: and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
no body else knew. Some say the <hi>Pope</hi> is the
Judge, others as confidently, that the Council is Judge
even without the Pope, others think it is sure work to
say, the Pope and Council together: and others say the
Body of the Church spread over the World.</p>
            <p>For the Popes, some of them have been condemned
for Heresie, and others for making Schism; many of
them have been most horrid men: they are generally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in Divinity, being for most part bred to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47937:16"/>
Law: so that a great part of their own Church rejects
the Popes Infallibility.</p>
            <p>For Councils, they have had none these 115 years,
and the last was so over-ruled by the Popes, that no
other has been desired since: so that if either a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
without the Pope, or with him, be the Infallible
Judge they have lost their infallibility; and except a
Council were constantly sitting, they can shew no living
and speaking Judg. So that either this is not necessary
to a Church, or otherwise they are not a compleat
Church. And for the Body of the Church, how shall
a man find out their sense, unless gathered together in
some Assembly? or must a Man go over Christendome,
and gather the Suffrages of all the Pastors of the Church?
Upon the whole matter it is plain that after all their
Canting about the Church, they must say, that it is of
Faith that the Pope is Infallible, otherwise they have no
Infallible Judg, and since a Council cannot be called
but by the Pope, what ever Authority the Council has
it can never be exercised, but by the Popes leave.</p>
            <p>And for all the sad consequences they say, follow the
want of a Common infallible Judg, it appears they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them as well as we; but with this difference, that we
plainly acknowledg, we have none, but do the best we
can without one: But they, as they have none, no more
than we, yet are under the Tyranny of one, and though
they are not bound to believe him Infallible, yet are as
much enslaved to him, and obliged to obey him, as if he
were really exempted from all possibility of Erring. So
that in short, they are slaves and we are freemen. And
for these ill consequences, they are, we confess, unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
for which we have very good Authority, from
his words, who on all sides is acknowledged to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47937:16"/>
that said,<note place="margin">Matt. 18. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Wo be to the World for scandals, for
it is necessary that scandals do come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to discuss this Objection, which works much on
ignorant people, let it be considered that sin and Error
are the two things, that do chiefly cross the design of
the Gospel: and of these two, sin, is the more dangerous
and destructive: since there is great reason to hope that
Error cannot be so fatal, when it infects a mind that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
sincere, as Sin, which clearly defaces the Image
of God in the Soul. We ought not therefore to expect
that the Gospel, should give any further security against
Error, than it gives against Sin: On the contrary we
should rather expect a further security from Sin, because
it is most hurtful. But all the Provision made against
Sin, is this, that in the Scriptures we are warned of the
evil of it, and are directed to such methods, and have
the promises of such Assistance, that if we use our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
we shall not be overcome by sin, nor perish in it:
So as to Error, we have the same security. The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
affords us a very clear light for directing our Belief
in the most important things, which if we study with
due humility, and sincerity, imploring God for the grace
of his holy Spirit, for our instruction, we shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from Error. And thus the same provision is made
against Error, that is against Sin. And we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to expect more. And as it were not fit, that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be offered without obliging men to use their
utmost endeavours, so it were not fit to give such an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
Remedy against Error, as that a man should not need
to employ his reason to discover Truth, and avoid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.
<hi>If our Gospel be also hid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>it is hid in them that
perish.</hi> Therefore that our Searches after Truth, may
be both encouraged and rewarded, God sets it before us
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47937:17"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47937:18"/>
in such a Light, that it is our own fault if we do not see
and follow it. But if men will either blindly give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up, to the conduct of such Guides, whose inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
it is to mislead them, which is the case of the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> or out of humour, or other base ends, will invent
or follow some erroneous Tenets, as other Hereticks do,
they have themselves to blame; and shall bear their own
Iniquity: but they have nor reason to cast the fault upon
God, or accuse the Scriptures, of Darkness, or Defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in these things that are necessary to Salvation.</p>
            <p>I come now to the last Prejudice, which will require
a fuller Discussion, because it relates to matter of Fact:
which as it is better understood, so it makes deeper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on people, that are not so much wrought on by
speculative points, as by these things that fall under
their senses.</p>
            <p>They first except to the Novelty of our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and always insult with this Question, <hi>Where was
your Religion before Luther?</hi> To this, these things are to
be opposed. <hi>First,</hi> we turn back the Question and ask
them where was their Religion the first six hundred
years after Christ? Where was the Worship of Images,
the Doctrine of the Corporal Presence, of Redeeming
out of Purgatory, of Deposing Princes, and of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
Saints, before the Eighth Century? If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
be now to be condemned, because of its No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
these things were then to be as much condemned,
because they were then Novelties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> If the Reformation had brought in any new
Doctrine, its Novelty were indeed a just Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it: but it was only the throwing out of these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
which had been brought in, in some dark and
Ignorant Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:47937:18"/>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Doctrine of the Reformed Church, is
no other than what Christ and his Apostles taught; and
what the Church believed for many Ages after them.
And as to the Positive part of it, it has been still held by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is yet acknowledged by them:
but with so many Additions, that there was a Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Reforming these: And this is often to be inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in them, that there is no Article of Faith, nor any
other material point of Religion, among us that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They only blame us
because we do not in many other points believe as they
do: and this we ought not to do, unless we could see
an equal Authority binding us to all alike.</p>
            <p>Another Exception is, that in the Reformation we
made a Schism, and broke the Unity of the Church, whereas
if there had been any things amiss in the Church, they say
the Reformers should have endeavoured to remove
them, without tearing the Body of Christ in pieces.</p>
            <p>But in answer to this, we acknowledg if the things
complained of, could have been continued without sin,
they ought not to have departed from the Communion
of other Churches: but when the publick Liturgies and
the Worship was found to be full of such Corruptions,
that without Idolatry and Superstition, they could be no
longer kept up, then it was not time to stay for the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Neighbouring Churches.</p>
            <p>Yet if there had been any probable hopes, that the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> would have concurred in such a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it had been worth staying for, as long, as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
But when it was on the contrary, apparent, that
all the most just Remonstrances made to that Court,
were answered at best with delays and Excuses if not
with Excommunications and other censures; they had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47937:19"/>
no reason to expect any concurrence from thence. So
the case being thus put, that they discovered such Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in the Worship of God, with which they could
not comply any longer; either they were obliged to
Worship God against their Consciences, or to lay aside
all publick Worship, or else to cast out these Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by a Reformation. Let any man of good reason
judge, whether the last of these was not to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen?</p>
            <p>There was no Obligation lying on this Church to
wait for the pleasure of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or our
neighbouring Churches in this matter. We are a free
and Independent Church: we owe a charitable and
neighbourly Correspondence to forreign Churches; but
we are subject to none of them. And according to the
express Decision of one of the first General Councils, in
the like case, we were no way subordinate to the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> even as it was the Patriarchate of the West.
Themselves do confess that it is no Heresie to say, That
See is fallible: and therefore we were not obliged to
dance attendance at that Court, when we discovered
the Corruptions, with which it had deceived the
World; but might in our National or Provincial Synods
at home, examine and Reform whatever errors were
among us. And the multitude of those who held these
errors, could be no just ground for delaying any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
towards a Reformation; no more than in the ancient
Church, the Orthodox Bishops when chosen into a See
corrupted with Arrianism, were obliged because that
Contagion was generally spread, to make no attempts
toward Reformation.</p>
            <p>They Except further, That the Reformation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
here by a vitious Prince, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47937:19"/>
who partly out of revenge, because the Pope would not
grant his desire about the Divorce of his Queen, and
partly to enrich himself and his Courtiers with the sale
of Abbey-lands did suffer these Doctrins first to take
head here: and therefore they can have no good opinion
of any thing that came from so wicked a man, and upon
such ill motives.</p>
            <p>If this be a good Argument against the Reformation,
it was as good against Christianity upon <hi>Constantine</hi>'s
turning Christian; for the Heathen Writers represent
him with as black a character as they can do King <hi>Henry.</hi>
But we must not think ill of every thing that is done
by a bad man, and upon an ill Principle: Otherwise if
we had lived in <hi>Iehu</hi>'s days, the same Plea would have
been as strong, for keeping up the Idolatry of <hi>Baal:</hi> since
<hi>Iehu</hi> had in a very unsincere manner destroyed it: and
yet God rewarded him for what he had done.</p>
            <p>But whatever might have been King <hi>Henry</hi>'s secret
motives, his proceedings were regular and justifiable.
He found himself married to her that had been his own
Brothers Wife, contrary to the express words of the
Law of God. The Popes Legat, and his own Confessor
and all the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> (except one) thought his
scruples were well grounded. Upon which according
to the superstition of that time, he made his applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for a Divorce: which were at
first well received, and a Bull was granted. Afterwards
some defects being found in that, a more ample one was
desired, which was also granted: and Legats were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to try the matter. But the Pope soon after turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over to the Emperors Party, whose Aunt the Queen
was: and was thereupon prevailed with, to recal the
Legats Commission, destroy the Bull, and cite the King
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47937:20"/>
to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> where all things and persons were at
the Emperors devotion. Upon all this, the King did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate
with the Pope, that either his business was just,
or unjust: if it was just why did he recall what he had
granted, and put him off with such delays. If it was
not just, why did he at first grant the Bull for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.
This was unanswerable, but the Pope did still seed
him with false hopes, yet would do nothing. Upon
which he consulted the chief Universities, and the most
learned men in Christendom, about his Marriage. Twelve
famous Universities, and above an hundred learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
did declare under their hands and Seals (some wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
larger Treatises about it) that his Marriage was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Law of God. And that in that case the Popes
Dispensation, which had allowed the Marriage, was void
of it self. So after the King had been kept in suspence
from <hi>December</hi> 1527 till <hi>February 1533/4.</hi> above six years,
he set his Divines to examin what authority the Pope
had in <hi>England,</hi> either by the Law of God, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Primitive Church, or the Law of the Land,
and after a long and accurate search, they found He had
no authority at all in <hi>England,</hi> neither by the Laws of
God, of the Church, nor of the Land: so this Decision
was not made rashly, nor of a sudden.</p>
            <p>The Popes Authority being thus cast off, it was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
in the next place to Consider, what Doctrines were
then held in <hi>England,</hi> upon no other grounds-than Papal
Decrees. For it was absurd to reject the Popes power;
and yet to retain these Opinions, which had no better
Foundation than his Authority. Upon this many of the
things, which had been for some Ages received in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> fell under debate: And, a great
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47937:20"/>
many particulars were reformed. Yet, that King was
so leavened with the Old Superstition, that the progress
of the Reformation, was but slow during his Reign.
But it was carried on to a further perfection, under King
<hi>Edward,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> In all their Methods of
proceeding, there is nothing that can be reasonably cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured:
if it be confessed that the Pope is not Infallible,
and the whole Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledges that it is
no Heresie to deny his Infallibility.</p>
            <p>And for the Sale of the Abby-lands, they only spoiled
the spoilers. For the <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Fryers,</hi> had put these
publick cheats on the Nation, of Redeeming Souls out
of Purgatory, going on Pilgrimages, with the worship
of Saints, and Images, which were infused in the vulgar,
by many lying Stories, pretended Apparitions, the false
shew of Miracles, with other such like Arts. And the
credulous and superstitious Multitudes were thereby
wrought on, to endow these Houses with their best
Lands, and adorn their Churches with their Plate and
richest Furniture. It was not to be expected that when
their Impostures were discovered, they should enjoy the
spoil they had made by them: nor was it for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
interest of the Nation, to give such encouragement
to idleness, as the converting all these Houses to Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for an unactive life would have been. Many of
them were applied to good Uses, Bishopricks, Cathedral
and Collegiat Churches, Hospitals, and free Schools:
And more of them ought indeed to have been converted
to these ends. But the excesses of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and his
Courtiers must not be charged on the Reformers; who
did all they could to hinder them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47937:21"/>
And thus all these prejudices with which the Vulgar
are misled, appear to be very unjust, and ill grounded.
In conclusion, If by these or such like considerations,
any that are now of that Communion, can be brought
to mind Religion in earnest, considering it, as a Design
to save their Souls, by making them truly pure and holy;
and so reconciling them to God through Christ: And
if they will examine Matters without Partiality, seeking
the truth and resolving to follow it, wherever they
find it; and joyn with their Enquiries, earnest Prayers
to God, <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> to open their eyes, and
grant them his Holy Spirit, to lead them into all truth;
there is little doubt to be made, but the great Evidence
that is in Truth, will in due time appear so clear to them
as to dissipate all these mists, which Education, implicite
Faith, and Superstition have raised, by which they have
hitherto darkened.</p>
