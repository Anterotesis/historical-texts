            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing finished my <hi>SAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTVARIE,</hi> and finding it to haue taken roote and life for some conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; I could not conceiue any better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of those houres, which I haue resolued to sequester for exercises in this kinde; then in making my conceptions legible vpon those Psalmes of DAVID, which liuely describe, both the forme
<pb facs="tcp:27771:3"/>
and the force of true repentance. Partly in regard of the generall dignity of the whole Booke of Psalmes, largely extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by many; but chiefly in regard of the eminent excellency of these Penitentiall Psalmes, which heereafter I entend particularly to declare. And heerein I aime at no priuate end, but <hi>designe,</hi> and <hi>resigne</hi> my endeuors wholly to the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the All-powerfull GOD: to whom <hi>Glory</hi> is so proper, that nothing is more repugnant to reason, then either not to attribute it to him, or to seeke to draw it to our selues.</p>
            <p>For albeit GOD, who is all fulnesse and perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ction, cannot receiue accesse or increase; yet by praysing and blessing his exteriour workes, we enlarge and spread his glory to others. This praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because we cannot incorporate into his essence, whereto no addition can bee
<pb facs="tcp:27771:3"/>
made: we are sayd to attribute to his NAME. For the NAME of a thing is separate, and externall from the thing which it serueth to signifie; and neither a part nor of the substance therof.</p>
            <p>But we on the other side, are inwardly hollow and empty, and alwaies wanting some amendment. Wherefore we haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe to labour in repairing that. We must not play our part for exteriour shewes; but inwardly, within our selues, where no eies shine but our owne. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we shalbe like to an Egge long coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with salt; the shell wherof wilbe faire and sound, but the inward substance alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether consumed. Or like an vnwise hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-starued beggar; more desirous of a faire garment, then of necessary meat. Hee who seekes himselfe abroade; who regardes more what hee is to
<pb facs="tcp:27771:4"/>
to others, then to himselfe; who doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, because he would be so esteemed; shall neuer produce profitable effect. As the intention is vaine, so wilbe the euent. But if constantly wee pursue reason and piety, let approbation of others follow if it please: as neither vainly desired, so not rigidly to be contemned.</p>
            <p>Much lesse must they expect any benefit by their trauailes, who retire themselues to priuate studies. For they liue not out of themselues, they study not other mens humours, they applie not their thoughts to the time. And this is the reason wherfore many well esteemed for sufficiency, whose vertue forbids them to be base, hang vnder the wheele, and cannot aduance. Yea, sometimes it happeneth, that whilest they are most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly busied, men of scornefull and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
<pb facs="tcp:27771:4"/>
ignorance, separate from all imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table qualities or endeauours, will be nimble to nippe from them such small matters as they haue.</p>
            <p>I confesse I haue beene bitten by some such Vipers; who thinke nothing suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they haue, nothing dishonest that they doe. But I enuie not the grauell in any mans throat. It sufficeth for mee that I haue attained a quiet contented life, free either from anguish in my selfe, or enuie at others: free either from wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great matters, or wanting some small: a life fit for serious cogitations.</p>
            <p>The rich compositions of Ancient times, I reuerence and admire; they doe not only satisfie, but astonish mee. I see them not to the depth, but I see them so farre, that I conceiue the farthest reach of our age cannot neerely approach
<pb facs="tcp:27771:5"/>
them. Of my owne productions, neuer any did fully content mee, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others is no warrant to my owne iudgement; tender and seuere in what I doe. They may happily bee somewhat sprinkled ouer, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died, I conceiue they are not. And in case any thing be excusable in them, it is not in regard of themselues, but in comparison of some other form-lesse vnsinewie writings; whereto notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I finde good allowance to bee giuen. Assuredly, knowing my owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and defects, I wonder much at the constant assurance of many others.</p>
            <p>But modestie forbids vs to speake good or ill of our selues. I haue heere vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a difficult taske, in writing vpon these high parts of Scripture. I did put forth two of these psalmes at the first, for
<pb facs="tcp:27771:5"/>
an assay, as before I did the like in my <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> And finding some accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I haue now added a third: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proceede in some of the rest. And wherein I finde no encouragement from others, I will remaine satisfied with my owne contentments For by entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my thoughts in these sweet retreits, how many tedious and friuolous cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue I auoyded? How many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and discontentments haue I therein buried? Let others hungerly hunt after fauour and wealth, the common drudgery of the world: let them spend their spirit and honestie in vnciuill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings. I desire and pray, that this heauenly harmony may alwayes ring in my eares; that I may close the last pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of my life with one of these songs of Sion.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the first of those Psalms which are called Penitentiall; and according to the version of Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and of <hi>Felix,</hi> beareth this inscription or title, <hi>A Psalme of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Dauid to him that vanquisheth</hi> (pro octaua) <hi>for an instrument of eight strings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was the Authour of this Psalme, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> is nothing doubted; not only because it hath beene

both anciently and generally so receiued, but because diuers passages of the Psalme doe plainely seeme to import no lesse. For therein is liuely expressed a most exquisite sense of sorrow and griefe; agreeable, as well to the greatnesse both of the person and sinne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as to the large measure of grace, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he did obtaine. It maketh mention also of (<hi>stratum)</hi> a kinde of couch vsed by men of eminent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> dignity; which as <hi>Dauid</hi> had defiled with adulterous embracements, so did hee there chiefly exercise his sorrow, so did he there plentifully powre foorth his teares.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> Now, in this life we are neuer at perfect peace, we are trauayled with continuall conflicts, wherin some armour is of necessary vse. But in these spirituall combats, sorrow, sighes, groanes, and teares are the onely armour of defence, the onely weapons of aduantage; by which wee atchieue true victory and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> triumph. For this cause it is sayd, that <hi>the iust shall flourish as a Palme tree.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 92.11</note> For as the Palme tree doeth flourish best vnder greatest weight; so vnder many difficulties and oppressions the iust must mount to their highest hopes. And therefore because by these armes <hi>Dauid</hi> did preuayle, not onely against his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemies, not only against his inward troubles and perplexities, but against the wrath and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Almighty GOD: because by these meanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> his griefe was turned into ioy: because hee beganne with bitter anguishes, and ended in exultation and

That their Counsailes shall bee confounded, their practises disappointed, and themselues turned to ignominy and reproach.</p>

I say more. They doe but make a man know how little he knowes; because all our knowledge consisteth in knowing our ignorance: and the most that a man can know of any Science in this world, is but the least part of that, whereof he is ignorant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:27771:45"/>But the knowledge of GOD, is the foundation of our Spirituall building; the first wheele of the clocke; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> the first moueable spheare, which causeth the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the rest. We are created in this world, to the end that we should serue GOD: But wee cannot serue him, vnlesse we loue him, vnlesse also wee feare him; and we can neither loue nor feare him vnlesse we know him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen as some rurall people haue not onely not honoured, but rudely intreated their Prince, comming by aduenture and vnknowen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. But it is not sufficient to beleeue that there is a GOD, to haue a confused knowledge of him; vnlesse we know what he is to vs, &amp; what we are to him: vnles we put of our shooes, that is al worldly affections, GOD wil not manifest himselfe to vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this done</hi> the knowledge of his goodnes will make vs to loue him; of his Iustice, to feare him; of his Maiestie, to honour him; of his Mercie, to hope in him; of his Wisedome, to obey him. <hi>My eye seeth thee</hi> (saith <hi>Iob) and therefore I repent in dust and ashes.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now againe, Albeit nothing bee so neere vs as our selues; yet the knowledge of our selues is furthest from vs. There is nothing almost that wee lesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, then our selues. For as our bodily eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold other obiects, but not themselues; so the eye of our minde, namely our vnderstanding, is apt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend other things, but not it selfe. It is nimble to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:27771:46"/>
discouer, strong and bold to iudge other matters; but is defectiue both in sight to discerne, and in iudgement to esteeme it selfe: For this cause the ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers affirme, that this voice <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; <hi>Know thy selfe</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> was first sounded from heauen. For this cause it was written in golden letters, vpon the doore of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple; either because it is proper onely to GOD; or because it is the highest wisedome whereto man can aspire; or because it is the onely entrance to the knowledge and seruice of GOD. For albeit GOD may be seene in all his creatures, yet especially in our selues who beare his Image. Thou seekest GOD abroad, but enter the secret chambers of thy soule, and there he may most readily be found. The better thou knowest thy selfe, the better thou knowest GOD; because the knowledge of thy selfe will lead thee to the knowledge of GOD.</p>

               </gap>litie is nothing else but a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our selues, which proceedeth from the knowledge of our selues: so as the knowledge of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:27771:46"/>
our selues is the forme of humilitie, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of all other vertues which are deriued from humilitie.</p>
            <p>And this great benefite did the mercie of GOD bring to <hi>Dauid,</hi> by reason of his sinne; To vnderstand his owne weakenesses and wants; to vnderstand by whom he must be supported in the one, and supplied in the other; To vnderstand (I say) both GOD and himselfe. The fall of <hi>Dauid</hi> did extinguish in him all puffie pride; it shaked vp his sensuall, or rather sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse securitie; it made him neuer to presume vpon his owne strength; but in all temptations and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to trust truely to the power and goodnesse of GOD; and to hope for no helpe, no stay, but onely from his all-powerfull grace. Hee that is sinfull and yet secure, is doubly miserable; miserable in his sinne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> but more miserable in his securitie. And thus GOD neuer suffereth euill but for some great and secret good; euen as <hi>Moses</hi> had said:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vt sugeret mel de pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra, &amp; oleum de saxo duris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>He caused him to sucke honie out of the rocke, and oyle out of the hardest stone.</hi> O the infinite wisedome and power of GOD! out of the drie and ragged rocke of our sinnes,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.13.</note> hee draweth the sweet sappe of humilitie from vs, and of mercie from himselfe; to the sweet safetie and felicitie of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> soules. Assuredly, some things may bee so good, as that they haue no mixture of euill: yet nothing can be so absolutely euill, but some good ariseth from it.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that the LORD calleth himselfe <hi>a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> hard-man; who reapeth where he did not sow, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth where he did not disperse.</hi> But,<note place="margin">

of Iustice? It is hard indeed; but how is it iust? to reap where thou didst not sow, &amp; gather where thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not disperse? Verely, thou sowest not the seeds of our sinnes; our sinnes are the tares which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell soweth among the wheate: and yet thou reapest out of them, both good to thy seruants, and glorie to thy selfe. By our sinnes thou doest bring vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand our selues, and to search after thee: to know our owne exceeding weakenesse and miserie, and to acknowledge thine infinite goodnesse, wisedome and power: to abandon and renounce the one, &amp; to trust entirely to the other.</p>

For there are two wayes out of this world; one, through the pleasures of sinne to eternall mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; the other, through the sorrowes of repentance to eternall glory. <hi>Blessed</hi> are they who are in this sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull way, for onely they trauaile to eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.

faith and by hope they are <hi>blessed.</hi> This onelie is the difference betweene Saints in heauen, and sinners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> that repent vpon earth: the one haue their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in hand, the other in hope: they are at their iourneyes end, these are vpon their way: they haue their <hi>blessed</hi> estate in possession, these in election.

               <p>Verely, as sinne is no small or ordinarie matter, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> is forgiuenesse of sinne no ordinarie blessing. Sinne is so hainous a thing, that it is a lesse euill to destroy all the creatures in the world, then to commit one sinne against GOD. Yet such is the power of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that by meanes thereof, GOD will not onely forgiue our sinnes, but he will forget them; Hee will so deale with penitent sinners, either as if hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seene their sinnes, or as if he had perpetually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got them: Hee will neuer either behold or remember their sinnes to iudge them. Marueilous is the mercy and goodnesse of GOD, towards sinners that repent: The more they remember their sinnes, the more doth he forget them; the readier they are to acknowledge their offences, the readier is he to couer and conceale them.</p>
               <p>It is a verie great blessing to haue our sinnes <hi>couered</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> because nothing is more hardly kept secret then sinne.

The more hee endeauored to hide himselfe, the more did his transgression appeare; the very hiding of himselfe did bewray his sinne.

               <p>It is a very hard thing which GOD cannot doe. But herein hath GOD restrained his power. GOD cannot be mercifull, vnlesse sinners repent: without repentance it is impossible that sinners should be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> because it is impossible without repentance to abandon euill, and turne to GOD. For sinne is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but an <hi>auersion</hi> from GOD, and a <hi>conuersion</hi> to creatures; an <hi>auersion</hi> from an inestimable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable good, and a <hi>conuersion</hi> to a vaine and variable euill. This sinne is neuer pardoned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quis est homo qui vult vitam, &amp;c. diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te a malo &amp; fac bonum.</hi> Psal. 33.</note> but by forsaking creatures, and by applying our selues againe to GOD; by turning againe from euill to good; by inward loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the transitory euill, whereto by pleasure wee did adhere; and by fixing our delight vpon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good, which will neuer either varie or faile.</p>
               <p>But this is a proper worke of repentance, this is repentance it selfe. Whosoeuer is thus conuerted in soule, he is truely penitent; hee is <hi>blessed</hi> in this life,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:27771:54"/>
the LORD will impute no sinne vnto him. And the reason is, because he imputeth sinne to himselfe; hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> preuenteth the imputation of the LORD, by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sinne to himselfe: he chargeth, iudgeth, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe; and therefore he shall neuer be, either condemned, or questioned by the LORD.</p>
               <p>For a superiour Iudge will neuer examine that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which hee knoweth to be both examined and iusticed by his commission. But GOD hath giuen to sinners, not onely commission, but command, to examine and iudge themselues: which if they will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially doe, hee hath promised that hee will neuer iudge them, that hee will neuer impute sinne to their charge. The Iustice of GOD requireth that sinne should be examined, condemned and punished: but the great mercie of GOD hath made sinners their owne Iudges, their owne executioners and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: It putteth them in choise, either to iudge and condemne their sinne, or to bee iudged and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their sinne: either to put sinne to death in this world, or to die for sinne in the world to come. But <hi>blessed</hi> is hee who embraceth this mercie; who doeth examine and condemne his sinnes; who doeth impute sinne to himselfe, that GOD may not impute his sinnes vnto him.</p>

               <p>For herein especially we must be regardfull, that we iudge vprightlie, that we giue no false sentence, whether by negligence, or by partialitie and selfe-loue: that our iudgement be not either <hi>muzled</hi> by the one, or <hi>misse-led</hi> by the other.

For I could not bee altogether ignorant; the checke of my owne conscience did often aduertise me, that my soule was drenched in two Stygian streames of corruption, originall and actuall: the one deriued to me by descent, the other proceeding from my proper will. For, by reason of the fall of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> first parent, his bloud was atteint, and corruption was so fast fixed in his nature, that hee transmitted that leprosie to all who euer descended from him. This is the seede of all actuall sinnes, this is in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer all sinnes in the world. Not onely if wee act the wicked motions thereof, but if we yeeld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto them, if without consent we take pleasure in thinking of them, then they turne to actuall sinnes.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Sometimes the Diuell did stupifie and benumme my soule; and then I had little or no feeling of my sinne, then sinne lay concealed in me: then either I entertayned no thought, or else was dull and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to acknowledge my sinnes. But as how much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> the longer any filthy liquor standeth in a vessell, so much the more is the vessell fouled and stayned, and so much the more hardly can the foule staines bee rubbed cleane: So the longer time that poysonous sinne remayned in my bosome, with a quiet and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled custome, the more was my vnhappy soule soyled therewith; the more deepe staines were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein, and the more hard to be defaced.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Sometimes I was so sensible of my sinnes, so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiue both of the number &amp; deformity of them, that I became thereby either ashamed or afrayd to confesse them to the LORD; to desplay them before those beautifull eyes, which are much offended with such impure obiects. The shame and the feare which the Diuell tooke away when I committed sinne, hee restored againe when I should confesse them. And as an expert captaine who besiegeth a fort, doeth first blocke vp all passages by which it may receiue any ayd: so the Diuell did in such sort <hi>beset</hi> and <hi>besot</hi> my soule, that he stopped all the wayes by which repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance might relieue it. I was easily perswaded not to stirre the vnsauory puddle, not to digge the filthy dunghill of my sinnes to the bottome. For who can answer the iust charge? Who dares thinke vpon the iust punishment for his offences? In this life hee may expect whole armies of euils; and death which is to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:27771:57"/>
others the port of their tempestuous nauigation, to him will seeme a gulfe both of intolerable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments.</p>
               <p>So I sottishly sought to hide my sinnes in my own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> obliuion: I did foolishly flatter my selfe, that thou, O LORD, wouldest neuer remember what I did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; that my offences locked vp in my owne silence, should bee close shut from thy knowledge or regard: I vainely thought that by not speaking, or not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my sinnes, I should most readily extinguish the memory of them.</p>
               <p>But as fire, the lesse vent it hath, the more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously it burneth: And as a festred and rotten sore, not opened and cleansed, which the Patient doth not vnfold to the Chyrurgian, and both desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his helpe; putrefieth and enflameth the more, and the more doeth the corruption both penetrate and spread: So my sinnes, whilest they were smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red within my owne conscience, whilest they were not by confession layd open to thee, did not onely more terribly anguish and torment me, but did deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infect the very substance of my soule. The conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of sinne did spread like a leprosie ouer euery part; the strongest vertues were infected therewith; all the faculties were drawne to a habite of euill. They did not only anguish me, but they did waste and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> me, they drew thy heauie iudgements vpon me; the dangers which they brought vpon mee, were no lesse then was the disquiet.</p>
               <p>For I felt in my soule, besides the sharpe sting of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> my conscience, the heauie blowes, and more heauie

threats of thine indignation. Many calamities thou didst also cast vpon my body, &amp; vpon the issue of my affaires. And so sharpelie didst thou visit mee, both outwardlie and within; that failing, or at least fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in body and minde, I sunke downe vnder the charge, and melted my languishing soule into moane. My calamities daily encreased, and therewith also my complaints: I <hi>complayned dayly,</hi> but <hi>duly</hi> &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I did not <hi>complaine.</hi> For I saw into what miseries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> I was deiected, I saw to what mischiefe I did bend my pace: but I neither endeuoured nor intended to cut off, either the cause of the one, or course of the other.</p>
               <p>I did not search into the state of my soule, I did not vnderstand it, I did not lay it open before thee. I did not blame, I did not accuse my selfe vnto thee. I did not returne to thee, I did not put my selfe into thy hands for helpe. I <hi>complayned</hi> for my calamities; but not for the cause of my calamities. I <hi>complayned</hi> for the punishment of my sinnes; but I neuer thought of my sinnes themselues. I had onely so much good left, as to see my present euill, and to languish in my distresse: my <hi>consuming</hi> encreased my <hi>complaints,</hi> and my <hi>complaints</hi> encreased my <hi>consuming</hi>; but I could not spie any sparke of comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> These calamities didst thou execute vpon mee, to draw me to a higher, to driue mee to a deeper consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my selfe. For as in diseases, the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to recouery, is the finding of the originall cause; so in troubles and distresses, there is small hope of helpe, vnlesse we discerne from what fountaine they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:27771:58"/>
flow. And therefore thou doest often presse vs with a heauie hand, that we should vnderstand our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against thee, that we should both know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our offences, that we should disburthen our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of that loathsome loade, which otherwise would poyson our soules to death. This is the cause of our calamities; and from hence must begin our reliefe.</p>
               <p>So thou didst send firie Serpents among thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in their passage through the deserts,<note place="margin">Numb. 21.</note> which ceased not to sling them to death, vntill they did confesse their sinnes. And for this cause thou didst call <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> in Paradise; not for that thou knewest not where he was, but to giue him occasion to acknowledge his transgression. The Diuell thou didst not call, Thou gauest sentence against the Diuell, vncalled, vnheard; because his will was inflexible, hee could not repent, he would not confesse that hee had done euill. But thou didst call man, because hee could acknowledge his sinne. Because man hath a power to repent his offences, and confesse them to thee, it pleaseth thee still by diuers meanes and occasions to call vs.</p>
               <p>But assuredly, the most powerfull meanes, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> most violent voyce to call vs to thee is by aduersity: more sinners are turned to thee by aduersity, then by prosperity; by feare, then by loue; by shame, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> by hope. Sinners, for the most part,<note place="margin">I called vpon the Lord in trouble, &amp; hee heard mee at large. <hi>Ps.</hi> 118.</note> are like to the spring of the Sun in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> which at midday is very cold, &amp; at midnight exceeding hot. We grow cold by prosperity; but by calamities our deuotion is enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. As much feeding vpon sweet meates, maketh

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> Hence it followeth, that it is a great mercy of GOD, to be trauailed and euen tired with labour in this life: It is a true token of his loue, it is a sure signe that hee hath not giuen vs ouer, that he is desirous to conuert vs to him. Man is like the earth, which vnlesse it bee torne vp with the plough, vnlesse it bee harrowed, digged and raked, bringeth foorth wilde weeds, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> little else. Troubles are GODS husbandrie vpon vs. To be spurned by all, to bee a marke whereat all men aime their arrowes, to be <hi>pressed</hi> with wants, to bee <hi>oppressed</hi> with wrongs, to haue our life perpetually run in a rugged way; are good assurances, or rather effects, both of his loue and of his care. They are the whips which make madde sinners sober: they are the batterie which enforce obstinate and rebellious hearts, to yeeld to the seruice and subiection of GOD: they are the arrowes which GOD hath taken out of the quiuer of his mercy, and winged with the fire of his Loue. To pierce and to warme our hard icie hearts, he hath tempered his arrowes of tribulation with mercy, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed them with his Loue.</p>

Who shall defend thee? whither wilt thou retire? Goe too now; Goe seeke for some mantle to veile thy obscene darkenesse: For thou canst not with any conscience (in case thou hast any) approach into the presence of the LORD. What? expectest thou to be releeued by him? Thinkest thou he will fauour thee? Nay, Is it possible that hee should forbeare thee? Seest thou not that he also is set against thee? That his hand is rigorous vpon thee? And how can it be otherwise? For GOD is iust; a hard dealer; a seuere exacter of accompts. Looke into the examples of his iustice: How he condemned his angels irreuocablie, for one only sinne; how for one only sinne, not onlie <hi>Adam</hi> but all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, and in a manner all creatures were cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p>If thou conceiuest comfort by reason of some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which followed this iustice; then compare this iustice and mercy together, by the continuall course of their effects. See how in all ages, both the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and most flourishing parts of the world, haue lien buried in infidelity. See how in those few parts, ouer which the light of trueth hath displaied her beames, many millions haue bin blinded, either by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or by superstition and errour. See how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea how most of those, who haue receiued true knowledge; either by delicacie, or other viciousnesse of life, reape no benefit thereby. So as it is apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie true, that <hi>many are called, and few are chosen</hi>: that the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:27771:61"/>
way to saluation is so difficult, and the gate so strait, that it is passable for very few.</p>
               <p>Few indeed: For how many were in the whole world, when it was ouerwhelmed with waters? How many in <hi>Sodome</hi> and the cities adioining to it, when they perished with fire? How many among the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen people of GOD, when <hi>Elias</hi> could not espie one? How many, when they were often captiuated, and finally ruined, and dispersed? Yea, seest thou not the iustice of GOD to be so implacable, that when flourishing nations are vtterly rooted out, infants and innocents, who haue not actually offended, are swallowed in the common calamity, for the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their progenitors? Compare (I say) these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of iustice and mercy together, and thou shalt plainely finde, that the first hath farre exceeded the last; that there are many vessels of the one, and few of the other.</p>
               <p>Now if thou hopest to be one of those few; then consult with thine owne conscience, how cleare and vncorrupt thou findest thy actions; how seuerely thou hast restrained thy euill inclinations; how strongly, how violently thou hast endeauoured to mainetaine a vertuous and religious life. No, no; thou art none of those few, who with perpetuall strong striuing shall wrestle through that narrow pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. Thou hast beene vnconstant, both in thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in thy actions: like a loose tooth; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vselesse, but troublesome and painefull. Thou hast beene a slander to the Church, and a staine to thy profession: Thou hast beene a derision to the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:27771:62"/>
euill, a shame and sorrow to the good, an offensiue example to the weake. The earth casteth thee vp, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen receiueth thee not; GOD is displeased with thee, and all creatures are bent to oppresse thee. Goe to then, abandon hope, and yeeld thy selfe captiue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.

hearted, without trembling or touch of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of GOD; who perseuere in sinne, either boldly or sencelesly; and then say, <hi>What euill haue I done?</hi> Let these feare: <hi>It is fearefull for these to fall into the hands of the liuing GOD.</hi> Ouer the neckes of these hangs a terrible sword, alwayes shaking, alwayes bent and ready to strike; the lesse they feare it, the more <hi>sure,</hi> the more <hi>sore</hi> and heauie will it fall.

Neuer thinke that the iustice of GOD is greater then his mercie. Nothing can bee sayd in GOD greater or lesser; because whatsoeuer is in him, is his very selfe. There was neuer sinner in this world, who hath not had a sweet taste of his mercy; neither was there euer righteous person, who hath not beene touched with his iustice: His iustice and his mercie are extended to all. For <hi>all the wayes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> LORD are mercie and trueth.</hi> Besides, mercie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth so many and so great good things vpon the righteous, that her workes farre exceed the workes of iustice. Neuer trouble thy selfe about the small
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27771:63"/>
number of the elect: Assuredly they are not a few, but almost innumerable, whom the LORD will receiue to mercy. Mercy will be no lesse milde, then iustice rigorous: mercy will no lesse finde a meanes to saue, then iustice to condemne. As the number of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is knowne only to GOD, so both the time and maner of their calling must onely be referred to him.</p>
               <p>But what mooueth thee to doubt and distrust thine estate? the multitude and grieuousnesse of thy sinnes? Trouble not thy selfe for the multitude and grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> of thy sinnes; because the mercy of the LORD doeth infinitely surmount them. Behold, how two contraries applied together, if the one far exceed the other, the greater must needs consume the lesse. But the mercies of GOD infinitely exceed al the sins in the world. All the sinnes of the world are more easily consumed by the mercie of GOD, then is a droppe of water in a hot fiery furnace; then a sparke of fire is extinguished in the sea. Doe but applie now this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to thy sinnes; and the infinitenes of the one, must needs consume the multitude of the other.</p>
               <p>But loe, shee hath already applied her selfe: Shee hasted to meet thee; shee hath already kissed thee; she holdeth thee close in her embracements. Yea, when thou didst fall she was present with thee (albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it thou diddest not discerne so much) shee layed her hand vnder thee, to keepe thee from harme, and to raise thee againe. Thou art a vessell both brittle and weake; thou must needs haue beene dashed to pieces, or much bruised with thy fall; vnlesse mercie had laid vnder her hand. This is a great signe that thou
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:27771:64"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> art elect; but it is not all. For mercie hath not onely preserued thee from the harme of sinne, but she hath turned thy sinne to thy good: For thereby she hath made both thee more humble in thy opinion, and more heedfull in thy wayes. The fall of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is like the fall of an elephant; they rise not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but impudently make light esteeme of their sinnes; and sometimes with a flintie forehead boast of them: But though the elect fall into the bottome of the sea, yet the same whale which swallowed them vp, must againe cast them vpon the land.</p>
               <p>Arise therefore, and strengthen thy heart: thou hast found how weake thine owne forces are; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thy selfe vnder the Almighty arme of the LORD. For humility is the foundation of all vertues; the lowest ground-worke of repentance. Humble thy selfe therefore with sorrow for thy sinnes past, and circumspection for thy life to come. If thou canst so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> humble thy selfe with sorrow, then neuer feare; this sorrow is the greatest ioy to a godly mind that can be; the more of this sorrow thou findest within thee, the lesse cause thou hast to feare. And to this examination now I leaue thee, to what degree of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse sorrow thou canst descend; for assuredly, to the same pitch of assurance thou shalt be exalted.</p>

Thou conceiuest that GOD is mercifull: it is true; excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mercifull; infinite in his mercies. But knowest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> thou not how odious an offence ingratitude is? How it stoppeth the streames? how it drieth vp the dew of mercy? how no mercy hath influence where ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude abides. Ingratitude is the summary of all sins: no euill, no reproach is left vnsaid, when a man is charged to be vngratefull. No beast is either so fierce or so dull, but hath some sence of gratitude, and will loue those who are carefull for them. The hands which feed the Lions, may safely touch their teeth and their pawes: Elephants for their food, make both their courage and their strength seruile to man. So naturall is this vertue, that those creatures which want vnderstanding, are both apprehensiue and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruant thereof. And so hatefull is ingratitude to

He hath created thee according to his owne image: he hath placed thee in the paradise of his blessed Church: with the water of baptisme he sanctified thee; he furnished thee with the knowledge of his trueth, putting his word in thy mouth, and his will in thy minde: with many temporall benefits he did enrich thee; not onely for necessitie, but for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and delight.</p>
               <p>But thou in the leuitie and vanitie of thy braine, diddest runne headlong after thine vnbridled lusts, and plunge thy selfe in many deepe sinnes.

He inuited thee, and thou diddest excuse thy selfe; he sent to compell thee, but thou diddest resist.

he instructed, he enlightened thee with his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; he brought thee from the tempestuous sea of this world, to the port of a calme conscience, and planted thee in a land of religious conuersation. Yet thou notwithstanding, either vnmindfull, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, hast exalted thy heart, and thereby lost that wisedome, which should haue made thy worship and seruice acceptable to the LORD.</p>

No shamefastnesse shall retaine me from mourning at any time, from making a sad and seuere reckoning with my body, from holding a sharpe hand vpon it.

I may well say with <hi>Iudas, I haue sinned</hi>; but either number, or truly estimate my sinnes, I cannot. If I could number the starres of Heauen, or the sands of the earth, or the drops of water that are in the Sea, or the moments of time since time began; yet am I out of hope to enumerate my sinnes: because they are no fewer in variety then they are in number: in number equall to those which I haue sayd, but farre exceeding them in variety. The summe of them is, the manifold breach of euery branch of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; whereof many of the most haynous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> sticke stiffe in my conscience, like sharpe stitches in a sicke mans side; whereof the pleasure lieth heauy in

my Soule, like sweet meats of extreame hard digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The most especiall of these are, either blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and prophane, or light and vaine vsing of thy most blessed Name: vile and vaine behauiour and speech, vnthankefulnes, couetousnesse, cruelty, pride, ambition, anger, malice, enuie, riot, sloath, violence, hypocrisie, flatterie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These particulars I vnfold before thee; in euery of these I haue many times offended; yea, many times whereof I was neuer sensible: For what man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how oft hee offendeth.

               <p>But see the milde mercies of our GOD; see the greatnesse of his goodnesse towards vs; see how prone he is to pardon our sinnes, how ready to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vs to his fauour. For I did but say, <hi>I will confesse my sinnes; and so he forgaue the wickednesse of my sinne.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> I had scarce addressed my heart to confesse my sins, scarce let one teare drop from my breast, but I obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fauour and forgiuenesse of him. <hi>I sayd I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my sinnes, and thou forgauest the wickednesse of my sinne.</hi> Oh! that wee were such seruants to thee, as thou art to vs a LORD; so ready, so willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our sinnes, as thou art fauourable to forgiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> them. Thou regardest not the measure, but the trueth of our repentance; not the <hi>extension,</hi> but the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27771:74"/>
                  <hi>intension</hi>; not how ceremonious it is, but how sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Our purposes thou takest oftentimes for full performances: oftentimes thou acceptest our design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for deeds: thou who art a spirit, regardest on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the spirit; the outward actions are many times sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by thy grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> And this especially maketh vs vnexcusable, if we doe not repent; because pardon may be so easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; because it requireth so little paines. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pardon of all our sinnes, a full confession is not alwaies necessarie, but a full and sufficient griefe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. If the griefe be sufficient, it is of force to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> sinnes. Such is the vertue of a true contrite heart, that if it be ioined onelie with a will and endeuour to confesse, it blotteth out, it wipeth away the guiltines of sinne; so as the sinner shall neuer be damned, if he returne not to his wickednesse againe. But confession of sinnes, with all the workes of satisfaction which a man can either effect or imagine, without a contrite heart; are nothing auaileable, nothing worth. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> heart is so necessarie for the remission of sinnes, that without it, no man hath euer beene saued; no sinnes haue beene euer remitted. For as GOD is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely with the heart, so with the heart onelie is he pleased; he desireth nothing but the heart: <hi>Sonne giue me thy heart.</hi> Nothing offendeth GOD but the heart; take away the will and intention of the heart, and all our actions are indifferent: and therfore from the heart must satisfaction proceed. The medicine must be applied where the disease is setled; the sinner must vse iustice vpon the same part where sinne was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27771:74"/>
first hatched, and where it raignes: Euen as offenders are commonlie punished, or branded vpon the same parts of their bodies, wherewith they did offend. Because we sinne with the heart, GOD requireth the punishment of the heart; which is done by full and true contrition.</p>
               <p>To obtaine remission of our sinnes, something is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> required on our part, and something from GOD. From vs, sorrow and detestation of our sinnes; and a liuely Faith in our great SALVATION: from GOD, the imparting of his grace: neither of which require any long trace of time; both of them may be done in an instant. For the sorrow of contrition requireth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> no determinate continuance of time; but as a man is damned by one peruerse act of his will, so by one contrarie act of his will hee is made fit on his part to bee iustified. Otherwise it would follow, (which the mercy of GOD will neither allow nor endure) that the way of saluation through shortnesse of time, should bee blocked vp against sorrowfull sinners;<note place="margin">

I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thy rebukes, and thy roddes; but I receiued thy kisses: I looked that thou wouldest haue thundered foorth thy threats, that thy angrie arme would haue dashed mee to dust; but thou diddest encounter mee with thy embracements, thou diddest enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mee with a sumptuous feast. Thou diddest more reioice to doe mee good, then I (heauie beast) did to receiue it. O fauourable LORD! How much more ready art thou to pardon, then to punish? How
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:27771:76"/>
much more ready to grant thy pardon, then wee to desire it? Verelie, no louing father can so graciously receiue his childe, cast downe at his feet, and in the lowest descent of submission crauing his fauor; as thou hast graciously receiued me.</p>

When Sathan assaulteth, when the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth, when my owne filthie flesh enclineth and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traieth me; when temptations, when aduersities and dangers enuiron and oppresse me; this is my onely comfort, that thou art <hi>good,</hi> and that I may haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to thy goodnesse; which is the most excellent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute and perfection that thou hast.</p>
               <p>True it is, that among all thy perfections, one is not greater or lesse then another: because euery one comprehendeth the most high and simple nature of thy diuinity, whereinto no comparison can fall. Yet as thou doest manifest thy selfe to vs, three of them are most excellent: thy <hi>goodnesse,</hi> thy <hi>wisedome</hi> and thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> omnipotent <hi>power.</hi> These are the three fingers which sustaine the earth. Of these, thy <hi>goodnesse</hi> mooueth thee to be bountifull to thy creatures; thy <hi>wisedome</hi> contriueth how this may most beneficially be done: thy <hi>power</hi> bringeth the worke to effect. And albeit these are equall in thy selfe, comprised together in thy diuine prouidence; yet as thou declarest thy selfe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> vs, thy <hi>goodnesse</hi> is most excellent and glorious, from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:27771:82"/>
whence thy <hi>mercy</hi> doeth proceed. This thou most extollest in thy selfe; this thou most expressest in thy workes, whereof alwayes thy <hi>goodnesse</hi> is the cause. For thy <hi>goodnesse</hi> draweth thy infinite <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to concurre with it, in bringing thy benefits to effect.</p>
               <p>And because it is the nature of <hi>Goodnesse</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and dilate it selfe; thou who art the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
                  <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> hast imparted many good things to thy Creatures. Not for any necessity to thy selfe, not for any increase of thy glory: for neither art thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue in any thing, neither can any thing enlarge thy glorie: but because thou wilt not be good alone. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thy <hi>goodnesse</hi> is of nature to extend it selfe, it hath made other creatures to participate therof. Thy <hi>goodnesse</hi> and thy glorie thou hast imparted to other creatures; that as thou enioyest thine owne essence and beautie, so they also should behold, loue and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the same: albeit not in the same degree with thy selfe: because they cannot comprehend thee, as thou comprehendest thy selfe. This is the felicitie and glorie which filleth the capacitie of our soules, and maketh them happie. And to this end it pleased thy infinite goodnesse to create, not onlie Angels, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so men: That so abiect a creature, in one part neerest to beasts, should sit at thy table, and feede of thine owne dish.</p>
               <p>Blessed be this noble <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> which hath so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> freelie and mercifullie communicated it selfe to so base creatures. This <hi>Goodnesse</hi> is the contentment and delight of my heart; this onelie is able, not onely
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27771:82"/>
to refresh, but to reuiue the soule with inward conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: There is no solid, either comfort or assurance, but in this <hi>Goodnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore whensoeuer I am enuironed and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> euen oppressed with dangers; when infinite euils shall on euery side assaile my body or my soule; with humble haste I will runne to thy <hi>Goodnesse</hi>: thy <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> shall then be not onely a buckler, but a bulwark to defend me. Vnder the defence of thy <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> I shall not onely be safe, but secure: Not onely safe from dangers, but secure also and free from feare. Although the earth tremble, and the mountaines be carried into the bosome of the sea; yet vnder this protection I will not feare. For among other things, this is one of thy chiefe endeuours and cares, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thy seruants and friends from dangers; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease their mindes from disquiet; because thou knowest what wee are, and whereof wee are made. Thou knowest how feeble our forces are; feeble by nature, but by often transgressions altogether disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> from releeuing our selues; altogether vnable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to resist, or to beare the calamities and dangers which presse vpon vs. A man may destroy himselfe,<note place="margin">

As I was before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with dangers, so shall I bee there enuironed with ioy: I shall not onely bee free from feare, but filled with vnspeakeable ioy. Oh happy soules! who are arriued in so sure custody; who in all the trauerses of this life, are guarded by the puissant hand of GOD. VVhat euill can either assaile or approach you? VVhat good doe you not enioy?

VVho being full of ioy, full of blessed contentment and quiet, liue like thy selfe: without perturbation, without feare or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> hope. O my GOD! how vilelie doe they esteeme the voluptuousnesse of this life? How doe they not onelie forbeare to desire, but loath and abhorre to quaffe off that broken bruage, which the flesh with a harlots hand presenteth to them, in the base and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure cup of this world? How little relish haue they in those flashie vnsinewie pleasures, which breake the forces of the soule, and cast it into a drunken dreame?</p>

And they are no lesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> free from the dangers of the world, then from the delights; no more troubled with the feare of the one, then with desire of the other. They may bee hated, but harmed they cannot bee; they may bee persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they cannot perish. For nothing killeth the soule but sinne; sin only is the sword that killeth the soule: <hi>that soule which sinneth shall die.</hi>

as thou art, and as the nature of thy being requires.</p>
               <p>Thou art a man, endued with reason and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, wherein GOD hath engrauen his liuely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. In other creatures there is some likenesse of him, some footsteps of his diuine nature; but in man, he hath stamped his image. Some things are like to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> GOD, in that they are; some, in that they liue; some in their excellent propertie and working. But this is not the image of GOD. His image is onely in that we vnderstand: which is so neere a resemblance of him, that nothing in all his creatures can so cleerely expresse him. For as GOD doeth vnderstand and loue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> himselfe; so man by his intellectuall power, is both apt and inclinable to vnderstand and loue him. And the more perfectly man doeth vnderstand and loue GOD, the more liuely doeth he expresse his image.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that thou art of so noble a nature, &amp; that thou bearest in thine vnderstanding the image of GOD; so gouerne thy selfe as is fit for a creature of vnderstanding. Bee not a man onely in name, and in outward feature, but in conditions of mind a beast; plunging thy selfe in those brutish pleasures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, whereby the flesh vanquisheth and destroyeth the spirit. Bee not like the brute beasts which want <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> vnderstanding; either wilde and vnruly, or else hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and dull: the one whereof must alwaies haue the snaffle betweene their teeth, the other the spurre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their side. Be not stiffe necked, be not slow paced; doe not furiously fling after the pleasures, doe not obstinately insist in the customes of a licentious life. Be not caried with the sway of thy appetites, with the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27771:89"/>
tempestuous rage of thy sensuality, without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, without any rule, or restraint of reason.</p>
               <p>Thinke that thou art a more excellent creature, then to be anchored like a beast, to earthly thoughts:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Thinke that thou art bound to declare that difference which nature hath set betweene thee and bruit beasts, not in outward appearance and behauiour, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the disposition of thy mind. Vnderstand thy state, vnderstand thy dangers; and then expresse some iudgement, care, and industry, how to auoid them. For assuredly, thou wantest either faith, if thou doest not beleeue thy danger; or vnderstanding, if with all care and diligence thou doest not endeauour to auoid it.</p>
               <p>Aboue all, be not halfe a man, be not carefull and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> regular in thy life to halfes: for such a one liueth most miserably, because he enioyeth neither GOD nor the world. He enioyeth not GOD, because he hath not grace enough to make him his owne: The world he doth not enioy; for that hee hath so much taste of grace, as to discouer the vanitie and iniquity of his pleasures.</p>
               <p>Thou mayest happily obserue foure degrees of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> sinne: the desire, the action, the custome, the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy or contempt. Desire bringeth forth action; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencie of action, draweth on custome; custome run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into habite; habite, into nature; from whence proceedeth obstinate contempt. Whensoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou fallest into any degree of sinne, lie not still, beware of custome; for this will soone rise into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27771:89"/>
which is not pardonable; because so long as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> contempt standeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Insanabilis est fractura tua.</hi> Ier. 30.</note> it is not possible that the sinne should bee remitted.

For no sinne is vnpardonable with GOD, when with sinceritie and humility of heart, the sinner desireth mercie; which contempt will neuer permit him to doe.</p>
               <p>And therefore at the very first summons that GOD <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> shall make, range thy selfe readily vnder his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Doe not constraine him by afflictions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine thee to his seruice; as a beast is constrained by bridle and whippes to be seruiceable to man. Be not good onely vpon compulsion and feare, neither let compulsion and feare deterre thee from goodnesse: But be like a sure blade, whereof albeit the point bee bowed to the hilts, yet will it not so stand, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne foorthwith to the straightnesse againe. Weigh thine actions with vnderstanding, do them with loue, walke cheerefully in the wayes of the LORD; bee readie, be desirous and ioyfull to be guided by him. For GOD who is a spirit, respecteth the spirit; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, he accepteth principally the heart: he is better pleased with the manner of our doing, then with that

Hence it proceeded, that in the creation of other things, GOD approoued them and saw that they were good; because he gaue them a stable and permanent nature. But of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of man no mention at all. Mans goodnesse was left vnapprooued at the first; because GOD gaue him libertie of will; either to embrace vertue, and be like vnto GOD; or to adhere to sensualitie, and be like vnto beasts.</p>

They shalbe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the side of GOD; they shall be apparrelled and adorned with so great glory; so great happines shalbe heaped vpon them, as the spirit of man is vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to apprehend, much lesse to expresse. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, the hope, the full faith and assurance hereof, cannot but worke in them incredible ioy, before they attaine the full fruition; euen whilest they are vpon their passage to it.

with what delight doe they either remooue or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all difficulties which lie before them? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer their trauaile seemeth troublesome and hard, yet the loue of their iourneyes end maketh it, not onely tolerable, but delightfull: The onely thought of the end of their trauaile, seasoneth all the meanes with sweetnesse, through which they are enforced to wrestle to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> It may be conceiued indeed, that the iust are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, and that the wicked chiefly flourish in this life: It seemeth to be so, but it is not so. It is so onely in appearance and shew, but in very deed it is not so. They are either blinded with grosse mists of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or abused with deceiuable colours and shewes, who thinke it so. It appeareth so only to those who are so rowled vp in flesh and bloud, that they esteeme nothing good or euill, but that which appertaineth to the body. Assuredly, they whose sinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, enioy the most perfect pleasure euen in this life: which in this sort doeth plainely appeare.</p>
               <p>As the inward vertues and faculties of the soule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> are capable of greater pleasure then the outward; partly because they are more noble and diuine, and partly because their obiect is more excellent; which is, GOD himselfe and all goodnesse: So the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect those powers and faculties are, the more perfect pleasure they apprehend in their proper obiects; which is euident by all outward and bodily sences.</p>
               <p>But penitent persons whose sinnes are forgiuen, haue the inward capacitie of their soules more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and cleere then other men: Because nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:27771:94"/>
defileth or defaceth the inward vertues of the soule, but onely sinne; neither is there any meanes to purge the one, or repayre the other, but by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Heerehence it followeth, that penitents only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy pure pleasure in this life; as proceeding from the purest and highest faculties of the soule; much cleansed by repentance from corruptions of sinne.</p>
               <p>But the pleasures of the wicked proceede onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> from the outward sences, common to them with bruit beasts; and so much inferiour to the pleasure of beasts, by how much they participate of sinne. It is true indeed that their sensuall appetites present to them a thousand pleasures; but the reckoning being cast, what pleasures are they? pleasures tempered with vice, which hold them still in a restlesse feauer: pleasures sweet for a moment, but leauing a long and loathsome taste behinde them: pleasures onely to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dangerous hookes: pleasures which carry their punishments with them. As for their inward vertues and powers, they are so dulled and dimmed, and sometimes stupefied and benummed with custome of sinne, that they affoord no pleasure at all; But ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie as sottishlie sencelesse, or else expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It cannot bee denied, that many penitents are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> alwaies vnder correction, that the scourge is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most alwaies vpon their backes; but heerein also I esteeme them blessed: For, <hi>Blessed is the man who is chasticed of the LORD.</hi>

For if you place it in honour, riches, beautie, power, or any other faire fauour of this world, it cannot be safe: because these things are transitory, and subiect to variations and dangers; because they will passe away and perish in a moment. And therefore the ioy that riseth from them is neuer dureable, and many times lesse then the griefe which they cause when they forsake vs. As they who ioy in GOD, need not feare any euill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all their euils are conuerted to their good: so should they not hope for any good from the world; because the Diuell, GODS professed enemie, is the great Prince of the world; and will endeuour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert that good to their euill.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:27771:102"/>
Thou who art most powerfull, and yet so pitifull, that thou releeuest miserable and vile sinners: O most glorious &amp; incomprehensible GOD! encline thine eye fauourably to my distresse; fauourably regard my poore petition, which breaking from a broken soule, must needs make an vntunable sound.</p>
               <p>There is nothing, O LORD, which my soule more desires: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more due and delightfull to thee, then that I should Loue thee. Thou hast created mee to loue thee, thou hast commanded mee to loue thee; in this loue thou hast placed my felicity and my peace: In this loue consist all good things, which we enioy vpon earth, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of those which we hope for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:27771:102"/>
in heauen. But no man can loue thee vnlesse hee know thee: the knowledge of thee is necessary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this loue; because wee cannot truely loue thee, vnlesse wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that all causes of loue are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in thee. O true delight of our hearts! I cannot <hi>liue,</hi> vnlesse I <hi>loue</hi> thee: and I cannot loue thee vnlesse I know thee. What then shall I do to atteine this knowledge.</p>
               <p>The knowledge that wee haue comes by our sences; which are as gates, through which the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of things sensible enter into our vnderstanding. But neither can thy greatnesse enter through so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row passages, neither can wee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any representation, whereby our vnderstanding may apprehend
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:27771:103"/>
thee. Thou hast formed all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in number, weight, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; their nature and vertues are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; thou hast giuen them their bounds which they cannot exceed: and therefore our vnderstanding is able to embrace them. But thou art infinite: thy <hi>being</hi> is boundlesse. Nothing is aboue thee, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thee, nothing wide of thee, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without thee: our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cannot comprehend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of thy <hi>being.</hi> As thou art infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in power, so art thou in nature: thy nature is no lesse infinite in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then eternall in continuance.</p>
               <p>No man hath hitherto beene able to vnderstand the essence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his owne soule, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and operations hee dayly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scernes:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:27771:103"/>
and this is because it beareth thy Image. And how then shall I be able to vnderstand thee? If my ignorance bee so dull and heauy in my selfe, how shall I be of capacity to know thee? O noble nature! O infinite essence! O incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maiesty! How shal I know thee? For I cannot see thee. My sight is dimme, and thou art a light which canst not be approached. Thou art most high, and so must hee be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall attaine thee. Who then will giue me the eyes of an Eagle, that I may beholde this Sunne? Who will giue mee wings, that as a Doue I may approach this height?</p>
               <p>But yet will I not thus giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the chase: the more hard it is,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:27771:104"/>
the more hardly will I pursue it. There is no wisedome but in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thee: there is no rest but in louing thee: there is no ioy but from beholding thy beauty. I will not liue without this knowledge, which is the originall both of loue and of ioy. My eyes are dimme, yea darke and blinde: but grace will enlighten me, Grace will effect that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot. And albeit I know thee very little and obscurely at the first, yet is it better so to know thee, then perfectly to know all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Albeit I cannot fully know thee, yet will I aspire to such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as I may, and this will I loue, and heerewith my soule shall rest content: euen as a bird is content with the water which she taketh in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:27771:104"/>
her bill, albeit shee bee not able to take the whole fountaine. Yea, thy grace will assist mee, that if I shall but begin to loue thee a little, thou wilt discouer thy selfe more plainly to my knowledge, euen as thou hast sayd, <hi>He that loueth me, shall bee loued of the Father, and I will loue him, and manifest my selfe vnto him.</hi>

               <p>To the eye of my <hi>Reason</hi> thou hast opened the booke of thy

creatures; which in their perfections manifest thy beauty, and thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in their vse. For this visible world, this fabricature of creatures is a faire Booke, wherein all men may read, and thereby learne, what thou art; euery creature being so many letters, to declare the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of their maker.

A title not proper to this Psalme alone, but common to fifteene together: whereof the first is the 120. the last the 134. But wherefore they are termed Psalmes of degrees, as writers doe much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their opinions, so all agree that it is not much materiall to know: for that it pertaineth not to any point of doctrine, but to some ceremonie in singing them, whatsoeuer it was.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Some are of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they are so entiled, because the Leuits or Priests did sing them in some conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place, wherto the ascent was by steps or degrees.

Others, that they tooke that name from the tunes wherwith they were appointed to be sung; which might be in a kinde of graduall ascending. Others, that they serued to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the parts of the diuine seruice vsed by the Iewes; and to bring the same as it were by steps to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> an end.

Temple and habitation of GOD: which is not by a start, but by many degrees; rising alwaies from one vertue to another, vntill we arriue at the happy end of our hope; euen to the vision of Almightie GOD.

            <p>This is an excellent Psalm for any man who is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with crosses and calamities of this life. For it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to the true cause of our calamities; namely our sins. And therby directeth vs to the true remedy; by crying to GOD. Not vpon trust of any worthines or worth in our selues; but vpon humble acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our miserable weakenesse; &amp; trusting only in the mercy of GOD (whereof he hath made many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall promises) and in the vnmeasurable merits of our <hi>Redemption.</hi> It further teacheth vs, to <hi>expect</hi> the LORD patiently; neuer to <hi>suspect</hi> him, neuer to <hi>respect</hi> any other thing. And albeit he <hi>deferre</hi> his reliefe, yet we must still <hi>preferre</hi> our complaints, and both ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and earnestlie addresse our selues to him: nothing doubting, but that with him is mercy, that his <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is plenteous, and largly sufficient for all our sins.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> But the more deepe we are sunke in sin, the more forceably must we cry: euen as the more inueterate a disease is, the more strong must be the medicine. For assuredly, as the righteous approaching daily to GOD aduance into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by degrees; so sinners falling from GOD, since downward by degrees, into many deepe dangers: and the deeper he sincketh in sinne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> the deeper he diues into danger, vntill at last he plung <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> into the horrible pit of hell. The first step of his deep falling, is a deliberate consent to motiues of sinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Next ensueth his busie endeauour in searching time and opportunitie to accomplish the sinne. And then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is time to cry vnto GOD. After this the act follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and that requireth a greater crie. Then frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of acts draweth into custome; and the longer the custome hath beene, the deeper is the descension (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the sinner be not alwaies sensible thereof) and the harder is he to bee raised againe: euen as a beast lying in the mire, although it seemeth to lie at ease, yet the longer it lyeth, the deeper it sinketh, and the more hardly can it struggle foorth: And therefore this degree cryeth for a vehement cry.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now beneath this another followeth, when the sinner reioyceth and boasteth of his sinne; and then he is sunke exceeding deepe, beyond the bounds of feare and of shame: two strong reines against disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred desires. When the Diuell hath gained this point of a sinner, hee hath then brought him into a sad and sencelesse securitie, he is then so farre from crying to GOD, that scarce any cry will stirre him.</p>

For when man by sinne is turned from GOD, whilest other creatures serue him, they are also turned with him from GOD.

Assuredly, it is true that no man is hurt but by himselfe. For onelie sinne (our owne viperous brood) is properly euill; take away sin, and all externall euills produce good effects. Because when sinne is away, GOD is present: but when the soule is possessed with sinne, all good things perish, all euils flourish and ouergrow. And as sinne is an offence against GOD and against all his creatures, so by sin we incurre the hostility of GOD and of all his creatures: wherof Ismael was a type,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ORD, I do often ingeminate this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> petition, because no plenty, no weight of words is sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the anguish of my soule. For it is no light either sorrow or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that is lighted vpon me. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine not of the malice or fraud of my enemies, not of any wordly losse or euill; which happily may bee either auoyded or well endured. I complaine not also of sinnes esteemed of inferiour nature: not of the slippes of youth, not of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of age, not of errours and escapes either ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or vnknowe to my selfe: against which applian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are easilie entertained. But my soule being a nest of sinne and goared with the sting of conscience, is now oppressed with such heauie cogitations, with such mortall wounds, and with such terrible assaults of despaire, that I feele that (as it seemeth to mee) which no man feeleth but my selfe: that I can see nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that thou hast not onlie couered thy
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:27771:124"/>
countenance, but cast mee off, and away for euer. Great are my externall oppressions, but these are the terrours which thunder vpon me; this is the loade vnder which I labour, this is the labour wherein I sweate: euen the threats of thy Law, and guiltines of my grieuous sinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Alasse! I haue lost my selfe in a labyrinth of doubts. I am in such extreame miserie, that I haue not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to foster my famished soule. The violence of my greefe hath so oppressed me, that hope can now do no more; It hath done enough, in keeping my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> heart from breaking. And herein I susteine the more cruell combate, because my quarrell is against my selfe: because I haue no challenge but against my own soule. Oh! that I could so hate it, as the loue of thee requires. Oh! that I were so angrie therewith, as thou mightest be appeased with me. Sometimes I haue beene desirous to run away, but then (vaine thought) I must runne from my selfe: my disease is fast fixed in my bones.</p>
               <p>I haue linked together the chaine of my owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series: I haue voluntarilie run into the awaitments of death. The enemie pitched snares in my pathes: but I despised them, and walked secure: I was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently swaied with the inclination of my appetites. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> I flattered my selfe, that in youth it was a fault to be without fault: I said with my selfe; why thinkest thou vpon the end, before thou approachest the middest? Euerie part of our age, hath both errours and amendments proper to it. GOD seeth it well, but he doth not regard it: he is most easie to forgiue,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:27771:124"/>
and I may heereafter conuert when I will. Thus I thought, vntill custome challenged mee for her slaue. I strugled to breake from her, but shee held me fast: I could not shake off the yoake, which had beene long buckled about my necke: I could not be ridde of the bridle, which I had willingly taken betweene my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> teeth: I willingly consented, and therefore am I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily lost.</p>
               <p>Whither then shall I flie? for I am fast bound, and my refuge is farre off. How shall I free my selfe from the iawes of death? from the gripes of hel? For,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> alasse! I finde, that there is no sinne which I haue not both seriously and sauourly committed. All my faculties both inward and outward I haue defiled; all my sences I haue feasted, I haue surfetted with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: All thy benefits I haue either buried, or else abused to thy dishonour; euen as thou diddest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine by thy Prophet,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note>

               <p>What hath beene all the course of my life, but a net of errours, a confused Babylonian building of treasons, pride, auarice, riot, lust, swearing, lying, hate, enuie, murmuring, flattering, detracting, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, blasphemie, and other innumerable euils. I haue been ouerborne with the violent storm of my passions, which I haue let loose without any limits: neuer endeuouring either to abate or diuert their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I haue beene laced and buckled in the snares of the Diuell. I haue pursued my inordinate appetites in all things like a beast, without respect to the Law of iustice or of reason. I haue liued worse then an

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> My trauailing phantasies haue made a long voiage in waies both dangerous and vnknowne. Before me hath gone my aduerse will to that which is good; behind a pleasing remembrance of that which was euill: On this side want of patience in aduersitie: on that side too much hautinesse in prosperitie: On e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery side, wounds and skarres stamped into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of my soule by custome of sinne.</p>
               <p>I haue often worne a burthened conscience, and yet felt no tortures within me; and therein was I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable indeed: For therein I was either stupid or dead, I carried a sencelesse soule in a liuing bodie; euen as it must needes be a dead and senceles hand, which can hold fire without feeling any sting of heat. None are more dead then they who can beare fire in their hand or sinne in their conscience without sence of smart. But out wretches! the houre will come, when the remembrance of sinne will so much the more sharpely teare, by how much it was lesse grieuous before. Assuredlie, if we could conceiue the terror of our generall accompt, we would not faile to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt euerie day.</p>
               <p>O dead sencelesse soule! where are thy complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cries? where are thy teares, to bath the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which thy sinnes haue made? wherefore doth not thy leaden heart melt? wherefore doth not thy yron eies breake foorth into riuers of teares, as did the rocke which <hi>Moses</hi> smote with his rod? O LORD

                  <hi>Breath forth thy spirit that the waters may flow</hi>: that teares of true contrition, accompanied with the saddest groanes of my soule, may plentifully breath foorth. Or if by thy iust iudgement I can finde no passage for teares of my eyes; let me not be depriued of groanes of my heart, let my heart sweat bloudie teares. Or if I bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that; yet let me loue groanes and teares; let me earnestly desire them; let me ardently sue to thee in my prayers for them.</p>
               <p>Alasse! what auaileth it that many of my sinnes are not knowen to others, when they are well knowen to my selfe. Miserable that I am, if I lightly regard this bosome witnesse: this witnesse that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe counsaile long, but will discouer my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to all the world. The longer time I haue liued the more I finde my life couered and ouergrowen with sinne; euen as a riuer, the further it runneth from the head, the more waters it gathereth and the greater doeth the streame encrease: or as a man ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in dustie waies, the further hee rideth the more dust he gathereth vpon him. I can finde in my selfe no light of goodnesse no calme of righteousnesse. I haue bin so loaden with the yron yoake of the Diuell, the troupes of my sinnes so muster vpon mee; that out of the depth of my miserable estate I am enforced with sighes groanes and teares to cry vnto thee.</p>

For because nothing is affected with that which is not agreeable to the nature thereof, it followeth, that a spirituall substance cannot bee affected with goods properly corporall; but onely with those which are spirituall. But in affecting spirituall goods there can bee no sinne, vnlesse the rule of a superiour be thereby transgressed: and this is by the sinne of <hi>pride,</hi> in being disobedient to a superiour, and in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a singular excellencie. But consequently <hi>enuie</hi> may ensue, by enuying the good of others, whether in GOD or in man, as a hindrance to their proper ends. But so enuy must not be taken for a passion, but for a will wrestling against anothers good. And hereby it appeareth, that the Diuell properly and in his owne nature sinneth onely in <hi>pride</hi> and in <hi>enuie</hi>; which onely are pure spirituall sinnes. But besides these, I haue committed so manie other sinnes, that I am both vnable and vnworthy particularlie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them; much more vnworthy to receiue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for them. I haue made so great ruine and waste in all the faculties of my soule, that it seemeth impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible they should be repaired.</p>

cleane are they who will not ruminate and consider, either the condition of their present state, or what in future is either necessarie or in aduenture to ensue. But alasse! I neuer thought on my danger, vntill all hope of remedie was past: I neuer regarded my steps, vntill I was in the snares of hell. And now, what death can I feare, when I haue lost the life of my soule? without which any other life is death? and which maketh death a pleasant passage to life?

               <p>And yet I will not cast downe my hope in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> LORD, I will not despaire of his gracious helpe.

For vnlesse thou abandon thy <hi>vanities,</hi> thou shalt <hi>vainely</hi> implore the Omnipotent to heare thee.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IIII"/> O most high and powerfull Creator! when I turne my eyes into my selfe, when I make a priuie search in my owne conscience, I finde the multitude and varietie of my sinnes to bee such; that I esteeme my selfe vtterly vnworthy, whom thou shouldest not onely helpe, but heare: because in comparison of my sinnes, the miseries are nothing which I endure. I haue so deepely offended thee, that in reason I can expect no fauour from thee. For what day? what hower hath passed in all my life, wherein I haue not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> deserued a world of torments? Insomuch as albeit thou shouldest discharge vpon mee all the horrours of hell, yet should the greatest part of my offences remaine vnpunished.</p>
               <p>Thou hast spared mee, but I haue not spared thee:
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:27771:130"/>
thou hast spared to strike mee with the sword of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but I haue not spared to smite thee with the fist of iniquitie. Thou hast shewed thy selfe a Father to mee; but I haue not behaued my selfe as a child. How shall I looke so good a Father in the face, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so lewd a child as would disthrone and destroy that good Father if I could? Suppose the Father will bee content to forgiue; yet it is doubtfull that the LORD will not. Hee that forbeareth his vnrulie childe, will he also forbeare his vngracious seruant? But thou art not onely a LORD but a LORD of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> A LORD must bee feared, Maiestie must bee reuerenced, both obeyed. If hee who contemneth humane maiestie be guiltie of treason, what shall bee done to him who despiseth and dishonoureth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine omnipotent Maiestie, alwayes iealous of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and neglect; whose frone no creature is able to endure?

What shall I say? If I looke vpon Mercy I thinke my selfe vnworthy of the least of her fauours: If vpon vpon Iustice, I condemne my selfe to the most seuere sentence that it can pronounce. But then againe I returne to Mercy, and prostrating my selfe at het feete, with sorrow in

my heart and teares in my eyes, I thus addresse my desires vnto her.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> O mild mercy! I acknowledge my self vnworthy of thee; vnworthy either to enioy, or to behold thee.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> And thou, O Father of Mercy, and LORD of Iustice; whose goodnesse canne neuer bee either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted or diminished: I doe not <hi>intend</hi> to <hi>contend</hi> with thee in Iudgement; but I lay hold vpon the horne of thy Altar of grace. Here I rest, here onely I repose my assurance. For if thou shouldest keepe a true registrie of our sinnes, If thou shouldest exactly examine them according to the seuere law of thy Iustice; If thou shouldest perpetually reteine in mind the offences for which wee are sorrowfull, and which thy goodnesse hath promised to forgiue: If thou shouldest cast them into the ballance of thy Iustice, and weigh them to a graine; or if thou shouldest
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:27771:131"/>
heape them together against the triall of thy inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iudgement: What then shall become of vs? Who can stand before thee? Who can endure thy heauy charge?</p>
               <p>For assuredly, all reasonable creatures, as well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Angels as men, considered in their proper nature, may sinne: Whatsoeuer creature participating of reason doth not sinne, it is not by condition of nature, but by a speciall gift of grace. The reason is, because sinne is nothing else but a declination from the streight rule whereby an act is to bee performed: and that as well in naturall acts, as in artificiall, and also in morall. But there is no act which is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to such deflection, vnlesse the rule thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon the will of the Agent. And therefore, because the will of GOD only is the rule of what he doeth, as not ordeined to any higher end; onely in the will of GOD there can be no sinne. In other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour wills there may bee; because they giue not the rule to their actes, but are to bee directed by the will of GOD; whereon they should depend, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their last and highest end.</p>
               <p>Now in that some Angels neuer sinned, they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> therein supportance by grace; and besides, they drew no originall eyther weakenesse or corruption from those which fell. But the nature of man is so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> depraued by disobedience of our first parents, that originall sinne inherent in our very substance, makes vs not onely inclineable, but headlong to all actuall sinne. Insomuch as albeit many are preserued by grace from offences of highest quality; yet all are
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27771:132"/>
so obnoxious to infinite infirmities, that wee dayly slippe, wee dayly fall; that nothing is more naturall to vs then dayly to fall; that the Iust fall <hi>seuen times a day.</hi> Yea, if the best of our actions should bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly examined, they will appeare so full, either of staines or of defectes, that we rather merit reproofe and punishment thereby, then either curtesie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. All our actions are euill, and the best seeme better then they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> And this was a principall cause, wherefore man was redeemed rather then Angels. For all Angels pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished not by the fall of some; the fall of some Angels was no impeachment to those which stood; because no naturall imperfection or infection was deriued from the one to the other. But by the fall of our first parents all mankind was inuolued in destruction; as being Siens of that corrupted tree, Runnells flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that poysonous spring. If man had not beene redeemed, the whole stocke, race and kinde of man must haue beene damned.</p>
               <p>And againe; The Angels fell meerely by malice of their will; but the first man was tempted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, and his posteritie dayly fall by inclination of their Nature. Nothing is imputed to Angels but their proper sinne: but to man is imputed the sinne of another. And therefore O LORD of infinite goodnesse! Let these reasons which mooued thee to redeeme mee, mooue thee also to heare mee; let sinne no more hinder thee from hearing, then it did from redeeming. For if sinne bee an impediment that prayers cannot bee heard, neuer shall any mans
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:27771:132"/>
prayer approch thine eare.</p>
               <p>For we are all borne sinners, wee liue and we shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> die sinners, wee cannot contend with thee in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee cannot dispute our righteousnesse against thee. If thou wilt bee onely a iudge to obserue and examine our actions, if thou wilt call vs to triall at the barre of thy iustice, of necessity we must perish: none can stand before thee and say, <hi>I am innocent.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we decline from thy court of iustice, and desire to be heard in thy court of mercy: wee stand before thy mercy: for if mercy were not with thee, sinners could hope for nothing from thee, which is a higher court then thy court of iustice. For otherwise wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIIII"/> could not appeale from iustice to mercy, because no appeale can be made but to a higher court. LORD, we appeare before thy high court of mercy; wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that all of vs are sinners, and that if mercy were not with thee, we could not hope for anything from thee. We humbly acknowledge, that we haue done nothing perfectly well; and our imperfect do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing well, is no thanke to vs, it is thy free gift: but if thou close not thy eyes against our offences, we must despaire, we cannot be saued. For our life resteth in remission of our sinnes; that thou hast couered or rather buried them; that thou wilt neuer obiect them against vs. <hi>All haue gone out of the way, we are all become vnprofitable:</hi>

thou art easie, thou art readie, thou art desirous to pardon. No man is so readie to intreat thee, as thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> art easie to be intreated.

               <p>This Ocean of mercie hath neither bottome nor bound; it cannot be fathomed, it cannot be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted. No sooner can a sinner call mercie to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> mind, but he is sencible of the working thereof. For it breaketh and disperseth the hell of remorse, which did chill his heart with astonishment and feare: the dampes of pensiuenesse vanish away; the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which hung ouer his head, is chased farre off. Or if any punishment be inflicted, it is not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of a iudge, but the chasticement of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is both temporall, and tempered with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; which maketh it not onely tolerable, but easie and sweete. In this Ocean of mercy I will cast the anchor of my hope, &amp; ride securely against al rage of wheather; here hope will hold mee firme and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable against all approaches.</p>

For despaire is nothing else but want of true trust in the mercie of GOD to remit sinnes. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it is not so: he is mercifull, and alwaies readie to forgiue.

               <p n="2">2. The iustice of GOD can be no impediment. For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> iustice requires no more then a recompence for a tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:27771:137"/>
and forthwith the offence to be forgiuen. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> thy redemption is made, thy reckoning is abundantly paide, there remaineth nothing for thee to discharge. This redemption is of such power and grace that it not onely satisfieth GODS iustice, but winneth him to great fauour and loue. Doe but remember who is the priest and what is the sacrifice, and thou shalt finde the iustice of GOD easily answered: for it was more that GOD died, then all man-kind had perpetually perished. This is such an offering, as if euery houre, euery minute it were newly offered. And therefore it is called <hi>an eternall redemption</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist ad Heb.</hi>
                  </note> because by it all true penitents are redeemed for euer. All therefore who are penitent, and haue a full purpose neuer to offend,<note place="margin">

This redemption is the very strength of repentance: hereby the iustice of GOD is no obstacle to his mercie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now touching his ordinance of the law: Of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> troth the law was fearefull and seuere; and therefore is termed the law of death: <hi>euery soule that sinneth shall die.</hi> But this seueritie is past and done. A new law is made; the law of grace, the law of mercie and of life. <hi>Repent and the kingdome of heauen is at hand.</hi> This is a milde law; but in any case the condition must bee performed. Thou must applie thy selfe to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in any case: GOD will not bee mercifull, vnlesse sinners repent. Notwithstanding, if at any time through weakenesse thou offend, doe not fall from him into despaire; but trust in him: sticke stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:27771:137"/>
and constantlie to him: and so shall thy trust sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his mercy in thee, and againe his mercy shall support thy trust: euen like a proppe against a wall, which holdeth vp the wall, and is againe sustained by the wall.</p>
               <p>The impediments of mercy being thus remoued, it remaineth plaine, that mercy may easily bee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that for diuers respects; and especially these:</p>
               <p>First, for that the <hi>goodnesse</hi> of GOD assureth his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> mercy. For to one who is good, nothing is more naturall then to doe good; which is the proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goodnesse. But because no greater good can be done to another, then to make him good, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that it is most proper to one who is good, to make others good: to communicate his goodnesse to others, vntill he hath made them so good as himself. And this is so farre true, that the more goodnesse any one hath, the more is he enflamed with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and the greater difficulties will hee vndertake to atchieue it: euen as the greater a fire is, the greater heat it casteth foorth, and the more matter it is able to consume. But GOD is so good, that in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of him, none other can be said to bee good:<note place="margin">Why cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest thou me good, &amp;c.</note> all goodnesse is attributed onely to him. And therefore the more hee exceedeth in goodnesse, the more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is he to communicate himselfe. As he hath made himselfe like vnto thee, so will he make thee like vnto him: hee will not cease to <hi>informe,</hi> to <hi>reforme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, transforme</hi> thee dayly, vntill hee hath vnited thee to him. He communicateth himselfe to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:27771:138"/>
in their degree, but in most especiall manner to man. Assuredly, it is not so naturall for light things to mount vpwards, for heauie things to draw down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the heauens to mooue round; as it is for the goodnesse of GOD to doe good. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of all creatures is accidentally in them; but the property to good is essentially in GOD. GOD is an essentiall goodnesse. So simple, pure and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is his substance, that no accident can adhere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: whatsoeuer is in GOD, is GOD.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> Againe, his loue may perswade thee that hee will bee mercifull. For hee did not beginne to loue thee when first thou wert borne, not when the world was created: but thou diddest sleepe in his bosome euen from eternitie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te perpetua dilexite, ideo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxi te miserans.</hi>
                  </note> His loue to thee is no lesse <hi>ancient,</hi> then <hi>the ancient of dayes</hi>; euen then himselfe: Who as hee is from eternitie, so from eternitie hath hee loued his elect. When his naturall Sonne was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, then wert thou adopted for his Sonne; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since hee hath cast vpon thee a fatherly eye; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remembring what glory hee hath appointed for thee. The Scriptures much commend an ancient friend. Loe here is an ancient Friend indeed: a friend who hath loued thee from all eternitie. Verely if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoriall possession maketh a right, thou hast now a good title to his loue; thou hast now prescribed it for thine owne: and hereby thou hast a good claime to his mercie. And because <hi>likenesse</hi> is not onely a signe, but a cause of <hi>liking</hi> and loue; hee hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thy soule according to his Image: for as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vpon earth resembleth him more, by nothing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:27771:138"/>
hee canne more easily bee knowen. And hence it is that the substance or essence of the soule cannot bee vnderstood; because it is like the diuine substance, which no man in this life can vnderstand. Hence also proceedeth the admirable capacity thereof, which all the creatures and riches of this world can no more fill, then a graine of mustard can fill the world.</p>

               <p>Thus may GOD say, and thus for the most part it happeneth.

                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.14.</note> But how dare wee trust to our repentance at that time, when the will by long custome is stiffe, and almost inflexible; when the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding partly weakened, partly amazed, is vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold diuers obiects perfectly.

               <p>Of all things that can be desired, eternall felicity is the chiefe. No man but doeth naturally desire it.

Signifying, that no man can attaine that happy height, no man can approch him who standeth at the toppe, but by many degrees of vertues, whereof euery one also hath many steppes. Consider with mee but a few of these, and namely the mortifying of all affections, either vicious or impertinent and vaine: then the treading in all the steps of humility, patience, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, mercifulnesse, temperance, obedience, feare, fortitude, true discretion, pure intention, sobrietie, modesty, externall composition, sweetnesse to others, seueritie against our selues, and all other vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and verely thou shalt finde it a long ladder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, and that which will require a long time to climbe. This climbing or walking is otherwise ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an edification or building. For as a great buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cannot be mowlded vp in an instant; but first the foundation must bee layde, then the walles erected, and lastly the roofe and floores framed: so in this spirituall building, a sure foundation must bee layd vpon earth, if we intend to raise it to reach into heauen.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is a point of extreame either blindnesse or madnesse, to aime at this end, this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie

In like maner wee all desire happinesse, there is not any who would not bee happie: but wee regard not the meanes appointed for that end.

We will not take either time or paines; but thinke to mount to heauen, at a leape, at a iumpe; at the last time of our age, at the last minute of our life; by a few short wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes rather then prayers.

               <p>Wherefore, O my soule! howsoeuer others ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther linger or giue ouer; betake thou thy selfe spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to the LORD. For to whom else shouldest thou resort? he is thy prefection, thy last end, the rest and satisfaction of all thy desires. Thou doest na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally desire nothing but him; the desire of worldly things is but a disease. Goe too then, tumble vpon
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:27771:155"/>
the bed of honour, riches, or pleasure; thou shalt neuer find rest,<note place="margin">GOD formed man, and breathed into him the breath of life.</note> because thou cariest thy disease with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee: ridde thee of thy sickenesse, and thou shalt finde rest onely in GOD. The reason is plaine. GOD made thee only for himselfe; and therefore being thy last end, thou canst not find quiet, but onely in him. Againe, GOD onely is agreeable to thy nature:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> thou art his image, thou art breathed from him. No worldly thing hath any proportion with thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore can not giue thee true satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. A horse is not satisfied with flesh, nor a Lion with grasse; because such foode agreeth not with the nature of those beasts. No lesse can a spirit be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with corporall things, because they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereto. The gifts and graces of GOD are conformable to thy nature, they only giue thee both nourishment and delight. Pride and enuy are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things; but they no more nourish a soule, then poison nourisheth a body. God only is agreeable to thy Nature, GOD onely filleth thy desire. And yet neither by filling thy desire hee doeth extinguish it; neither by enflaming thy desire he ceaseth to fill it. Wherefore (O my soule) Loose not time, but since he hath created thee: <hi>Remember thy maker in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> Since thou hast no satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but from him, <hi>take the wings of the morning, and flie vnto him.</hi>

               <p>O my friendes, O all ye of the house and Church of GOD! <hi>Trust in the LORD.</hi> Attend for succours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from him: for he is both ready and most assured.

               <p>If GOD hath not hitherto thus dealt with some, it is because hee knoweth their weakenesse, hee knoweth their cowardice, hee knoweth how vnfitte they are to bee his souldiers; hee will not take them into his pay. they who neuer tasted troubles, haue great cause to feare, that they are vnder no fauourable hand.

Hee leadeth his seruants like a hangman, by the broad and faire way of false plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and comforts, to the place of their execution: he mounteth them vpon high scaffolds, to the end to dispatch them with the greater griefe and shame. So was the rich man aduanced, when hee boasted of his wealth: but the same night he lost both his riches and his soule. When the deuill most flattereth, then hee hunteth; then you are most in danger of his snares.</p>
               <p>And therefore (O my friends) In all your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles <hi>trust in the LORD</hi>; for this is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall conditions of obtaining your desires.

                  <hi>so is his mercie.</hi> And therefore as hee is infinitely great, so is hee infinitely mercifull: and as hee hath infinite riches to bee distributed, so is hee infinitely liberall to distribute the same. Otherwise there shall bee a defect and disproportion in the diuine substance; If hauing infinite goods to bee distributed, hee should not haue an infinite mind and will for distribution. This great mercie of GOD was not vnknowen to the idolatrous Philistims;<note place="margin">1.

O the bowels of his mercie! hee so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his creatures, that it grieueth him to see them perish: scarce doe his eyes behold their miseries, but he is forthwith mooued to mercy. <hi>LORD, they who know thy Name will trust in thee: for thou hast neuer failed them who seeke thee.</hi> Psal. 9.10.</p>
               <p>There are two perfections in GOD, Mercy and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:27771:159"/>
Iustice, both cut by the same measure and compasse: neyther canne bee greater nor lesse then the other, because both are infinite. Yet in two points they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; in two points mercie is preferred before Iustice. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> First because GOD by his own nature is more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to mercy.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Indignatio non est mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when hee scourged sinners out of the temple, he brought no whippe with him, but made it of cords which hee found amongst them: he taketh both the cause and the matter of the scourge onely from our selues. The second is because hee offereth his mercie generally to all: but his punitiue Iustice remaineth onely for those who contemne his mercy. All they who embrace his mercy, shall neuer tast the smart of his iustice.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Againe, albeit all the diuine perfections are not onely equall, but one in GOD; yet hee is most rich in the workes of mercie, and hath done greater things to demonstrate his goodnesse and mercie, then his other vertues and perfections besides. To mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his wisedome and power, hee created the world; to declare his iustice, hee drowned it: but to shew his mercie, hee died for it. Oh! how inestimable greater is the worke, that GOD suffered for the world, then that hee created it? that GOD died for man, then that all men should haue perished.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6</note>

bloud for our redemption.

Physitions prescribe bleeding in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate measure; but our redeemer out of his vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable loue made a profuse effusion of all that hee had.

His bloud, his precious bloud, euery drop of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud, was poured foorth for our redemption. After that his externall parts were emptied of bloud, by sweating, scourging, crowning and nailing: His internall and vitall parts were also drayned by the stroke of a speare. For in that water flowed foorth, without any tincture of bloud, it was an euident proofe that all the bloud was spent. A little bloud will giue colour to much water: and therefore if any little bloud had remayned, the water must haue been somewhat coloured thereby.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> This is the treasure, this the ransome wherewith sinners are redeemed.

VVhen GOD of his owne will hath so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully redeemed vs. VVho can suspect that he will be lesse willing to distribute this treasure, then hee was to amasse it? Assuredly there is no default in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> GOD if sinners be damned, for hee desireth not the death of a sinner: there is no default in GOD for not giuing, but there may bee default in sinners, for not desiring.

               <p>By this redemption wee are not onely deliuered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> both from the guilt, and eternall punishment of our sinnes; but wee are also enriched with the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our Redeemer. All the merits of his penury, trauailes, watchings, groanings, sweat, teares, and bloud, are our rich treasure. All his innocence and righteousnesse is ours. For the righteousnesse of the second <hi>Adam</hi> is no lesse ours, then was the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the first <hi>Adam</hi>: wee no lesse participate of the innocencie and sanctity of the one, for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then of the disobedience of the other for our damnation.

The father hath deliuered the keyes of his infinite treasure to his sonne, and our brother; to our flesh and blood.

But GOD thinketh not this enough: For hee giueth aboue all that wee can aske or receiue: no man either can or dare aske so much, as he is both willing and ready to giue. As wee slenderly beleeue, so wee slenderly aske; but GOD rayneth plentifully vpon the little

               <p>It was a merueilous redemption whereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel was freed from the seuere seruitude of Egypt: but it was not like this whereof I speake, it was but a type and figure thereof. This redemption is vniuersall; it hath discharged not one people alone, but all the world: There is no sinne, not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but possible to be committed, which by this redemption is not discharged. And this is true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>sufficiencie</hi>; but in regard of <hi>efficacie</hi> it pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth only to the elect; who are the Church, the true house and familie of <hi>Israel.</hi> But there can bee no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, either for number so great, or for qualitie so grieuous, but this redemption is <hi>sufficient</hi> for them.

               <p>And shall I tell thee, O my friend? shall I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> thee with an infallible experience, how all the calamities of this life may not onely bee endured, but vtterly broken? how thou mayest obtaine a most glorious conquest? This is worth the knowing, and by assistance of grace not vneasie to bee done. The Apostle findeth in one man two: the spirit and the flesh; the minde and the members; the soule and the body. These are so chained together as they make but one; and yet so contrary, as they make two.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:27771:169"/>
They are so contrary, as the life of the one, is the death of the other; the raising vp of the one, is the ruine of the other: whereupon the Scripture saith; that <hi>hee who loseth his life shall saue it.</hi> That is, hee who loseth his sensuall life, shall saue his spirituall life. Betweene these two men there is such a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combate, that therupon the life of man is termed a <hi>warfare</hi>: betweene these two men, all the maine businesse of this life consistes.</p>
               <p>Now then, beate downe this mortall and bodily man, breake thy vnbrideled appetites, set aside thy carnall pleasures and desires; and thou shalt liue peaceably and at sweet content: no worldly troubles shall molest thee. Thou complainest of externall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; but thy enemies are within, thy proper passions make warre against thee: Vanquish these enemies, and thy complaints will cease. He is a great LORD who commandes himselfe; hee who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes, his owne will, is more powerfull then many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> great kings.

But bee friendes with them, and loue them, and then they will not molest thee; then they will bee pleasant to thy taste, thou wilt be gladde then and glory in them. If worldly troubles bee grieuous to thee, the fault is in thy selfe, it is in thy power to loue them: doe but cutte off the desires of the world, and thou wilt neuer complaine of any
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:27771:169"/>
worldly thing. Complaine of thy inward desires <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> thou mayest; but of externall accidents thou canst not iustly complaine, because they cannot hurt thee vnlesse thou wilt. If any thing seemes grieuous to thee, take thy selfe in hand; chastice thy inward ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and thou shalt bee quiet. As moathes consume the cloath, and wormes the wood wherein they breede; So thy owne concupiscences consume thy heart. They gnawe thy bowels like the vipers broode, and worke out their birth by thy torment and death. It is most infallible, that no man is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by himselfe. Thou art thine owne enemie. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thy selfe, and thou shalt haue calme quiet and ioy of spirit.

That heereafter I no more bend or binde my selfe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish my will, but thine: that I seek not my owne pleasure or aduantage, but what is pleasing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to thee.

His workes were finite, but the merits of his workes are infinite. I offer him wholly to thee; hee is wholly mine, in that his loue is mine.

How with the vile society which he is constrained to endure? What friends, what suit will hee make for his discharge? So they who

               <p>Out of the <hi>deepest</hi> dungeon of this prison (O LORD) I crie vnto thee: <hi>deepely</hi> couered with naturall corruption, <hi>deepely</hi> ouerwhelmed with actuall transgressions, <hi>deepely</hi> charged both with sence and feare
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:27771:173"/>
of thy wrath, I streine foorth my voice vnto thee. LORD, thou art alwayes farre distant from sinners, and now out of this <hi>deepe</hi> distance, I doe not weakly desire thee, but with <hi>deepe</hi> sighes and groanes from the <hi>depth</hi> of my heart, I call vnto thee. I haue sinned, and thou hast puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: I haue displeased thee, and thou hast disquieted me; according to the greatnesse of my sinnes, thy punishments haue beene great vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee. Out of this <hi>depth</hi> both of infirmities and of calamities, with an inflamed spirit, I lift vp my voyce, hands, eyes, and soule vnto thee. Heare me (O LORD) who doest no sooner heare then helpe: Oh! let the complaint of my sobbing soule haue accesse to thy gentle audience.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:27771:174"/>
Looke not vpon my sinnes and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy iustice; but looke vpon my miseries, and vpon thy mercies: turn away thy face from me, as I am sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but regard me as I am sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for my sinnes. Despise not (O LORD!) the worke of thy hands.</p>
               <p>For thou knowest of what mettall we are made, thou knowest the bad temper thereof; thou knowest, not only our weakenesse, but our prone inclination to euill. Insomuch as if thou shouldest examine our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the exact ballance, and then smite them by the seuere sword of thy Iustice; all must despaire; wee must all bee damned. For there is none so innocent vnder heauen, who canne eyther answere thy Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice or endure it. Not one canne
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:27771:174"/>
stand before thee in Iudgement; not one canne answere <hi>one for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt not bee so rigid and seuere against thy feeble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For with thee abideth not onely <hi>Iustice,</hi> but also <hi>Mercie</hi>; not onely <hi>Iustice,</hi> for obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but <hi>Mercie</hi> for the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Thou art aboue measure milde and fauourable to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; thou canst not deny thy <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> from any who desire it from an humble heart. And therefore albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it my sinnes presse heauie vpon me, albeit they trouble my soule with many terrours; yet will I worship thee, with a dutifull and obedient <hi>feare.</hi> I will <hi>hope</hi> in thee, but not cease to <hi>feare:</hi> I will <hi>hope,</hi> but not

               <p>Vpon these two wings will I <hi>flie</hi> vnto thee; with these two eyes will I <hi>looke for thee:</hi> but my trust addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it selfe especially to thy <hi>mercy.</hi>

                  </gap>f this mercy thy <hi>word</hi> hath giuen assurance: thy <hi>word</hi> expresseth much fatherly affection; thy <hi>word</hi> is full of many sweet promises of remission of sinnes: and therefore my <hi>trust</hi> laieth hold vpon thy word. For were it not a dishonour to a King? would not people speake shrewdly of him, if hauing promised his pardon, hee would execute men for the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:27771:175"/>
Assuredly, whatsoeuer some Kings may doe, thou canst not: thou canst not denie thy word, because thou canst not denie thy selfe. Thy <hi>iustice</hi> will not suffer thee, either to reuoke, or lightly to regard the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of thy <hi>mercy,</hi> in case we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them in seasonable time.</p>
               <p>And therefore I will not be either betrayed by pleasures, or benummed by sluggish sloath: I will not suffer time to <hi>passe,</hi> vntill time shall be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>past:</hi> When there cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be any harme in haste, I will not aduenture vpon the dangers of delay. O LORD my maker! Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me with thy inciting grace, that I may with all speed addresse my selfe both to entreat and to embrace thy mercy; that I may timely begin to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:27771:176"/>
attend vpon thee. For albeit no part of my life should be either shortned or mispent; Albeit I should be most couetously carefull to imploy euery minute thereof: yet is man too mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to attaine performance of the least part of his duty to thee. And although I bee not presently relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although for a long time thou with-holdest thy helpe; let not my hope be wearied in wayting for thee; let me both patiently and constantly expect thy pleasure.</p>
               <p>And so must all doe who sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serue thee; who put their <hi>trust</hi> in thy <hi>word:</hi> and so they shall neuer be disappointed of their hope. For not only thy <hi>Mercy</hi> is most faithfully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by thy <hi>word</hi>; but thy <hi>Iustice</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is plentifully satisfied, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualuable
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:27771:176"/>
blood of our <hi>Redeemer:</hi> which is so noble and precious in thy sight, that there neither are, nor can be any sinnes, for expiation of which it doeth not suffice. It ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the gate of grace to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; it excludeth none, it sufficeth for all. Let no man feare the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his sinnes; this <hi>Mercy</hi> and this <hi>Redemption</hi> doe infinitely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them: they infinitely ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance the sinnes of all men, in case they repent. LORD! thou art a great Physition; thou knowest all our sicknesses, and art most expert in all sorts of remedies. Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our diseases are, neuer so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, neuer so desperate; thou hast variety of remedies in store, and knowest right well how to applie

them: thy <hi>Mercie</hi> and thy <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> thou hast alwayes at hand.</p>
               <p>Wherefore with all <hi>feare</hi> and reuerence which my weakenesse is able to apprehend, I resort now to thy throne of <hi>Grace</hi>; most humbly entreating thy <hi>Mercie,</hi> and the benefit of thy <hi>plentifull redemption.</hi> Repell mee not from thy presence, I beseech thee; vntill I bee reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thy fauour.
