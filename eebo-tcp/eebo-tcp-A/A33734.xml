            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PURPURA ANGLICANA</head>
            <p>THere being many Natural things, which I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and of late, happily found in the South and West
Parts of <hi>England,</hi> not as I can find published by any <hi>Author;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many more which have been discovered by the industrious
Exquisitions of divers ingenious and curious Searchers of Nature;
(as also others which were before thought to be Exotiques;) I
have reason to believe, that there are very many more (for in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>couragement
of such Inquirers) yet undiscovered in this our
Native Country. Among others, that of the <hi>Purple-Fish,</hi> which
I found the last Winter, on the <hi>Sea</hi> Coasts of <hi>Somerset-shire,</hi> and
the shores of <hi>South-Wales</hi> opposite to it; which also I doubt not
but may be found on the other Coasts of <hi>England,</hi> especially the
South and Western parts, (in which I am almost assured I have
formerly seen them, tho' then unknown to me,) where there are
Rocks and great Pebbles, and where the Tides run not too strong.
Which Discovery I do not pretend to be so made by me, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no hint of it before: For in <hi>October,</hi> 1684, there were two
Ladies at <hi>Mynehead,</hi> where I then was, who seeing what Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I had made of Natural things in those Parts, told me, there
was a certain Person living by the Sea-side, in some Port or Creek
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who made considerable gain, by marking with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
durable Crimson Colour, fine Linnen of Ladies, Gent. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
sent from many parts of that <hi>Island,</hi> with their Names, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as they pleased; which, they told me, (as they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,)
was made by some liquid substance taken out of a <hi>Shell-fish;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102755:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon which I shewed them all the Shells I had found on that
Coast; one of them thought it to be taken out of a Limpot; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of that Shell here figured and described; but neither of
them could inform me out of what part it was taken in either. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their departure from that Port, I made Experiments on all the
<hi>Shell-fishes,</hi> in which I might probably think to find it; and brake
them while the <hi>Fishes</hi> were alive in them, and with a short poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Pencil of Horse hair (no other instrument being so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient)
I tryed every part of each, which I imagined might
yield the Colour; but upon washing the Linnen which I had
marked, in scalding water, with sope, there appeared nothing of
any colour on them; upon which I was ready to give over any
farther search; but at length trying that part, in which I least
thought the Tincture lay, it immediatly turned to a light green;
which being presently dryed and washed, as before, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
that delicate colour they told me of, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>The whole process, upon my oft repeated Experiments, was
as followeth.</p>
            <p>These Shells, being harder then most of other kinds, are to
be broken with a smart stroak of a hammer, on a plate of Iron,
or firm piece of Timber, with their mouth downwards, so as not
to crush the Body of the Fish within: The broken pieces being
pickt off, there will appear a white Vein, lying transversly in
a little furrow or cleft, next to the head of the Fish, which must
be digg'd out with the stiff point of the Horse hair pencil, being
made short and tapering; which must be so formed, by reason
of the viscous clamminess of that white Liquor in the Vein, that
so by its stiffness, it may drive in the Matter into the fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
or white Silk; which, altho' I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not yet tryed it, will
(I think) be better then on Linnen, and make the colour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more bright and vivid by its reflection, since which I have
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it on white Sarsnet, and find it so.</p>
            <p>The Letter, Figures, or what else shall be made on the Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
or Silk (as much forced in, as it can be by the pencil) will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102755:3"/>
presently appear of a pleasant <hi>light green colour;</hi> and if placed in
the <hi>Sun,</hi> will change into the following colours, <hi>i. e.</hi> if in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
about noon, if in the Summer, an hour or two after Sun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and so much before setting, for in the heat of the day, in
Summer, the colours will come on so fast, that the succession of
each, will scarce be distinguisht; next to the first <hi>light green,</hi> it
will appear of a <hi>deep green;</hi> and in few minutes change into a
full and very fair <hi>Sea green;</hi> after which in a few minutes more,
it will alter into a <hi>Watchet blew;</hi> from that, in a little time more,
it will be of a <hi>Purplish red:</hi> after which, lying about an hour or
two, (supposing the <hi>Sun</hi> still shining) it will be of a very <hi>deep
Purple red,</hi> beyond which the <hi>Sun</hi> can do no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> that these changes are made faster or slower, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the degrees of the <hi>Suns</hi> heat.</p>
            <p>But then the last and most beautiful colour, (after washing in
scalding water and sope) will (the Matter being again put out
into the <hi>Sun</hi> or wind to dry) be much a differing colour from all
those mention'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a fair bright <hi>Crimson,</hi> or near to the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Colour;</hi> which afterwards, notwithstanding there is no use of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Stiptic to bind the colour, will continue the same, if well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as I have found in handkercheifs, that have been washt more
than 40 times; only it will be somwhat allayed from what it
was after the first washing. I made large Letters on so many
cloaths, as there are distinct colours, to put them into a Book,
which kept them from the <hi>Air;</hi> I have several months after,
shewed the various colours distinct, as aforesaid; yet by often
opening the Book, and so exposing them to the <hi>Air,</hi> all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
excepting the two last (I mean before washing either)
will fade; but all the colours, being washt, will be one and the
same. While the Cloath so writ upon, lyes in the <hi>Sun,</hi> it will
yield a very strong fetid smell; (which divers who have smelt it
could not endure) as if <hi>Garlick</hi> &amp; <hi>Assa-faetida</hi> were mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which I proved but few days before I wrote this, tho' it
had been at least twelve months, kept in a Book; which before
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102755:4"/>
it was laid in the <hi>Sun,</hi> had very little of that smell. I have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observed, that the cloath dryed and washt soon after it is
wrote on, will appear fresher and brighter, then after being kept
in a Book; as I found by some I newly caused to be washt, after
they had been 14 months so kept.</p>
            <p>The Shells are of divers colours, but the most part of them
white; some are red, when newly taken off the Rocks; some
yellow; others of both those colours; some a blackish brown;
many a Sandy colour; and some few striped with white and
brown parallel lines: I have herewith sent you most of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
with one of the largest I have found, and one of the least,
with several of the middle sized. <hi>vid. the Figures,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>The first linnen Cloaths marked with Letters and Names, I
sent to D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Plot</hi> in <hi>Nov.</hi> 1684, being then one of the <hi>Secretaries</hi>
to the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to whom he communicating my
<hi>Letter</hi> containing my first Observations, and also shewing the
Linnen so markt (at the same time) advised me that it was so
acceptable to them, that they were pleased to order him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
me their thanks; and that they had appointed some Gent.
to wait on His late <hi>Majesty</hi> with them; who (with divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Honour to whom they were shewn) was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the sight, and relation of the discovery, as new to him.
After which I was desired to send up some Shells with the Fishes
alive in them; which could not be done any other way, then
by sending them in some Ship bound for <hi>London,</hi> in an open Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Pan; renewing the <hi>Sea</hi>-water every day: after which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
I have kept them near a fortnight, and longer I might, had
I not made use of them; for it seems to be a kind of <hi>Amphibious
Animal,</hi> alternately living in both Elements every Tide. Being out
of their native place, and in want of such Vicissitudes, they take
this course to find the <hi>Air;</hi> when any of them are put into a
Vessel of <hi>Sea</hi>-water, (for in fresh they soon expire) after they
have lain some time on the bottom of the Vessel, they creep up
to the superficies of the water, and by extending a kind of Lipp,
<pb facs="tcp:102755:4"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb facs="tcp:102755:5"/>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102755:5"/>
with their <hi>Operculum's</hi> cling to the side of the Vessel or Pan,
(which is most convenient for their ascent,) with about half that
part aboue the water, sometimes creeping down under it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
again to their station, between Wind and Water. This
I designed to accomplish, and was contriving this way to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
their desires; to the end His <hi>Majesty</hi> the great <hi>Patron</hi> and
<hi>Founder</hi> of their <hi>Society,</hi> might have the pleasing diversion of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Experiment made in His <hi>Royal</hi> Presence; but a stop was
put to this design by a Calamity, too great and publick to be
mentioned.</p>
            <p>There are other imperfect observations, which I have made
of this our <hi>Purple-Fish;</hi> which I may in some time give you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
account of, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. At what Age of the Moon, and time
of the Tides (<hi>i. e.</hi> Spring or Neap) their Veins are fullest, and
give the best Tincture. For I have found a difference, they being
sometimes fuller and whiter, and the juice more viscid; at other
times more flaccid and watery.</p>
            <p>2. Whether they are in greater perfection in Summer or Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
having not, as I expected, received any of them this last
Summer, to make that Experiment, by reason of our Western
Troubles in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Invasion. Such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to these Inquiries, and have more liberty from business
then I have, may make farther improvements of it, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of it by Urine, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Authors.</hi> And altho' the Shells are small, yet their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on some of our Shoars, may yield matter enough, (with
the more pains) to dy a quantity of fine Wooll, or Silk, so as
to render the discovery some way useful, and to answer the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
objection of <hi>cui bono,</hi> made by such persons, who own no
good but what relates to the Body. I am of opinion there may
be found on our marine Coasts, some bigger Shells, which may
have a colouring juice, though not the same with this, for that
I know few Natural things both of Animals and Vegitables, but
what have divers Species of the same kind, sometimes in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102755:6"/>
same place. This may be a sufficient intimation to all Ingenious
persons living near the <hi>Sea,</hi> to imploy some time to find this
out.</p>
            <p>My purpose was, with this discourse to have drawn and sent
you Figures of these Shells, with the Fish pulled out and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
beyond the Vein, together with their <hi>Operculums;</hi> to
which end I sent lately for some of them, but they being not yet
come (to satisfy the desires of some Gent. of the <hi>Society</hi>) I have
sent it now, (in that particular) not so perfect as I could wish.
As for the qualities of this Fish, I can yet say but little, only I
was assured, by some who had boyled, drest, and eaten of them,
that they are wholsome food; as good at least, and tast as well
as Lympots or Winkles, only the flesh something harder.</p>
            <p>For what Use Nature hath designed this Vein of colouring juice
unto the <hi>Animal,</hi> will be difficult to find out; perhaps it may
be the spermatick and prolifick Matter, by which they propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
their kind; which I am inclinable to think, from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
virulent and faetid savour. A Microscope (which I
had not then by me) might have given some light in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and confirmed it, if those <hi>Animalcula</hi> are to be found in it,
which are in the Masculine Sperm of Fish, and other living
Creatures (as some affirm from the many late Experiments
they have made.) Or else it may be a Humor in this <hi>Animal,</hi>
which by its Vital Energie, as the spring of life and motion, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the want of heart, liver, blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in other exanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Animals.</hi> Those who seek after them may find, as I have
done, some of those <hi>Purple</hi> Shells, in which are the <hi>Cancelli,</hi> or
rather <hi>Astaci,</hi> (unto which they are more like,) and so may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake;
for those little Craw-fishes, I have found in most of our
<hi>English</hi>-Shells, excepting the <hi>bivalved,</hi> and <hi>Patella's;</hi> of which
in many parts, especially in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> there are many
sorts, and some very large; which our Country-men there call
<hi>Soldiers;</hi> for that they say, they enter by force, kill, and take
possession of those Houses they have not built; and when they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102755:6"/>
grow too big, forsake them and enter into larger: Whether
that be true I know not: This I have found, when I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
some of the Shells in which those Vagrants are, so as not to
bruise their Bodies, and then put them naked into the water, I
have beheld them with nimble springing Motion, to run to and
fro, till they find a Stone to hide themselves under; which not
finding, they bury themselves in loose sand: and this observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gave me full satisfaction, that they were not (at least all the
kinds) connate and coalescent with their Shells, as other testace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Animals</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> are; but this being besides my
purpose, I return to the <hi>Purpura.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but that it is a Species of that kind; of
which there are many sorts, differing in bigness, structure, colour
of the Shell, according to the nature of the <hi>Sea</hi>-Grounds,
depth or shallowness of water, Rocks, Gravel, Mud, as also the
Latitude where they are found; and so differing also in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of colours of the tinging juice in their Veins, as black, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
violaceous, deep Sea-green, light and deep red, Amethy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the Histories of this <hi>Animal</hi> doe mention. But
the best of all were found in the <hi>Tyrian Seas,</hi> near that <hi>Island,</hi>
on which the renowned City of <hi>Tyre</hi> was built, now an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Town called <hi>Sur;</hi> this was celebrated, and prised above
all the rest, for that it excelled them all in its illustrious colour,
called in former Ages by divers Names, as <hi>Ostrum Sarranum, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagium,
Venenum Tyrium, Purpurissum, Flores Tyriani,</hi> &amp;c. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all <hi>Authors</hi> agree, that it lyes in a certain Vein in the Fish,
and some of them mention it to be white and viscous, as this of
ours is. It were to little purpose to give the History at large of
all the <hi>Purpurae;</hi> and when and how first discovered to <hi>Phoenix</hi>
the Son of <hi>Agenor,</hi> the second King of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> by means
of a Shepheards Dog devouring one of the Fishes, and colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his lips with that excellent dye: By which its Antiquity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
In succeeding Ages it received improvements, to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102755:7"/>
time of <hi>Pliny,</hi> in whose days (being in the Reign of the <hi>Vespasians</hi>)
it seems to have arrived at its highest perfection; of which he hath
made more particular Observations than I can find in other <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;</hi>
for which he had great opportunity, living in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
City of the World, where the Artists in Preparations of that
Tinging <hi>Succus,</hi> for dying the Robes and other Vestments of
the Emperors, Senators <hi>&amp;c.</hi> strove to excell each other in new
fashioned Purples for their own gain, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to gratify the
luxuriant excess of the Great Ones of those times, by preparing
and mixing the colour (found in the several sorts of Shells, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.)
This colour sold then at great Prises; that which
was fine double dyed Purple of <hi>Tyre,</hi> called <hi>Dibapha,</hi> yielded
1000 <hi>Roman Denarii</hi> the pound, which is computed to be more
than Thirty Pounds <hi>Sterling:</hi> and this of ours being so excellent
a colour, without other preparation or addition of any thing to
it, may now, or at least hereafter (by farther improvement)
vye with the <hi>Tyrian Purple. Iohnston</hi> out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> mentions
a Species of these <hi>Fishes,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Littorales quae par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae
&amp; flore sunt rubro;</hi> this agrees with ours, which may be
named <hi>Purpura littoralis (sive</hi> Teniensis) <hi>parva turbinata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the importunity of some Friends hastned this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

Experiments, which I might have made this next Summer) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming

of it, which could not be so well digested (in the

a publick Imployment, which requires my dayly Attendance; I
