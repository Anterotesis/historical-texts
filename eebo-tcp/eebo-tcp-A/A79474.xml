            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I deſire to cloſe up this point in a word, All reall Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are ſpirituall Kings; the Prince of the Kings of the earth loved us ſo well, as to waſh us in his own pretious blood, that he might make us Kings unto God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5, 6.

If our ſouls fall into a league with Sin, and Satan, Death, and Hell, our ſouls are made ignoble; we are ſervants of ſin, ſlaves of Satan, the undoubted heirs of Hell and damnation: But if when Chriſt makes love to our ſouls, we do with all humilitie and thankfulneſſe, embrace the offer, and take him for our Lord, and our Love, our King, and our Husband: We have Heaven made over to our ſouls for ever, not as a Joynture, but an Inheritance: We are Kings to God, and Heirs, Coheirs with Chriſt. <hi>Such Honour have all the Saints;</hi> for they are the men whom the King of Kings doth delight to honour, and they ſhall continue in their honour, becauſe they underſtand their dependance, and will continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence, to the fountain of honour: They ſhall not be like the Beaſts of the field, but like the Angels of Heaven, ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with honour, and crowned with glory: And ſo I paſſe to my ſecond obſervation; which is briefly this.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are Beaſts for want of underſtanding,</hi> or for want of conſideration; for they will not underſtand, ſo <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> renders it: They are ſo wilfully inconſiderate, that they become like bruite Beaſts that have no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Men in Honour are very bruitiſh, if they underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the eternall welfare of their pretious ſoul, nothing concerning Religon, and Happineſſe, Heaven and Holineſſe: Surely, ſaith that ingenuous man, <hi>Prov. 30. 2, 3.

            <p>I have touched upon the former Character, give me leave to point at the latter.</p>
            <p>Men in Honour do extremely debaſe, and diſhonour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by ſenſualitie, by corrupting themſelves in thoſe things which they know naturally; that is, in thoſe things which are diſcerned by their outward and inward ſenſe: They are more corrupt then bruit Beaſts, by indulging to their Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, by pleaſing their Senſes, and gratifying their Luſts. <hi>What</hi> is the reaſon, that men in honour are ſo <hi>Phantaſticall,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they live like Beaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by <hi>phantaſie,</hi> rather then like men by <hi>reaſon? They</hi> that feed high, and make it their buſineſſe to pleaſe their ſenſes, and pamper their luſts, muſt needs be bruitiſh at laſt; for their very reaſon is incarnate, it grows fat and fleſhly, and therefore, they embrace principles of ſenſuality, inſtead of principles of Moralitie, or Divinitie: They have <hi>groſſe ſouls,</hi> though <hi>wanton wits,</hi> and all their wit is but like a flaſh of lightning, which doth not direct, but puzzle, and dazzle the eye of reaſon, or elſe their wit is but a vapouring wit, and vapours eclipſe, and overcloud the riſing beauty of the light of nature.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This preeminence tends to a greater downfall; If wicked men had not immortall ſouls, they could not be eternally tormented after death, in the angry flames of helliſh Brimſtone?</p>

My Lords, you are not told often enough of Hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and therefore, I do ſo often thunder out damnation, that I might keep you from being damned: Tell me, ye ſons of Nobles, Whether your delicate ſences can endure the touch of fire, or ſmell of brimſtone; can your ſouls dwell with everlaſting burnings; can you wade thorow a River of brimſtone, kindled with the wrath of God? Oh the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and eternitie of Helliſh torments, is unutterable, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable. In Hell death ever lives, the damned cannot die, but do eternally ſuffer a kinde of living death; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the eternitie of their torment is to them, the greateſt torment, and therefore they are ready to complain, that there is a thouſand Hels, and ten thouſand Devils in this word, <hi>eternitie.</hi> In Hell there are no degrees of honour, but there are degrees of torment; there's a black Prince of flames, and Nobles of darkneſſe; there's weeping and houling, and gnaſhing of teeth, out of deſperate indignation: The tongue is parched in the mouth, the marrow fried in the bones, the darkneſſe of the fire affright, them the heat of the fire torments them; and yet they are more tormented with the curſe and wrath of God, then the fire of Hell; Hell were no Hell, if it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112953:20"/>
were not for the wrath of God: But oh the loſſe of Honour, the loſſe of Heaven, the loſſe of Glory, the loſſe of the Favour of an infinite God, to a ſoul capable of Grace and Glory, that's an unſpeakable loſſe, becauſe an infinite loſſe, an infinite diſhonour, to be thus diſhonoured to all eternitie.

Come then, and take an holy revenge upon your ſelves to day, be grieved in your hearts, and pierced in your reins, for all your ignoble practiſes againſt the God of Heaven, repent with a kinde of indignation, as <hi>David</hi> did, and cry out: <hi>Oh what a fool was I, what a beaſt was I to diſhonour him, who is the fountain of Honour;</hi> Look upon your patern, <hi>Pſal. 73 21, 22.

But others that are men of working phantaſies, and timorous ſpirits, are uſually ſuſpitious for want of courage or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then they cannot but preoccupate evils, never plotted any where, but in their own brain, becauſe they are commonly led into ſome finiſter interpretation of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, by ſome prejudicate opinion, or ungrounded fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: The wiſeſt courſe therefore for men in honour, is to <hi>keep cloſe to their Rule,</hi> and in doubtfull caſes, to admit <hi>none but prudent, faithfull, and well-approved Counſellours;</hi> that if their prudence or fidel it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly. God hath an abſolute Power and Soveraign Command over the greateſt men in the World, and they owe <hi>Abſolute ſubjection to the will, pleaſure, providence of the God of Heaven:</hi> Come, acknowledge your ſubjection.

God having varietie of Inſtruments, doth delight to uſe <hi>them by turns;</hi> If any are unfaithfull, they have been uſed too long; but all that have faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their part of the ſervice, will not, or need not, repine,

if men of meaner abilities, <hi>take their turn,</hi> the meaner they are, the more ſhould <hi>God be glorified, and you humbled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. When God hath tried men in the duties of active obedience, he doth uſually call them to honour him farther, by paſſive obedience; and it is no eaſie matter <hi>to come off with honour in the paſſive part:</hi> Great ſpirits will finde it task enough for to be patient; they will have work enough to keep themſelves humble in ſuch a caſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they need not complain for want of work. My Lords, It is a <hi>Work indeed, to mortifie ſelf-love; it is no eaſie matter, for great men to take themſelves off from ſelf-confidence, ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe, and ſelf-ends, that their hearts may be wrought unto a ſelf-deniall;</hi> which is the foundation of Chriſtianitie, and at this time, the onely means in ſight of our ſafetie: Can you imitate <hi>David</hi> in one of the moſt royall ſervices that ever we read of; it was a ſelf-denying ſervice, a royall and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, but ſweet ſubmiſſion to the Will of God: <hi>If I finde favour in the eyes of God, he will bring me back again,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me farther; that was his meaning: <hi>But if he ſay, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do unto me as ſeems good in his ſight, 2 Sam.</hi> 15. 25, 26. My Lords, Suffer me to deal freely and honeſtly with you: It may be, God ſees that your hearts are like to be lifted up by too high an opinion, of what God hath done by you in former times, and therefore God would have you breath, and reſt a while, that you may be ſufficiently humbled, and ſo fitted for ſome higher and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler peece of active obedience; and then you'l ſhew more bright and glorious, after this ſeeming ſad eclipſe: <hi>At low water you have him to tread the banks, whileſt the ſhip is in the barbour, you may dreſſe it, and trim it, and make it able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſtorms and tempeſts.</hi> They that are employed, will ſhew themſelves men, they adventure far; and you have a full em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, your votes have an influence into all affairs of high concernment: Be not diſpleaſed, but reſt aſſured, That your active ſpirits, and inlarged hearts, will by the bleſſing of Heaven, have fairer opportunities, and better ſatisfaction in future employments; and then you will acknowledge, That though <hi>God did in your apprehenſion, chaſtiſe you with Scorpions,

            <p>The ſecond Quere, <hi>How your Honour may be preſerved, increaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By your leave my Lords, if you deſire to preſerve your Honour, you muſt preſerve the <hi>Fundamentals of Honour,</hi> and then let times alter as they will, you'l be ſure to preſerve <hi>all the Realitie of your Honour:</hi> He who hath learnt to preſerve a juſt Order, and true Decorum in all things, which concern <hi>God, the Common-wealth, and himſelf,</hi> he will by <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſing preſerve, nay, increaſe his Honour every day more and more. That Honour which is maintained by vulgar breath, is, <hi>But like Lightning, it appears, and vaniſhes in an inſtant;</hi> But he who <hi>deſerves,</hi> doth in the judgement of good and wiſemen, <hi>preſerve his Honour, though the people ceaſe to do him Honour.</hi> The ſtrongeſt Foundation of Honour <hi>(which layes a man low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and yet raiſes him higheſt) is Reall Pietie:</hi> The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers <note place="margin">Pietie.</note> were acquainted with ſome kinde of Pietie to order us in thoſe things which belong to <hi>God:</hi> They could treat of a certain Reverence and Divine Reſpect, due from ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Creatures, to the Creatour, Preſerver and Governour of all things: They perceived, by the light of Nature, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, Petitions and Thanks,</hi> were to be duly preſented by us Mortals, to the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven: They were convinced, that <hi>God</hi> was offended with ſin; and concluded, That he was to be appeaſed by Sacrifice, for it could not enter into their reaſonable mindes, to conceive, <hi>That all our prayers, or any of our performances, could give ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God;</hi> and yet they were invincibly ignorant, that our <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and none but our <hi>Jeſus</hi> alone, could give him all-ſufficient ſatisfaction: And this Piety they laid as the ground and foundation of all other vertues.

               <hi>you, theſe have no need of a Candle to ſee what miſchief you do in the dark.</hi> Next to Piety, the Philoſophers conceived that <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Morall vertues</hi> were the ſure Fundamentals of ſubſtantiall Honour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Prudence</hi> was in their conceit, as a ſilken ſtring, which runs thorow all the Morall vertues, as ſo many Pearls, knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all together, and making a Bracelet, a Chain of Honour, fit to adorn the Necks, the Souls of Nobles; for <hi>Prudence</hi> is that vertue which doth order even <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf, which being carnall, is apt to be irregular: The other vertues which they called <hi>Morall,</hi> were to regulate our will and affections, indeed our whole life and converſation. Theſe, theſe are the Fundamentals of Reall Honour: He then that deſires to preſerve his Honour, muſt be a prudent and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, becauſe <hi>Honour is as unſeemly for a fool, as Snow is unſeaſonable in Summer, or Rain in Harveſt, Prov.</hi> 26. 1.

Yes, this ignoble age hath plotted how to diſhonour God in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable way.</hi> In a word, Be your ſins old, or new, ſins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Tradition from your forefathers, and therefore, received with honour; as if they were ſome noble vices, which ought to be ſtanders to your noble Families; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and ſadly conſider it, He that reſolves to live in any ſin, but till to morrow morning, may for ought he knows, die, and periſh in his ſin; the Divell may come and fetch away
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:112953:29"/>
his ſoul this night, and he may be in Hell ere morning. The God of Heaven, ſet that conſideration home to your hearts; you muſt fall down upon your faces, and acknowledge, That <hi>God</hi> is in this Meditation of a trueth: The Lord Jeſus did preſſe this point home in his powerfull preaching, you may read it thrice in one Chapter, <hi>John</hi> 8. 21, 24. It is one of the moſt fearfull threats in Scripture; for it doth indeed contain all threatnings in it.</p>
            <p>My Lords, Will nothing touch your hearts; yes, I beleeve your hearts have been touched to day, and touched to the quick. Now then, my Lords, what ſay you now? Why ſure you are come to this reſolution, ye would not die in your ſins, that were to die baſely, to die diſhonourably: Why then, my Lords, If you would not die in your ſins, ye muſt not live in them; Oh but how ſhall we be ſaved from all our ſins, our ignoble ſins? Why though <hi>Joſhuah</hi> be called <hi>Jeſus, Heb.</hi> 4. 8. and the people were wont to bow every time that Text was read, yet) there is but one Jeſus, the Lord Jeſus, who can ſave us from our ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. Oh now your hearts relent, and give a little: Now, now conſider, how you have abuſed and undervalued; how you have crucified and tormented this Jeſus, who alone can ſave you from your ſins: How you have made a ſport and paſtime of thoſe ſins which let out the heart blood of Jeſus Chriſt. What, are your hearts like <hi>Nabals,</hi> dead within you? Or are you caſt into a trembling fit; are you fainting, and even ſwowning under the weight of Gods wrath, and your ſin: why now, now you are in this agony and bloody ſweat, the Lord Jeſus offers himſelf to be your Saviour upon fair and honourable terms, do you deliberate, whether you ſhould be ſaved? Why then take him Jaylour, clap ſome bolts upon his conſcience, and let the iron enter into his ſoul; let him taſte a cup of brimſtone, and ſee how he likes it before hand; let the Law thunder curſes upon him, and the ſpirit of bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age flaſh ſome lightning into his ſoul. Oh baſe unworthy wretch doeſt thou capitulate with thy Judge, and ſcorn thy Saviour; is thy minde prepoſeſſed with prejudice againſt Chriſt, and are thy affections preingaged to the fleſh, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:112953:29"/>
world, the divell; doſt love thy ſin better then thy Saviour? Why then thou art mad upon thy pleaſure, thou art drunk with honour, and bewitched with gain; enjoy thy ſin, and hug thy damnation, the Lord Jeſus will not beſtow himſelf on ſuch a ſot: Yet once more Ile ask the queſtion, for ought thou knoweſt, it may be the laſt time of asking; Wilt thou have Jeſus Chriſt <hi>for thy antiquitie, for thy nobilitie,</hi> for thy husband, thy King, thy Prophet, thy Prieſt, thy Saviour, thy <hi>All?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt will binde <hi>Kings in chains, and Nobles in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iron;</hi> he will <hi>powre contempt</hi> upon Princes, if they contemn him. What ſay you then, my Lords, (and what ſay you Brethren) will you ſubmit your necks to the yoak, and your ſhoulders to the burthen of Jeſus Chriſt? Will you deny your ſelves, take up your croſſe daily, and follow him? Will you beleeve him, truſt him, love him, obey him. Give me leave to inſiſt a little upon thoſe two ſpeciall duties of Faith and Love; and I pitch upon them the rather, becauſe Faith and Love are <hi>Radicall Graces, and you can never prove</hi>

               </gap>. Faith is the eye of the ſoul; Reaſon is blinde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith. <hi>Except a man be born from above,</hi> (except his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be raiſed, elevated by Faith, inlightned by the Spirit) <hi>he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> as our Saviour told that Ruler of the Jews, when he catechiſed him, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. Every true beleever hath ſo much underſtanding, as to aſſent to the truth, and ſo much ingenuity, as to conſent to the goodneſſe of all the promiſes.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll already. Remember, that though Jeſus Chriſt be King of all the world, in a <hi>providentiall way,</hi> yet he is <hi>King of Saints onely, in a ſpirituall and ſaving way.</hi> Chriſt will ſave none but Saints; ſuch honour, immortall honour, have all his Saints, and none but Saints; none but his Saints, whoſe conſciences, Chriſt hath purged from the guilt, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſin, and whoſe hearts he hath purified from the Love, <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14. Acts 15. 9.</note> (and their whole man, from the power, and dominion) of ſin, by a lively Faith, that they may ſerve the living God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. True Faith is a reſting and relying grace, Faith <note place="margin">III.</note> doth ſupport the feeble ſoul, the ſinking ſoul, by leaning upon Gods arm, and Chriſts boſome; becauſe thou didſt <hi>relie</hi> on <note place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 8. 2 Chro. 14. 11.</note> the Lord, ſaith the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

for juſtification? Then it is well, but a beleever muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe live in a conſtant dependance upon God, for perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in grace, and then he is right.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Faith is a <hi>radicall grace;</hi> and therefore as the <note place="margin">IV.</note> root of a tree ſucks nouriſhing moiſture from the earth, fo a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>leever, ſucks and draws nouriſhing vertue, freſh vertue, and new ſupplies every day, from Jeſus Chriſt: Faith doth not onely depend upon Chriſt, and adhere to him, but ſuck from him; it hangs upon the Ordinances of Chriſt, the Breaſts of Chriſt, as the Infant hangs upon the Mothers breaſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. <hi>Faith is a mortifying and quickning grace,</hi> Becauſe <note place="margin">V.</note> it draws vertue from Chriſt, to mortifie our luſts, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us to a lively performance of all duties, in their due place and ſeaſon: Upon dayes of Humiliation, the beleever draws much power from the death of Chriſt, to mortifie his luſt, and ſets upon all tasks of mortification in the ſtrength of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly. Faith is a victorious grace, <hi>it overcomes the world,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">VI.</note> 
               <hi>and the Divel, and it doth both, by purifying our hearts, and mortifying our luſts:</hi> For if our hearts be purified, and our luſts mortified, the world, and divell, are not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt us; <hi>We ſhall come of with honour in the main battle, at the latter end of the day,</hi> though we may be foiled now and then in a skirmiſh, and give ground a little, when we are too hotly charged, and over-borne by violence. <hi>The divel cannot throw a fiery dart at us, but faith will quench it: If our luſts do not fire us, the dart cannot wound us: Take the ſhield of Faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>That ye may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the divel: Above all</hi> other pieces of Chriſtian armour, <hi>take the ſhield of Faith, Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. The leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of true Faith, doth in ſome meaſure overcome the world, becauſe it doth perſwade the heart (even before the man hath any cleer bright evidence of his own election) that there are better things laid up <hi>for the elect,</hi> in Chriſt, then any the world can beſtow upon them; better honour, better riches, better glory. Chriſt is a pretious Chriſt, to all true beleevers, to you, <hi>who beleeve he is an Honour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. The originall

Would ye then my Lords, (and you dear Chriſtians) gain an immortall glorious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; you ſee the ready way, beleeve, beleeve, and Jeſus Chriſt will be an Honour to you: But remember that your Faith muſt be the Faith of Chriſtians, not the faith of Divels; it muſt be ſuch a pretious faith, as purifies the heart, purges the conſcience, aſſents, and conſents to Chriſt; ſuch a faith as overcomes the world, and quenches the fiery darts of the divell, by reſting upon Chriſt, and drawing vertue from him.</p>
