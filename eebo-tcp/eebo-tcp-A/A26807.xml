            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is the privilege of Christianity, <hi>that Life and Immortality are brought to Light in the Gospel.</hi> The Heathen World sat in Darkness, was secure in Misery: As one that sleeps is pleas'd with the Scenes of Fancy; he Dreams of Treasures of Gold, of Gardens, of Feasts, and thinks the painted Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, the superficial
<pb facs="tcp:42567:3"/>
Colours of Good to be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: thus whilst Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was darkned by Sense, the World was content with pleasant Delusions. Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the many pretenders to Wisdom, had a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing knowledg of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Eternity to come? Who had a glimpse of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness that results from the sight of God in Glory? This Instruction so refreshing our Spirits, darkned with Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows here, comes from the School of Heaven: as the Sun revives us by its
<pb facs="tcp:42567:3"/>
chearful Appearance, and affords that Light, without which it were impossible to behold it.</p>
            <p>During the Legal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, there was a Mist upon the Future State. The notice of Eternal Things was a Twilight mixt with Shadows. The Revelation of the Heavenly Glory was reserv'd till our Saviour's appearing in the World, who purchas'd it with the dearest price, and offers it upon such gracious Terms,
<pb facs="tcp:42567:4"/>
that whosoever sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and seeks, shall obtain it; and none shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of it, but for their wilful and guilty neglect. It might be expected that such a Proposal were sufficient to engage Men with all their Active Powers to secure such a precious Interest, when indeed their best En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and most zealous Affections are too slight and faint, with respect to that excellent Happiness. Are not the first Notions of
<pb facs="tcp:42567:4"/>
Things that are written in our Brests, sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that what is for ever, is to be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what suddenly passes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Or is it necessary in Matters of Temporal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, to use strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perswade us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to chuse a Treasure that will enrich us for our Lives, than what will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase food only for a day? Yet 'tis strange to amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in Things of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Weight &amp; Consequence
<pb facs="tcp:42567:5"/>
that respect the Soul, and trivial Things that respect the Body, Men make as preposterous a Judgment and Choice, as if they were irreconcilable Enemies to themselves, and obstinately averse from their own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. The Life to come extends beyond all possible Number of Ages; the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is so compleat and sure, that the least shadow of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil shall never eclipse it: The Soul shall be in a state of highest Perfection and
<pb facs="tcp:42567:5"/>
Joy; the Vnderstanding illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, with no more study, than opening the Eye and fixing it on the Glorious Objects, the Will satisfied with the perfect Love and Enjoyment of the Blessed God: The Body shall be clothed with Light as with a Garment, and shine with a Beauty that never disflourishes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays; the innumerable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of Angels and Saints always affords new and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable Delights; and what is set in comparison against
<pb facs="tcp:42567:6"/>
this transcendent Felicity in Heaven? The poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable vanishing Life on Earth: whose Pleasures are so shallow and empty, that they can't satisfy the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, much less our noble and comprehensive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: whose Griefs are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so heavy and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that all the Comforts of the World are no more effectual to relieve the Soul labouring under them, than the sounding of Brass, and the tinckling of Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,
<pb facs="tcp:42567:6"/>
usually done by the Heathens, were to free the Moon from its dark Eclipse, which they fancied to labour in extremity. Yet the petty Preferments, the deceitful Riches, the vain Pleasures here are chosen, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously and eagerly persued, and the infinite everlasting Happiness hereafter under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued and rejected. But as the Wonder ceases, that a Man doth not see in the clearest Day, by saying, He is blind: so Carnal Men
<pb facs="tcp:42567:7"/>
are without Faith, that is, the Internal Light of the Mind, they do not stedfastly believe the Reality of the Divine World, tho so clearly open'd in the Gospel. They are under so strong a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Error of Sensuality, that they vilify a Spiritual Happiness, a Glorious Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and present sensible Things, of no price in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, have the highest place in their Esteem and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The proper Means to recover Man from his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:42567:7"/>
Folly, are unceasing fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers, That <hi>the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give unto them the Spirit of Wisdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the knowledg of him: The Eyes of their Understandings being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, that they may know what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints:</hi> and to represent this World, and the next, as they are to
<pb facs="tcp:42567:8"/>
their considerate Minds, that their Interest and Duty, with united Efficacy, may over-rule their Hearts, and turn the Stream of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours into the right Channel; that the judicious Comparison between Objects so vastly differing, may be the governing Principle of their Lives. All Things are vain and transient, within the Confines of Time; all Things stable and solid in the Territories of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

            <p>OUR blessed Saviour in the words, applies Heavenly Comfort to his Disciples, to support their drooping Spirits in his absence from them: He foretold his departure;<note place="margin">Ch. 13.33.</note> 
               <hi>Little Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, whither I go, ye cannot come: so now I say unto you.</hi> This tenderly affected their Hearts: But that their Sorrow might not flow into Despair, he assures them, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42567:9"/>
their Separation should not be final, and that it was not the singular Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note> that <hi>he should follow him hereafter</hi>; but that there were Rooms reserved in Heaven for them all, and He would return and receive them to Himself. This Consolation He addresses to them in a very affectionate manner,<note place="margin">Ch. 19.1.</note> 
               <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled:</hi> No Work is more Divine, none more proper and delightful to our Saviour, than to comfort the afflicted Spirits of his People. He directs them, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also in me.</hi> God is the Supreme Object of Faith, his unchangeable Love and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with his infinite Power in the accomplishing his Promises, is the Security of Believers. Christ, as Mediator between God and guilty Creatures, is the immediate Object of our Faith; for he restores us to the Favour of God, therefore 'tis said,<note place="margin">1 Peter 1.21.</note> we believe in God by him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Preface to calm the unquiet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42567:9"/>
Agitations of their Minds, and make them more receptive of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he proposeth to them;</p>
            <p n="1">1. A blessed Doctrine; <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House are many Mansions,</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive all his Disciples.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gives them an infallible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it. 1. From his inviolate Love and Truth, <hi>If it were not so, I would have told you.</hi> 2. That his going away, was not to reign alone in the Kingdom of Glory, <hi>but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Point that I shall discourse of from these words, is this; There is a blessed Place Above prepared for all the faithful Disciples of Christ, wherein they shall be glorified with him for ever.</p>
            <p>In the managing this Argument, I will endeavour;</p>
            <p n="1">1. To represent the Excellencies of this Place specified by his Father's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42567:10"/>
House, and the state of Felicity that is inseparable from all that dwell in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider the infallible Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we have of obtaining it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Excellencies of this Place may be argued from the Maker of it, and its Attributes specified in Scripture.<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Heb. 11.10</note> First, God is said to be the artificial Builder of this City, to signify a correspondent Excellency in the Work to the Divine Maker. All the Works of God have a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Impression of his Power and Providence, but in some are more conspicuous Characters of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: For the wise Author of all Things, hath ordered their several degrees of Excellence, both in the Matter, and various Art of adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, suitable to the End for which they were design'd. Now the supreme Heaven was made to be the Temple of the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, wherein he would diffuse the richest Beams of his Goodness and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42567:10"/>
Glory to his chosen Servants for ever, and accordingly is a most noble Work of his Omnipotent Hand; and there are two Remarks to be made in its Creation, from whence we may infer its peculiar Excellency.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis the beginning of the Creation. Amongst intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Angels are the First-Born of God's Power; and in Natural and Divine Prerogatives excel Men. From hence it is that the Excellency of any praise-worthy Quality in Men, is set forth by a resemblance of the Angels. Excellent Wisdom in <hi>David, My Lord, the King, is like an Angel of God.</hi> Excellent Eloquence by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is stiled <hi>the Tongues of Angels.</hi> Heroick Vertue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Holiness in the Christian Church, <hi>The House of</hi> David <hi>shall be as the Angel of the Lord</hi>; for that which is highest in any kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is the Rule and Measure of the degrees of that Perfection. And thus in forming the material
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42567:11"/>
World, the supreme Heaven hath the precedence in order and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before all the other Parts of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed <hi>Moses</hi> only recites particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Creation of the visible World; and by what gradations this great Fabrick with all its Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture was compleated: And the History of that is instructive of the Creation of invisible Things, which is expresly specified in the Gospel. But, as Paradise was first made, and then Man created to be the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of it; so we may infer, that the highest Heaven, the Seat of the Angels, was made before they were created. Now the Angels (we are inform'd by Divine Revelation) were present when the <hi>Foundations of the Earth were laid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 38.4, 5, 7.</note> 
               <hi>and God stretched his Line upon it: Then the Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy.</hi> They saw the rising World, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and beauty of its Frame, the admirable Order that distinguishes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42567:11"/>
and unites its Parts, that all Things were divinely done, and transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wonder and joy celebrated the praises of the Creator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Supreme Heaven is the effect of God's immediat Creation. The Earth with all its Ornaments was form'd of preexistent Matter: the <hi>Chaos,</hi> a confused Mass, was the <hi>Embrio</hi> of the sublunary World: but the Supreme Heaven is his more immediate and exquisit Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and receiv'd its Being and Perfection at once. You may illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate this by the Account is given by <hi>Moses</hi> of the Creation of Man; <hi>God made Man of the Dust of the Ground.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> His Body derives its Birth from the low Element; and the Wisdom of the Creator is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the artificial structure of it: 'Tis added, <hi>God breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life</hi>; and <hi>Man became a living Soul.</hi> The Earth enters into the composition of his Body, but his Soul was inspired by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42567:12"/>
the Breath of God; that is, by his Divine Power immediately created; and in nobility of Nature, and its spiritual Endowments, incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly excels the Body. And the third Heaven, though not a spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, yet in the purity of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, far transcends whatever was form'd of gross Matter.</p>
            <p>This being premis'd, I will now consider what the Scripture reveals to us of that place that is eminently the House of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Amplitude of it. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>The Way is narrow, and the Gate strait that leads to it,</hi> to excite our diligence; but there <hi>are many Mansions</hi> in the Celestial Pallace to encourage our Hopes. 'Tis therefore call'd <hi>a City, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> If we look up to the shining Sky, wherein are the Sun, that by the computation of late <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Boyle, <hi>Of the high Veneration Man's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect ows to God,</hi> &amp;c. p. 11.</note> Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, some thousands of times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Earth in its magnitude; and innumerable Stars, and some of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42567:12"/>
that greatness, that they eighty times exceed this Globe of Earth; tho to the ignorant, and therefore incredulous, they are judged to be as they appear, (upon the account of that unmeasurable distance between the Firmament and us) but glister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing points of Light: our Minds will be tir'd and lost in taking mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of that that seemeth boundless: and this vast Expansion, with all the glorious Luminaries, is but the Portal of the House of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Solomon,</hi> setting forth the boundless Greatness of God, saith, <hi>Behold the Heaven,</hi> and <hi>the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him</hi>; that is, neither the Airy nor Ethereal Heaven, nor the Supreme Heaven that encompasses and exceeds it. 'Tis a spacious Pallace, becoming the Divine Maker's Greatness, the Image of his Immensity: and the State of Felicity there is answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The blessed God, in whom there is an eternal Union of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42567:13"/>
perfections, <hi>is all in all to his People.</hi> The Sun in its brightness may be as truly included in a Spark, as the Divine Excellencies be measur'd by created Contemplation. There is an infinite variety in the Supreme Good, that makes it always rare and new in the fruition. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Love, and universal Fulness of the Deity, exceedingly satisfies all the Desires, and perpetuates the Delights of the Saints. He stiles himself, in the gracious Covenant with his People, <hi>I am God Alsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; walk before me, and be perfect.</hi> He is sufficient in all things that are requisite, to the compleat Felicity of the most comprehensive Spirits; and is sufficient to make all that innumerable Company of Angels and Saints, as happy as one Person. <hi>God is Light,</hi> and the Emanations of his Goodness are sensibly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by it. Heaven is call'd, <hi>the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> As the Sun (his Almoner) diffuses
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42567:13"/>
its Light and Heat so generally, that every one indifferently enjoys it without prejudice to others. As the Sun streams forth in Rays every moment, yet (which is a perpetual Miracle in Nature) without the least diminution of his Lustre and Efficacy: thus the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness dispences his influences of Knowledg, and Love, and Joy, to all the blessed Assembly above, and is the universal Happiness of all, and the entire Happiness of every Saint. God is an inexhaustible Fountain of Felicity:<note place="margin">Quantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Fons vincit si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientem.</note> As he that drinks of a living Spring, (tho inflam'd with thirst) yet leaves it flowing and full as before, sufficient to refresh a thousand Men without being dry:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> thus God is able to make many Worlds happy. An earthly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is either entirely and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the first Born's, or is lessen'd by division:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> but all <hi>the Sons of God</hi> have the dignity of <hi>the first born,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and <hi>are Heirs of God,</hi> and enjoy an
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42567:14"/>
undivided Inheritance. Our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father verifies to every Saint, what the Father in the Parable said to his Son, <hi>All that I have is thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The stability and firmness of it. The Apostle <hi>saith, 'Tis a City that hath Foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God.</hi> Cities that are raised by the greatest Kings, who are corruptible, and mortal, are so slite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built, that they may be consum'd by Fire, batter'd by Storms, and without external Violence, yet from an inward principle of Decay, sink into Ruins: but Heaven is the <hi>City of the living God,</hi> the Seat of his eternal Empire. This present World is like a Tent pitcht for a time, whilst the Church is sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wilderness: the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid parts of it,<note place="margin">Psal. 102. 2 Peter <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</note> the visible Heaven, and Earth, shall perish, either by an entire Consumption, or their ruin shall terminate in a renovation to a better State. But the third Heaven is above the dominion of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42567:14"/>
exempted from all changes, and for ever remains. 'Tis <hi>an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance incorruptible, undefiled, and fades not away:</hi> The integrity, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and glory of it are always the same. 'Tis the habitation of God's Throne,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> He <hi>sits in Heaven</hi> secure from all the tumultuous Conspiracies of his Enemies, and derides their impious Attempts, against his Son, and Church. His Throne is unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken there, notwithstanding things below are turn'd about in a vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Circle. And as the House, so the Inhabitants, and their felicity, are eternal. <hi>Glory, Honour, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> are the Reward of all that patiently continue in well-doing.</hi> Our Saviour assures his Disciples, <hi>Because I live, ye shall live also. He tasted Death for them, and swallowed it up in Victory.</hi> He declar'd in Vision to St. <hi>John, Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am alive for evermore.</hi> The Lord of Life will uphold the Saints in that blessed State for ever: They shall never fall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42567:15"/>
out of the Arms and Bosom of a gracious God. He will never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Love, and they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forfeit it: for Sin is from the perverseness of the Will, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Affections, join'd with some error of the Mind. But in the Light of Glory, and full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, the Understanding is so perfectly illuminated, the Will and the Affections so exceedingly satisfied, that 'tis impossible they should apprehend erroneously, or desire irregularly.</p>
            <p>This glorious Advantage the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Saints have (by Jesus Christ who <hi>obtain'd eternal Redemption for them)</hi> above the Grace given to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Man in the first Creation.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note> The Angels were upon trial of their Obedience, not in a determin'd state of Felicity. Their first declination of Love and Subjection, was a downfal from their blessed Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Woful change! how unlike themselves in their original Purity,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42567:15"/>
and Glory? An unparallel'd Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the frailty of the Creature that forsakes God, and of the Divine Severity. Man did but stand in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise for a little while, and had a ruinous fall with all his Progeny. But the glorified <hi>Saints actually sit with Christ in Heavenly Places,</hi> and enjoy an unchangeable happy State. The felicity Above is permanent, as the everlasting Object that produces and preserves it, and the everlasting Soul wherein it dwells. Blessed Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity! how triumphantly do the glorified in Heaven sing, <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever.</hi> Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Relations, how near soever, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in Death; and the sorrow of losing them, is in proportion to the delightful enjoying them. But the Heavenly Relation between God and the Saints, is as everlasting, as the Object on which 'tis fixt: This God in whom are all amiable Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, all Sweetness and Beauty to feed Desires and Delights, is our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42567:16"/>
God in strict propriety, in the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most reviving fruition for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Their Happiness is crown'd with Eternity. This is so real an accession to their Felicity, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the entire assurance of it, the state of Blessedness were incompleat; the least jealousie of losing it, would disturb their peaceful fruition, and joyful tranquillity in Heaven: For as Hope in Misery allays Sorrow, so fear in Happiness lessens Joy. The apprehension of losing such a Kingdom, would cause torment. But, as in the contrary state, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Sinners that are in Hell, under an utter impossibility of deliverance, are rack'd and tortur'd by absolute despair: So the Blessed Above, that enjoy the Beatifick Vision, by the infallible assurance of its perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are fill'd with a Joy unspeakable and glorious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Sanctity of this blessed House. 'Tis separate from the rest of the World in its sublime Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42567:16"/>
and its unparallel'd Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Sanctity of Place is Relative, and is founded, either upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of God's special Presence, or consecration of it to his Service. 'Tis consistent with the Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity, to be differently present in several places: as the Soul is in another manner present in the Head, where it performs its noblest Operations, than in other parts of the Body; and upon any special ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God, a Place is Sacred. Thus when <hi>Moses</hi> approach'd to see the Flaming Bush, he was enjoin'd, <hi>Do not come near hither</hi>;<note place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>pluck off thy Shoes from off thy Feet, the place where thou standest is Holy Ground.</hi> The visible Testimony of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Presence sanctified the Place, and the most humble outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence was due, a Sign and Effect of the internal Respect that is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his most adorable Majesty. The sanctity of that Place, was an extraordinary Relation, and ceas'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42567:17"/>
upon the vanishing of the Flame, the sign of God's Presence. There is also a Relative Sanctity, by the Consecration of Time or Place for Holy Uses. Thus the Seventh Day, upon the finishing the Creation, was hallowed by God himself, set apart as the first Fruits of Days for his Service, and applied to Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that Man might more entirely exercise his Mind in admiring and praising the Creator, whose Glory was visible in his Works. And in both these respects, the Temple of of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was Holy, as being appropriated to God's Service by his own Election and Appointment; and being the place wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited his Presence in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Solomon</hi> expresseth this as the End of building the Temple, in his Letter to the King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> desiring his Assistance;<note place="margin">2 Chr. 2.4.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I build an House to the Name of the Lord my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet Incense, and for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42567:17"/>
the continual Shewbread, and for the burnt-Offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, and on the new Moons, and on the solemn Feasts of the Lord our God.</hi> And we read, at the Dedication of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, that a suddain thick Cloud obscur'd the Air, a sign of God's descending and acceptance, whose invisible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was veiled under it: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that Sacred Darkness, or fear at the unexpected Miracle,<note place="margin">2 Chr. 5.13, 14.</note> the Priests could not minister because of the Cloud. The Sacrifices, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, and all the Temple-Service was interrupted. But the Temple built with Hands, and all its pompous Service, was but an imperfect mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Shadow of the <hi>Holy Temple</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,<note place="margin">Psal. 11.4.</note> where God exhibits his Sacred Presence, not in a dark Vapour, but in the richest Beams of Glory, and wherein that most pure Spirit is worship'd in Spirit and Truth for ever. The Saints are <hi>a Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to God,</hi> in a state of Eminency,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42567:18"/>
and separation from the rest of the World: They now offer up the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Praise, and the sacred In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense of Prayer, infinitely more pleasing to God than all the Sacrifice of Beasts, and the most precious Gums, and Aromatick Spices, that with their sweet Smoak perfum'd the Temple. But <hi>in the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies Above, (where no defiled thing can enter)</hi> they perform Divine Service in a Divine manner. The perfect Rest in Heaven,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> is <hi>a Sabbath's Rest,</hi> wherein our fervent Affections, the Springs of Activity, are in their powerful Exercise upon God. Here our faint Earth clogs our ascending Affections; and such is the tender Indulgence of our Heavenly Father, that <hi>when the Spirit is willing, tho the Flesh be weak,</hi> he pardons and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts us. But there our Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spiritual, qualified for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Heaven, and all our Powers are in a holy Heat and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, admiring and praising the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42567:18"/>
blessed God. Here the Saints often retire from the World, to worship the Divine Majesty in their Closets; and the secrecy of the Duty, is an Argument of the Sincerity. They with more freedom pour forth their Souls into his Bosom, and he insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the gracious acceptance of their Requests: But the noblest elevation of the Affections, is in communion with all the Saints and Angels above. The ardent Seraphims were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, crying one to another,<note place="margin">Isa. 6.3.</note> 
               <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> Here there must be some interval between the solemn Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the Circumstances of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State require it; but in the Heavenly Sanctuary, 'tis their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual work and delight to celebrate the high Praises of God: <hi>They are before his Throne, and serve him day and night in his Temple.</hi> The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Arabia the Happy,</hi> burn, for their common uses, those Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42567:19"/>
Trees, that produce Myrrh and precious Balm, of which the Sacred Incense was compounded: And 'tis no wonder, because those Trees grow common in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that is open to the most favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aspects of the Heavens, and the strongest heat of the Sun: But to our Countries, how little of those rich Perfumes are brought. And such is the Comparison between the Praises of the Angels and the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints, and ours here below. They are always in the noblest Work, excited by the highest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. They are always under the direct Beams of God's Favour, which are vigorously reflected in their Praises. All their Felicity is, to contemplate his excellent Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all their Pleasure to love him, all their Glory to obey him. Their affectionate Praises are renewed without intermission, because the Divine Favours are renewed every moment. There is a perpetual cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42567:19"/>
of Graces from the blessed Creator, and Thanksgivings from the happy Creature. All their joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Affections, all their solemn Thoughts and Reflections are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in that great and glorious Object. The Prophet declares their holy Employment; <hi>They continually speak of the glorious Honour of his Majesty, and of his wondrous Works: They speak of the Might of his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acts; and they declare his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sing of his Righteousness. The Lord is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great Mercy. The Lord is good to all, and his tender Mercies are over all his Works. All thy Works praise thee, O Lord, and thy Saints bless thee. They speak of the Glory of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and talk of thy Power. Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom; and thy Dominion endures through all Generations.</hi> They never cease to love, and admire, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease to praise him. Their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42567:20"/>
Hearts are eternally inflam'd, and their Mouths eternally open'd to glorify him. But with the highest veneration they adore his Mercy; that Perfection that is the special Glory &amp; the dearest delight of God; that which is the supreme of all the glorious Attributes in our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will be the principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of their Praises. <hi>They sing of the Mercies of the Lord for ever</hi>; that Mercy that chose them from Everlasting; that Mercy that in such an admirable manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them through the World, that never left them, but most wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order'd all things below in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their future Happiness; that Mercy that crowns them with Life and Immortality, when the reprobate World feel the most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effects of revenging Justice. We read of the Jews after their Captivity, upon their finishing the Temple, that with a transport of Joy, they cried, <hi>Grace! Grace!</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42567:20"/>
when God, who is the Author of our Salvation, shall have finish'd it, with what a sweet consent shall we celebrate his sacred Praises! Mercy upon Mercy, all is Mercy. Happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise! Heaven is a State of Joy and Thankfulness. <hi>Blessed are those that are in thy house they always praise thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The delightfulness of this Place. 'Tis call'd <hi>Paradise</hi> by our Saviour. He promises the penitent Thief, the Companion of his Cross, <hi>To day shalt thou be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi> Paradise was a Garden plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by immortal Hands, to be the Habitation of <hi>Adam</hi> in his state of original Righteousness, when the Favourite of Heaven: it was the Beauty and Delight, the Flower of the World, and with abundance, and variety, exceedingly satisfied all the desires of Life: 'twas water'd with four Rivers, to make it always pleasant, and fruitful. But the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Paradise as much excels it in Beauty and Pleasantness, as in its
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42567:21"/>
sublime situation: and the joyful satisfaction of the Soul in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and the blessed So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety there, infinitely excels all the innocent Delights of the natural Life. Heaven is a state of pure, full, and unfading Joy. The Joy of the Blessed is not mixt with things that may corrupt its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. There is an absolute exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all Evils. <hi>God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain.</hi> The Joy is full; 'Tis call'd <hi>our Master's Joy.</hi> Great God, how ineffable is that Joy! 'Tis the richest Reward infinite Bounty can give to faithful Servants. As <hi>being made like to Christ in Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Joh. 3.2.</note> implies a divine and full Perfection: so the <hi>entering into his Joy,</hi> implies the most accomplisht and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Felicity. 'Tis a permanent Joy that none shall take from the Blessed, as our Saviour promises his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42567:21"/>
Disciples. Here below, suppose a Person encompast with all the Good Things of the World, yet this Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is neither without Defects, nor without Dependance upon Casual Things, that he is never compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, but only less miserable: and tho he lives long in Prosperity, and hath a tenor of Health to enjoy it; yet, as the clearest Evening is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently follow'd by Night, so the most vigorous old Age is certainly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Death, that extinguishes all sensual pleasures. But in the <hi>Presence of God is fulness of Joy; at his Right Hand are Pleasures for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To explain this more particularly, let us consider, that Knowledg, Love, and Joy, are the Perfections and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of immortal Spirits, and are correspondent to the excellency of the Objects upon which they are fixt, and the capacity of the Faculties that are exercis'd, and the degrees of Satisfaction communicated to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42567:22"/>
them. Now in Heaven, our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Faculties, the Understanding and Will, are rais'd and enlarg'd, and entirely united to the best Objects. What conception can we frame of Joy for an intellectual Creature, so full and satisfying, as the clear Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God invested with all his attractive Attributes, his glorious Perfections, and in perfect loving the most lovely Object, and being perfectly lov'd by him? When the Soul freed from this mortal muddy Flesh, and the Mind clear'd from all terrene Images, convey'd by the Channels of the Senses, sees <hi>God Face to Face</hi>; how is it ravish'd with wonder and love in the sight of his most amiable Excellencies? How pure a Joy is infus'd to the Center of the Soul, and fills all its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires? How permanent, like the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Spring from whence it flows? The Psalmist inspir'd with the Love of God, breaks forth in an Holy Extasy;<note place="margin">Psal. 65.4.</note> 
               <hi>How blessed is that Man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42567:22"/>
whom thou chusest, and causest to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts? We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy House, even of thy Holy Temple.</hi> Admirable Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness! dear Felicity! The same Heavenly Saint expresses his esteem and affection; <hi>How excellent is thy loving kindness, O Lord!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 36.8.</note> 
               <hi>They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thy House: and thou shalt make them drink of the River of thy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> Here we <hi>do but taste and see how good the Lord is</hi>; and that is so powerful a Cordial, as gloriously supports the Saints under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest Sufferings. But Heaven is the Element of Joy. Here a glancing sight of his Goodness, how reviving is it? A living Vein of Light,<note place="margin">Acts 16.24, 25.</note> from his favourable Countenance, pierc'd into the miserable Dungeon where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were chain'd, and rais'd their Spirits to that Heavenly pitch, that they sang <hi>Praises to God:</hi> the illustrious reflection of Paradise,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42567:23"/>
               <hi>lightned them at Midnight,</hi> and put a gloss of Joy upon them. But in Heaven, those most divine and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable Titles, that <hi>God is Light, and that God is Love,</hi> are most fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and experimentally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the Saints. <hi>They see him as he is,</hi> in his essential Glory; and all the secret Treasures of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in his Works of Wonder are unfolded, and the sweetest Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations of his Love are given to them. That which the Prophet declares of God's tender Affections to his Church, is verified in the most excellent manner in Heaven; <hi>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is Mighty:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 3.17</note> 
               <hi>he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy: he will rest in his Love, he will joy over thee with sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> That the blessed God is well pleased in the glorified Saints, is the supreme degree of their Felicity. How joyful a Complacency arises from the Communion with the blessed Redeemer, and the Saints in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42567:23"/>
Heaven? Love is the first Fountain of Joy; and the more intense, the more ravishing is the Fruition. The Love of Christ to them was so great, that from Eternity he was infinitely pleas'd in the thoughts of their Salvation;<note place="margin">Prov. 8.31</note> 
               <hi>His Delights were with the Sons of Men,</hi> before they delighted in him. If the Design of that blessed Work was so pleasing, what is the Accomplishment? The Evangelical Prophet declares,<note place="margin">Isa. 53.11.</note> 
               <hi>He shall see of the travel of his Soul, and be satisfied.</hi> And the Love of the Saints to Christ, is a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Affection, according to their utmost Capacity. All the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were scatter'd here below, are concenter'd in him,<note place="margin">Omnia su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiria in Christo anhelent. Ille unus pulcherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus qui foedos di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexit, ut pulchros faceret, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideretur.</note> for he infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely deserves their Love, having ransom'd them with the dearest Price, and purchas'd for them an everlasting Inheritance. He lov'd them in their foul deformity, that he might superinduce a Divine Beauty upon them, and prepare them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42567:24"/>
for the enjoyment of himself. He is now their Desire, and in Heaven where he appears in all his Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Beauty, their everlasting Delight. We may conceive a little of their ravishing Communion, by the Language of Divine Love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and the Church, in the <hi>Song of Solomon,</hi> and their harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Affections exprest in the most endearing manner; <hi>Open to me my Love, my Dove, my Vndefiled:</hi> And the inflam'd Spouse, in a high and delightful rapture, breaks forth; <hi>I am my Beloved's, and he is mine.</hi> If a Propriety and Interest in him, be productive of such a pure Joy, what will the everlasting Fruition be? The Scripture represents it by a Marriage-Feast, as the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat resemblance of that spiritual Joy. Thus the Inhabitants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are introduc'd, speaking; <hi>Give Honour to him; for the Marriage of the Lamb is come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 19.7.</note> 
               <hi>and his Wife hath made her self ready.</hi> What Union!
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42567:24"/>
what Joy! How will the Saints rejoice in God their Saviour, in the view of the surprising Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his Love? The Scripture speaks of another accession to the Joys of Heaven, the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Company of Angels and Saints that live in perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, inviolable Love, the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Content, and joyful Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Society is a principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of Joy. What exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Joy will there be, when the whole Family of Heaven shall meet together in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House? We may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture how the Angels are affected to us, by what is recorded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their appearance at the Birth of our Saviour; <hi>There was a multitude of the heavenly Host praising God; saying, Glory be to God on High, on Earth Peace, good Will towards Men.</hi> 'Tis the first time since the Fall of Man, that we hear of the Angels Song:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42567:25"/>
They were commission'd to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish rebellious Sinners, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with flaming Swords, the Instruments of revenging Wrath. But when the Lord of Hosts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the God of Peace, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with Harps in their Hands, with Praise and Joy, celebrating his Mercy. They foresaw that Peace on Earth would end in the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and the Ruins of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Country, would be repair'd by our Salvation. And the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints are all Companions in the same Joy, and the same Blessedness. For never was there such a transforming of one Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into another here, as there is of the Saints in Heaven: They are all animated by the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit; their Thoughts and Inclinations are the same, and have the highest satisfaction in the felicity of one another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how good, and how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42567:25"/>
is it for Brethren to dwell for ever in Unity! Briefly, we find that sensible Joy is in its ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the times of the Harvest and Vintage, and after Victory; when the Blessings of God, the precious Fruits of the Earth, the Hopes of our Labours, and the Support and Comfort of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Life are received, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Joy fills the Country. Now <hi>Light is sown for the Righteous, and Joy for the upright in Heart. 'Tis sown in Tears, but reapt with Exultation.</hi> We gather the Fruits of Blessedness from Thorns, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and Mourning, Hunger, and Thirst, and Persecution: and this gives the more lively tincture to our Joy. The Joy of Victory is transporting, and that always in proportion to the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Power of the Enemies subdu'd, and the rich Spoils ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them. Now when our Spiritual Enemies, so numerous,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42567:26"/>
so powerful and irreconcileable to our Souls, Sin, Satan, Death, are utterly broken, how trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant a Joy follows?<note place="margin">Sed nihil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentius popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Romanus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spexit, quam illas quas ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muerat cum turribus suis bestias, quae non sine sensu captivitatis submissis cervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus victores equos seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur. <hi>Flor.</hi> lib. 1. c. 18.</note> The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian relating that most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Triumph at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> their proud and potent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was expell'd from <hi>Italy,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, That of all the Show, no part was more joyful, than to see the Elephants that had been so terrible, and carried Towers on their Backs, to be subdued and led in Triumph.

            <p n="5">5. The Glory of this Place is discovered in the Scripture. The <hi>Father of Christ is the God of Glory, and the Father of Glory</hi>; and Heaven is his lofty and glorious Throne, becoming his Excellent Majesty and Universal Dominion. <hi>The Lord hath prepared his Throne in the Heavens, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth over all.</hi> Glory in its first Notion signifies the brightness and lustre of Light, and from thence metaphorically imports Excellency in any Kind.

'tis call'd, <hi>The richly glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> When the Sun rises in its brightness, a Deluge of Gold overflows the World, and adorns the Universe: but this is but a Shadow of the inherent Glory of the highest Heaven.

The number of the Workmen were seventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, employ'd seven Years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission; the Materials were very rich and splendid, Gold, and Cedar, and precious Stones: and the excellency of the Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was such, that no humane

Art can equal: for it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del'd by the Divine Mind; and the delineation of its Parts was sent to <hi>David</hi> by an Angel.

The Earth since Man's Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42567:28"/>
doth not remain in its Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive State, but hath lost much of its Beauty and Usefulness. At first it was intirely suitable to the rich Goodness of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; now terrible mixtures of his Justice appear in all the parts of it: Barrenness in the Earth, Thorns and Thistles, the Fruits of the Curse for Sin; Malignant Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and Storms in the Air, Tempests in the Sea, Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Water; and how many Diseases are fatally natural to our Bodies? But the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven remains in its original Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pure Integrity. The Earth is now the Habitation of his Enemies, where they oppress his faithful Servants by their bold Injuries: but Heaven is the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Saints. In short, 'tis a Place becoming the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and Magnificence of God, and his Love to his chosen Friends. 'Tis said of the Patriarchs, whose
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42567:29"/>
Desires and Hopes were not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in that Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> tho flowing with Milk and Hony; but <hi>they desir'd a better Country,</hi> that is, <hi>a Heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a City.</hi> To be stiled our God, is a Title of the richest value, and implies, that all the Perfections of the Deity are to make us happy. It had been a reflection upon his Greatness and Goodness, if he had only given to the Patriarchs a Portion in this World. But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a Place and State of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city becoming his Infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, his special Love, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Duration. 'Tis an Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Totum Deum occupatum, &amp; deditum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu, opere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio, sapientiâ. Amor dictabat lineamenta.</note> That God who made other Things by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by the omnipotent Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of his Will, appli'd himself with Counsel to form the Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Model of all Perfections that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42567:29"/>
a humane Body is capable of, for the beauty of Aspect without, and the artificial order of the Parts within; and the reason was, Love drew the Lineaments. Thus Love, the Queen of the Divine Attributes, employ'd infinite Wisdom, and almighty Power, to build this Celestial City for the reception of his chosen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. The King of Glory dwells there in a special manner. <hi>The Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lord's; but the Earth hath he given to the Children of Men.</hi> By Right and Dominion, <hi>the Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> and the possession of it is from his Bounty to Men; but Heaven is reserv'd for himself, the Place of his glorious Residence. As a Prince that hath many Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, gives some for to be inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Servants, but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Palace is kept for his own Dwelling; God manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42567:30"/>
there in the most refulgent manner. All the Perfections of the Glorious Deity are reveal'd to the Saints in their purity and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diancy. The Divine Presence is the Supreme Glory of Heaven. The Lord Jesus Christ is there crown'd with the Majesty of the Divine Empire. This Glory is the Reward of his meritorious Obedience and Sufferings. He was made a Subject and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and endur'd the most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious cruel Death to satisfy God's injur'd Justice. What hath not the Son done for the Glory of his Father? He lost his Life ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Obedience: And what will not the Father do for the Honour of his Son? What Recompence is correspondent to such astonishing Humiliation? Our Saviour in his last solemn Prayer with his Disciples, addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses himself to God: <hi>I have glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thee on Earth</hi>;<note place="margin">John 17.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>I have finish'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42567:30"/>
the Work thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify me with thy Self, with the Glory I had with thee before the World was.</hi> The Father was so highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by Christ, that to satisfy his infinite Love towards him, he hath dignified him with a Name and State, that transcends all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Glory. He is the Lord of Angels, the Head of the Church, and sits at the right Hand of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on high. In Heaven he appears in his triumphant Glory, of which in the Transfiguration there was a transient glimpse, when his Face did shine as the Sun, but allayed and moderated, that his Disciples might sustain his Presence. There the Angels, the Princes of the Celestical Court, in all their bright Orders encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass the Throne of God, and pay their humblest Homage to him. The Saints appear there in their Robes of Glory, for they are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42567:31"/>
transform'd into the glorious likeness of the Son of God: Their Souls radiant with pure unspotted Holiness, shine through their Bodies, as Sun-beams trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through Chrystal. They all reign in Soveraign State for ever. It becomes the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that all God's Subjects should be Kings; and the highest Principality on Earth, is but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude compar'd with the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enjoy'd by the Saints above: For how often are the mightiest Monarchs on Earth in perfect bondage to their lawless Passions, and the Soul in dull captivity to the sensual Appetites? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are the strongest Empires dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd and ruin'd? But the Saints in Heaven, by obeying God, reign triumphantly: no Passions, no Fears, no Desires resist their Will; nothing is able to trouble the sincere Delight, the perfect Tranquillity of their State. They
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42567:31"/>
in their several degrees of Glory, shine like the Stars for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>To sum up all; What is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the Church, is fulfill'd in Heaven;<note place="margin">Isa. 60.19.</note> 
               <hi>The Sun shall be no more thy Light by Day, nor the Moon by Night; but the Lord shall be thy everlasting Light, and thy God thy Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to represent that luminous Palace, and the bright Inhabitants: but how short is the description of the glorious Realities, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Words are too weak and narrow to express it as it is. The Glory and Joy of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed State are unspeakable, as the Apostle, a Spectator thereof, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies. And 'tis observable that our Saviour himself expresses the greatest Things, by low fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Terms and Resemblances; as he tells his Faithful Disciples, they shall eat and drink at his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42567:32"/>
Table in his Kingdom. In his Promises of Rewards, it was not his intention meerly to make a show of his Power, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Love: Like a God, he doth not magnify the Favours he will bestow, but leaves it to their Spirits to conceive what becomes Almighty Goodness to bestow on his Servants. In the plainest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of promising the Reward, there is a clear Character of the excellent Greatness of the Giver and his Gifts.</p>
            <p>I will now consider the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Assurance we have of this blessed Place and State. This is built on our Saviour's Love to them, and his Truth; and his going to prepare that Blessedness for them. He saith to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Otherwise I would have told you</hi>; implying, that his Affection and Sincerity, make it impossible that he should deceive them with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42567:32"/>
an empty Promise of future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) His Love secures them. He would never have chosen them to be the Companions of his Cross, never have expos'd them as Sheep among Wolves, to suffer for his sake, and to leave them for ever, and reign alone in Heaven. Love is a benevolent affection ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Breast, and expressing it self in real Benefits, according to the Power of the Lover, and the Wants or the Capacity of the Person beloved: and the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense the Affection is, the more evident and noble effects of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will proceed from it. All the most liberal Expressions, without real performance, are but a vain pageant of Friendship. Now, the Love of our Saviour to his Disciples, was not only sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, but in such a degree of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that they might safely rely upon his Promises. His pure
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42567:33"/>
Love, was the motive of select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the World, and dignifying them with the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring title of his Friends. His Conversation with them was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely sweet, a Miracle of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity: and that glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his Love for them, and all Believers, in leaving Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for their sakes, is the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest assurance that he will bring them to his Father's House above. 'Tis represented as the peculiar Glory of <hi>Theodosius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amicitiae no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men privatum non solum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra aulam vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casti, sed indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam auro, gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis<expan>

               </note> that he seated Majesty and Love in the same Throne: for Love unites and conforms Persons, and makes them, as it were, Peers: and it seems too low a submission for a Soveraign to descend from his Throne to a kind of equality with a Subject, or too high an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation to assume a private Person into such a degree of affection, as to make him as himself; yet such was the condescension of that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42567:33"/>
great and amiable Emperor. But how distant is the greatest Monarch in the World from the Eternal Son of God, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth? Love brought him down from his Throne in Heaven, where he was ador'd by the Angels, and united him to our nature in our lowly state, in order to the raising us to his Kingdom, and uniting us to himself in Glory. Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable and incomparable! If <hi>Solomon,</hi> upon God's descending in a Cloud to take possession of the Temple, was surpriz'd with heavenly astonishment; <hi>But will God indeed dwell on Earth?</hi> with infinite more cause have we, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the incarnation of the Son of God, to say, <hi>Will God indeed dwell on Earth?</hi> For what was the appearance of a Vapour that might be easily dispell'd, to the coming of Jesus Christ into the World, in whom the Fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42567:34"/>
dwelt substantially? What is so worthy of reverence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration? New Things suspend the actings of the mind, glorious Things overwhelm the Faculty; and never was there so rare and excelling an Object. This so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and amazing Effect of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Love, gives assurance to Christians, that he will take them to an everlasting Communion with himself in Glory. As 'tis more for a Prince to live with a private Person in a Cottage with complacency, than to receive that Person into his Court, and invest him with Honour. The Love of our Saviour never abated to his Disciples; when he was in view of Death, with its troops of Terrors, 'tis said, <hi>Having lov'd his own, he lov'd them to the end.</hi> And after his Resurrection to a Heavenly Life, he exprest the same dear affection, <hi>Go to my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren!</hi> a stile as high as Love can rise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:42567:34"/>'Tis further considerable what was touch'd on before, that the Disciples of Christ, besides the common Calamities of Mankind wherein they are involv'd, are for his Truth and Cause expos'd to Indignities and Injuries of all kinds and degrees, which the malice of Satan and his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the perverted World, can fasten upon them. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Church of old is often renew'd, <hi>For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as Sheep for the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And can the Love of Christ, so tender, so compassionate, that the Love of a Mother to a sucking Infant is not an adequate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of it; can such Love let the Saints be separated from him for ever? Then, according to the Apostle's expression, <hi>If in this Life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all Men most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42567:35"/>(2.) His Truth gives an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible assurance that we shall be receiv'd with him in Glory.

Nature are the Foundation of his unchangeable Councils; and from thence the unchangeableness of his Promises is justly inferr'd. The Decrees of God are engraven with the point of a Diamond, and are unretractible. <hi>The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the Lord shall stand:</hi> for such is the perfection of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that he can never be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd by any sudden unforeseen Event that should induce a change of his Will; and such is his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, that he gives an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible accomplishment to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: <hi>and his Word endures for ever.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.25.</note> The immutability of his Nature, gives firmness to his Counsels; and the fidelity of his Nature to his Promises. <hi>In him there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableness, nor shadow of change: and he is God that cannot ly:</hi> He reveals himself by his Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova</hi> to his People, to signify, that he is the same in performing, as in promising. Now Jesus
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42567:36"/>
Christ his Son is equal to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all essential Perfections. He stiles himself <hi>the Amen, the true and faithful Witness:</hi> If he deceive his Servants with a false expectation of a joyful glorious State hereafter, it would be a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish to his unspotted Holiness, an eternal reflection upon his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate Truth. 'Tis therefore a faithful Saying, and worthy of all acceptation, That where Christ is in Glory, there shall his Servants be with him, otherwise <hi>he would have told them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We are to consider the other firm ground of assurance in our Saviour's next words: <hi>I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you.</hi> This speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally respects his Ascension into Heaven, but it supposes his Death. He purchas'd Heaven by his Death: He prepares it by his Ascension. His Blood shed on the Cross, and pleaded in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42567:36"/>
gives to Believers a right to it here, and actual possession hereafter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His obedient Sufferings are the price of this glorious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In our Guilty State, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is as inaccessible to us, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise was to <hi>Adam</hi> after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, when guarded by a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim with a flaming Sword. For neither the Divine Wisdom, nor the Law of God would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that an unpardon'd Sinner should be receiv'd into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Justice of God doth not infringe his rich Goodness, but that he may bestow upon an innocent Creature the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Blessings, the Testimonies of his Bounty. If <hi>Adam</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sever'd in his Duty, God might have translated him to Heaven, and that happy change had been a free Favour: for his Obedince had not been comparable to the Glory that shall be revealed in the Saints.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42567:37"/>
But Justice sets up a Legal Barr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Guilty; they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Heavenly Glory. The Creature must be intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or graciously pardon'd, to be capable of enjoying that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Happiness. When the guilt of Sin is abolish'd, it hath no malignant Power, either to subject us to Evil, or deprive us of Good. Now our Saviour by Satisfying the Injur'd Justice of God, hath wash'd away our Sins in his Blood; and hath infinitely pleas'd God, that we obtain by him, not only redemption from Hell,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.12.</note> but the possession of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This was the Design of God's Love, in giving his <hi>only begotten Son, that whoever believes should not perish, but have everlasting Life.</hi> Accordingly the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Titus 3.7.</note> 
               <hi>That being justified by his Grace through Jesus Christ, we should be made Heirs of Eternal Life.</hi> And by the gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42567:37"/>
tenour of the Gospel, these great Benefits are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it being equally impossible that an unpardon'd Sinner should enter into Heaven, or that a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd Sinner should be excluded. The Connexion is indissolvable; <hi>Whom he justifies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> 
               <hi>them he glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</hi> Nay, 'tis more easily cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that a pardon'd Sinner should be admitted into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Presence of God, than that a guilty Sinner should be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him. As supposing the revival of a Phoenix from its Ashes, 'tis more easily conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it should take its flight upwards, which is the natural Motion of a living Bird, than that it should be restor'd to Life in such a miraculous manner. In short, Heaven is a free Gift to us, but dearly bought by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; 'tis <hi>the Gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> He had a double Title to Heaven, as the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42567:38"/>
Son of God, he was Heir of his Kingdom; this Title is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municably his own: and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd it by his meritorious Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: This he imparts to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, <hi>who enter into Heaven by the new and living Way, which he consecrated for them through his Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He ascended into Heaven to prepare a Place for us. The Actions of our Saviour may be considered two ways; either as terminated in himself, or with a relative respect to Believers, as the Head of the Church. His Resurrection was not meerly Personal, but hath an operative Force in raising all the Members of his Mystical Body: As <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s subduing <hi>Goliah,</hi> was not his own personal Victory simply, but was extended in its happy Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to all his Nation: for in him, as their Champion, the Army of <hi>Israel</hi> overcame the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42567:38"/>
               <hi>Philistims.</hi> Jesus Christ, as Head of the Church, hath broken the Dominion of Death; and by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Conquest, the Grave shall restore the Saints at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Resurrection. And his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension was not a personal Act purely to obtain his own Right; but as our Forerunner he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd for us into Heaven. As the High Priest in his majestick my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Habit, with the Names of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> upon his Breast, enter'd into the Holy of Holies; so Jesus Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the Eternal Sanctuary as our Representer, to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it for us. The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Despair is silenc'd for ever. <hi>Who shall ascend up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to raise us thither?</hi> Christ is lifted up to the highest Glory, and will draw all his People after him. The first <hi>Adam</hi> was from the Earth, Earthly; but Christ is the Lord from Heaven, and is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42567:39"/>
return'd to Heaven: and shall Earth destroy what Heaven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not restore? The Apostle tells us, That <hi>Believers sit with Christ in Heavenly Places</hi>; that is, as he is the Head of that Sacred Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Church; and his Promise is exprest, <hi>To him that overcomes, will I grant personally to sit with me in my Throne, even as I also am set down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> After victorious Obedience, the Saints shall be taken into Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Alliance with Christ, and reign for ever. In short, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Merit is the Foundation of our glorious Hope: and his prevailing Intercession introduces us into actual Possession. He that purchas'd Heaven, disposes of it by his last Will; thus he addrest to his Father immediately before his Death; <hi>Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may see my Glory:</hi> And he has Power
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42567:39"/>
to accomplish his own Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What he hath done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for Believers is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Evidence, and invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Assurance of what he hath promised. There is a vaster di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between the Deity and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, than between Man and the Heavenly Glory. For the Sun to go backwards ten Degrees, was miraculous and astonishing; but to ascend the Horizon, is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to natural Order. The abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Son of God was stupendious, but his advancement to the highest Glory is most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his Divine Relation, and infinitely due to his exuberant Merits, and a firm Foundation of Hope, that all his redeemed Saints <hi>shall be where he is,</hi> and be conform'd to him in all superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Divine Excellencies of Soul and Body for ever.</p>

               <head>The Application.</head>
               <p n="1">1. LET us adore the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Love of God, who hath prepar'd such a Place of Joy, and Glory for his Children when they leave the World. The Father prepar'd it in his Decree from Eternity, and by his creating Power from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World: and we are assur'd 'tis such a Place and State, as fully answers the Design of God's Love, that is, to make a reasonable Creature as happy as 'tis capable to be. When Man was turn'd Rebel against his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, when so chang'd from the Divine Resemblance imprest at first upon him, into the disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>likeness of the Beasts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> as the Psalmist justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches him; then to pardon us, and prefer us; to restore us to his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42567:40"/>
Favour, and Image, and the nearest communion with himself in his Palace above, is such an astonishing Mercy as is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>God who is Love.</hi> And the Love of our Redeemer is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admirable; when we were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd Paradise, he makes a reentry for us, and intercepts the stroke of the flaming Sword that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd us. We neither know the depth of our Misery from whence we are freed, nor the heighth of Glory to which we are rais'd by our Redeemer. In what Heart but that of the Son of God, could ever such compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and charity be conceiv'd? He took our Flesh to Heaven to prepare it for us, and interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably left his Spirit on Earth to prepare us for Heaven. How just is the solemn and terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the Apostle, <hi>He that loves not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema, Maranatha.</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:42567:41"/>
And how are we obliged to God for the blessed and glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that infinitely excels all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Books in the matter it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the everlasting Happiness of Man, and the certain way to obtain it, and in the manner of conveying those great and Sacred Truths by Divine Revelation? And what an Argument of thankfulness is it to consider the distinguishing Grace of God; that when the most are so blind in the clear Light of the Gospel, as not to discover the lustre of the Pearl of Price, and so immers'd in Vanities as to disrelish Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Joys, that he is pleased to inlighten the Eyes of our Mind, that we may know <hi>what is the Hope of his Calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Saints.</hi> The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Fools that understand not the Price that is put into their Hands, in comparison of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:42567:41"/>
truly Wise, is greater than of common Stones that lie in the Mire of the Streets, to precious Stones of the highest value, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Rubies: <hi>How affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately should we give thanks to the Father who has made us meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> But we have such Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays by the Relicks of Carnality, that without the Heavenly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's inspiring our cold Earth, we shall never be ardent and lively in the Praises of our Blessed Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. Even <hi>David</hi> himself was fain to call upon his Soul with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated fervency, and excite eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Faculty within him, <hi>to bless the Lord, who had forgiven his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and redeem'd his Life from destraction, and crown'd him with loving Kindness, and tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence we may infer the great Guilt of Unbelievers in the Christian Church; and such
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42567:42"/>
are all those who implicitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and reject Heaven for the present World. This will aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Sin and Sentence of the Carnal and Worldly, that they despise such glorious Realities for empty Vanities. Desperate Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that venture a Kingdom at every Throw! What blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, or rather pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart is it, that Men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue with their best strength and desires, the fading and false World, and slight Heaven an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable and everlasting Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Certainly when Death shall open their Eyes, they will have chang'd thoughts of Things. 'Tis related by a wise Historian,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plut.</hi>
                  </note> That a Citizen pleaded his own Cause of great moment before <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who slept during the Plea; and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after pass'd an unrighteous Judgment against him; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Person reply'd, I appeal
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42567:42"/>
from your Sentence. A word that seem'd so presumptuous to an Independent Soveraign, that with indignation the King asked him, To whom he appeal'd? He answered, From the King sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the King waking. Thus Men who are led by Sense, are asleep, whilst the Cause of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Concernment, eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is faithfully pleaded by the Advocates of their Souls; and they determine for the Interest of the Flesh against the Spirit: but their waking Thoughts will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the unrighteousness of their carnal Judgment. In the next State how will they with restless Anguish remember their foolish Bargain, to exchange an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treasure for fading Toys? We may a little conjecture the Torments of the Damn'd, by the Terrors of the Dying; then the enlightned guilty Conscience makes them cry out, O that we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42567:43"/>
had been wise, so to use the World that we might enjoy God! O that we had been so careful to have obtain'd an Interest in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as we have been to gain the Earth! Then the stinging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse begins that shall never end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us make it our fixed Aim, our zealous constant Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to secure our Title to this heavenly Inheritance. Let Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be our Counseller, and guide our Choice. Let us not build our Felicity on the Sand, but on the Rock that cannot be shaken. Such is the excellent Goodness of God reveal'd in the Gospel, that every Person that sincerely and regularly seeks Heaven, shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and no Person shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of it, but for his wilful neglect. Now our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who open'd the Eternal Kingdom, has declar'd to us upon what terms it may be obtain'd,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42567:43"/>
in his conference with <hi>Nicodemus</hi>;<note place="margin">John 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily, verily I say unto thee, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Man be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see the Kingdom of God.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth, and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho never so high and noble, are of no advantage there. The degeneracy of Man from his Primitive Holiness, makes him both unworthy and uncapable of having a right or possession of Heaven, without a Divine Change, a Spiritual Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The supernatural Inheritance is annext to the being born of God: that is, the receiving a Principle of Life, and Actions suitable to the Life of God, in universal Holiness and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 'Tis not a ground of Title to Heaven, that we have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alliance to God, as the Father of Spirits in the first Creation, but we must be his Off-spring by a new and more excellent Creation, according to our Saviour's words,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42567:44"/>
                  <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit. We must be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds,</hi> spiritualiz'd in our Affections, before we can obtain an interest in his Love, which was forfeited by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and consequently in his Kingdom. Adoption into God's Family, and the Line of Heaven, is always in conjunction with the renovation of the Divine Nature and Image in us. The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit witnesses with our Spirits, <hi>that we are the Children of God:</hi> but his witnessing is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to his working in us those Graces that constitute us to be the Children of God: an humble Fear to offend him, a Care to please him, a Zeal for his Glory, delight in Communion with him, resignation to his Will and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, trust on his Fatherly Love, and a desire to be in his Blessed Presence. By the discovery of these filial Affections, our Divine
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42567:44"/>
Relation is made sure. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle infers, <hi>If Sons, then Heirs.</hi> Holiness is the infallible Evidence of Election; for <hi>the Vessels of Mercy are prepar'd by Holiness for Glory</hi>; the Seal of Adoption, whereby God's Children are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd from the World; and <hi>the Earnest of their Inheritance</hi> for Heaven,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.5.</note> is a blissful State of Purity; and the Graces with the Comforts of the Spirit, are the beginnings of it here. 'Tis fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be observ'd, that our right in the Heavenly Inheritance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our union with Christ. He instates his Members in the same Relation with himself to God. Thus he declares to his Disciples, <hi>I ascend to my Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God.</hi> Christ's Relation hath precedency in Point of Dignity and Causality; and he derives a Right to us in his Father's House: <hi>We are Coheirs with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42567:45"/>
Christ.</hi> Now 'tis universally and necessarily true what the Apostle saith, <hi>Whoever is in Christ, is a new Creature.</hi> For our vital Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, is by the Sanctifying Spirit on Christ's part; and by Faith and Love on our part. Briefly, <hi>Without Holiness no Man shall see God.</hi> The Exclusion is absolute and universal of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Persons. 'Tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible God should admit them into Heaven; for the Rights of Justice are inviolable: we must come to Christ's Tribunal before we come to his Throne:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.23.</note> We must <hi>come to God the Judg of all, before we are admitted into the number of Just Men made perfect.</hi> According to our Works the Reward will be: and Men are uncapable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Heaven without Holiness. The Wisdom of God appears, in that the various sorts of Creatures live in the Elements from which they were produc'd, and have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42567:45"/>
Natures suitable to the Places of their Residence. The Beasts that were form'd from the Earth, walk and rest there: the Birds and Fishes that were produc'd out of the Waters, the one sort flies in the Air, that is, rarefied Water; the other swim in Water, that is, the thickest Air; and that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more evidently appears in suiting the everlasting States of Men to their moral Dispositions. <hi>Thus we must be born from above,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> if we would joyfully live above. The Apostle tells us, <hi>That Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi> The natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy must be spiritualiz'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with Celestial Qualities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can enter into that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Place: and the Reason is more strong, that earthly sensual Souls can never enter into Heaven, there being an absolute Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and Opposition between the habitual constitution of such,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42567:46"/>
and that place and state: they must be Holy and Heavenly, to be prepar'd for the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and to converse with the purified Assembly Above; <hi>'till they are wrought for that blessed End,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> cleansed, and purified, and endued with Holy Qualities, till they are <hi>made meet, they cannot possess the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> How vain and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible are the hopes of unrenewed Sinners? The Presence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of the Saints is now an offence to them, damps their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Jollity and wild Mirth, for it upbraids their neglect of Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion. How fearful will the sight of God be to them? If the unpurg'd Eye cannot bear the Light of a Candle, how will it sustain the glorious Light of the Sun? The Lord's Day, in its Sacred employment, is their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; how can they expect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy an everlasting Sabbath Above?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42567:46"/>
How can there be a lively Hope of Heaven, that implies perfection of Holiness, when they neither seriously desire, nor endeavour to be Holy? They may have a Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web Hope that will be swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but Hope that is as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to secure the Soul, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a purifying influence on the Heart and Life.<note place="margin">1 John 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoever hath this Hope of being</hi> like to Christ in Glory, <hi>purifies himself even as he is pure.</hi> In short, as the Jews had a carnal conceit of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and transform'd him into a temporal Prince coming with Pomp and Splendor, to free their Nation from Bondage, and exalt it to the highest Dominion in the World: and this Conceit so strongly possest them, that when the Son of God, who was Holy, Harmless, and Undefiled, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Sinners, appear'd in an humble state to reform and save Mankind, they rejected him:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42567:47"/>
Thus the unregenerate have a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conceit of Heaven: They can only fancy it as a place of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glory, and a Sanctuary and Refuge from the Torments of Hell, and in that Notion desire it; but as the Place wherein that Holy God is enjoyed and glorified by the Saints, they cannot desire nor delight in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From hence we should be induc'd to regulate our Minds, Affections, and Conversation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our present State and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Hopes. Our Father's House, our Everlasting Home is Above, and here we are Strangers in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and should be so in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to present Things.

the Law upbraid our Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. They had not so clear a revelation of the Heavenly State, yet they <hi>confest they were Pilgrims and Strangers on Earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd a better Country.</hi> And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> not only when he was as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridg chas'd upon the Mountains, but when seated on the Royal Throne, acknowledges, <hi>We are Strangers, as all our Fathers were</hi>; and his Affections were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaned from the World. Was ever Passenger so foolish, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pass over a narrow Strait of the Sea of a days sayling, makes Provisions for a Voyage of a Year? or that will be at great cost to paint an Inn, and adorn it with rich Furniture, where he is to lodge but a Night? 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more reproachful folly, to spend the best of our Time, and Strength, and Spirits for the gaining the present World,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42567:48"/>
as if we were to continue here for ever. How many are sensual, and secure in their earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, 'till as the rich Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, that was cloth'd in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and far'd deliciously every day, they unexpectedly die, and irrecoverably drop into Hell. Just like a Traveller, that lays himself under the shadow of some Trees in his way Home, and sleeps till the Night with its Darkness and Dangers surprizes him, and he is destroyed by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or wild Beasts. How plain and necessary a Lesson is the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and shortness of the present Life? but how few effectually learn it? The <hi>Psalmist</hi> addresses himself to God for Instruction; <hi>So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wisdom.</hi> Let Men fancy what they please of their Tenure here, they are <hi>but Strangers, and have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42567:49"/>
no continuing City here</hi>; and the consequent Duty is most clearly and strongly urged by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Let them seek one to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Let our Conversation be in Heaven, whilst we are upon the Earth. Every Thing in Nature, hath a tendency to its Original and Perfection. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that come from the Sea, are in a living Motion returning thither; If you stop their Course, and confine them, though in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of Marble, they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and die. The Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Saints hath a strong tendency to Heaven from whence it came, and raiseth the Soul by solemn Thoughts, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Desires, to that Blessed Place. A Philosopher that was ask'd of what Country he was; replied, He was a Citizen of the World. The Scripture corrects
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42567:49"/>
the Language, and teaches us that we are Citizens of Heaven; we are passing to the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Above, the <hi>Land of Promise, the true Land of the Living:</hi> and all our Aims and Endeavours should have a final respect thither. <hi>Our Hearts should be where our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is.</hi> How joyful, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious is a Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation? The serious and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Contemplation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is a temperate Extasy, and brings the Soul into the Divine Presence: anticipates the Joy of it by a sweet foretast, by a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural elevation of Mind: by frequent lively Thoughts of our Glorious Inheritance, we gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually enter into it: the prospect of that causes in the Saints, a Holy Contempt of the World, as not worthy our Ambition and Diligence: it causes such a self-denial from the inviting tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42567:50"/>
of Sense, that Men, whose Portion is in this Life, are forc'd to admire their restraint from those Objects that ravish Carnal Hearts. A Heavenly Christian will improve sensible Things for spiritual Ends; as Feathers that have a natural Weight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to the Center, yet plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Wings of a Bird, by a living Motion, carry it aloft in the free Air. Our rising in the Morning, is an Emblem of the Resurrection from the Grave, to behold the bright Day of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All the Refreshments and Comforts of the present Life, should be an advantage to raise our Minds to God, who is the Supreme Good, whose Fulness eminently contains all Good, and infinitely exceeds all our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. Heavenly Love will dry up the Vanity of our Thoughts and Affections, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42567:50"/>
rescue the Mind from the prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to sensible Things, and most pleasantly exercise it upon Things Above. Love between Friends is maintain'd by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Converse, or by Letters, when absent: thus is Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul: And if God, that is to himself his own Blessedness, his own Kingdom and Glory, yet is pleas'd in his gracious Communications to his Children on Earth; how much more should they by frequent and affectionate Duties, address to him who is their eternal lnfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Good. Thus they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and enjoy a sweet Peace, and obtain an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confidence of appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in his Holy and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habitation: whereas those who live without God in the World, are justly fearful of Death; for then the Spirit returns to God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42567:51"/>
that gave it. Briefly, let us with zealous Affections, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing Diligence prepare our selves for the Presence of God, and the Society of Blessed Spirits in our Father's House: <hi>Let us always abound in the Work of the Lord, knowing our Labour is not in vain:</hi> Let us join Works of Charity with Works of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; employ the fading Riches of the World for the Relief of the Saints; that as our Saviour Promises <hi>when we shall fail,</hi> when in the Hour of Death our <hi>Flesh and Hearts shall fail us,</hi> and our Souls be dislodged from our Earthly Tabernacles,<note place="margin">Luke 16.9.</note> we <hi>may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Eternal Habitations.</hi> The Everlasting Judg, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenses Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has acquainted us with the Rule of Judgment at the last Day: Those who mercifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him in his Members, shall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42567:51"/>
                  <hi>inherit the Kingdom of Glory</hi>; and those who neglect that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, shall be cast into the Lake of Fire. Though many who are wretchedly careless of doing Good according to their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, now satisfy themselves that they are not injurious to others: Yet it will be a small mitigation of their Sentence at last, that they are condemn'd, not for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Justice, but of Charity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let the belief that there are Mansions of Rest and Joy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for the Saints in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House, gloriously support them under their heaviest Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles here. This World is the Devil's Circuit, wherein he is alwayes ranging about seeking to devour: The pleasant Things of the World are his Temptations to ensnare the Carnal; the Men of the World are his Instruments to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42567:52"/>
oppress the Saints; and were it not for the Restraints of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, what Desolations would be made in God's Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?<note place="margin">Sext Empirie cont. Mathem.</note> 'Twas a strange and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Custom among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> that upon the Death of the Emperor, for five days the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was left without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as upon removing the Stone from the Fabulous Cave of <hi>Aeolus,</hi> the Winds broke out in their fury: so by taking away the authority of the Laws, licence was given to all Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and the whole Kingdom was in mortal Paroxisms. All were in Arms, some to do Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, others to revenge them: the Chastity of none was secure, but conceal'd, nor the Estates of any but defended: the Bridle of Fear was taken off, no Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness but was boldly committed, or attempted, and the Kingdom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42567:52"/>
became a Field of Bloody War. But when the new King was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd, all things were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reduc'd to Order, that the Advantage of Government might be set off by the experimental Confusions and Mischiefs of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. But if God left the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted World, and Satan the Prince of it, one day to their rage against his People, did he not shut <hi>it in with Doors, and Bars,</hi> as he doth the impetuous Ocean; so swelling and diffusive is their Malignity, that it would, like the Deluge, drown all, and not a Remnant of the Saints would be left. Yet God wisely permits many Temporal Evils to be inflicted on his Servants by their Enemies, for the tryal of their Fidelity, and their noble Resolution to glorify him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they suffer for his sake. And it becomes them, with an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42567:53"/>
undisturb'd serenity of Mind, and harmony of Affections, with an invincible Patience, to bear all the Scorn and Contempt, all the Malice, and Fury to which they are expos'd upon a Christian account. Let them remember <hi>they are Strangers and Sojourners here,</hi> and live by other Laws than the World doth, which causes their hatred: But in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House there will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rest. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had experience of both in a singular manner, declares, <hi>I reckon that the Sufferings of the present State, are not worthy to be compar'd, to the Glory that shall be reveal'd in us.</hi> In that State of pure Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there are no remains of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Evils; all is Peace, and Joy, and Glory.</p>

Did Philosophy inspire him with such Principles of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Fortitude? yet it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended no higher than the visible Heavens. How much more should Faith that raises a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, by high and steady Thoughts, to the Supreme Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where the Divine Glory shines, comfort him in all the

Troubles of this World. Add further, That 'tis an excellent Preservative from Envy and Fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness at the Prosperity of the Wicked, to consider that their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is as transient and vanishing as the Trouble of the Saints:<note place="margin">Psalm 37.35, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>I have seen the Wicked in great Power, and spreading himself like a green Bay Tree: yet he pass'd away, and lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, and he could not be found.</hi> All the Riches, and Greatness, and Pleasures of the World are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, number'd, and measur'd by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> and found to be as light and fading as Vanity. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they came into the World, and naked they must go out</hi>; and how much more tormenting will it be to be stript of all their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; how much more sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful will they be to go from their great Possessions, than for one that leaves the World, and never

had them? Their Hopes are like the giving up of the Ghost, and expire with their Breath for ever. <hi>I went into the Sanctuary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm. 73.</note> 
                  <hi>saith the troubled Saint, then understood I their End:</hi> The End of their Felicity, and the Miseries of the Righteous. Besides the Evils suffer'd for Righteousness-sake, there are innumerable Sorrows that befal the Saints here. How many afflicting Diseases, sad Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, vexing Passions har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras them? Some Afflictions are so wounding to their Spirits, that no Balm that growns on Earth can heal. But the lively Hope of Heaven is an Universal Cure for all their Troubles. Let the mourning Christian consider the wise Providence of God, that orders all Events, and believe his Love in sending, and his End in all their Afflictions. Such is the Divine Power that God could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately free us from all Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42567:55"/>
as easily, as turn the Wind from a blasting Quarter of the Heavens, to the most Benign and Refreshing. Are we pain'd with Diseases? he can more easily change the Tone of Nature in a sickly Body, and make it healthy; than one can change the stop in an Organ that presently alters the sound: but his Love dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses bitter Things to us, that are necessary for our Spiritual and Everlasting Good. His End is to prepare us for Heaven, that is prepared for us. The Apostle declares, <hi>He that hath wrought us for the self-same thing, is God:</hi> that is, made us fit for the Heavenly Glory. The Divine disposal of Things here to the Saints, has a certain Order to their Eternal State. He purgeth out our vicious guilty Affections to the World by sharp Physick, that our Hopes of Heaven may be more pure and vigorous, more
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42567:55"/>
actuated by serious Thoughts and intense Desires, that we may feel the sense of the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Expression, <hi>O when shall we come and appear before God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In short, Art thou in the Vale of Tears, languishing in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and dying every Day? by Faith ascend to <hi>the Mountains of Spices,</hi> the Blessed Place Above, and thou wilt find the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God to revive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thy Soul.</p>

                  <hi>In this we groan earnestly, desiring to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with our House that is from Heaven: And we are willing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be absent from the Body, and present with the Lord.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint in the present World is both a Prison and a Captive: his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42567:56"/>
Soul is detain'd from the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God, by confinement to his Body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore methinks he should not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be content to die out of the Necessity of Nature, when he can live no longer, but desire the happy removal, and say with the Psalmist, <hi>I rejoic'd when they said to me, Let us go into the House of the Lord.</hi> 'Tis true, Nature will recoile, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing the present Life, with all its sensible pleasant Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is uneasy to us: but as when the Candles are put out, the Sun rises in its brightness, so when the Natural Life ceases, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life springs forth in its Oriency and Glory: <hi>When the Earthly Tabernacle is dissolv'd, the naked separate Soul shall be received into a Building not made with Hands, Eternal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</hi> Our joyful Affections, in leaving the World, and ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42567:56"/>
to Heaven, should be in some manner suitable to our recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there. What a joyful Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come will entertain us from God himself? Our Saviour comforted his Disciples with a Heavenly Valediction, <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.</hi> The Gracious Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sweetens the Glorious. He that joyfully receives the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, but penitent Son to Grace, will joyfully receive his obedient Sons to Glory. He that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives their Prayers with the Affection of a Father, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Persons with the dearest Expressions of Love. His Fatherly Providence watch'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in the Way, and will triumphantly bring them Home. Here many Blessed Testimonies of God's Love are given to the Saints, that produce such a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sweetness in their Hearts, that they esteem his loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42567:57"/>
as better than Life, more worth than all the World; but the full revealing of his Love is only in Heaven. And as a Child knows by Experience the Love of his Father, but the Degrees and Strength of his Affection he does not understand till arrived at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Age, and sees the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance his Father enstates upon him. Thus in Heaven only the Saints shall know the excellent and perfect Love of God to them, when they are possess'd of that Glorious Kingdom, his most free and rich Gift, which transcends all their present Thoughts. And our blessed Redeemer, that by so many Titles has an Interest in us, that is not contented in his own Personal Glory, without our partaking of it, that by his Resurrection open'd the Grave, and by his Ascension open'd Heaven for us; how dearly will he receive us? He esteems
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42567:57"/>
Believers to <hi>be his Joy and Crown,</hi> and with an extasy of Affection will present them to his Father; <hi>Behold I, and the Children that God has given me.</hi> The Angels and Saints Above overflow with Joy; when the Soul, as a pure Spark freed from its Ashes, ascends to the Element of Spirits, how joyfully is it entertain'd by that Glorious Assembly? The Angels that rejoice at the Conversion of a Sinner, will much more at the Glorification of a Saint; and the Saints have a new accession to their Joy, upon the reception of any of their Brethren to that State of Felicity.</p>
               <p>The Saints of all Ages may be resembled to a Fleet of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men that are bound for the same Port, some arrive sooner, others later, according to the time of their setting out: but those who arrive first, how do they welcome their Friends that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42567:58"/>
come safely afterwards? An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect resemblance how dearly and joyfully the Saints that are gone before us welcome those who arrive in Heaven every day, knowing the dangerous Seas they have past through, where so many have been cast away and lost for ever. All Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in Musick, celebrating the Praises of God, and expressing their joyful sense, when a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saint is come to receive his Reward. How does this Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration upbraid us, that we are so unwilling to be dissolv'd, and to be with our best Friends in the best Place? that our Tears and Sorrows for leaving the Earthly Tabernacle, and the low Comforts of this Life, should continue till we come to the Gate of Heaven? How can we be content with the Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the present State? Here we are as distant from compleat
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42567:58"/>
Happiness, as the highest Heaven is from the Earth. Where is our Faith in the Promises of God? Where is our Love to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and our Souls? The loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Sincere Christian to die, and be with Christ, is a deflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from his Christianity.</p>
               <p>Lastly, This should refresh our Sorrows for the loss of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friends that die in the Lord. Here is a mournful parting, when they are laid in the cold, dark and silent Mansions of the Earth: when those whom we lov'd as our own Souls, are finally separated from us, and we shall see their Faces no more. And as one that is directed by the Light of a Torch in the Night, when 'tis taken away, is more sensible of the Darkness, than if he had not been inlightned by it: So when those dear Friends are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, whose Conversation was the Light and Joy of our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42567:59"/>
Lives, we are more darkned with Sorrow, than if we had never injoy'd them. But if we duly consider Things, there is more reason of Joy, than Sorrow, at the departure of the Saints. Our Saviour tells his Disciples, that were mourning for his signifying that he must go away, <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, because I say I must go to my Father to reign with him in Soveraign Glory.</hi> Sincere Love will make us more to rejoice in their Gain, than to grieve for our Loss. Especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within a little while we shall be inseparably united in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory, where Love reigns for ever.</p>
