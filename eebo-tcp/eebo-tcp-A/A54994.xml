         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100886:24"/>
Firſt, you may have faire
ſweet marjerom, baſil, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or roſe-mary pots,
&amp;c. to ſtand looſely upon
faire ſhelves, which pots
you may let down at your
pleaſure in apt frames with
a pulley from your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
window into your
Garden, or you may place
them upon ſhelves made
without the room, there to
receive the warme ſun, or
temperate raine at your
pleaſure, now and then
when you ſee cauſe. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
window you may make
ſquare frames either of lead
or of bords, well pitched
within: fill them with ſome
rich earth, and plant ſuch
flowers or hearbs therein as
you like beſt; if hearbs you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100886:25"/>
may keep them in the ſhape
of green borders, or other
forms. And if you plant
them with Roſemary, you
may maintain the ſame
running up the tranſumes
and movels of your win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.
And in the ſhady
places of the room, you may
prove if ſuch ſhady plants
as do grow abroad out of
the Sun, will not alſo grow
there: as ſweet Bryars, Bayes,
Germander, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you
muſt often ſet open your
Caſements, eſpecially in the

And theſe are <hi>Italian</hi> fancies

your chimny may be trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a fine bank of moſs,
which may be wrought in

               <p>Here I will conclude with
a conceit of that delicate
Knight, Sir <hi>Francis Carew;</hi>
who, for the better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of his Royall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of our late
Queen of happy memory, at
his houſe at <hi>Beddington,</hi> led
her Majeſty to a Cherry
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100886:87"/>
tree, whoſe fruit he had of
purpoſe kept back from
ripening, at the leaſt one
moneth after all Cherries
had taken their farewell of
<hi>England.</hi> This ſecret he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
by ſtraining a Tent
or cover of canvas over the
whole tree, and wetting the
ſame now and then with a
ſcoope or horne, as the heat
of the weather required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and ſo, by with-holding the
ſun-beames from reflecting
upon the berries, they grew
both great, and were very
long before they had gotten
their perfect cherry colour:
and when he was aſſured of
her Majeſties comming, he
removed the Tent, and a
few ſunny dayes brought
them to their full maturity.</p>

            <head>A Philoſophicall Garden: with
a touch at the vegetable

of the Oſtrich.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, pave a ſquare plot with
brick, (and if it be covered
with plaiſter of <hi>Paris,</hi> it is ſo
much the better) making up ſides
of brick alſo plaiſtered likewiſe:
let this be of a convenient depth,
fill it with the beſt vegetable ♄
which you can get, that hath
ſtood two yeares, or one at the
leaſt, quite within his owne
Spheare: make <hi>contrition</hi> of the
ſame; and be ſure to avoid all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
imbibe it with <hi>Aqua
coeleſtis</hi> in a true proportion, grind
it once a day till it be dry: being
dry, let it ſtand two or three days
without any imbibition, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100886:88"/>
influence, continuing then
alſo a <hi>Philoſophical contrition</hi> every
day (this grinding muſt alſo be
uſed in the vegetable work where
the ☿ of hearbs is uſed inſtead of
<hi>aqua coeleſtis</hi>) during all the time
of preparation: then plant what
rare flowers, fruits, or ſeeds, you
pleaſe therein. And (if my <hi>Theory</hi>
of Nature deceive me not this ♄
ſo enriched from the heavens,
without the help of any manner
of ſoyl, marle, or compoſt (after
one years revolution) will make
the ſame to flouriſh and fructifie
in a ſtrange and admirable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
yea, I am perſwaded, that it
will receive an <hi>Indian</hi> plant, and
make all vegetables to proſper in
the higheſt degree, and to bear
their fruits in <hi>England,</hi> as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
as they do in <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> or
elſewhere.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe of that Walnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
planted within the limits of
the aforeſaid Abby, which on
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100886:88"/>
St. <hi>Barnabias</hi> Eve ſtandeth bare,
and naked without leaves; and
upon the day it ſelf, richly clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with his green veſture.</p>
            <p>I could remember many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
plants in England,
were it not that the loſſe of <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's</hi>
life, that renowned Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
who ſuffered death (as the
ſecret report goeth) for making a
Pear-tree to fructifie in Winter,
did command an <hi>altum ſilentium</hi>
in theſe matters: but it was the
denial of his medicine, and not
the crime of conjuration, which
was but colourably laid to his
charge, that wrought his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
            <p>Nay, if the earth it ſelf, after
it hath thus conceived from the
clouds, were then left to bring
forth her own fruits and flowers
in her own time, and no ſeeds or
plants placed therein by the hand
of man, it is held very probable
(unleſſe for the ſin of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100886:89"/>
begun in them, and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increaſed in us, the great God
of Nature, even <hi>Natura naturans,</hi>
ſhould recall, or ſuſpend thoſe
fructifying bleſſings which at the
firſt he conferred upon his coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Creatures) that this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
earth, ſo manured with the
ſtarres, would bring forth ſuch
ſtrange and glorious plants, fruits
and flowers, as none of all the
Herbariſts that ever wrote till this
day, nor any other, unleſſe <hi>Adam</hi>
himſelfe were alive againe, could
either know, or give true and
proper names unto theſe moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
ſimples.</p>
            <p>Alſo, in the work of fructifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I think that Corn it ſelf may
be ſo philoſophically prepared,
only by imbibition in the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
<hi>aqua vitae,</hi> that any bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
ground, ſo as it be in nature
kindly for Corn, ſhall bring forth
a rich crop, without any matter
added to the ground, and ſo with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100886:89"/>
a ſmall or no charge, a man may
ſow yearly upon the ſame ground
And he that knoweth how to lay
his fallowes truely, whereby they
may become pregnant from the
heavens, and draw abundantly
that coeleſtial and generative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
into the <hi>Mataix</hi> of the earth;
this man, no doubt, will prove
the true and philoſophical Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
and goe beyond all the
Countrey <hi>Coridons</hi> of the Land,
though never ſo well acquainted
with <hi>Virgils Georgicks,</hi> or with
Maſter <hi>Bernhard Paliſiy</hi> his conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
part of raine water, which
he calleth the <hi>Vegetable ſalt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
wherein though he obſerved
more then either <hi>Varro, Columella,</hi>
or any of the ancient Writers in
this kind, did ever dream of; yet
doth he come many degrees ſhort
of this heavenly myſtery.</p>
            <p>Now, to give you ſome taſte of
that fire which the Philoſophers
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100886:90"/>
call the <hi>Stomach of the Oſtrich,</hi>
(without which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
true and perfect <hi>Aqua vitae</hi>
can never be made) you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that it is an outward
fire of Nature, which doth not
onely keepe your Glaſſe, and the
matter therein contained, in a
true proportionable heat, fit for
workmanſhip, without the helpe
of any ordinary or material fire:
but it is alſo an efficient and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
cauſe, by his powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and pearcing quality, to ſtir
up, alter and exalt, that inward
fire that is incloſed within the
Glaſſe in his owne proper earth.
And therefore here, all the uſual
Chymical fires, with all their
graduations, are utterly ſecluded;
ſo as neither any naked fire, nor
the heat of filings of Iron, of
ſand, of aſhes, nor of <hi>Baln. Mar.</hi>
though kept in a moſt exquiſite
manner, nor any of the fires en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered
by putrefaction, as of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100886:90"/>
dung and ſuch like, no nor the
heat of the Sun, or of a Lamp, or
an <hi>Athanor</hi> (the laſt refuge of our
wandring and illiterate Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts)
have here any place at all.
So that by this fire and furnace
onely, a man may eaſily diſcern a
mercenary workman (if he deale
in vegetables onely from a ſecond
Philoſopher; and if in any thing
(as no doubt in many things)
then here eſpecially <hi>vulgaris ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
caligat plurimum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fire is by nature generally
offered unto all, and yet none
but the children of Art have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to apprehend it: for, being coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial,
it is not eaſily underſtood
of an elemental braine; and being
too ſubtile for the ſenſe of the
Eye, it is left onely to the ſearch
of a divine wit: and there I leave
it for this time.</p>
            <p>The phyſical uſe of this fire,
is to divide a <hi>Coelum terrae,</hi> and
then to ſtellifie the ſame with any
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100886:91"/>
animall or vegetable ſtar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in the end it may become a
quinteſſence.</p>
            <p>Here I had thought to have
handled that crimſon coloured
ſalt of Nature, ſo farre exceeding
all other ſalts, in a true, quick,
and lively taſte, which is drawne
from the Philoſophers earth, and
worketh miraculous effects in
mans body; and withall, to have
examined that ſtrange opinion
which Doctor <hi>Quercitanus,</hi> an
excellent <hi>Theoriſt</hi> in Nature, and
a great Writer in theſe dayes doth.
violently maintaine, in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
upon <hi>Salt-peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe it is impertinent to
this ſubject, and that I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
more at large thereon in
my Abſtract of <hi>Corn. Agrip.</hi> his
Booke <hi>De occult. Philoſ.</hi> and for
that <hi>Quercitanus</hi> doth ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

Houſhold, I will not ſtraine my

to be of that family; although

as himſelfe, muſt give me leave,
whenſoever I ſhall be forced in

happily to weaken ſome
principles and poſitions, which
both he and they have already
