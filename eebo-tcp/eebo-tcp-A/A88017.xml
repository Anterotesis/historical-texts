            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sent from thoſe LORDS, whoſe Names are under-written, to the

the High Court of Parliament, <date>June the 4. 1642.</date>
            </head>
            <p>WEE whoſe names are underwritten, have each of us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an Order, ſigned by the Clarke of the Houſe <hi>John
Browne;</hi> commanding our appearance as Delinquents, at
the Barr (the eight of <hi>June</hi> inſtant, to Anſwer an high
Contempt againſt the Houſe, contrary to our Duty and our breach of
priviledge of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which by Oath we are bound to maintain.</p>
            <p>We are very ſenſible to hear a ſtile, as the name of Delinquency ſhould
be put upon us; and ſo great a diſgrace as coming to the Barr, which we
conceive to be contrary to the dignity and priviledge of Peeres: the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity
of the Crime not at all notified. And we doe further conceive,
That it is the apparant uſual, and inherent right belonging to the Peerage
of <hi>England,</hi> That in the higheſt miſdemenour whatſoever, no Pecre is to
Anſwer to the firſt, but in his owne perſon, and not upon the firſt Charg
to come to the Barr. And as we are ignorant of the Nature of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
ſo are We not informed by the Order wherein We have broken
any Priviledge of Parliament, much leſſe violated any Oath.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe of our coming being to pay a willing obedience to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
command, ſignified by Letters under his owne hand; And we ſhall
be much comforted and ſatisfied (when his Majeſties occaſions ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
us) to returne backe to the Houſe to ſit with the liberty and that
condition that the Peerage of <hi>England</hi> formerly have done, ſecured from
all menaces, or demanding any account of our particular Votes, and from
tumultuary aſſemblies. My Lords, we hope that as in our hearts reſide
a great reverence and duty to the Houſe, ſo we are confident thoſe H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
