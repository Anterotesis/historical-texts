            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Treatise, together with the state of the Case annex'd to it, is Humbly Presented to your Lordships, to whom it properly belongs; the Subject matter of both, relating to that Supream Jurisdiction in Cases of Appeals from Courts of Equity which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd by your Lordships, as being the last Resort: Your Lordships being also the true and just Moderators in all Disputes between other Courts in points of Jurisdiction; you having the Coercive and Directive Power of keeping the rest of the Courts within their due Bounds, set them by the Law and Constitution of the Nation, that they do not Overflow their Banks, nor Usurp nor Encroach one upon another.</p>
            <p>Your Lordships besides, have a more peculiar Right and Title to the Service of the Composer of this Treatise, who hath had the Honour to serve your Lordships for some Years, and in several Parliaments, in an Eminent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with a large Testimony and favourable Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from your Lordships, as appears by that hearty and kind Address which your Lordships made on his behalf; besides his ordinary Attendance and Assistance as one of the Judges, which he began about Four and twenty years since.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:57482:3"/>
If what he hath written seem too free and plain, he hopes he is excuseable, the Necessity and Importance of the Case so requires: And he may be allowed a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Zeal for the <hi>Common Law,</hi> he having sat so many Years as a Judge in several of the Courts in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall;</hi> he himself, and his Three immediate Ancestors, having been of the Profession for near Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, and in Judicial places; and (through the Blessing of Almighty God) have Prospered by it. His Great Grandfather living in the time of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry VII.</hi> and they all have, in their several turns, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the Charge and Labour of Readers of <hi>Lincolns-Inn.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The only Design of this Treatise, being meerly to Assist and Serve your Lordships, in your Discharge of that Mighty Trust reposed in your Lordships; to whom the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and Case is entirely submitted, by</p>

            <head>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE Jurisdiction of the <hi>CHANCERY,</hi> IN Causes of Equity, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT cannot, nor (as to the present Occasion and Enquiry) it need not be denied, but that the Names of Chancellor and Chancery are very Ancient, not only in Foreign Countries, <note place="margin">The Names of Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> but even in this Nation, both in the times of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and continued from thence down to our times. But our proper business at present is to Enquire, what those Great and High Names did at first import and signifie; and what Change hath been introduced in their signification by process of time, derived down to this present Age.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> (that Learned Antiquary,) in his Glossary print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1687. <hi>pag.</hi> 109. gives us a Series of the Chancellors in this Nation, and begins with <hi>Turketulus,</hi> Chancellor to <hi>Edward</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The first Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> the Elder, (as he is called in our History of the <hi>Saxon</hi> times) in the year of our Lord 924. near 800 years since. <hi>Rembaldus</hi> was Chancellor to <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, <hi>Roll. Abr. Tit. Chancellor.</hi> 1 <hi>part.</hi> 384.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> (sometime Lord Chancellor of <hi>England)</hi> in his <hi>Resus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>itatio,</hi> at the end of that Book, sets down a Catalogue of our Chancellors, beginning with <hi>Mauritius,</hi> in the time of our <hi>William</hi> the First, <hi>Anno</hi> 1067. And <hi>Dugdale</hi> in his <hi>Origines Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridiciales</hi> gives the same. See Sir <hi>Edw. Cooke</hi> 4 <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tit.</hi> 78. in the Chapter of the Chancery, are the Names of several Chancellors n ancient times.</p>
            <p>This shews the Antiquity of the Names; but our business is to learn the Nature of them, and what their Business and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and Office of Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note> was at first, and when, and how it changed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nomen ab Officio.</hi> We may learn what the latter (the <hi>Officium)</hi> is, from the Name; so that the <hi>Nomen</hi> may be a true <hi>Notamen</hi> of the thing, (as it ought to be.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57482:4"/>
The Name of an Office, or Employment, generally imports the most eminent and noted part of the Employment, though it consists of divers parts. <hi>Cowel</hi> in his Interpreter upon the word (Chancellor) deduces it from <hi>(Cancellare) id est, Literas, vel scriptum, line â per medium deductâ, damnare.</hi> Which, (as the word now in use with us) is to Cancel, or make void; and it is performed by drawing cross Lines over the Letters Patents, <note place="margin">So <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word.</note> or other Writings, to signifie they are made void, and are to be of no farther use.</p>
            <p>And this ('tis likely) was borrowed from the Lettices of Wood or Iron laid Croswise one over another, to divide or enclose one part of a Room, from the rest of that Room, so that a Man <note place="margin">Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia, <hi>p.</hi> 143.</note> might see through them; within which Inclosure the Judge, or Officer sate, so as to be seen and spoken with, but yet defended from the press of those that resorted to them. As it is used in Churches, where the Chancel is divided from the Body of the Church, and the Clergy from the People, in the first design of that partition. And this rather relates to the place called the Chancery, than to the Chancellor. But from the resemblance of this partition, the word is also applied to the Office or Duty of the Chancellor, which was <hi>(Cancellare)</hi> to draw cross Lines over a Writing, that is, to Cancel it.</p>
            <p>From hence it may be collected, that at first the Chancellors principal Imployment was, to Cancel Writings, for he had his Name from it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Cowel</hi> cites <hi>Lupanus,</hi> as testifying the same. That the Name of <hi>Cancellarius</hi> was belonging to every Register, who also was styled <hi>Grapharius</hi> a Scribe, a writer of Writs, or Actuary, a <note place="margin">A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial, not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at first.</note> Register of the Acts and Proceeding of a Court; not a Judge, but an Officer, attending upon Judges; <hi>Qui conscribendis Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum actis dat operam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon's Resuscitatio</hi> (before cited) That <hi>Turketul</hi> (before mentioned for a Chancellor) was Abbot of <hi>Croyland,</hi> (as the succeeding Chancellors till the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> were generally Clergymen,) and their principal Employment was in serving at the Altar in Spiritual Things.</p>
            <p>And in a Subscription by <hi>Rembaldus,</hi> Chancellor to <hi>William</hi> the First, as a witness to Royal Charters, (among others) he did not subscribe in the first place, but after divers Bishops, Abbots, and others; which shews something of his Degree and Character at that time. And <hi>Mauritius</hi> (Chancellor to <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) subscribed as a witness to that King's Charter after the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and before the Abbots. <hi>Rolle's Abridgment par.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 384. and long before the Conquest, in the time of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> (the first Christian King of the <hi>Saxons) Augemandus</hi> the Chan-cellor


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57482:4"/>
(as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> supposes) subscribes a Charter by the Title of <hi>(Referendarius)</hi> a Referee, or Reporter, (as <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew</hi> upon that word) which seems by that to be the higher Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and the Office of both, as he observes, signifies an Officer that received Petitions directed to the King, as Masters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests have done of late; and made out Writs and Mandates, suited to the different Cases of the Petitioners: Whence 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the place of the Office afterwards acquired the Name of <hi>Officina Brevium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears by Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s Gloss. <hi>pag.</hi> 106. <hi>Connectun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Munus Cancellarii &amp; Capellani Regis</hi> in the time of King <hi>Ethelbert, nec deinceps, nisi rarò, disjunguntur:</hi> The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor was usually the King's Chaplain.</p>
            <p>In the Conqueror's time the Chancellor was styled the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Colledge of Scribes, or Clerks, which Colledge probably was, what we now call the <hi>Chancery Office;</hi> whose Duty was <hi>Diplomata Scribere:</hi> whence, what was daily written by them have been called <hi>(Writs).</hi>

            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> affirms, that this was the Genius or Humour of all <hi>Europe,</hi> But, to confine our selves to our own Nation, he particularly observes, that <hi>Prisci nostri Reges coram Omni Regno jurabant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Justitiam per Concilium Procerum regni sui ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turos.</hi> The Kings alone never did determine matters either in Law or Equity. <hi>Ingens Exemplorum Multitudo, quibus prisci illi Reges Causas ad palatium suum allatas, non Unius alicujus judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, sed Communi Procerum Concilio definiêre.</hi> This circumscribes that unlimited Power, which in the beginning of that Paragraph Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> seems to ascribe singly and solely to the Kings; from whence the Advocates of the mighty Power of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> (like true <hi>Herodians,</hi> who cried up <hi>Herod)</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the like to their Chancellors. <hi>Fessi autem</hi> (meaning it of our Kings) <hi>tautae rei mole, coguntur exemplo Moysis, Judiciorum lancem Delegatis credere.</hi> No doubt but it was done by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune Concilium</hi> of the Nation, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Titles of Honour concludes of many such like publick Transactions; tho the Records and Rolls of them are not now extant. <hi>Tunc ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis seorsim à Palatio Tribunalibus,</hi> (pointing, as he supposes, at the Original of our Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall) <hi>Singula multis quamvis ex Canone judicaturis</hi> (tho tied to certain Rules) <hi>Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum unico Substituerunt Judici, Justitiam, (uti veritatem) rati tutius, apud plures conservari.

               <hi>Banoroft,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had informed King <hi>James</hi> the First, That the King himself might decide Causes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his Royal Person; and that the Judges are but Delegates of the King; and that the King may take what Causes he please to determine, from the determination of the Judges, and may determine them himself. And the Archbishop said, that this was clear in Divinity, that such Authority belongs to the King by the Word of God. But Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> (then Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) in the Presence, and with the clear Consent of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and Barons of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> answered, That the King in his own Person cannot adjudge any Case, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Criminal, or between Party and Party; but it ought to be determin'd in some Court of Justice, according to the Law and Custom of <hi>England.</hi> 4 <hi>Instit.</hi> in the Chap of the King's Bench, <hi>fol.</hi> 70. The King (that is, the Law and Constitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) hath committed all Power of Judicature to several Courts of Justice. This is necessary to be remembred, because it is confidently affirm'd by the Advocates of the Equity-Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Chancery;</hi> that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> anciently, and at the first, did Administer Justice, and more especially did mitigate the Rigour of the Law, by Equity, in their own Persons alone; and afterwards did delegate the same Power of Equity to a single Person, (the Chancellor) who (as they phrase it) hath the dispensing of the King's Conscience, as well as the Custody of it: And that, to the King alone, in such Cases, an Appeal doth lie; which, by what hath been already said, is manifestly untrue, as shall yet be further made out.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Fortescue</hi> (who was a Lord Chancellor) in his Book <hi>De laudibus Legum Angliae, pag.</hi> 64. says, to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> (Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> VI) <hi>proprio ore Nullus Regum Angliae Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium proferre visus est, &amp; tamen sua sunt omnia Judicia regni, licet per Alios ipsa reddantur.</hi> Just as all our Laws are said to be the King's Laws; not that he hath the sole Legislature, (as Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> doth weakly, or rather wilfully, tho ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly infer;) but <hi>Denominatio sumitur à Majore,</hi> as is most frequent

Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> says, that this Decree <note place="margin">The first Decree in Chancery was rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the matter left by the House of Lords, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</note> so made by the Council, was the first Decree in <hi>Chancery,</hi> that he could find; and that upon a deliberate hearing of the whole matter, by the Lords in Parliament, it was adjudg'd, that Sir <hi>John de Windsor</hi> should take nothing by his Suit, but stand to the Common Law; that is, (according to our now usual Language,) His Petition or Bill in Equity was dismiss'd, and the Parties sent to the <hi>Common Law.</hi> I desire that both these Authorities last cited, may be compared together, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Cotton</hi>'s <hi>Abr.</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s 2 <hi>Instit.</hi> 553. the one gives light to the other; <hi>Juncta juvant.</hi> This Instructs us in the method of Proceedings in Equity, used in the time of King <hi>R.</hi> II. and most likely in the times preceding: Not to the Chancellor alone, but to the King himself, to be referr'd to the Councel. And the Case of Sir <hi>Richard le Scrope,</hi> was in a matter where there was remedy at Law, (so that they were out of their way, in Petitioning to the King in it); and therefore the Decree was revers'd by the Lords in Parliament, before whom the Appeal did properly lye; nor would the Lords themselves determine it upon the Merits of the Cause; <hi>viz.</hi> who had the right, but referred the Parties to the Common Law, to the right course; and yet it was a Decree made by the Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Parties to the Arbitration. So ready were the Lords at that time to do right to the Common Law: Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> says, this was the first Decree made by the Chancellor in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> who did, (as it seems) <hi>in limine titubare,</hi> (stumble at the very Threshold); which (some say) is ominous. The Proceedings in this Case of Sir <hi>Richard le Scrope,</hi> was (as I find) when <hi>Thomas Arundel,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and afterwards Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was Chancellor; who, no doubt, did much influence the King and Council, in making the Decree.</p>
            <p>They have been Churchmen, and divers of them of the highest rank, (Cardinals,) who are upon good ground supposed <note place="margin">The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were the first Setters up of a Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Chancery, in matters of Equity.</note> to be the first Setters up, and promoters of this absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>Chancery;</hi> the Chancellors generally in those elder times, being of the Order of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>And they began (as is usual in beginnings) with great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and to exercise their Power in some few Cases, which failed of ordinary help; and when Parliaments were not so frequent as formerly, to whom recourse should have been, and who would have censured such assuming of new Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as they afterwards very frequently did). And the Setters up <note place="margin">The Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were at first wont to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with by the Chancello.</note> of this new Jurisdiction, would not at first adventure to do it by One single Person alone, tho never so high, but with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence

consented to by the Nation, and from the first appearance of them, declaim'd against by several Acts of Parliament, and by a multitude of Petitions of the whole Commons in Parliament, complaining of their Process as a Novelty, began at first but about <hi>Richard</hi> II. or <hi>Henry</hi> IV. time; a time of great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. See to this purpose <hi>Cott. Abr.</hi> 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Nu.</hi> 69. 3. <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>Nu.</hi> 46. 9 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>Nu.</hi> 25. <hi>Roll.

Yet let me here observe one thing more by the way, namely, that from these beginnings here, of the Chancellor's Power, tho so restrained as we see, by the several particular Acts of Parliament that gave them: Occasion was taken afterwards to Engross the Power of Equity, and to take it from the highest Court of the Nation: And those that plead for it, do without all sence or reason, ascribe it to some few Acts of Parliament, that referred some particular Cases to him, as fairly giving him the power; whereas those Acts of Parliament manifestly shew the contrary. <hi>Utcunque verò,</hi> (says Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,) se res habuerit, fiquidem vel Exutis sociis, vel cedentibus</hi> (shaken off, sitting silent, or weary of being Mutes) <hi>apud ipsum Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> (meaning still the Chancellor) <hi>remansit tandem Jurisdictio.</hi> It so came to pass, that he could not well tell how, that the Chancellor grasp'd it all, and shook off his Associates, or they prov'd Deserters. And one Act of Parliament more Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spelman</hi> mentions, <hi>viz.</hi> 36 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. as trusting the Chancellor singly; but it hath been already shewn, that the matter so intrusted by that Statute, had no reference to Equity, nor indeed to any Judicial power to be exercised by him, but meerly as ministerial rather, directing Remedies by Writs, in order to a Decision by a Legal Course, and by the Common Law. He proceeds farther, <hi>viz. Ascitisque &amp; protractis in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellariam pluribus quam Justum videbatur; Populus</hi> (meaning the Commons in Parliament) <hi>ad candem cohibendam Legem rogat, non autem tulit, sed benignè à Rege responsum est,</hi> (as was wont) <hi>mandaturum se id parciùs fieri quam priùs solitum.</hi> This was 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>

            <p>See Sir <hi>Rob. Cott. Abr. pag.</hi> 410. 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Nu.</hi> 69. a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commons against the very Original Process of <hi>Sub-Paena,</hi> that it might no more be used; and that the Subjects might be treated according to the rightful Laws of the Land, <note place="margin">And of the Process by Sub-Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> anciently used; see <hi>Rolles</hi>'s <hi>Abr. part</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 370. more at large.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57482:10"/>
the Suggestions made in <hi>Chancery,</hi> may be tryed by a Jury; and if they be found false, that the Jury may give the Defendant damages: And that the Plaintiff, before he be allowed to take out a <hi>Sub-Paena,</hi> may find sufficient Surety to answer such Damages; which shews the good Opinion the Nation had of Juries.</p>
            <p>The Petition of the Commons, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Nu.</hi> 110. intimates, that all the Estates of the Realm, were in danger by the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi>-Proceedings, and they pray remedy for God's sake. It is very useful and pertinent also, to set down what further Sir <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Spelman</hi> mentions: <hi>Simile quiddam</hi> (says he) <hi>agitatum ferunt in Parliamento, Anno primo</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. <hi>Sc. Neminem ad Cancellariam provocaturum, cui duo Justiciariorum Regis non fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent testimonium haud Subvenire Legem Terrae.</hi> Two Judges of the Common Law, (which is call'd the Law of the Land, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from the Chancery-Rules,) were to make way for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bill in <hi>Chancery,</hi> by their first certifying, that the Plaintiff had no Remedy at Law: which was an excellent expedient, and worthy to be made a Law by a short Act, to be past for that purpose.</p>
            <p>The Judges of the Common Law, who are Sworn to maintain the Law, were thought the most competent, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be entrusted in it; and not look'd upon as partial and unindifferent, which is a Scandalous Reflection upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Constitution. See the 2 <hi>Instit.</hi> of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke, pag.</hi> 544. there is a Writ directed by King <hi>Edw.</hi> II. to the Judges of the King's-Bench, in these words: <hi>Vos Locum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum in placitis teneatis &amp; nostram praesentiam supplere debeatis;</hi> and in the Case of <hi>Walter de Langton, ib. fo.</hi> 573. <hi>Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ministris domini Regis facto eidem Domino Regi inferuntur,</hi> says the Record, in the 33th year of King <hi>Edw.</hi> I.</p>
            <p>It appears, that the Chancellor could not Act, no, not in many ordinary Matters, till enabled by the Parliament. See 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>fo.</hi> 1. <hi>Brook Abr. Tit. Brief. plac.</hi> 483. and then his Power was limited, and he alone was not entrusted, but he had an Association of others. <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi> It far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shews when he began to enlarge and assume a greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and how unwarrantable it was in his first Exercise of it, not grounded upon any good Authority; for we should have been sure to have heard of it in the King's Answers to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Commons against it, (as was constantly used upon such Petitions, where there was any Law to warrant what was so complain'd of;) had there been any, either Prescription or Act of Parliament, the Chancellor being constantly the chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son among the Tryers of Petitions in Parliament, and framing


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57482:10"/>
the Answers of those Petitions in Parliament; together with the Bishops, Lords and Judges, which of late hath been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disused.</p>
            <p>And lastly, it proves how early this new Jurisdiction of the Chanceries Proceeding in Equity, was decry'd and exclaim'd against, not only for the Abuses in the Administration of it, but for usurping a Jurisdiction, not founded upon any good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and carried on by the Potency and Greatness of the Chancellor. Nor was there any the least pretence of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription or Act of Parliament, to support it: Nor was it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be any part of the Law of the Land, or of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, tho taken in the largest sence; but rather <hi>contra</hi>-distinct, and indeed opposite to it, and destructive of it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> at last takes leave of this great Officer, and of his Court, by shewing what a mighty encrease came flowing in from that ill Weed, <hi>(the Invention of Uses or Trusts,</hi> which are still the same.) But to this point there are plenty of far greater Authorities and Authors, for whose Testimony herein I shall reserve it.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be premised, is, that as the King had no such Power himself singly, and in his own Person only, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide Causes of Equity, and therefore could not Delegate it to any one Man, (as 'tis pretended he might;) so, and upon the <note place="margin">There can be no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in Equity, but either by Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not by any Charter, or Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the King.</note> same ground and reason, the King by our Law could not by his Commission, Erect any Court of Equity. It can be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and warranted only upon a Prescription, or an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; neither of which can be pretended to, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand; it was so adjudged 26 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the King's-Bench. Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> 4 <hi>Instit. fol.</hi> 87, <hi>&amp;</hi> 97. That a Court of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cannot be Erected, but only by Act of Parliament, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. And the like in the Lord <hi>Hob. Rep.</hi> 63. Resolv'd also in <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi>'s <hi>Ca.</hi> 12. <hi>Rep.</hi> 52. That the King cannot raise a Court of Equity: the reason is, because a Court of Equity proceeds by the Rules of the Civil Law, and not by the Common Law. 6 <hi>Rep.</hi> 11. <hi>b.</hi> and 2 <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.</hi> 71.

            <p>In the next place, Let us proceed to examine about what time, and upon what occasion, this Court of Equity exerted its Power, which hath in part fallen in among our former Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For the time and occasion too, Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> in his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheion, pag.</hi> 75. refers it to the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57482:11"/>
the occasion was taken from Feoffments to Uses: For remedy in which Cases the <hi>Chancery</hi> was fled unto: With this agrees Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> in his <hi>Glossary, pag.</hi> 107. at the lower end <hi>Doctor and Student, fol.</hi> 98. Sir <hi>John Davy's Rep.</hi> in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; Mr. <hi>Hunt's</hi> Argument for the Bishop's Right, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 144.</p>
            <p>And to prevent mistakes herein, it must be observ'd, That <note place="margin">What <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> meant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.</note> the word <hi>Equity,</hi> hath been very anciently used, (long before this Jurisdiction began in <hi>Chancery,)</hi> but not in a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or in Opposition to the Common Law of the Land, (as now it is;) but either in a mild and merciful Expounding of the Law, by the known and sworn Judges of the Law; or as synonimous, and signifying the same thing as Law, Justice and Right. For the Laws of <hi>England</hi> were not looked upon then, as being like the Laws of <hi>Draco,</hi> Sanguinary and Cruel, and Rigorous, but merciful and equitable in themselves, and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and administred by the Judges of the Common Law. <hi>Mulcaster</hi> the Translator of the <hi>Chancellour Fortescue,</hi> being a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>H.</hi> VIII. could readily observe to his Reader, from his Study of those Laws, and from the Arguments used by his Author (the Excellent Sir <hi>John Fortescue,) Easdem nostras Leges non solum Romanorum Caesarum, sed &amp; omnium aliarum Nationum Constitutiones multis parasangis prudentiâ Justitia &amp; equitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellere facilè perspicias.</hi> See his Preface. <hi>Non quod principi placet, Legis vigorem habet, non quicquid de voluntate Regis,</hi> tho his Will be not Arbitrary neither, but guided by Discretion, and tho he define <hi>secundum aequum &amp; bonum) sed quod Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum suorum Concilio (Regiâ authoritate praestante) &amp; habita su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hoc deliberatione, &amp; tractatu rectè fuerit definitum.</hi> So writes <hi>Bracton, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>fol.</hi> 107. and so <hi>Britton,</hi> Sir <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Thorneton, (Ch.

The Kings of <hi>England,</hi> were from the first Foundation of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sworn to observe the old known Laws of the Realm, which were called <hi>Usus &amp; Consuetudines Regni,</hi> and that they would not suffer any Innovasion, which was often attempted by the Pope and his Clergy, who endeavoured to introduce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Realm, the Civil and Canon Laws.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> I. writing to the Pope upon such an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, tells the Pope stoutly, <hi>Notum habe at Sanctitas vestra, quod me vivente, Usus Regni Angliae non imminuentur.

much from the former, and may be thus defin'd. <hi>Equitas est verborum legis directio, efficiens cum una res solummodo legis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur verbis, ut omnis alia in aequali genere eisdem caveatur verbis.</hi> As for instance, the Stat. of 9 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. which gives an Action of Debt against Executors, shall be extended by Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Administrators, (tho not within the words.) But this also is done by the Judges of the Common Law. Here is no mention of a Chancery-Equity; and it had been (according to the right Rules of Logick,) no good Division, if it had not taken in all the parts, called the <hi>Membra Dividentia,</hi> which ought to be <hi>Toti adaequata, Keckerm. Systema Logicae, pag.</hi> 245. <hi>regula quarta;</hi> Doctor and Student, <hi>pag.</hi> 27, 28. Equity is to be exercised in the mild and merciful Construction of a Law; and in some Cases departing from the strict and rigorous words of a positive Law, rather than oppress any Man by it, which is not by appealing from that Law, or from the Court where that Law is administred; but resorting from the Letter, to the true intent and meaning of the Law, and the true mind of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Law. <hi>Ubi aliud suadet necessitas, cessat humanae constitutionis vigor, cessat &amp; voluntas Nomothetae.</hi> But this is the Duty of the Judges of the Common Law, and to be done in the same Court, and in the same Suit and Action; and not in another Court, and by a new Suit, under pretence of Equity; for that were to censure the Law, and the Judges of the Common-Law Courts; and to charge the Law-makers, either with Ignorance, or over-much Severity, which is not to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: And this (says St. <hi>Germin,</hi> the Author of that Treatise) is secretly intended and understood in every general Rule, of every positive Law, according to what is before remembred in this Discourse, out of the Case of <hi>Eyston</hi> and <hi>Studde,</hi> in <hi>Plowd.

            <p>Thus in the Exposition of a Statute, Judges depart from the words of the Law, rather than run into an absurdity or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, by a too literal Exposition, (as in the Case upon the


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57482:12"/>
Stat. of <hi>Marlbr.</hi> concerning Distresses.) The Judges, <hi>Hill.</hi> 30. <hi>E.</hi> 3. gave Judgment against the express words of that Stat. tho the words were in the Negative too, as is observed in the argument of <hi>Reniger</hi> and <hi>Fogassa's</hi> Case.

            <p>Let us hear the Judgment of an ingenious Writer, and a worthy Person, Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> before mentioned, in his printed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Bishop's Right, in Judging Capital Causes in Parliament, <hi>pag.</hi> 144. One may wonder, (says he) That there is nothing in Antiquity, that gives Authority to so celebrated and busie a Court, as the <hi>Chancery</hi> at this day is; none can be able to Cope with it, but the highest and Supream Sovereign Power; (he means, I suppose, the last Resort, the Lords,) and it is the proper work and care of that Court; (and to that Court only, is this address made). It occasions (says Mr. <hi>Hunt)</hi> a multitude of Suits, tedious in delay: The Expences many times equal (sometimes exceeds) the Value of the Right in dispute; and (that which is worse,) the Event is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. That Court, says he, had its Rise from Feofments made upon Trust, to avoid Forfeiture to the Crown, in times of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War between the Two Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>fo.</hi> 23. <hi>Bro.

            <p>It encreased from the Nicety of Pleadings, especially in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Case in the Common Law Courts, and from the Potency of the Chancellor, who commonly made and unmade, says he, the Twelve Judges.</p>
            <p>If we may give due respect and credit to learned Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> and to the Resolutions of many Reverend Judges, in several Cases in several Kings and Queens Reigns, and allow them to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Acts of Parliament, (to whom, out of all doubt, it does pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly belong.) We may conclude, That upon such Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57482:13"/>
in Equity, for matters tryable by a Jury, and especially where a Freehold is concern'd, and where (if there be a right) there is an ordinary Remedy for it. I say, upon such Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <note place="margin">That a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies to stop a Suit in chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. See Mich. 13.

Coke's</hi> 3 <hi>Instit. fol.</hi> 121. in the middle of that <hi>fol.</hi> in the <hi>Chapt.</hi> of <hi>Praemunire;</hi> and the very Statutes made in those Cases, are Prohibitions in themselves.</p>
            <p>If it were thought convenient, by the Supream Legislature, to have any such Power exercised in an ordinary and constant use of it, possibly it might better be deposited in the hands of the Judges, of the ordinary Courts of the Common Law; (whatever Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> says to the contrary, in his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Learning,) which has been successfully experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the late Court of Wards mixed of Law and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and in the Court of <hi>Exchequer,</hi> where matter of Equity, by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 33 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. <hi>C.</hi> 39. is allowed to be pleaded in the same Court and Office, among the Latine Proceedings. But neither of these Courts ventur'd upon such a Course; no, not to proceed in a Course of Equity by <hi>English</hi> Bill, till ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do so by Act of Parliament; tho some have been of Opinion, that the Exchequer had such an Equitable Jurisdiction by Prescription. And it is a thing to be admired, that after so many Courts suppressed by several Acts of Parliament, as that of the Star-Chamber, the Court of the Council, in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Wales,</hi> and others; and several Courts that have very politically surceas'd the Exercise of their Jurisdiction of their own accord, as not being warranted by Law; as the Court of Requests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Friends to the High Court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> as to the Exercise of an Equitable Jurisdiction, have not endeavoured to fortifie their Court with an Act of Parliament, under due and reasonable Regulation; especially when it once fell, (tho in times of Usurpation) under a large Correction; which, tho it wanted a good Authority too, yet it manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews the sence of the whole Nation, whom the then Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers thought it good Policy to gratifie and indulge; for <hi>in pessimis temporibus,</hi> as well as <hi>ex malis Moribus, bonae oriun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Leges.</hi> as to the matter of them; as in the short Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> III.</p>
            <p>I can appeal to that Highest Judicature, (the whole House of Lords,) who have had many years Experience of me, begun


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57482:14"/>
about Twenty Four years since, (for so long ago I was their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistant,) and to Thousands more, with whom I have had a publick Conversation for about Fifty years, and some for a shorter time; that this is no new, or sullen and revengeful Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in me, but proceeds from a Love to my Countrey, and Gratitude to mine, and my Ancestors Profession; and from a desire to have my self, and my own Posterity and Neighbours, Free and Happy.</p>
            <p>Let me observe from Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> before cited, that what he writes, doth appear to be the Vulgar and Common Opinion concerning this Court of Equity, (for which reason I cite him.) It points out to us, whether we are properly to resort for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, (that is to the Lords House,) and (with all Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reverence to that High Court be it spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) it is a Trust repos'd in them, to reform this Lesser, (tho commonly call'd <hi>The High Court of Chancery;)</hi> and to keep the rest of the Courts within their due Bounds. As for the Court of the King's-Bench, (to whom it most properly belongs, to grant Prohibitions upon such occasions.) 2 <hi>Instit. fol.</hi> 610. Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not of Favour, but of Justice. It is now grown to that pass, through the length of time and disuse, that the Court of King's-Bench might possibly find it, <hi>(Imparem Congressum)</hi> unless encourag'd to it, by that Supream Court of the Lord's House. Observe too, that this Author Mr. <hi>Hunt,</hi> does concur herein with many other Testimonies, when this Court of Equity had its first rise and beginning, and whence it took the occasion of <note place="margin">The Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs from the Invention of Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Uses, and in Trust.</note> such a Jurisdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Feofments upon Trust, whose beginning too we know, and what the Design and purpose was of such illegal and fraudulent corrupt Feofments, and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to Uses upon Trust were, we shall further examine, and hear the Opinion and Judgment of several Reverend Judges, and divers Writers besides, upon that Subject, before the close of this Discourse, of which much hath already been said, as from Sir <hi>Edw.

            <p>Now, What an absurdity and contradiction is it in Reason, and a mockery and abuse of the Common Law, That a Man shall use the just and necessary Liberty the Law allows him to convey away his Land, but it shall be so agreed, that he to whom it is conveyed, shall not be one jot the better for it, but it shall still remain his in point of Profit, that convey'd it away? And so it is all but a Delusion and Deceit, and the


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57482:15"/>
honest intention of the Law is baffled by it; But a world of work is made by this for a new Court. The Judges, who are the Conservators of the Common Law, and of the rights of the People, early decryed these Inventions of Uses, and so have several Acts of Parliament: But the Potency of some great Church-men and others, did still own and support them; for they bring great Profit with them to the Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>Under this pretence, and upon these occasions, began the Invention of Uses and Trusts, which have wonderfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd and turmoil'd almost all the Estates in <hi>England;</hi> so that Men's Estates and Titles are not now so much guided and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the old, and most wise and certain Rules of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Common Law, as by new invented Rules, in a new Court, to the subverting of the Common Law, and Ruine of many Families.</p>
            <p>How much work have they cut out for our Parliaments, by making many Acts of Parliament to redress the Abuses? but the Mischiefs are insuperable, and the many good Remedies provided by several Parliaments have been rendred fruitless: and I cannot for my life tell how it hath so come to pass, unless by the excessive Power and mighty Favour that hath been indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Persons in that High Office; such as Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> and others of the Hierarchy, who were formerly in that great Office, and were wont to have a mighty stroak in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>By reason of these Conveyances to secret Uses and Trusts the Lord was Defrauded of his Ward, heriot, and Escheat. To remedy this was the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 52 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. called the <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Marlebridge,</hi> made, which made such Conveyances void as against the Lord; and several other Statutes to the same purpose.</p>
            <p>The Creditor who supposed the same Feoffor, (he still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Possession, and taking the Profits) to be still the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Law he lost his debt, till the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 50. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. made the Lands however liable to satisfie the Debts; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Statutes more were made in the like Case.</p>
            <p>A Man that had cause to Sue for his Land, knew not against whom to take his Remedy, and to bring his Action: For one Man had the naked Name or Title, like the titular Bishops of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and another had the Use and Profit, till the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. made an Assize maintainable against the Pernor, or him that took the Profits.</p>
            <p>The Wife was Defrauded of her Thirds.</p>
            <p>The Husband of his Tenancy by the Courtesie.</p>
            <p>The poor Farmer of his Lease.</p>

The Crown, of the Forfeiture for Treason; whereby Men were more imboldened to commit Treason.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stat.</hi> of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. Tho it meant well, yet gave too much countenance to these mischievous Uses, by making good the Estates granted by the <hi>cestuyque Use:</hi> Whereas, it should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have set a brand upon those Conveyances to Uses, and have declar'd them all void, as being generally meer Frauds and Cheats; for so the Judges were in those times wont still to pronounce them. And that <hi>Stat.</hi> of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. deals plainly in the matter, by setting forth in the Preamble, the great Unsure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Trouble, Costs, and grievous Vexations that daily grew from them; but at last, that Statute deals too gently by them.</p>
            <p>And several other like Statutes were made, but to no very great purpose; for means were found out to evade them.</p>
            <p>At last came forth the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. and this undertook, and plainly so intended, to pluck up this unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Weed by the Roots: Which good Law, first reciting the excellent quiet and repose that Men's Estates had, by the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Rules of the Common Law; but cunning Men had sought out new Inventions by fraudulent Feofments, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances craftily made to secret <hi>Uses</hi> and <hi>Trusts,</hi> to the utter subversion of the ancient Common Laws of this Realm, (as the Preamble speaks,) for the utter EXTIRPATING and EXTINGUISHMENT of all such subtil practis'd Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Abuses and Errors; It is Enacted, That the Possession of the Land shall be in him that hath the Use; and that he shall have the like Estate in the Land as he had in the Use.</p>
            <p>How strangely hath all this good Intention, Pains and Care been made of little or no effect, and the mischiefs still continued by a distinction invested between <hi>Trusts</hi> and <hi>Uses,</hi> directly against the often repeated Clauses, and manifest plain meaning, and express words of this good Act!</p>
            <p>For thô the Judges of the Common Law were now by this Act to judge of Uses, (which before was the work of the Chancery,) they being now converted by this Act into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states at Law.</p>
            <p>Yet some Men, perfectly to elude this good Act, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently maintain'd, asserted and allow'd a distinction, between an <hi>Use</hi> and a <hi>Trust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thô they are content, (because they cannot help it) that the Judges of the Common Law may determine of Uses; the Courts of Equity shall hold a Jurisdiction in matters of Trust.</p>
            <p>And most of the great Estates in <hi>England</hi> have, by colour of this, fallen under their determination and controulment, and now have a dependence upon a Jurisdiction of Equity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57482:16"/>
Whereas, Were there the least colour left by that Act of 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for any distinction between an <hi>Use</hi> and a <hi>Trust,</hi> (as most certainly and plainly there is none;) yet as certainly and clearly that Act of Parliament meant to extirpate those Trusts, as well as Uses, as any ordinary Capacity, well perusing that Statute to this purpose, may easily perceive. I humbly and heartily beg that favour of every Lord to read over deliberately this <hi>Stat.</hi> of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. for this very purpose; for it will plainly discover this gross abuse.</p>
            <p>As to the length of time, wherein such a Power and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Equity hath been exercised in the Chancery, yet it plainly appears, not to be grounded upon Prescription, the Original being known, and not so very ancient neither; and modest too, and moderate at first, (as most such are in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;) and having from the first starting of it, been hunted and pursued with full Cry, and upon a fresh Scent, and in view, and having hardly any Colour of an Act of Parliament; That length of time (were it much longer) would be no Plea for it: See Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> in his Treatise of the <hi>Pope's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, pag.</hi> 154. He that has no right (says he) to the thing that he possesses, cannot plead any length of time to make his pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session lawful.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. by Acts of Parliament, restored the Regal Ecclesiastical Sovereignty, after it had been usurp'd upon by the Popes and their Prelates near 400 years, that is, from the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour: For then began their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Act of Parliament of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. calls it a power that had been Usurp'd by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the Form and Order of the Common Law used in this Realm, in high derogation to the King's Royal Prerogative: from whence we may observe, That Usurping upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and Usurping upon the King's Prerogative, go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Bishops Courts here in <hi>England</hi> took their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from a Charter of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour; so that this Jurisdiction was a great Limb lopp'd off from the Primitive Common Law of <hi>England:</hi> For before that Charter of King <hi>William,</hi> Ecclesiastical Causes were determin'd in the Hundred Court, and not by Witnesses only, and not by the Canon Law, but by the Law of the Countrey. But this Charter was made by advice of the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Princes, and Temporal Lords. See <hi>Fox</hi> his Acts and Monuments, <hi>Vol. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Coke,</hi> (a most true and hearty lover of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and an high honour to, and honourer of the Profession of the Common Law,) in his 4 <hi>Instit.</hi> 246. at the end of that folio; in Respect, (says that Good and Great Man) that this Court of Equity hath had some continuance, and many Decrees made by it, it were worthy of the Wisdom of a Parliament for some Establishment to be had therein, and to this intent have I chiefly used this freedom; for I never loved <hi>Quiet a movere,</hi> but in order to a better Security. And for that end I chuse to make this Humble Address to the House of Lords; It is the House of Lords, who are theSupreme Court of Justice, that can set the true and legal Bounds and Limits to the Jurisdiction of Inferiour Courts, and can say to the biggest of them, Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed. And such their Judicial Declarations are not to be controul'd by any, but the Legislative Power. Almighty God gave a strict charge to his own chosen People of <hi>Israel,</hi> to observe those Ordinances and Laws, which he gave them by <hi>Moses,</hi> which were very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and wherein nothing was left to the Discretion of the Magistrate; nor had the Magistrate any Latitude, whereby he could depart from the plain and common sence, and Judge <hi>Secundum Aequum &amp; Bonum</hi> Arbitrarily. But they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Yee shall put nothing to the word which I command you,</hi> (says God by <hi>Moses,) neither shall ye take ought therefrom;</hi> and the 12 <hi>Deut.</hi> the last verse, in Cases of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that might arise upon the Construction of those Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Laws, a Provision is made by Almighty God, that in such Cases resort should be had to the Priest, and to the Judge who should declare the Sentence of Judgment. This seems to refer to some special Revelation of the mind of God in such difficult Cases, which God made known to the Priest that stood before the Lord to minister, 17 <hi>Deut.</hi> 8, <hi>&amp;</hi>

And in Cases of Difficulty of expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Law, or supplying any defect; in the one Case we must have recourse to the Supream Court, and in the other to the Legislative Power.

upon punishing an Offender. That Law, (as <hi>Moses</hi> says of it) 30 <hi>Deut. v.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. was not hid from them, but very evident, (as the Marginal Note says) so that none could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ignorance.

The Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hale,</hi> in his Preface to the Abridgment of <hi>Rolls,</hi> speaking in Commendation of the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> says, These are not the product of the Wisdom of some one Man, but of the Wisdom, Council, Experience, and Observation of many Ages, of Wise and Observing Men: They are the productions of much Wisdom, Time and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Again, says he, The Common Laws of <hi>England</hi> are more particular than any other Laws, and this prevents Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness in the Judge. General Laws leave a great Latitude to Partiality, Interest, and variety of Apprehensions to misapply them. And after all this Wisdom, Certainty, Particularity, and mighty Caution to prevent Arbitrariness, shall they be all made Subject to the Sudden and Arbitrary Opinion of any one Man to Controul these Laws, under a pretence of Equity, against the Severity and Rigour, (as they term it) of these Laws? <hi>Justitia est aequalitas, non quae nobis videtur, sed quam Lex ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> says <hi>Zenophon,</hi> speaking of a Decision of a Controversie made by <hi>Cyrus</hi> amongst the Youths, when <hi>Cyrus</hi> himself, being a Youth, was chosen a Judge amongst them: But <hi>Cyrus</hi> not observing the Rule of Law, received Correction for it. <hi>Quod do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet</hi> (says <hi>Zenophon) leges ante-ferendas esse propriis. opinioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>

Law, (which the Chancery follows) by the Testimony of Witnesses only; and by as much extolling the certainty of our Common Law, administred by the Judges of it.

            <p>Now let us take Notice of the ill Effects that have arisen from the Exercise of this Equitable Jurisdiction, which in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words were taken notice of by a Bill, that lately passed One or both Houses of Parliament; take these Instances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> which is the <note n="*" place="margin">Hill. 8. H. 4. fol. 19. by <hi>Gascoin,</hi> that the Common Law is the Peoples Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> birth-right of every <hi>English</hi> Man, and which is so agreeable to the Genius of this Nation, and a Law of their chusing, is by this new Jurisdiction Subverted; and the Civil Law, which hath been so vigorously oppos'd by the Lords and Commons from the beginning, and in all Ages, is introduc'd; which brings our Rights and Estates to be determined, <hi>ad aliud Examen,</hi> to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision by Depositions of Witnesses only, and in such a manner examin'd, (as is observ'd by that incomparable Treatise of the Chancellor Sir <hi>John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum Angliae)</hi> in a private Room, before an Officer call'd <hi>An Examiner,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge of the Court, and many times upon leading In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories. Whereas, the Truth is best discovered, when Witnesses are produced in the face of the Court, and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Judge of the Court, in the presence of the Parties to the Suit, and their Council, and Witnesses brought to confront one another. There is many times much in the Countenance and Carriage of a Witness, to help to the manifestation of the Truth or Falshood of his Evidence, and by Questions sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asked him. <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his <hi>Annals</hi> in his Second Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. tells us, that the ancient custom of <hi>Rome</hi> was, That even the Vestal Virgins, that in all other Cases were recluse and vailed, yet upon occasion for their Testimony, they were examined as Witnesses, in the common place of Pleadings and Judgment.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Judgment and Determination of Causes in Chancery, depend upon the sole Opinion and Conscience of one single Person, whose Power therein, (as some of our Books and Modern Authors presume to affirm) is Absolute and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

               <hi>Fitzh. Sub-Paena, placit.</hi> 16. by <hi>Hussey,</hi> The Chancellor's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not guided always by certain and known Rules, so that no foresight can sence and provide against it. We are not fore-warn'd, and therefore cannot be fore-arm'd; and all this by a Jurisdiction, at the first assum'd, but not legally granted. The first Chancellor in this Exercise of this Power, not at all asking that material Question, <hi>Quis me constituit Judicem?</hi> as our Blessed Saviour himself did in the like Case. And how expensive and dilatory in Proceedings, we have been already told by the several Books and Authorities cited, and it shall be yet further observ'd.</p>
            <p>We may read in the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in his <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> 29th <hi>Chap.</hi> in his Exposition <hi>(fol.</hi> 51.) of the words <hi>(per Legem Terrae,)</hi> What mischiefs and horrible vexations did arise, when this ancient and fundamental Law, this <hi>(Lex Terrae)</hi> was laid aside, in divers Cases by the Act of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. and a Liberty given to proceed without any finding and presentment, by the Verdict of Twelve Men, upon a bare information for the King; altho' the Justices of Assize, and Justices of the Peace, were entrusted in it, to proceed according to their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, upon bare proof by Witnesses, whereby the Judges and Justices, (who might best be trusted with such a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Power, if it might be allow'd to any) were not only Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Law, as the Judges of the Common Law Courts at <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> are, but also in the place of a Jury, to judge and determine of Fact too, as the Equity side of the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too often doth; and yet this Liberty was given by an Act of Parliament, (which cannot be said of the Jurisdiction we are treating of,) yet the Nation could not bear it, but was restless till that intolerable Act of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. was Repeal'd by the Act of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>C.</hi> 6. and the Tryals by Juries thereby restor'd again.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the same <hi>Chap. fol.</hi> 54. further declares, That if any Man, by colour of any Authority, where he hath not any in that particular Case, Arrest or Imprison any Man, or cause him to be Arrested or Imprisoned, this is against this Act of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> and it is most hateful, says he, when it is done by Countenance of Justice; and I take it to be worse if done by a Countenance of Equity, and by colour of a new invented Writ, first devis'd By <hi>John de Waltham.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> in his fore-cited <hi>Archaion fol.</hi> 84. speaks thus, If the Chancery have no certain Rules and Limits of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it be not known before-hand, in what Cases the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor will relieve, and where not; then neither the Subject can <note place="margin">

            <p>But we in <hi>England</hi> have contrary Laws, (as some do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;) so that we serve two Masters, that are divided in their Commands, and command contrary things; and the one undoes what the other does. These are like divers Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, <hi>which are an Abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 20. 10. In one Court they measure Men's Actions and Rights by one Rule, in another Court the same Actions again by contrary Rules, as if there were Two contrary first Principles and Deities in Nature, (as the <hi>Marcionites</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi> held;) the one benign, kind, and indulgent; the other rigorous and destructive to Mankind.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>England</hi> have a Right to be Govern'd, and their Lives and Estates Subjected to no other Laws, but such as are of their own chusing, to which they consent, according to that most excellent Preamble to the <hi>Stat.</hi> of the 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. The Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Preamble tells us) have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the People of <hi>England</hi> at their free Liberty, by their own Consent, to be used among them, as the Customs and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws Originally Established, and not otherwise. Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bacon</hi> in his <hi>Resuscitatio, pag.</hi> 65. in his Speech upon taking his place of Chancellor, tells us, that the Roman <hi>Praetors,</hi> (whose Office had the greatest Affinity with the Jurisdiction claim'd in the Chancery,) used to set down at their Entrance, how they would use their Jurisdiction; and he acquaints us with the Excellent charge given him by King <hi>James</hi> I. at the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Seal to him, <hi>viz.</hi> To contain that Jurisdiction in its due limits, without swelling, or excess. The excess, or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, (says Sir <hi>Fr.)</hi> arises ist from that Courts embracing Causes meerly determinable and fit for the Common Law: For the Chancery is ordain'd (says he) to supply the Law, not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it; Tho' by his favour, the supplying of a Law is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

(says that nameless Author;) when the Rebellion in the North, about suppressing the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, was pacified; whilst the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> stayed in those parts, many Complaints were brought unto him of Wrongs done in the Rebellion: Some of them he compounded himself, and some of them he committed to Men of Wisdom under his Seal, to be by them Compounded; which when the King understood, he sent him a peculiar Seal to use in these Causes; and the same Seal he committed (after the Duke was called back) to <hi>Tunstall</hi> Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> and appointed to him Assistants, with Authority to hear and determine the complaints of the poor. He was then first of all named President, and the Authority of his Successors hath ever since encreased very much. This Presidentship (says the Annals) which is now full of Honour, hath from a poor beginning grown up in a short time to this Greatness: See Sir <hi>E. C.</hi> 4 <hi>Instit.</hi> 245. <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Subject. <hi>Rushworth</hi> in the Second part of his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical Collections, pag.</hi> 1336. mentions how that Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Lord Chancellor) then a Member of the House of Commons in the Parliament, 1640. by Command from the House of Commons, presented to the House of Lords a Complaint against this Court, of the President of the North; and tells the Lords, that that Court by the Spirit and Ambition of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters trusted there, or by the natural Inclination of Courts to enlarge their own Power and Jurisdiction, had so prodigiously broken down the Banks of the first Channel in which it ran, as it had almost overwhelmed the Country, under the Sea of Arbitrary Power, and involved the People in a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of Distemper, Oppression and Poverty.

            <p>It deserves to be considered how it fares with the Profession of the Common Law of late years, since the Chancery hath been so exalted. Readings at the Four Inns of Court twice every year, upon some publick useful Statutes which were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient, and of great esteem and authority in our Courts of Justice, are now wholly discontinu'd. There being no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration had who have been Readers, in the call to the Degree of a Sergeant at the Law, nor in the choice of Judges, to the utter overthrow of that Exercise; the Lord Chancellor having a great stroak in recommending Persons to that Degree and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and this hath happen'd but of late, since the Court of Equity hath swell'd to that Height and Greatness. Nor have the Nobility and Gentry so much applied themselves to the Study of the Common Law, nor the Students to the performance of Exercises, whereby they should prepare themselves for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of it, when they observe the Profit and Preferment to run in another Channel, and forsake the Old. Hence it comes to pass, that an inferiour sort of Men oftentimes procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be admitted of the Inns of Court, and called to the Bar, and suddenly leap into mighty Practise and extraordinary Gain in the Court of Chancery, having taken no great pains in Study, but arriv'd only at some experience in the Course of that Court, which is soon attain'd to.</p>
            <p>It may be worth the while to look into some of those Cases wherein these Courts of Equity do most frequently exercise their Jurisdiction, and then consider whether there be any great necessity of resorting to those Courts for Relief in such Cases; or whether they might not be reliev'd more easily, with less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and more speed, and as clearly by the help of the Courts of the Common Law, without going a tedious and chargeable Course at Common Law first, (as it sometimes falls out,) which after all must serve for nothing, but be all set aside, and a new, but more tedious and more chargeable and uncertain Course of Equity be undergone at last; which seems to Strangers, (not so much accustom'd to the like) to be very absurd and impolitick, in the Constitution of our Laws and Courts. It is according to the Latine <hi>Adage Penelopes telam texere &amp; retexere.</hi> Put the Case that a Man pays a Debt upon a single Obligation, without taking an Acquittance, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he is Sued by the Obligee upon that Obligation, which is clearly against Conscience, he cannot at Common Law plead


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57482:21"/>
payment without producing an Acquittance, which he hath not to produce, and is therefore Remediless at the Common Law; for it is a Maxim, that every charge must be discharged, by that which is of as high a nature as that which charges. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord must be discharged by a Record, and a specialty by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialty, and not by a bare Averment of the Party that is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with it: And the true reason upon which that Maxim is grounded is given by St. <hi>Germin</hi> in his Book Entituled, <hi>A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue between a Doctor of Divinity, and a Student of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,</hi> written in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>pag.</hi> 22. <hi>b. &amp;</hi> 23. where he puts the same Case: That Maxim (says St. <hi>Germin)</hi> is grounded upon great reason, and to avoid a great inconvenience, that else might happen to come to many People; that is to say, That every Man by a bare Averment shall avoid a Bond, and this is the true reason of the Law; and tho (says St. <hi>Germin)</hi> it may follow thereupon, that in some peculiar Case a Man by occasion of that general Maxim may be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to pay the Money again, yet the Law took heed to that which may often fall out, and do hurt among the People, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than do hurt to particular Cases. And the Law setteth a general Rule, which is good and necessary to all, and which every Man may well keep without it be thro' his own default. But after all, Tho' the Obligor in such Case be Remediless at the Common Law, yet, says the Author (St. <hi>Germin,) pag.</hi> 23. he may be holpen in Equity by a <hi>Sub-Paena.</hi> And so says Sir <hi>Geo. Cary</hi> in his Reports of Causes in Chancery, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. 1st Case, and there are Precedents of it in Chancery, says the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was Chancellor: And the like is said by <hi>Moreton,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Chancellor, and afterwards Cardinal (another Clergy-man) <hi>Pasc.</hi> 7. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>fo.</hi> 12. I suppose these Authors rather speak the Usage and Practise of the Chancery in such Cases, <note place="margin">22 E. 4. See that year Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 6. and that it shall be tried by Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and the Judges are utterly against the <hi>Sub-Paena,</hi> and the then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor agreed to it. See Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s 13 Rep. fol. 44. in the upper part, concerning the infinite Exceptions to Witnesses in the Civil Law Courts.</note> than what was their own Opinion and Judgment. For if this Relief in Chancery in such Case may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what becomes of that great reason upon which that Maxim was grounded, (as the Author himself observed before?) and how is that great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence avoided by this Maxime, which the Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the same breath? If the Chancery may receive the same Averment, and upon proof by Witnesses, without trying the Fact by a Jury, that Court may relieve the Party. Does not the Inconvenience return again, and are not the People as much hurt by it? Or, is it a Mischief and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience in the Common Law Courts, and none in a Court of Equity? It were better the Law were changed, and that


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57482:22"/>
such Averment of the payment might be pleaded to the Action at the Common Law; where if Issue be joined upon it, it must not only be prov'd by Witnesses, but found also by Twelve Men to be true, rather than the Chancery shall receive that Averment and allow it to be prov'd by Witnesses only, and one single Person to be Judge of the Fact, upon proof by Witnesses, without referring it to the Judgment of Twelve Men; upon whose Verdict our Law, and the very Genius of the Nation from of old, lay so much stress, and are so fond of it. Yet let me observe further, That by the Chanceries doing this, there is another Great and Fundamental Maxim invaded; nay, several other Maxims; as that general Rule, That a Court of Equity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Relieve against a Maxim in Law; <hi>Rolle's</hi> 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 219. And again, That a Court of Equity is not to determine of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, if it be denied, but it ought to go to a Jury to Try it. And the Author of Doctor and Student himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be of the same mind, not to allow of any <hi>Sub-Paena</hi> in such Case, <hi>pag.</hi> 155. in the middle of that page he holds, That where the Common Law in Cases concerning Inheritances, putteth the Party from an Averment, for eschewing of an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that might follow thereupon, among the People, if the same Inconvenience should follow in the Chancery, if the same matter should be pleaded there; he says, no <hi>Sub-Paena</hi> should lie in such Cases; for as much and as great Vexations, Delays, Costs and Expences might accrue to the Party, if he should be put to answer such Averments in the Chancery, as if he were put to answer them at the Common Law; and therefore, says that Author, it is, that no <hi>Sub-Paena</hi> lyeth in such Cases, nor in any other like unto them.</p>
            <p>In the Cases of Conveyances made in Trust, which is the great and busie work of the Courts of Equity, to enforce the performance of those Trusts, enough hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy observ'd, how that the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. makes Uses and Trusts to be the same thing: and the drift of that Statute was to Transfer the Possession to the Use, and thereby what before the making of that Statute was relieveable only in Equity, is by that Statute now relievable at the Common Law, and thereby the Common Law in Effect restor'd, which before was usurp'd upon by that mischievous Invention of Uses. But how is the intent of that Law evaded, by making a groundless distinction between Uses and Trusts, <note n="*" place="margin">44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. fol. 25. <hi>Bro.</hi> Tit. Feofments to Uses, plac. 9. &amp; plac. 20. Feeffees to Uses, are called Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees in Trust.</note> to the mighty enriching of some Men? Mighty profit arises to that Court by Redemption of Mortgages, wherein Relief being given, long after the time limited by the Parties, great Inconveniencies happen to the Mortgagee, by expecting the event of a tedious Suit, and what his Estate or Interest will


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57482:22"/>
at last fall out to be, whether real, or only personal, or of what value, and how to dispose of it in the mean time, as 'tis probable he would, if he knew it would be a real Estate, (as the Common Law does Judge it,) or whether only personal, and then to be left to an Executor, to perform his Will, or make a Provision for a younger Child, or how to dispose of it in case it prove the one or the other; he is a long time held in Suspence, till after some years the Court of Equity come to a Resolution about it. Many good Proposals have been made by a Bill lately depending in Parliament, and upon other occasions, from others that have been well wishers to the Nation, that might have cured these Mischiefs, but mightily oppos'd; For this is one of their <hi>Diana's,</hi> by which not only a Livelihood, but many a large Estate is gotten. The like mischiefs do arise from long Leases, utterly against the Ancient Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> but being generally made in Trust, and many times to attend upon the Inheritance, draws all the Trade into Courts of Equity; and they must be resolv'd to have the same quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with Estates of Inheritance, as to be limited by way of Remainder and the like; and thereby a Confusion made of the distinct Species of Estates, whereby new and difficult Points and Cases every day arise: but by these means, almost all the Estates in <hi>England</hi> will in length of time, by degrees, fall under the Decision of Courts of Equity. So also, by relieving against the Penalties and Forfeitures of Bonds and Securities for Money, which might and would easily be provided against, by the Agreement of the Parties in their first Sealing with one another; but is wholly neglected by reason of this common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief given in Courts of Equity, in such Cases; tho to the great Vexation, and mighty Expence of the Parties at last, who repent of this Course, when it is too late.</p>
            <p>But that which is of greater Importance than all that hath been hitherto observed, and is of a more Transcendent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Exercise of the Jurisdiction of Equity in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, is, that they relieve in Cases after Judgment obtained at the Common Law, and render the Judgment of no Effect; so that all the time and charges spent in gaining that Judgment, are lost.</p>
            <p>They of the Chancery, supposing that the Statute of 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> 
               <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>Cap.</hi> 23. doth not extend to the Court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, tho' it Ordain and Establish in express words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That after Judgment given in the Courts of the King, the Parties and their Heirs shall be thereof in Peace, untill the Judgment be undone by Attaint or Errour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57482:23"/>
Which liberty being taken of a Jurisdiction in Equity, after Judgment at Law, tends (as the Preamble of that Statute does recite,) to the great impoverishing of the Parties aforesaid, subversion of the Common Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>And the Preamble tells us what the mischief was that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned the making of that Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> That such Judgments were again Examined, and the Parties made to come upon grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Pain, (that is, by Process of <hi>Sub-Paena,)</hi> to answer thereof of new, sometimes before the King himself, sometimes before the King's Council, and sometimes to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>It does not indeed by plain and express words mention the Chancery, which yet (as is held by the Chancery-men) is <hi>Coram Rege;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But does the Statute restrain the King himself, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the Supream Court, the Parliament, from the Liberty of examining into Equity after Judgment given? and can we Believe it might be indulged to any other Court whatsoever? whether, to a Court then in being, (if the Chancery were so,) or to any other Court of Equity, that should in after-times be Erected? Would not all the mischief recited in the Preamble of that Statute, and intended to be remedied by it, return again upon us? Did the Makers of that Law mean to forbid it to these High Resorts and Powers, the King, the Privy Council, and the Parliament, out of favour to the Chancery, or to any Court of Equity, that after the making of that Statute, should assume to it self a Jurisdiction in Equity? that the Chancery, or such other Court might Engross to it self this mighty and exceeding busie Employment, of Relieving in Equity after Judgment, and so over-top the Courts of the Common Law? Will not the Common Law be still Subverted thereby, which that Statute meant to redress? And how will the Parties to such Judgment be in Peace? A Peace with a witness! to be involv'd again with a new tedious expensive Chancery-Suit, so uncertain in the Event, and tied to no certain Rules.</p>
            <p>When the Plaintiff at Law flatter'd himself, and was glad that he had arriv'd at his desired Haven, <hi>Post varios casus, post tot discrimina.</hi>—</p>
            <p>He is wonderfully deceived; he must set out to Sea again, to another long <hi>East-India</hi> Voyage.</p>
            <p>But what Authorities, Law-Books, or Resolutions of Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or Courts of Justice, have the Chancery had, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of the Statute of 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> 
               <hi>Henry</hi> IV. in this sense? which utterly makes that Statute of no Effect, besides those of itheir own Chancellors, and besides the Privy-Seal of King <hi>James</hi> I. upon consulting only with his own Council at Law; A very strange way of Proceedng!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57482:23"/>
The Great Seal and the Privy Seal are on their side, ('tis true) if these in such Case must be submitted to, what then becomes of the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. whereby it is accorded and established, That it shall not be commanded by the Great nor the little Seal, to disturb or delay common Right: and tho such Commandments do come, the Justices shall not therefore cease to do right in any point; the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the same effect.</p>
            <p>The complaint against the late Court of <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> which yet was established by Law, was, that by experience it was found to be an intolerable burthen to the Subject, and the means to introduce an Arbitrary Power: and therefore that Court was taken away by the Act of 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>I shall now on the other side endeavour to make it clear to the Honourable the Lords, that such Proceedings of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, of Relieving after Judgment at Law, upon any pretence of Equity whatsoever, is not only against the express words and meaning of that Act of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4 but against the Ancient and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> and this I doubt not to make out by all sorts of Authorities and Resolutions, Ancient and Modern, and in the Reigns of several Kings and Queens of this Nation, and that not one authentick Legal Authority can be produced to the contrary.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the most ancient Authority, and that is in 6 <hi>E.</hi> 1. in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> cited in Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi>'s 3 <hi>Instit.</hi> in the Chapter of <hi>Praemunire, fol.</hi> 123. Judgment was there given before the Justices of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> against the Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> and his Tenants: The Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> Excommunicated all Persons that dealt in those Proceedings against the Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> and his Tenants, before those Justices.</p>
            <p>The Record says, That the Judgments given in the King's Court ought not to be Impeach'd in any other Court. This appears by that Record to be the Antient Law.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Stat.</hi> of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. now treated of, is in effect a Declaration of the Common Law; for it recites in the Preamble (as was before observed,) that such Proceeding was in Subversion of the Common Law of the Land, which proves it to be done against the Common Law.</p>
            <p>In the Case of <hi>Cobb</hi> and <hi>Nore, Pasc.</hi> 5. <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>Coram Rege,</hi> cited by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> in the same third <hi>Instit. fol.</hi> 123.</p>
            <p>A Judgment was obtain'd by <hi>Covin</hi> and Practise, against all Equity and Conscience in the King's-Bench: For the Plaintiff in the Judgment retained by Collusion an Attorney for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, without the knowledge of the Defendant, then being beyond Sea; the Defendant's Attorney confesseth the Action,


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57482:24"/>
whereupon Judgment was given: The Defendant sought his Remedy by Parliament, and by Authority of Parliament Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was given to the Lord Chancellor, by advice of Two of the Judges, to hear, and order the Case according to Equity.</p>
            <p>If the Chancellor had any such Power before, what need was there of resorting to the Parliament? <hi>Non recurritur ad extra-ordinarium, nisi cessat ordinarium:</hi> And why was it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Chancellor alone without Associates, if it did of Right belong to him before? Such a Case in these days, would be held in <hi>Chancery,</hi> to be a most proper Case for the Relief of that Court.</p>
            <p>And Note further, That one Person alone, thô a Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, was not to be entrusted with a Judicial Power, but others were joined with him.</p>
            <p>In the 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>fol.</hi> 37. It is said by <hi>Hussey, Ch. Justice,</hi> If after Judgment the Chancellor grant an Injunction, and commit the Plaintiff at Law to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> will by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> discharge him.</p>
            <p>In the 21th year of K. <hi>H.</hi> VIII. Articles were Signed by Sir <hi>Tho.

(the Plaintiff in <hi>Chancery,)</hi> and that Judgment had been affirm'd in Error, and demanded the Judgment of the <hi>Chancery;</hi> if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgment given at the Common Law, he should be drawn to answer in Equity; <hi>Egerton</hi> would not allow the Plea, but over-ruled it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Note,</hi> He did not Plead the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. but ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Plea at the Common Law).</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> referr'd the Consideration of this Plea and Demurrer to all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> (not to her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Learned in the Law;) for the Twelve Judges are the proper Judges of this Question, tho it concern'd their own Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>After hearing Council, and the intent of the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <note place="margin">☜</note> being said to be, not to Impeach the Judgment, but to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon collateral Matter in Equity:</p>
            <p>Upon great Deliberation, it was Resolved by all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> That the Plea of the Defendant in <hi>Chancery</hi> was good.</p>
            <p>And that the Lord Chancellor ought not to Examine the matter in Equity, after the Judgment at the Common Law; For thô he would not Examine the Judgment, yet he would by Decree, take away the Effect of the Judgment.</p>
            <p>And it is there said, That the Precedents produced in the times of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>E.</hi> 6. were grounded upon the sole Opinion of the Lord Chancellor, and passed <hi>Sub Silentio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that no Precedent nor Prescription, could prevail against the Statutes of the Realm.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, this being certified to the Queen, the Plea stood for a good Plea. <hi>Note,</hi> The Twelve Judges are the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Expounders of Statutes; see the 2 <hi>Instit. fol.</hi> 611. in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the 16th Objection, made by the Bishops and Clergy; where all the Judges do affirm, That they never heard it except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, (before the time of King <hi>James</hi> I.) that any Statute should be expounded by any other than by the Judges of the Law; and <hi>fol.</hi> 618. in the answer of the Judges, to the last Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Bishops, it is truly said by all the Judges of that time also; That if the Twelve Judges Err in Judgment, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise be reformed, (not by the Chancellor, nor by the Bishops,) but Judicially by the Parliament, the Superiour Court, not by the Council Table neither.</p>
            <p>They further resolv'd, That the Interpretation of all Statutes that concern the Clergy, being parcel of the Laws of the Realm, do belong to the Judges of the Common Law; yet this was a Contest about Jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>So that here are all sorts of Resolutions in this very point, and from all sorts of Authorities in Law, and in several Reigns Ancient and Modern, by the whole Parliament, declared by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Statutes; by the House of Lords, by all the Twelve Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, at several times; by all the Courts of Law in <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> and in particular by the Court of <hi>Exchequer;</hi> most of whose business is to Relieve in Equity, grounded upon a Power and Jurisdiction, vested in them by Act of Parliament, if not by Prescription; (the two onely ways whereby a Jurisdiction in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be given, as has been often resolved, and was before obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved). And all these are Unanimous, not one Judge dissenting or doubting; not any one Resolution, Book, or Authority in the Law to the contrary: And yet, as I am informed, the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> constantly, and without any <hi>hesitancy</hi> or scruple made of it, proceeds to Relieve in Equity after Judgment at Law.</p>
            <p>The Plea and Argument for it on the <hi>Chancery</hi> side (which we may find in a late Author, the Title of whose Book is, <hi>Reports of Cases in the Court of Chancery,</hi> Printed 1693. to which is added Arguments to prove the Antiquity, Dignity, Power, and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of that Court: And much to that purpose is recited in Sir <hi>Edw.

            <p>It is a Privy Seal, 14 <hi>Jac.

Relief in Equity: And this was done against the Unanimous Resolution of all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> and without calling the Judges to Debate it, and without any Hearing of them; looking upon them as Parties concerned and practical, (which is a Scurvey Reflection, and Scandal upon the Justice of the Nation; See the 2d <hi>Instit.</hi> of Sir <hi>Edw. Cok. fol.</hi> 617. The Answer of the Twelve Judges to the Twenty fourth Objection, to this purpose;) so that the King upon hearing his own Council, Learned in the Law, only took upon him to Over-rule all the Twelve Judges in a point of Law, and to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and Expound an Act of Parliament, which properly belongs to the Judges, next under the Supream Court.</p>
            <p>And no wonder is it, if King <hi>James</hi> I. took this Arbitrage upon him, as belonging to his Kingly Office, and resolved it under his Privy Seal; when his constant Opinion was, that he was above the Law; and that it was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to affirm the contrary; which yet all the Twelve Judges stoutly did; <note place="margin">See Sir <hi>E.

See the several ancient Statutes that require and command the Judges to proceed to administer Justice, without Regard had to the Great, or Privy Seal, that command the contrary, <hi>Magna Charta cap.</hi> 29. 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8. 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. <note place="margin">See 2 <hi>Inst. fo.</hi> 601. the 1st Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> 20 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Some will argue for the Jurisdiction of the Chancery in Equity, from the Statute of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2d, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. which directs, That <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo recedat à Curia Regis sine Remedio;</hi> from hence they Collect, that where there is matter of Equity, wherein the Common Law cannot Relieve, there the Chancery by this Statute is enabled to provide Remedy.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Design and Scope of that Statute extends no further than to the framing of Writs, in order to Relief by Actions at the Common Law, where the Register of Writs (that ancient Book of Law) had for some new and special Cases provided no Writ; which is the first step in every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is proper work for the Chancery, which is therefore styled, <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina Brevium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very far from giving that Court any Jurisdiction in Equity; but it shews what Remedy is to be given towards a Proceeding at the Common Law, and not to Relieve against it.</p>
            <p>But it may be noted from this ancient Statute, that neither the Chancellor nor the Chancery could alter an Original, or so much as frame a new Writ, were there never so great Necessity for it, till enabled by this Statute. It could be done only by the Parliament; and in such Cases the Parties were forced to wait till the meeting of a Parliament, tho they had manifest Right, and clear Equity on their side, but no Remedy at Law. If it were then a Court of Equity, why did not the Chancery Relieve in Equity, because the Party was without Remedy at Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> in the next place, That the Parliament by that Statute doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust the Chancellor alone, nor any one Person, with the framing of new Writs, fitted to such new Cases; tho they were Cases that had a manifest Right, but not a Legal Remedy; and yet. Writs serve but as a mean to


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57482:27"/>
bring the Case to a Judgment; but it refers the matter also to the Clerks (now called the Masters of the Chancery) to frame Writs for such new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And those Clerks (now Masters) were, as <hi>Fleta</hi> describes them, Men of profound Science, (What! in the Civil Law? no, but) in the Laws and Customs of <hi>England; Qui in Legibus &amp; Consuetudinibus Anglicanis notitiam habeant pleniorem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these Masters have Caution given them by that Statute, that if any <note place="margin">2 Instit. fol. 408.</note> Doubt or Difficulty did arise about framing those Writs, <hi>Atterminent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes ad proximum Parliamentum, &amp; Scribantur Casus in quibus concordare non possunt. Et de consensu Juris peritorum fiat breve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why was it not referred in such Case to the Lord Chancellor, at least where the Masters could not settle and agree the Form, it being a Form? No, not to any one Man, and it was a Work proper for a Parliament; and in those days, Parliaments met often for these very purposes; and it was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by an Act of Parliament in King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time, (and it is a Law still in force,) That for ever, twice a year, or oftner, if need were, in time of Peace, a Parliament should be holden at <hi>London;</hi> and as <hi>Bracton</hi> (a Judge) tells us, this was so ordain'd to determine of Cases that were new, and had no Remedy at Law, or a doubtful Remedy, but good Equity; (where was the Chancery-Equity then?) <hi>Si aliqua Nova &amp; inconsueta Emerserent, quoe nunquàm prius evenerunt: Ponantur in respectu usque ad Magnam Curiam, ut ibi per Concilium Curioe terminentur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are infinite Precedents, (says the Learned <hi>Coke)</hi> in the Rolls of Parliament, of such references to the Parliament; and to that end were Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments <note place="margin">Ryley, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, fol. 411, 386, 374, 373, 371, 361, 362.</note> so often to be held; and it took up most of their time. See <hi>Ryley</hi>'s <hi>Placita Parliamentaria,</hi> in the Appendix, <hi>fol.</hi> 525.</p>
            <p>And the infrequency of Parliaments hath given occasion to other Courts to Transact in those matters, that are indeed proper for the Parliament. The Exorbitances of great and high Officers have been many times a means to hinder and prevent the frequent Meetings of Parliament, as in the Case before mentioned of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey;</hi> least their Exorbitancies should be questioned.</p>
            <p>All these Mischiefs might be Remedied, either by some good Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to be Pass'd, as has been often endeavour'd; or by Referring the Determination and Judging of Bills of Review of their Decrees into good and indifferent hands; or by the Supreme Court's declaring, that the Courts of the Common Law in <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> ought, <hi>ex Debito Justitiae</hi> to grant Prohibitions to any Court whatsoever, that either Usurp a Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where they have none of Right, or exceed their Jurisdiction where they have one. This Legal Remedy having been long disused and laid asleep wants a Revival. In order to obtain these peaceable and most necessary Helps, this small Treatise is Humbly recommended to the grave Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the HOUSE OF PEERS.</p>
