            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

now found out the way to laugh at; either came from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment party, or were cheriſhed and turned into advantages by them.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115400:57"/>
and recruited the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his broken Army; and to couſen and put the people on the more to ſeek their own miſery, a day of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving was publiquely kept for the great Victory obtained againſt the King.

ſerve to reduce the King, and bring Him to His Parliament.</p>

our ſelves, no ſuch War was ever made yet in the World, nor any people ever found that would engage in a War for that they obeyed, but againſt their wills: And for that part of the Law that gives them the Kings protection, priviledges, immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and certainties of deciding controverſies (which are more fitly to be called the Liberties of the people, then to have 45. of the Houſe of Commons, or a Faction, to make daily, and hourly Laws, Religion, and Government, and vote their eſtates in and out to pay an Army, to force their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it) if we had not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived the Parliaments diſguiſes, and pretences, ſaw them now tearing them up by the roots, that there may be no hope of their growing up again, and ſetting up

               <p>For indeed it is as impoſsible to think that there can be any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to commit Treaſon, as to think that a King ſhould privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all his Nobility, and every one of his Subjects, that could get to be elected into the Houſe of

do no leſs then rouſe him up to make his own defence; and he muſt be as much without his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as care of his own preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he ſhould not then think it to be high time to make ready to defend himſelf, and neceſsity enough to excuſe him, for any thing ſhould be done in order to it.</p>
               <p>The Parliament and he (as this caſe ſtood) could not be both at one and the ſame time, in the defenſive part; for, they had all the Money, Arms, Ammunition, and ſtrength of the Kingdom in their hands, and multitudes of deluded people to aſsiſt them; and ſo hunted and purſued him from place to place, as it was come to be a ſaying and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word among the apprentices and new levied men at <hi>London,</hi> they

                  <hi>would go a King-catching:</hi> and were not likely therefore to be guilty of ſo much patience as the King, who was ſo much in love with Peace, and ſo thirſted after it, as that, and his often ſending Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and Propoſitions for it, would not permit him to make uſe of any victories or advantages which God had given him.

His enemies ſo ridiculouſly weak, as He might have ſubdued them, but with looking upon them but a fortnight longer, could not be perſwaded to draw a ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: would now begin an offenſive war without any power or ſtrength at all againſt thoſe that had before-hand ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it: Or what policy or wiſdom could it be in Him to begin a War without Money, or Men, or Arms, to go through with it?

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115400:90"/>
think that the King did begin the War? when what he did was but to preſerve His Regality and the <hi>Militia,</hi> and protection of His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the Parliament in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, as well as by <hi>Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> for it, acknowledged to be His <hi>own;</hi> (being but that which every private man, that had but money or friends would not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to do.)</p>
               <p>Did He any more in ſeeking to preſerve His Regality, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and keep himſelf from a breach of truſt they ſought to make him break? Or could there be a greater perjury, or breach of truſt in the Kingly Office, then to put the ſword which God had given him, into the hands of <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> or <hi>fools?</hi> or ſuch as would kill and ſlay, and undo their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects with it? or to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

up the protection of His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the hands of a few of their ambitious fellow ſubjects? who did as much break their own <hi>truſt</hi> to thoſe they repreſented in asking of it; as the King would have done if He had granted it?

               <p>But if the King by any maner of conſtruction could be blamed, or cenſured, for denying to grant the <hi>Militia;</hi> which was the firſt pretence of beginning of the War by thoſe that ſought to take it
