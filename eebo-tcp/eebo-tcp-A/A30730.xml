            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <item>The Anſwer at large given to this Inquiry, is in the Affirmative; that it is ſo; from 4 <hi>to</hi> 149</item>
               <item>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder this Anſwer are divers particular uſeful Truths and Duties opened; As that the Seventh-day was Created for to be the weekly Sabbath, the laſt day of the week, being that Seventh, and no other day of the week ſo. Thus it was in the Primitive Creation, 4, 5, 6, 7</item>
               <item>Which matter is reſolved into a Scripture Determination, 4, 5, 6, 7</item>
               <item>That all the Reaſons which <hi>Jehovah Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohim</hi> doth give for the due Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a weekly Sabbath, do belong to to the Seventh, which is the laſt day in every week, and to no other day of the week, as ſuch, 7, 8, 9, 10</item>
               <item>That <hi>Aelohim</hi> reſted from his Works of the foregoing ſix days of the week, on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, as the weekly Sabbath-day. Which Seventh day Sabbath righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in Chriſt, is that Righteouſneſs which a Believer is to apply himſelf to cover his Sabbath-unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 7, 8</item>
               <item>That <hi>Aelohim</hi> Bleſſed the Seventh, which is the laſt day in the week that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath day 8, 9</item>
               <item>That <hi>Aelohim</hi> ſanctified the Seventh, which is the laſt day in the week, that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, 9, 10</item>
               <item>That all the Scriptures thorow, where the Holy Spirit doth ſpeak of a weekly Sabbath-day, there the name and thing of a weekly Sabbath, is given only to the Seventh, which is the laſt

day in the week, in the weekly Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and ſucceſſive Courſes of it, and to no other day of the week, as a weekly Sabbath-day, <hi>Page</hi> 10, 11</item>
               <item>That no Command is given for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any other day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, but only of the Seventh, which is the laſt day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, 11 <hi>to</hi> 15</item>
               <item>Where is, alſo further diſcovered, that pretended unwritten Inſtitutions, for a Firſt-day weekly Sabbath, are a falſe, deceitful, wrong, cooked rule, which we may neither meaſure nor walk by, 12, 13</item>
               <item>That Chriſt as Mediator, had it not in Commiſſion from his Father, to change the weekly Sabbath-day, from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth to the Firſt, 13, 14, 15</item>
               <item>That there is no Promiſe made to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of any other day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, but only of the Seventh-day, which is the laſt day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, 15, 16</item>
               <item>That there is no threatning, all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures thorow, either denounced againſt, or executed upon, any that ſhall not obſerve any other day in the week, as a weekly Sabbath-day, but only againſt and upon ſuch as will not obſerve the Seventh-day, which is the laſt day in every week, 16 <hi>to</hi> 19</item>
               <item>That <hi>Aelohim</hi> bath put this weekly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath into Created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a ſtanding unchangeable Law, 19, 20, 21, 22</item>
               <item>Here is declared what is meant by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Scripture 20, 21, 22</item>
               <item>Where alſo, ſeeing it is called for by ſome as an argument to men, is diſoovered, That this particular Seventh-day, which we now count to be the laſt day of the week, is the Seventh-day, by the Judgement and Tradition of ſuch Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Records, as many are ſo fond of; although we do bottom our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice upon Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and created Nature, 22, 23, 24, 25</item>
               <item>Objections againſt this Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, are anſwered, from: 25 <hi>to</hi> 147</item>
               <item>Here is proved, that it was not a ſeventh part of weekly time, or a ſeventh day, But the Seventh-day, the laſt day in every week, this, and this only is the weekly Sabbath-day, having a ſpecial honour put upon it by <hi>Aelohim</hi> himſelf by notes of Demonſtration, by particles, by pronouns, by praepoſitions, all ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in their places, to point out the Seventh-day, to be the only certain, known, determinate, fixed, particular, unchangeable day of the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: where the emphatickneſs of the Hebrew, <hi>Ha,</hi> is aſſerted, 25 <hi>to</hi> 33</item>
               <item>It is further evidenced, that what is in the Engliſh Tranſſation, in ſeven places of the New Teſtament, the firſt day of the week, is in every one of them in the Greek, one of the Sabbaths, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech, and ſo its colourable pretence for a Firſt day weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is convincingly reprehended, as Scriptureleſs; from 33 <hi>to</hi> 45</item>
               <item>That five of theſe ſeven places mentioned in the four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> relate to the Paſchal Sabbaths, and not to the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sabbath, 33 <hi>to</hi> 41</item>
               <item>That Believers in the times of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, before the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was written, could find nothing in all their Scriptures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament for a pretended Firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, 32, 33</item>
               <item>That in one place, where it is, <hi>The firſt of the Sabbath,</hi> this ſpeaks nothing to any change of the weekly Sabbath, from the Seventh to the Firſt day, but has a quite another meaning, both in the ſignificancy, and in the intendment of that phraſe, 35, 36. 37, 38</item>
               <item>That the weekly Sabbath under the New Teſtament, is not barely, or no more than an half-holy-day, between Sun riſing and Sun ſet, but that it is an whole Seventh-day from Evening to Evening, 38</item>
               <item>That Chriſt's Redemption Work, as well as his Creation Work, has eſtabliſhed the Seventh-day, to be ſtill the weekly Sabbath day, 39, 40</item>
               <item>That <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. is no firm ground to bottom the pretended Firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath upon, 41, 42, 43</item>
               <item>Neither is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. 43, 44</item>
               <item>That the eleven Diſciples did not meet on Chriſts Reſurrection Day, as a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weekly Sabbath day, in memory of that Riſing, 45</item>
               <item>That the weekly Sabbath, under the new Diſpenſation, is not left ſo much in the dark and deep, as ſome pretend; but is clearly the Seventh-day in the plain Precept, as of old, 46, 47</item>
               <item>That the true ſtating of the Matter of right in this Queſtion, about the
<pb facs="tcp:50938:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weekly Sabbath, doth not depend upon Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, <hi>Page 47 to p.</hi> 62</item>
               <item>That mens cauſe of erring, of their great erring about this Controverſie (as in many other weighty Caſes:) is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not the Scriptures, nor the Power of God, put forth in a word-way, 48</item>
               <item>That the cauſe of mens erring, is not therefore, becauſe they do not know and acknowledge, and own, either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtral dictates of Humane Rabbies, 48</item>

Give me a man, who has attained to an eminent degree, and is ſtill continuedly reaching after, and preſſing towards, larger meaſures of practical skilfulneſs how to live over believed Truths, how to improve Scripture-Convictions, how to fill up Chriſtian Duties, how to act ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Graces, how to mortifie Corruptions, how to overcome Temptations, how to exerciſe ſpiritual Senſes, how to bear croſſes, how to enjoy priviledges, how to carry on, and to order all the affairs of his particular lawful Calling in a Scripture-way for Kind, for Principles, for Rule, and for Ends, how to grow up into the later<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Glory, how to walk with God, how to have diſtinct fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Father; with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator, as ſuch; with the Holy Spirit, as the Holy Spirit; in their ſeveral Offices and Relations: how to paſs into ſuch a myſtical memberſhip as may be an Heaven upon earth, how to manifeſt and evidence an univerſal-growing holy-Conformity, both in knowledg and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to an whole Chriſt, and to the whole Word of Chriſt; in ſhort, how to be really a thorow Diſciple of the LORD Jeſus, daily perfecting his Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; bring me ſuch a one, and he ſhall be the wiſe man with me, whilſt the vain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecters of humane wiſdom may not expect to be advanced to ſuch a degree in this religious School of Chriſtian Learning.

Having thus my ſelf had a ſpiritual view of the created World through a Scripture-glaſs: put it into the hands of the diſcerning Reader for him a while, to delight his eye with the clear proſpect of ſo beauteous an Object, that might a while withdraw, and feaſt my thoughts with ſweet medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and upon his word, and his works. See, and admire, O my Soul, what a glorious ſtructure the wonder-working Creator hath ſet before thine eyes of Senſe, of Reaſon and of Faith! If thou aſcend into the higher Heaven <note n="a" place="margin">Revel. 17. 14. and 19. 16. Pſal. 48. 2. Eſa. 14. 13, 14, 15. Acts 7. 55, 56. Job 26. 6, 7, 9. and 37. 9, 22. Eſai. 6. 1. and 66. 1, 2.</note>, there above the lower viſible world maiſt thou take a pleaſant view of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Chriſt in his human glorified Nature, <hi>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> ſitting on the glorious Throne of his exalted Majeſty, at the right hand of his Father, negotiating all the weighty affairs of ſuch, more eſpecially, whom the Father hath given unto him! There he continually preſenteth himſelf and the All-ſufficiency and full ſatisfactorineſs of his ſacrifice and oblation, and the purchaſes of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the merits of his death! There he appears in a Court both of Juſtice and Mercy, as an Advocate before the face of God making interceſſion for thee, that, all procured benefits may be made effectual for thee! In that higheſt world, there mayſt thou ſee, thouſand times thouſands miniſtring before the LORD, and ten thouſand times ten thouſands of glorious Angels ſtanding before Him, theſe with the Spirits of juſt men perfectly ſanctified, worſhipping before the throne of God: and of the Lamb, where his Servants ſerve him, and ſee his face! O my Soul, be thou in the Spirit with thoſe, doing their work and enjoying their priviledg, by improving a myſtical Memberſhip! Lo, there the new four-ſquared City, Chriſt's Father's houſe, which he is gone before to prepare, that He and His good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may be together there! Enter in there and take poſſeſſion of thy manſion! Behold, above this lower Firmament are the Treaſures of Rain and of Dew, of Snow and of Hail, of all the upper waters! when thou haſt been there, where thou hopeſt to be for ever, come down a while, and let thine Eye glance it ſelf upon the viſible objects of this middle world! ſeeſt thou the yonder azure expanſe! O what a goodly Canopy hath the LORD ſpread over thy head! obſerveſt thou what glittering ſpangles the ſtarry ſtuds are, what ſhining balls the Sun and Moon are! how glorious is their beauty, how golden are their beams, how operative their influences? All that vaſt ſpace of Heavens which my eye can compaſs, the Sun, the Moon and the ſtars theſe are thine, a Part of thy Portion: how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Creature is that light, by which other viſibles are diſcovered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned? Here mayſt thou ſee the cloudy bottles and the flying Fowls, Here is the Air in which thou doſt breath; ſtep one ſtair lower now and walk the earth a while. If thou well obſerveſt it in its ſeaſons, in its ſpringing verdure, how lovely doth it appear in it's garniſhed ornaments and green attire! green! a colour both pleaſing and ſtrengthening to the Eye; whereas, if it ſhewed its beauty only in white, it would dazle thy fight into a blindneſs: O what admirable variety is there here! The graſs I tread on, how many are its kinds, of how great benefit is this: The herbs were made for my uſe, and they have often ſerved at my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and have been both for food and for medicine: how often have the flowers perfumed the Air for me, and brought me in their ſweetneſs, in their way of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perception taking ſome kind of delight, that, their maker has put any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that might be pleaſurable to me! How many are the ſorts of Fruit-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-trees, and how often have their fruits dropt themſelves to me, and yielded themſelves to my gathering, and ſeveral of them have travelled ſcores, hundreds, and ſome of them thouſands of miles, to viſit me, and to let me know from Chriſt that much of the end of their being was to find out my hand and to fill my mouth! How many ſprings have been flowing, and Rivers running, and wells filling, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford me water! How often have I eaten of the kidneys of wheat, of the fineſt of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50938:6"/>
the flower! How often have the well-fed both of the flock and of the herd parted with their lives, to make meats and feaſts for me? What ſhall I ſay, how many thouſands of hands have wrought hard for me, who never ſaw my face, nor knew my name? The Ploughman, the ſower, the reaper, the in-gatherer, the threſher, the winnower, the ſeller, the miller, the kneader, the baker; the carder, the ſpinner, the weaver, the dyer, the clothier, the taylor, with multitudes of more, and all theſe, under my LORD Jeſus Chriſt, my Servants, employed by him for a ſupplying good to me! Shall I now dig deep and get into the bowels of this earth? O what a hidden Kingdom of ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous minerals is here! Here are the roots of thoſe Trees, which have afforded their beams of Timber for my habitation! Here are the quarries of ſtone, which have yielded materials to raiſe up walls for me to dwell ſafely within! Here the Colliers dig hard to ſend in winter fewel to me! Here the Searchers after the mines, do find out the Tin and the Lead, the Iron and the Steel, the Braſs and the Copper, the Silver and the Gold, which ſo often have brought me in ſome of their neceſſary Supplies. If I go down to the Sea, the great and wide Sea, in a Ship, there I may ſee the works of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and his wonders in the Deeps, in the great waters which are <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 20. 4. Deut. 5. 8. Pſal. 24. 1, 2. Job 11. 9. 2 Pet. 3. 5. Gen. 1. 9, 10, 22.</note> under the earth. How large and how deep a Subject is there here to ſwim and to fail in? There are things creeping innumerable both ſmall and great, there the Whales, the Sea-dragons do play in the troubleſom Deep, at the bottom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the mire of Depth, where is no ſtanding. And now, my Soul, thy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have led thee to the loweſt world, to Hell beneath; a place out of which the Creator will fetch the glory of his Juſtice; a place full of terrible confuſed darkneſs, a place of torment. Here I ſee <note n="c" place="margin">Job 38. 8, 9, 10. and 10. 21, 22.</note> the two-leafed-doors, unfolding and opening of themſelves before my thoughts, through which paſſage, when the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are entred, theſe doors do cloſe themſelves over ſuch <note n="d" place="margin">Job 26. 7.

Ezek. 32, 18-32.</note>, and they are left to ſink and to fall down into the gulphy, empty, ſpace, a dark, dreadful deep, where are no walls to hang by, nor any ſtay to reſt on, where the black paſſengers bound hand and foot are thrown down; being amazingly ſurprized with overwhelming horrour, full of fears they ſink lower and lower <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.

Eſai 14. 9-15.</note>, till the bottomleſs pit of Hell do open its mouth upon them, gaping wide to ſwallow them down into a foul and hideous priſon, a doleful place where are yelling Complaints, and howling noiſes, woful out-cries and frightful ſhrieks. Thus have I taken a ſhort view of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold marvellous works of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> as made in admirable wiſdom! How ample and large, how clear and ſplendid, how illuſtrious and magnificent is his name in all the earth, who hath given his glorious Majeſty above the Heavens! who, or what am I, that, he hath given me ſuch an excellent formation, as to behold and admire, to acknowledg and confeſs his incomparable perfections in his gracious words, and in his glorious works? That, he made me a tongued Trumpeter to proclaim and to commend his power and skill in ſo wonderful a Creation? and that he has not taken me hence, before I left behind me ſome written, printed, Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Royal Excellencies. I was now paſſing into a Sabbath-enjoyment, as the laſt and beſt day of the Week, to take my ſweet repoſe in him, who formed all theſe things, and who had brought forth ſuch a world ſomewhat for me, vile un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſinful me. But that which was and is, through the Grace of God, an Holy Reſt to me, has been, and is like further to be, through the corruptions of men, a troubleſom Controverſie from them. Muſt I now be made a man of contention, who have ſo much deſired and endeavoured to be a man of Peace! My LORD is going forth in his comely Honour, riding upon the word of his Truth, and he will proſper: His Truth is victorious; for this muſt I be valiant and earneſtly contend in his ſtrength: For this end was he born, and for this cauſe came he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that he ſhould bear witneſs unto the Truth; Every one that is of the Truth, heareth his voice: Happy is he, who has a good report of the Truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the Order of my purſuit after the refining and raiſing of uſeful Arts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Knowledges, I am now led to that day, the Seventh, which is the laſt day in the week, wherein <hi>Aelohim</hi> the Creator himſelf did Sabbatize; on this day he reſted to contemplate his own Works: For, having now framed and diſpoſed the glorious Fabrick and the goodly ſtructure of the whole Univerſe; and having put it into its beauteous ceconomy and regular Polity, he cloſeth the week with a day,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50938:7"/>
bleſſed above all the other foregoing days of the Week. The righteous cauſe of which ſanctified Day I am now to plead, againſt the many Contenders againſt it.</p>
            <p>Having thus in a former Treatiſe, attended, followed and walked with <hi>Aelohim</hi> in ſome of his great Works on the ſeveral diſtinct ſix foregoing days of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted World; I am now brought to Sabbatize, and reſt with, and in, Him, on his Weekly-ſeventh-day-Sabbath. There are divers profitable Diſquiſitions that might be made with reſpect to the Seventh, which is the laſt, Day of every Week; For the advancement of this Holy Art, and for the Improvement of this Spiritual Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which would be a great promoting to this uſeful Learning: As,</p>

            <p>Q. Whether, the LORD Jeſus Chriſt, having riſen again the Third day accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures, that Third day, be the Full complete Third day from the time of his burial? and what that particular large day of the week was? and what the certain hour of that particular large day was, in which He did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſe? and what Scripture-evidence there is of this, which is queried, not at all in the leaſt to queſtion the Truth of his Reſurrection, which we firmly believe, but rather to ſtrengthen our Faith therein, and to promote Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of the Doctrine of Chriſts Reſurrection, upon which the whole of the Chriſtian Religion doth ſo much depend, and for ſome other good ends?</p>
            <p>For the preſent there are ſome weighty reaſons, why I do not interpoſe my own Apprehenſions about theſe <hi>Quaeries,</hi> but leave them to thoſe, who are of ſtudious inquiring Spirits, who by a deeper ſearch into the word of Truth in the Supplies of the Holy Spirit, may make thoſe Diſcoveries that will at once, both convince, and ſhame the ignorant-miſtaking-World: Whilſt, for the better ſatisfaction of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſeekers after Chriſts mind about the weekly-Sabbath, I ſhall in a Word-way, through the whole Scripture, where this Caſe is ſpoken to and of, treat of this one Enquiry, returning a plain, and, as I judge, a full Anſwer thereunto.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether, the Seventh Day, which is the laſt Day in, and of, the Week, in the weekly Revolutions and orderly Returns thereof, has been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſo continued to be all the old-Teſtament-adminiſtration of Grace through, and be ſo under the New Teſtament Diſpenſation of Grace all along to this Age of the Church, and will be ſo to the end of this World, the weekly-Sabbath-day?</p>
            <p>A. The Seventh-day, which is the laſt day in, and of, the week, in the weekly Revolutions and orderly Returns thereof, has been from the beginning, and ſo continued to be all the Old-Teſtament-Adminiſtration of Grace through, and is ſo under the New-Teſtament-Diſpenſation of Grace, all along to this Age of the Church, and will be ſo to the end of this World, the weekly-Sabbath-day. The whole Scripture is profitable for this Doctrine, and for this Duty.</p>
            <p>This cloſing part of the Hiſtory of the Creation is expreſs for it. When <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah Aelohim</hi> had finiſhed all his Works, relating unto the ſix foregoing days of this one week: <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Exod. 20. 10, 11. Hebs. 4. 3, 4.</note> The LORD Chriſt now on the Seventh-day actually perfected, and will continue actually perfect in the whole, and in every part of it, His dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated-work, which he had made (adornedly-really to exiſt preparedly perfected,)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50938:7"/>
and He did then Sabbatize, (and his will was, is, and will be, that from thence his people ſhall Sabbatize,) (ceaſing, reſting, from other motion and work of the fore-mentioned creating kind) In a Day, that Seventh from all his Work, the which he had made, and he did and will bleſs (in word and in deed, in a continued way in the weekly revolutions of it, as long as weeks ſhall laſt in this world) That day, That Seventh, and he did and will ſanctifie (by ſevering it from a common uſe, and deſtinating it to an Holy Uſe, accomodating it to inſtituted Ordinances of ſolemn Worſhip,) the ſame, becauſe in it he hath ſabbatized, and will Sabbatize, from all his work, the which he had created (pure without ſpot or blemiſh of corruptneſs or uncomelineſs) for to make. This Seventh is a Number completely perfecting the Week: For, when ſuch a number of days hath filled up the week, then we begin again, with one, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth and ſixth, till it comes to another ſeventh: And there the Week in the continued revolutions thereof doth, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a perfective end. The <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2.</note> here (as in a many of other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures elſe where) are Corrupters of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, who do tranſlate, in the ſixth day, for the Seventh, and their pretended reaſon is frivolous, leſt the Heathen ſhould think, (miſtaking the phraſe) that <hi>Aelohim</hi> did work upon the Seventh-day-Sabbath. Whereas he had finiſhed the whole, and every part of his creating work upon the ſeveral ſix foregoing days of this one week of the created world: Only he did that on the Seventh-day, which was proper Sabbath-Work: As the <note n="h" place="margin">Mar. 2. 27. The Sabbath was made. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 20. 11. Hebrew 4. 3, 4. John 5. 17.</note> making of the Seventh-day, the reſting from other Functions upon it to inſtitute and obſerve Sabbath-duties, employments and priviledges, the bleſſing of it, the ſanctifying of it, together with his preſerving of the Creatures which he had made on the ſix foregoing days, and with his and his Fathers providential working to the upholding of them in their Being. Thoſe who do call the Firſt day the Seventh day, and the Seventh day the ſixth day, making the Firſt day to be both the Firſt and the Seventh day, and ſo do alter the names of the number of all the reſt, do invert the Order of nature in the Firſt Creation: For, although in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent quantity (ſuch as Extenſion of parts one beyond another,) there is not one, ſecond, third, fourth, and ſo on, or not one firſt, and another laſt, put into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that created Being; becauſe, theſe are not really in the confiſtent Nature thereof; it being conſiſtent altogether, and ſo the firſt part may be the laſt part, or the laſt part the firſt part, according to mens common notion, and reckoning and appointing of it to be ſo, the LORD not having inſtituted herein any ſuch Order of Numbring, where we are to begin, and how to go on, and where to end: yet, in quantity ſucceſſive, as in duration, and in time, this is of a different conſideration, both in the nature of the thing and in <hi>Aelohims</hi> inſtitution: For this is really ſuch in exiſtence, truly ſubſiſting, whether we imagine it or not; neither is it left in our power to our diſpoſal, to put them into any other Order than the creating Meſſaiah hath, ſo far as doth reſpect his eſtabliſhed times and his inſtituted Seaſons: There is one day, a ſecond day, a third day, a fourth day, a fifth day, a ſixth day, and a ſeventh day, in the ſeveral ſucceſſive natures and durations of every one of them: Here is part after part by temporary ſucceſſion in a moſt direct line, and in its proper Partitions and terminating points, by an unchangeable Law, and well-ſetled-order, of the ſtanding Creation. The Work of the ſix foregoing Days <hi>Aelohim</hi> did reſt from (leaving man an example to follow him herein) on the Seventh-day-Sabbath. The Seventh-day is to be remitted unto Workers, who laboured in their ſeveral lawful Functions on every day of the week before; and <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 20. 11.</note> therefore <hi>Aelohim</hi> bleſſed this Seventh-day; becauſe, he himſelf reſted on it, and ſanctified it, unto <hi>Adam;</hi> the Sabbath was made <note n="k" place="margin">Mar. 2. 27.

Thus is the whole Scripture profitable for the clearing and confirming of theſe two Reaſons of Chriſts Aſſigning, as I am now alſo further to manifeſt, that, it is ſo for his third Reaſon which is this, becauſe <hi>Aelohim</hi> ſanctified the ſeventh, which is the laſt day in every week, that and that only, and no other day of the week, as the Weekly Sabbath-day.

All here, in this Hiſtory of the Creation is actual and real, Anticipations here, have no ſuch place as thoſe pretend who would have this ſanctification of the ſeventh day, as a Weekly Sabbath, to be only in <hi>Aelohims</hi> Decree and deſtination, as if it took not place actually till the proclaiming of the Law at <hi>Mount-Sinai</hi> which was above two thouſand years after; for, this Scripture, as others alſo collated with it, do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſhew that it was thus ſet apart, from the beginning of the World from <hi>Adams</hi> time and ſo downwards. This Hiſtory doth treat of Exiſtences, of Beings in their Created nature: As <hi>Aelohim</hi> reſted on that day Actually, and it was made for <note n="w" place="margin">Mar. 2. 27.

               <hi>Adam</hi> and for his poſterity for that purpoſe and end, that he and they might ſanctifie it, and that it might be a bleſſed day to him and to them. The Creator and maker of daies did put apart the ſeventh-day from all and from every of other daies for peculiar uſes and Ends. The Proof is convincing enough to the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unprejudiced, that the ſanctification of the ſeventh-day-Sabbath, was before the promulgation of it at <hi>Sinai: Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of it, as of a thing known, uſing the ſame reaſons and grounds of equity, and much in the ſame words, which <hi>Aelohim</hi> himſelf uſed in the proclaiming, and referring to the firſt inſtitution of <note n="x" place="margin">Exod. 16. 23. 30.</note> labouring on the ſix fore going daies and Sabbatizing on the ſeventh, where the ſeventh day is mentioned four times, and Sabbath, Sabbatiſm, Reſt, Reſted, about ſix times, declaring, that, in times paſt, of old, <hi>Jehovah</hi> had given the Sabbath for this end, that in it there ſhould be a ceaſing from ordinary Labour, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the People reſted on the ſeventh-day-Sabbath; at <hi>Mount-Sinai</hi> the promulgator of this Law himſelf delivers his mind to be ſtill the ſame in much plainneſs of ſpeech, <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 20. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> ſix daies thou ſhalt labour, but the ſeventh day is the Sabbath, in it thou ſhalt not do any work, for, ſix daies <hi>Jehovah</hi> made the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day, wherefore <hi>Jehovah</hi> hallowed the Sabbath day, he ſacrated it, conſecrated it, ſanctified it, reſtored it to its holy uſe, he ſpiritually diſtinguiſhed it from the other foregoing ſix daies of the week: Setting it apart for his more ſolemn worſhip and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſervice: And thus you may carry this ſanctification of it through the reſt of the Scriptures that do treat on this ſubject; for, the People of God all along were Sabbath-keepers, and <hi>Aelohim-</hi>worſhippers: They remembred this as that word of memoir and of remark, bringing in this Law upon their hearts as of ſpecial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance. <note n="z" place="margin">Iſai. 56. 2-8. &amp; 66. 23.</note> The ſanctification of the ſabbath doth ſet out ſometimes, the whole worſhip of God; for, where this is duly obſerved it doth promote all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and it is put Prophetically by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for the ſpiritual worſhip under the New Teſtament diſpenſation; it was inſtituted to the end, that, ſolemn ſervice might be performed to the LORD therein: <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 23. 3. 2.

            <p>I paſs on to ſome other ſpiritual proofs of this: After long and ſerious ſearch into the whole ſcripture about this matter, I find, that all the Scriptures through, where the holy Spirit doth ſpeak of a weekly Sabbath day, there the name and thing of a weekly Sabbath is given only to the ſeventh, which is the laſt day of the week, in the weekly revolutions and returns, and ſucceſſive courſes of it, and to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50938:10"/>
no other day of the week as a weekly-Sabbath-day: That, there is no Command given for the Obſervation of any other day in the week as the weekly-Sabbath-day but only of the ſeventh day: That, there is no promiſe made to the obſerving of any other day in the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, but only of the ſeventh day; and that there is no threatning either Denounced againſt or executed upon any, that have not obſerved any other day in the week, as the weekly-Sabbath-day, but only againſt and upon ſuch as obſerved not the ſeventh-day as ſuch. If it be thus, then how nameleſs, how Commandleſs, how promiſeleſs, how threatleſs, is the firſt day of the week, as to this matter of the weekly-Sabbath-day? Examine and ſearch we the Scriptures in this caſe. All the Scriptures through, where the holy ſpirit ſpeaks of a weekly-ſabbath day, the name and thing thereof, that is, of ſuch a weekly-Sabbath-day, is given only to the ſeventh, which is the laſt day in the week, in the weekly returns of it, and to no other day of the week as a weekly-Sabbath-day. <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</note> On the ſeventh-day, the ſeventh-day, the ſeventh-day, <hi>Aelohim</hi> Sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, he Sabbatized. <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 16. 23-30.</note> The ſeventh-day, the ſeventh-day, the ſeventh-day, the ſeventh-day, the reſt of the Holy Sabbath, a Sabbath, the Sabbath, the Sabbath, the People reſted on it. <note n="f" place="margin">Exod. 20. 10, 11.</note> The ſeventh day is the Sabbath; in it thou ſhalt not do any work.

It was <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 4. 4.</note> the ſeventh, this ſeventh day; (it is double-Articled,) on which God reſted from all his works. Conſider further, there is not all the Scriptures through, any command given for the obſervation of any other day in the week asthe weekly-Sabbath-day, but only the ſeventh which is the laſt day in the week, in the weekly return of it. At the firſt Creation of this ſeventh day It was inſtituted for <hi>Adam</hi> to do it, and obſerve it, as the weekly Sabbath day, Thus before the Law was proclaimed, how long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ye to keep my Commandements and my Laws? <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath given you the Sabbath: Let no man go out of his place <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2. 3.

               <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and the People heard the word of God on this Sabbath-day, ſome years after Chriſt was Aſcended up into Glory. Whither can the Obſervers of the Firſt day (as the Weekly Sabbath-day) go to find out Commands in the whole Scripture for their day? One of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of the ſeventh-day-Sabbath, who appeared in Writing againſt a Letter of another to him, upon his own deſire, which conteined ſome reaſons and Scriptures for the weekly-ſeventh-day-Sabbath, He, in delivering his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Firſt day, upon this Queſtion, whether there be any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs word for the Inſtitution of the firſt day of the week to be obſerved as the Lords-day, the day for his Weekly Sabbath? has theſe paſſages; we might ſay, that, it might be Inſtituted, though it be not Recorded, (he meaneth in the Scriptures.) When and where; and again, tis acknowledged, ſaith he, we have no expreſs word, in ſo many letters and Words or Syllables, for the Inſtitution of the Firſt day of ſeven. And a Third time, what if it ſhould be ſaid, that he, (that is, that Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator,) did according to his Power actually change the day, though when, and how, it be not recorded? And a Fourth time, why might he not Inſtitute this, (he intends the firſt,) day, although it be not expreſſed, when or where, and though it be not recorded? Obſerve here, thou who readeſt this with a deſire to have the mind of Chriſt in this matter: Suppoſe in the ſerious tenderneſs of thy Heart thou ſhouldeſt enquire of this Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether there be any Inſtitution of the Firſt day of the week, to be Obſerved as the Weekly Sabbath-day under the New-Teſtament, in the Room of the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeventh-day-Sabbath; and he ſhould ſay, there may be an Inſtitution of the Firſt day of the Week as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, though it be not recorded, Suppoſe thou ſhouldeſt further ask, when, for the time, might this Inſtitution be, if it were at all? And he ſhould reply, there might be an Inſtitution, though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50938:11"/>
it be not recorded when for the time. Put caſe, thou demand of him further, where, for the Place might this ſuppoſed Inſtitution be? And he ſhould tell thee there might be an Inſtitution though it be not Recorded, where for the place. Upon this, thou further propoundeſt this to him, how is this pretended Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the occaſion or manner, that, I might be ſomewhat Directed in my practiſe, if it were manifeſted to be my Duty to obſerve the firſt day, as the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day? To which he ſhould return thee theſe words: there might be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, though it be not recorded how for the occaſion or manner. Can ſuch anſwers as theſe give thee any Convincing Demonſtration or ſatisfying Evidence? What? After all thy Trading in Sabbath-Religion wilt thou at laſt be ſent thou knoweſt not whether, to pretended unwritten verities for thy Religion? Art thou under any Obligations of Conſcience in theſe matters, to beleive further than what is <note n="d" place="margin">John 20. 30. 31.</note> written? Can thy ſpiritual Appetite <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 6.</note> ſavour in ſuch Caſes, what is not written? As for any other Framed, Fancyed, Forged, Grounds of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the Firſt day as the weekly Sabbath-day, from pretended practiſe of the Apoſtles for this end, in this, or any other Author I meet with, or from what other Reaſons Conjecturally, unſcripturally ſuggeſted, it will be ſpoken unto in its place: Only here is one part of the fore-mentioned paſſage, which I would write ſomewhat about, leſt the force of the anſwerers Arguing ſhould be thought to be paſſed by unobſerved, which is that expreſſion, (according to his Power) whereby the anſwerer intends, that, Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator had Power to Change the Weekly Sabbath from the Seventh which is the laſt day to the Firſt day of the Week. What Power the LORD Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator has received, I thankfully acknowledge, and through Mercy and Grace purchaſed by him for me, and freely, richly given from the Father to me, in the ſupplies of the holy Spirit, I have been for ſeveral years an applyer of, a liver upon, and ſomewhat an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of, though I find great cauſe to be deeply humbled, for that, I have put it to no better uſe. As for the Power of Chriſt, conſidering him as mediator, we have it from his own Mouth <note n="f" place="margin">John 5. 22, 27. &amp; 3. 35.</note> in his life time; that, the Father had given all Judgment unto the Son: That the Father hath given unto Chriſt Power to do Judgment, becauſe, he is the Son of Man, that, the Father hath given all things into his hand. And a little before his death, that, <note n="g" place="margin">John 17. 2.</note> the Father gave him power of all Fleſh: And after his Reſurrection, that <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 28. 18.</note> unto him all Authoritative Power was given in Heaven and on Earth. This is my Faith and my Food: Yet withal it muſt be conſidered, that Chriſt, as Mediator, was one put into Office by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſent by him in a delegated Function, having his proper work aſſigned him: And thus, his Power was Limited. Let us ſearch whether the whole Scripture be profitable for this? In the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 18. 15, 18, 19. Acts 3. 22. &amp; 7. 37. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> there is a Propheſie, that, <hi>Jehovah</hi> the <hi>Aelohim</hi> of his People would raiſe up unto them a Prophet, (meaning the LORD Jeſus Chriſt, as is manifeſt by a collation of thoſe other Scriptures which do ſo interpret this,) from the midſt of them, of their Brethren like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> unto him they were to hearken, and I, ſaid <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father, will give my words into his Mouth, and he ſhall ſpeak unto the People, all that I ſhall Command him: And it ſhall come to paſs, that, the Man who will not hearken to my words, which he ſhall ſpeak in my name, I will require it of him. Remark here: It was the Father who raiſed up Chriſt to this Office of being a Prophet, they were the Fathers words which were given into Chriſts Mouth: and Chriſt was to ſpeak unto the People all that which the Father ſhould Command him: They muſt be the Fathers words, and it muſt be in the Fathers Name, that Chriſt was to ſpeak. To this Clauſe in the Commiſſion muſt Chriſt keep cloſe: And accordingly ſo he did. In the Book of the after-Prophets you may read <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father thus ſpeaking concerning his Son Chriſt, <note n="k" place="margin">Iſai. 42. 1. compared with Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I take pleaſure, O my <hi>Aelohim,</hi> to do thy well-pleaſing, thy will: (as Chriſt elſe where, in the hiſtory of this) not as I will, but as thou: Not what I will but what thou will: Not my will but, thine be done: Lo I come to do thy will; I utter thy truth, and thy Salvation, I do not conceal thy bountifulness and thy Faithfulneſs in the great Congregation: Chriſt did not in the leaſt go beyond or beſide his Fathers will and word.

An exact punctual juſt accompt of this great undertaking and Tranſacting will Chriſt give and deliver up to his Father in the latter day. The diſcerning Reader may ſee, how expreſs Chriſt is in this matter; he exerciſeth his Power according to his Fathers will and word. And the Father, as alſo the Son from the Father; hath not revealed any ſuch thing in the word of truth, as the Change of the Weekly Sabbath from the laſt to the firſt day of the Week: There is no appearance of any ſuch Inſtitution or Command. Chriſt came not to make a Change in any one of the Laws of the ten words. where did the Father put any ſuch words into Chriſts mouth? and where did Chriſt ever ſpeak any ſuch words?

            <p>I am now to ſpeak of the Promiſe. There is no Promiſe made to the obſerving of any other day in the Week as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, but only of the ſeventh-day, which is the laſt day in the Week, in the weekly returns of it. Here all that might be reſumed, which is Written about <hi>Aelohims</hi> Bleſſing of the ſeventh day; and that only, as the Weekly Sabbath-day.

Thus ſtandeth the Relation in the weekly ſucceſſion of daies, which <hi>Aelohim</hi> made to be in the true nature of theſe Created exiſtences, really whilſt the World ſtands to be inſtructive unto all mankind of what is his natural will, and mans natural Duty. There was in this Primitive Ordination a full evidence and a convincing Demonſtration of <hi>Aelohims</hi> pleaſure herein, by his appointing a ſufficiencie of light about this matter, both in the Created nature of daies, and of works and Reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively in thoſe daies, to give <hi>Adam</hi> to ſee and know, what he ought to do, what daies to work in, and what day to reſt on, and alſo Innate in <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his inſtruction, thereby diſcerningly to underſtand and Faithfully to improve this for the deſigned end, true uſe, and proper purpoſes. Some notions of this Law, as well as of the others of the Ten words, are ſtill retained and kept in man, even though now fallen and in his corrupt ſtate? and renewing Grace doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore in part to the firſt Created Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. <hi>Aelohim</hi> Created <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in his own Image: In the Image of <hi>Aelohim</hi> Created he him: And we are to put on the New man which according to God is Created in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of Truth, which is renewed unto knowledge according to the Image of him that Created him. And the whole of this is ſtill in being, carefully, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, unalterably preſerved, not only by Revelation in the Scriptures of Truth, but alſo by Primitive Creation and Providential Continuation in the true Nature and in the real Exiſtence of the things themſelves.

Therefore the work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſet out by Creation; and for the ſame reaſon it is called a renewed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So is his work of Preſervation of, and of Providence over, his creatures. So will his work of Regeneration and of Converſion ſtill be: Thus alſo his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of his Church: Thus alſo his work of Inſtauration and of Renovation of the Heavens and of the Earth. This work of firſt Creation by the creating <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is the rule and Standard, the pattern and exemplar, to which all muſt be brought. It is, as to the final cauſe thereof, for the glory of <hi>Aelohim;</hi> The glory of Chriſt, The good of the Elect and of the Believing. The work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that one week of the Erected World was a glorious work, every way <note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 32. 4.</note> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, particularly of <note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 28. and 2. 16, 19. Pſa. 8, 6. Heb. 7, 8.</note> Man, as Man. That Sabbath which was thus from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning muſt ſtill ſtand. The firſt created Seventh-day-Sabbath is throughout the Scripture moſt natural, according to the Scripture. This alone, and no other Day is the Sabbath in pure created Nature. This Seventh in order, has the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural name of Sabbath, which the Firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, fifth and ſixth have not. The creation has a natural order: The ſeveral works thereof having been ſo created in ſuch due order in ſix diſtinct days, doth carry that along with it in the very nature and order of their creation, which would convince a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, exerciſing right reaſon, eſpecially when the true information and clear diſcovery thereof is brought unto him by Scripture-revelation, that, the Creators wiſdom doth ſhine forth in that order, and that this ſelf-evidencing light ſhould be received, entertained, and improved with ready ſubmiſſion to its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging Law which doth bind ſuch a natural conſcience to believe, obſerve and obey it. The firſt created time as to the weekly Sabbath was perfected and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in its proper, prime, pure, and natural, Created ſtate: and therefore the created order of the ſeven days of that one week muſt ſtill keep their natural Names: and ſo, the laſt day of the week and no other, is alone, the ſeventh-day and the Sabbath-day: Which day then, cannot be altered unto a working-day: <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s Law muſt ſtill be obeyed and his Example followed whilſt Time has duration. To carry the Sabbatizing reſt from the ſeventh to the firſt day, and the Labouring-ſervice from the firſt to the ſeventh-day, is contrary to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Created Nature. There is not a tranſlating either of the Work, or of the Reſt from one day of the week to another. <hi>Aelohim</hi> would not have either of theſe to be ſeparated from his, from their, appointed ſeaſons; It muſt abide to the End what was thus from the Beginning. What the Holy Law of pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth confirm, doth remain unmoved through all the Diſpenſations of Grace, both of the Old and New-Teſtament-Adminiſtration: This doth not deſtroy that which is pure and perfect in its natural created Being. Scripture and Nature are in Harmonious Concord in this matter. This ſeventh day is peculiarly ſequeſtred by <hi>Aelohim</hi> for a Sabbath, and has this Preeminence beyond all the reſt; the Vote and ſuffrage of Primitive Nature, doth determine and conclude it to be ſo. And what is Man, that, he attempts <note n="t" place="margin">Dan. 7. 25. 1 Kin. 12. 32, 33.</note> to change this Time and Law, by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing of his own heart, and to level this Honorable Day with the reſt, ſeeing it was the Inſtitution of <hi>Aelohim</hi> in the very Forming of Created beings? The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends whereof, were concreated uſes, natural and permanent for this portion of Time; Which ſeventh day may not therefore be employed about the common ends, uſes, and works of the ſix foregoing days of the Week: Which ſix days
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50938:16"/>
in their order and names have their ſeveral diſtinct Exiſtence, as ſenſe doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate, by the continued ſucceſſive courſes of Night and Day in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. At the firſt framing of Nature, the very time it ſelf of the ſeventh day was on that ſame day created and made an Holy Reſt, and was by Law and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo declared, The time it ſelf of the ſeventh-day-Sabbath, As ſuch, was, and is, and will be, That diſtinct part of Time which was the object of <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>'s bleſſing and ſanctifying of it, as the natural Weekly Sabbath, to be a day of Holy Reſt, having Foundation in its own natural Exiſtence. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly evidenceable to every rational Man's revived nature; and it is perfectly demonſtrable by Scripture-revelation, to every conſidering Believer, who gives himſelf impartially to underſtand the ſubſtance and the end of <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s creating of ſuch a ſeparated determinate portion of Time. This is the true Doctrine and the Genuin meaning of the Weekly-Sabbath: Man and this ſeventh-day-Sabbath being created in one and the ſame week, will be coeval whilſt Weeks do laſt, They will live and ſtand together. The fittedneſs of this Day was a Creating-Act: The reaſon of which Day is of natural ſelf-Manifeſtation and Obligation, in which we are confirmed by Word-revelation. This is the prime Make of it, having its firſt riſe with Created Nature, and ſo is Perpetual, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fixed, An Individual-Sabbath-day, untransferrable to any other Day of the Week: Sabbath-day and ſeventh-day are Connatural and Reciprocal. Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-worſhip and ſervice muſt be done on the <note n="u" place="margin">Numb. 28. 9, 10.</note> Day thereof. All days of the week are not of equal accompt with God; neither have they the ſame Honour. Chriſt Himſelf hath put the Crown upon the Head of the Seventh-day; and ſo let it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy its ſole and laſting Royal Dignity; It having a concreated Excellingneſs which will be, and abide with it, through the duration of the World. A Primitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution that muſt ſtand firm. <note n="w" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Exod. 5. 13, 19. Lev. 23. 37. 1 King. 8. 59. Ezek. 24. 2.</note> It is a diſtinct day and has a diſtinct word for it. Thus let the Scriptural compleat Journal, and its perfect Diary of that one Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Week, in ſeven diſtinct days remain in its unmoveable Order. And now, if this Argument drawn from pure Primitive Created Nature be convincing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, let that Great Ratiocinator call to mind his Expreſſions, I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſaith he, that all They take the ſeventh-day for the Sabbath, who can prove it to be by meer natural evidence: and in another place he thus writes, This is the very hinge of all our Controverſie, For, if this be once proved, we ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conſeſs that it (he ſpeaks of the Seventh-day-ſabbath,) is not abrogated: For, Chriſt came not to abrogate any Law of Nature. And further he writes, That the great Laws of nature, containing Man's Duty to God, reſulting from and manifeſted in our nature, As related to God, and in the nature of things or the works of God, was ſtill made the chief part of the Redeemer's Law. So that this Law of nature, whoſe ſum is the love of God and of his Image, is ever the Primitive unchangeable Law. No title of this ſhall ever ceaſe, if Nature ceaſe not. The ſeventh-day thus ſpeaks for it ſelf and has its Creator and his word cogently pleading for it. No other day of the week, either in name or in nature, is the Seventh-day: The order of the Days is ſenſible from the firſt to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. He, that can tell the days, and knows their number, underſtandeth, that, there muſt ſix go before in the ſame week, ere he can come to the ſeventh: A day, which cannot be loſt by all Mankind: Will any apprehend that, all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of reaſonable creatures have out ſlept juſt one whole day or more, whereby this accompt is diſturbed? What colour is there for ſuch an apprehenſion, And if, for Diſputes ſake, ſuch a groundleſs ſuppoſition were admitted, yet the Day if tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſearched after would recover its ancient right. <note n="x" place="margin">See the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>pag.</hi> 19, 20.</note> Exact Aſtronomers have obſerved, that, natural days are not all of equal length, whatever the vulgar of Philoſophers have ſuppoſed to the contrary. Let thoſe improve their skill to advance this great ſecret in Created Nature with a particular eye unto the ſeventh-day-Sabbath; Which alone ſhould put a deciding end unto this Controverſie. Yet in regard this Thwart-over-Generation of vain affecters of Humane Wiſdom doth expect ſome further accompt of this Matter by way of Argument unto Men, (although I bottom my judgment and practiſe upon Scripture-Revelation and Created Nature:) Let me preſent the Reader with ſomewhat of Expoſtulation, and of reaſoning the Caſe, with ſuch as do importunately call for it.

Sufficient to me is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Authority, warranted in created Nature.</p>
            <p>Having now gone thorow my great Task and undertaking in aſſerting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, thorow the whole Scriptures by <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s own aſſigned Reaſons, by other Scripture Arguments, and by Created Nature and Eſtabliſhed Order, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day, which is the laſt day of the week to be the Weekly Sabbath-day, ſhould not every Mouth be ſtopped from gain-ſaying of it? Yet the plaineſts, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Truths have been oppoſed, and ſo is this: Some riſe up againſt it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that, no ſpecial Honour is put by the LORD and by his Word upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, more than upon any other day, of the week, and that, it is but A ſeventh, not The ſeventh; And that, that part of time, that is and will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God is declared and determined to be the ſeventh part of it, or one day in ſeven: and that, one day in ſeven hath and muſt have a natural priority unto the ſeventh-day, becauſe, ſay ſuch, the ſeventh day is one of the ſeven; Whereas ſuch ſhould have more deliberately conſidered, that one day of ſeven was not before the ſeventh day in order of time: It could not be truly affirmed of any one day, that it was one of ſeven before the ſeventh day was Created. For, when the one day was ſo named, there was but that one day; ſo but two on the ſecond day; but three on the third day, but four on the fourth, but five on the fifth, but ſix on the ſixth day, till the ſeventh had its natural Exiſtence, and its created being; and untill then no one of the fore-going days of the Week could be called one in ſeven: For, till then there were not ſeven: and the ſeventh day is the laſt number of days, and the only ſeventh in the days of the Week. So that, here is a ſtop made, and we go no further for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, As to the natural created Order and accompt of a Week, and therefore that exception and objection, which ſome do bring in againſt this from ten Lambs, any of which may be the tenth according as they may run out, is nothing perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and applicable to the preſent matter; For, the days of every week do not run voluntarily at their pleaſure which can be before or behind as they will, to go backward or forward when they liſt, but, they keep their created order in this ſucceſſive continued weekly courſe by a well-eſtabliſhed natural, unalterable Law: although in the exception and objection, this ſhould be noted, that, when the ten Lambs were run out; they had each diſtinct names, and the laſt was the only tenth, and no other but the laſt. That particular day of the week is the Weekly Sabbath-day, which alone (As to this of the weekly-Sabbath) has proper marks of Note and of Honour put upon it, As <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s own peculiar day, which he has culled out from all the reſt of the days of the week for his created ends and inſtituted purpoſes: There is not any one Inſignificant word or letter in the whole Book of God; All that he has ſpoken and given to his people is of good uſe. <note place="margin">

There are alſo two Pronoun Affixes which do further Demonſtrate this. And the Oppoſition doth ſet out a Fooliſh one, of all Fools one of the verieſt Fools, an inconſtant Fool, who walks in darkneſs either not uſing his eyes, but winking, and ſhutting his eyes, when Light is before him, or taking a time to walk in when it is dark, ſo that he cannot find out the right way. A raſh inconſiderate Fool, that knows not whither he goes, nor at what he ſtumbles. Beſides the proverbial Antitheſis here, doth declare and commend the excellingneſs and Preference of the wiſe man above and beyond the Fool. <note n="g" place="margin">See <hi>Mercer</hi> upon this place.

If men would expect from him acceptance of their work; the word or thing (we ſhould have a word for every thing,) of a day muſt be done in his day. How expreſs are the Scriptures in this, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Seventh-day-Sabbath! <note n="p" place="margin">Numb. 28. 9. 10</note> In the Sabbath-day (the ſeventh day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the weekly returns thereof,) there was to be the Aſcenſion (or Aſcending Sacrifice) of the Sabbath in his Sabbath: Sabbath worſhip muſt be done on the proper day and time of it, on the ſeventh day, the laſt day of every week, and not a day before in the ſame week, nor a day after, in another week. (They, <note n="q" place="margin">1. King. 12. 33, 34. Dan. 7. 25.

One of the great oppoſers of the weekly ſeventh-day-Sabbath doth yet grant; that Reſt in the firſt notion of it doth include a reſpect to an Antecedent work or labour: And that, it is ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where declared: And that, it is vain to imagine the World was made in Six daies, and thoſe cloſed with a day of Reſt, without an eſpeciall reſpect unto the obedience of rational Creatures. Hereby then man in general was taught o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and working, before he entered into reſt: For, being Created in the Image of God, he was to conform himſelf to God. As God wrought before he reſted, ſo was he to work before his Reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus he. How then can the firſt day of the week be now the Reſting day of that week, where the Reſt is made to go before the work and labour? This being contrary to Greated Nature? And it being a part of mans natural Created Image of <hi>Aelohim</hi> to conform unto him in working before Reſting in the ſame week. Meditation on the works as well as on the word of Chriſt, and on Chriſt himſelf, is a neceſſary uſeful duty. And how can this be performed in its right proper place, where the Sabbath is carried from the ſeventh to any other day of the week, (as for inſtance,) to the Firſt day? For, this Computation would put the Seventh day back to the ſixth day, the Sixth to the Fifth day, the Fifth to the Fourth day, the Fourth to the Third day, the third to the Second day, the Second to the Firſt day, and it would ſet the Firſt day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Seventh; quite inverting the order of the Creation, and ſo would engage a man on the Firſt day which was and is a working day; to meditate on a Sabbath-days priviledge, and on the Creators Reſting, and mans Reſting, which was upon another day, the ſeventh which is the laſt day of the week; and on the Seventh day, which by this wrong account is miſreckoned the Sixth. It would put a man upon meditating on the work of the Sixth day, whereas, it was Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and appointed the Reſting-day. Thus every day would be ſet out of its due place: And hence it is, that, ſuch multitudes of namers of the Name of Chriſt do ſo little underſtand, what the particular Created works of every day in the week are; and ſo ſeldom meditate upon the peculiar works of their proper day. Whereas, when the ſeventh day cloſeth the week with a Sabbath day, a day of Reſt which is moſt natural, then <note n="s" place="margin">Compare Pſal. 104. throughout with Pſal. 98. title with the reſt of that Pſalm. &amp; Gen. 1. throughout, with ch. 251, 2, 3.</note> Meditation paſſeth naturally into Created or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as to working, and as to Reſting. To ſpeak in propriety of ſpeech, there is but one only day in a week, that is the Seventh day in the ſame week in orderly reckoning according to Created beings, which is and muſt be, and can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the laſt day of the week. <note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 1. 5, 8. 12, 19, 23, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having thus far attended the Weekly-ſeventh-day-Sabbath in its ſtrait-footed walk in a plain path, through the whole Scripture, there thwarts the Reader now, a ſtraying company that would perſwade him to get into another way along with them, the way of the firſt day, as the weekly-Sabbath, as if this were now the New-Teſtament-Diſpenſation. And for this, they would have him to conſider theſe <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 28. 1. Mark. 16. 2. Lu. 24, 1. Joh. 20. 1, 19. Act. 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2. Rev. 1. 10.

            <p>Before I return an expreſs direct Anſwer to the ſeveral particular Scriptures themſelves, I adviſe the Reader, to ask theſe Transferrers of the Weekly-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week, when they judg it was, that, the firſt day of the week began to be the weekly Sabbath-day? Moſt will ſay that it began on the particular day of Chriſt's Reſurrection, by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Some few will aſſert, that, it was a little after that Reſurrection, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſt: but all of them will acknowledge, that, it was before any part of the New-Teſtament was written. It being ſo then, let the Reader im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this laſt Conceſſion, and further demand of theſe men, if one of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as <hi>Peter</hi> by name, for Suppoſition, had preached up this Doctrine, that, the Weekly Sabbath-day under the New-Teſtament-Adminiſtration of Grace, was tranſlated and changed from the Seventh, which is the laſt day of Week, to the firſt day of the week; and that, one of the Hearers had asked <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> upon what Scripture do you bottom this Doctrine? How are, whatſoever words of God were heretofore written, Profitable, and written for ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? What Anſwer do theſe Men imagine, that <hi>Peter</hi> could have returned? The New Teſtament was not then written, and all the Scriptures which they then had, were the Writings of the Old Teſtament: Thoſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the Prophets: This Hearer ſearcheth theſe and can meet with no ſuch thing, in the Preceptive, or Prophetical, or Promiſſary, part of that Word, neither could any other refer him to clear-convincing-proofs of this. How then could this Man be well ſatisfied, that, this was True Doctrine, when he could not find it in his Bible; but the quite contrary all the Old Teſtament through, another day, the Seventh in order of Created Time all along Commanded and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! And if this Hearer ſhould further have asked <hi>Peter,</hi> If I ſhould work upon the ſeventh-day contrary to the Precept in the Law, what Scriptures would bear me out in ſo doing, when I appear before the righteous Judg, who has in ſo many Words forbid this, and ſo often, in all the Scriptures that I have, which ſpeak of this thing? and if I do not obſerve the firſt day as the Weekly-Sabbath-day, but do work on that day having <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s Command and Example for it, what Scriptures have you by which to reprove me? After this Arguing, what could <hi>Peter</hi> have replyed to this, from Old-Teſtament-Scripture? I leave the Reader further to improve this in his Study and Meditation. For, the Chriſtianized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did ſearch the Scriptures, whether thoſe things which the Apoſtles of Chriſt taught them, were ſo or not, even in the Caſe <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 17. 2, 3, 11. and 28. 23. and 26. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Learned Adverſary of the ſeventh-day-Sabbath doth acknowledge, that, about the time of the writing of the Books of the New Teſtament, both the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, and all the Heathen, which took notice of all theſe Feaſts and ſolemn Aſſemblies did call them Sabbaths, and not only ſo, But by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from their Analogie, which I ſhall have further occaſion after a few leaves, to make ſome uſe of. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 1-10. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 1-14. we may read of Sabbaths in the <hi>Plural number</hi> (as in many other places) of the Firſt Sabbath, a ſecond Sabbath, another Sabbath; which if they be applyed to the Sabbaths of either of the Typical Feaſts, then it is an evident proof, that, the days of thoſe feaſts had the name of Sabbaths in the Scripture if they refer the expreſſions to the weekly Sabbaths, then it doth afford a teſtimony for the Weekly ſeventh-day-Sabbath. Upon one of theſe Sabbaths our LORD Jeſus Chriſt did ariſe from the Dead. And now let the Conſidering-Reader bethink himſelf, whether this do give any the leaſt intimation of any Change of the weekly-Sabbath, from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week?

Here in the Way how groundleſs and Scriptureleſs is the Conjecture of that Advocate for the Firſt day-Sabbath, who from hence, to wit, Chriſt's time of ariſing, as he judgeth it, would date the beginning of the Firſt days pretended Holy Reſt, to be the Morning of the Firſt day of the week, and to laſt but from Morning till the Evening, making the Night-part to be no part of the weekly-Sabbath, and as having no place in the ſpiritual Reſt of the Goſpel to be expreſſed on this day, (the Firſt day, he ſpeaks of) nor to be any thing diſtinguiſhed from the Night of other Days of the week! So writes a Learned Man. Thus we have a kind of half Holy-day ſet up by a Man in the room of an whole Seventh-days-weekly-Sabbath, Created and Inſtituted by <hi>Jehovah Aelohim.</hi> But, what part of Time ſhall we reckon that Night-time to? It muſt belong either to Working-day, or Sabbath-day? If to Sabbath-day-time, then it is a part of the time of a Sabbath-day: If to Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-day-time, then we have more time than Six Working-days in one Week, which is contrary to Scripture-revelation, and to Created Nature. For, the Evening is as Natural to the Created Days as the Morning. The Creator Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did ſome of his works in the Night. As <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> Particularly, He created Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the beginning of the Evening of the one Day, in the firſt Week of the created World, and the night-part of every one of the Large days: and it is the Commendation of a <hi>Virtuoſa-</hi>Woman, that, <note n="p" place="margin">Prov. 31. 15, 18.</note> ſhe and her Houſhold do work ſome part of the Night; Whereas we are expreſly forbid to do any Work of our particular Functions on the Seventh-day-Sabbath: all that kind of work is ſuppoſed to be done on the ſix foregoing days of the Week: and I have before ſhewed, <note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 110. to <hi>pag.</hi> 120. of this treatiſe.</note> that, the Night-part, as well as the Day-part belongs to the Weekly Sabbath-day. And how doth this Aſſertion of that learned Man agree with another Affirmation of his, ſo often repeated in that Book of his, that, That part of Time, that is and will be accepted with God, is declared and determined in the Fourth Commandment to be the ſeventh part of it, or one day in ſeven! If ſo, Then how can this Learned Man and his Followers in This, well groundedly expect Acceptance with God; When the ſeventh-part of Time is not obſerved, as the Weekly-Sabbath; but one half of that Seventh part is cut off by him: quite contrary unto what God has declared and determined in the Fourth Commandment! This incoherence and inconſiſtence doth bewray the Darkneſs and doubtfulneſs that is upon the Minds and Hearts of the moſt Learned Oppoſers of the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. What will become of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Laws and Preſcriptions, if Men take ſuch an Unwarranted Liberty, at one blow to cut off the half of the Weekly-Sabbath, contrary to the LORD's Appointments, and contrary too, unto their own Conceſſions and Aſſertions, eſpecially alſo, when on this piece of a pretended Sabbath they give ſuch a Looſe to carnal Hearts, as to leave any to be a Rule unto themſelves for their words, works, and actions upon this half part of a day of Reſt? as if all others were Men of a Legal Spirit, and were Judaizing Sabbatizers, that will be exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture-rules of the good old way in theſe Matters: Who ſees not what an Unſcriptural liberty even good men will be too prone to allow themſelves, if once they apprehend, that, this is referred unto themſelves to judg Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately of? <note n="r" place="margin">Iſai. 56. 1. 8. &amp; 58. 12, 13, 14.

Judged by the Word? Here again, My heart would be at work in ſweet thoughts, and in raiſed affections towards a dear Redeemer, who has done and ſuffered ſo much for his unworthy Creature, that, my Heart and Head and Hand may ceaſe a while from giving anſwering Solutions to Fallacious arguings. O how full, how ſutable, a good is here! Thou who readeſt this, canſt thou truly ſay, this Redeemer is my Redeemer; this Mediator hath loved me, and hath given himſelf for me? Redemption is wrought out and finiſhed by Chriſt for me! He will perfect it in me as well as for me! All the juſt demands of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are fully ſatisfied by the Son of His love! In the vertue of his Satisfaction and Interceſſion I will go to the Father and expect Audience and Aſſiſtance, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and a Bleſſing O how well will it go with them and with their Cauſe, who have Chriſt for their Advocate? How ſure is that Covenant of Grace, which hath Chriſt for the Surety!</p>
            <p>The Reader now may expect, that, I ſay ſomething to that part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which doth ſuppoſe the work of Redemption to have been finiſhed on the day of Chriſt's Reſurrection. So that, He being then Gloriouſly Manifeſted to have Reſted from it, the Objectors think, that Chriſt might have good cauſe to Honour the Firſt day of the Week above any other day, as the Weekly-Sabbath-day.</p>
            <p>Here is Mens Thinking and Reaſoning, but the ſerious Inquirer doth look for Chriſt's Inſtituting and Commanding, which he can never find in the Word, as to the Firſt-days being the Weekly Sabbath-day. Redemption in the whole and in all and every of the parts of it, and in all and every of the Fruits and effects of it, I beleivingly confeſs, praiſe, and apply, according to thoſe growing meaſures of Scripture light, and of ſaving Graces, which the LORD hath graciouſly given me therein about this.

            <p>The adverſary being driven out of this hold, ſeeks refuge for his Firſt day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in ſome other Scriptures, cited in the <note n="x" place="margin">John 20. 19. 26. Luke 24. 13-36. Acts 20. 7. 1. Cor. 16. 2.</note> Margin, (which yet will not allow him Countenance and Warrant.) For, ſay they, the good Apoſtles met on the Firſt day, the day of Chriſts Reſurrection, which they then obſerved as the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Sabbath-day, in memory of his Reſurrection, and of his compleating the works of Redemption on that day; Chriſt taught the two Diſciples on that day of his Riſing, on the ſame day he appeared to the Diſciples, and inſtructed them, and did eat with them, thus aſſembled, and Bleſſed them! The next Firſt day of the week he choſe to appear to them again: And thoſe Apoſtles Chriſt did Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as his principal Church Miniſters to teach the Churches all his Doctrine, and to deliver them all his Commands and orders, and ſo to ſettle and guide the firſt Churches: Which Apoſtles did actually ſeparate and appoint the Firſt day of the week for Holy Worſhip eſpecially in Church-aſſemblies; They themſelves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently meeting upon that day, for that end; and enjoyning the Churches of their Plantation ſo to do, who obeyed them in this: The Firſt day is mentioned as the day of the Diſciples aſſembling to break Bread (which though they did it oft: on other daies, yet no day elſe was peculiarly appointed for it.) Diſciples and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers at Chriſtian-aſſemblies were not to come empty on the firſt day of the week, but were on that day to depoſite what they brought in to the Treaſury of the Church. And this has been the practice of all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, ſince the Apoſtles daies: For which there is the Evidence of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſtory in this matter of Fact, into which Humane Authority this muſt be reſolved: For this evidence of this Churches Vniverſal conſtant uſage is a full and ſufficient proof of the matter of Fact: That, the Firſt day was ſet apart by the Apoſtles for Holy worſhip, eſpecially in the publick Church aſſemblies. They that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Validity of this Hiſtorical evidence do by conſequence betray the Chriſtian Faith, or give away or deny the neceſſary means of proving the truth of it, and of many great particulars of Religion; For, without this Hiſtorical evidence we cannot make good the Authority of any one ſingle verſe or text of Scripture, which we ſhall alledg, becauſe, we are not certain of that particular Text, (or words) whether it have been altered or added, or corrupted by the Fraud of the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, or the partiality of ſome Chriſtians; or the overſight of Scribes, &amp;c. thus theſe objecters. <note n="y" place="margin">1.

Which ſhall be done by a ſtrict examination of the two Comprehenſive particulars, more eſpecially, whether the Scriptures alledged be truly Tranſlated, and rightly Interpreted, and meetly applyed, as to the preſent Caſe in hand, either for matter of Fact, or for matter of Right?

            <p>As for thoſe expreſſions in our laſt Engliſh Tranſlation, of the Firſt day of the week, in the places cited, I have ſhewn before, that, the words in the propriety of ſpeech according to the truth of Grammar-etymology in their proper ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy and regimen of ſyntax, are, one of the Sabbaths, the Notation of which Phraſe in its plain meaning exactly agreeing with the real Nature of the thing punctually ſet out by it, it has been diſcovered and proved, that, <note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 28. 1. Mar. 16. 2. Luk. 24. 1. John. 20. 1, 19.</note> as to thoſe places in the Evangeliſts, it was one of the Paſchal Sabbaths, which doth ſpeak nothing as to any ſubſtituting of the Firſt day of the week in the room of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day as the Weekly Sabbath now, which is the pretence of our Oppoſers: As neither do the other Scriptures cited where that Expreſſion is uſed, once in the <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 20. 7. 1. Corin. 16. 2.</note> Acts of the Apoſtles, and another time in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians; for one of the Sabbaths.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50938:26"/>
there is expreſs mention made both of the feaſt of unleavened Bread, which was the Paſſover-Feaſt, in the verſe immediately going before the place cited; and alſo of Pentecoſt in nine verſes after relating to that ſeaſon in the ſame year; within the compaſs of which two Feaſts incluſively, were ſeven Sabbaths, upon one of which that meeting was of <hi>Paul</hi> with the Diſciples: Which doth hold forth a clear Truth, contrary to what it is alledged for. As for what <hi>Paul</hi> did more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Sabbath day was over, at the going in of the Sun, when another day came on, which was meerly occaſional, he being in a preparedneſs to depart on the next day after the Sabbath: Such as <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 20. 7-12.</note> his continuing of his ſpeech till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, his raiſing up <hi>Eutychus,</hi> his eating of Brèad, his talking with them a long while, even till break of day, then departing: So long Preaching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference all the Night long is not to be enforced as a neceſſary Sabbath-duty, the Scriptures no where ſo enjoyning it, and if this objector would aſſert it, ſo far at leaſt as till the midnight, (according to his account of an whole day in <hi>England</hi> from midnight to midnight, which I have ſhewn in this treatiſe to be no right reckoning, but contrary to the word of truth:) Let him and the other learned man whom I anſwered but a little before, who ſhuts out the night-part from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any part of the weekly-Sabbath-day, let them I ſay, if they can find no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter work for their time, contend about that matter. This Night-part belonging to the after day-part, as making up the whole next day after the Sabbath, was not obſerved by <hi>Paul</hi> as the weekly-Sabbath: for you may <note n="d" place="margin">Acts. 20 13, 14.</note> there Read how ſome of the Diſciples went before to ſhip, and ſayled to <hi>Aſſos,</hi> there intending to take in <hi>Paul:</hi> For, ſo had he appointed, minding himſelf to go afoot: And when he met with them at <hi>Aſſos</hi> they took him in, and came to <hi>Mytilene:</hi> this was no Weekly-Sabbath-work, no neceſſity nor mercy enforcing or warranting them thereunto. As for the breaking of Bread, whether that expreſſed in the ſeventh, or the other in the eleventh verſe, if it were admitted to be uſed in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and participation of the LORD's Supper, yet this objector himſelf doth affirm, that it was often done by Apoſtles and Diſciples on other daies of the week than on that which he ſo earneſtly contends for: And whereas he doth aſſert that no day elſe but only the Firſt day of the Week was peculiarly appointed for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread in that ordinance: Whither ſhall we go for a warrant and proof of this? We find no ſuch appointment by our LORD in the Scriptures; and the Objector cannot but acknowledg, that our LORD Jeſus Chriſt did inſtitute and adminiſter it at the firſt appointing and diſpenſing of that New-Teſtament or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the ſupper, on another day of the Week, than the firſt day: For, the Objector affirms elſewhere, that the paſſover day in that year was the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath: and <note n="e" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 23.-26.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſly ſay that it was the ſame Night in which he was betrayed; then it was, that, he took the Bread and the Cup in this LORDly Supper: And this did <hi>Paul</hi> receive from the LORD, and ſo did deliver it unto that Corinthian-Church of Saints, as that word-Rule by which they were to reform their abuſes which had crept in amongſt them, as to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance particularly, and according unto which they were exactly to meaſure all their Adminiſtrations. If this Objector do urge humane Authorities without Scripture-evidence, we ſhall ſhew the vanity and weakneſs, the incogency and unconvincingneſs of that empty Plea after a while. Reader exerciſe thy diſcerning here? Is there any thing in this place that ſpeaks at all of any change of the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Sabbath from the Seventh to the firſt day of the Week? do either the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the words or the intendment of the place, or the force of the context, or any neceſſary unavoidable conſequence, preſent any ſuch thing to an impartial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced underſtanding, which doth report a matter of fact done upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, not medling with any ſtate of this queſtion about this matter of Right. Has the Firſt day of the Week either the name of the Weekly Sabbath or the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſence of it? Is there any one word of Command found here requiring beleiving Chriſtians to obſerve the Firſt Day as the Weekly Sabbath? Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Promiſe made over to the weekly obſervers of it As ſuch? Is there any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning denounced here againſt the not-obſervers of it, As ſuch?

the Seventh daies being now any longer the Weekly-Sabbath-day? Can this Objector ſatisfie and eſtabliſh thee upon any firm ground, ſuch as is Scriptural, by any contrary arguing, wherein nothing of all this can befound?

               <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whence <hi>Paul</hi> came, was a Province in <hi>Graecia;</hi> There at <hi>Troas Paul</hi> ſtayed ſeven daies incluſively, in the fifth and ſix verſes of this twentyeth Chapter, ſpending a Seventh-day-Sabbath amongſt them, and then went away from them the next Week, in the Seventh and eleventh verſes, after the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath. The Objector therefore miſtaking the day to be the firſt day of the week, whereas, It was the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, all that which he doth wrongly build upon that miſtake, falleth to the Ground, together with that miſtake, This anſwer, drawn up from the true proper tranſlating of the words, one of the Sabbaths, I mainly ſtick to, as plain, convincing, and ſelf Evidencing, though I have elſewhere drawn up much more about it: We are not hurried away with noiſe and multitude: But that which ſwayes with us, and keeps our hearts in an aweſul fear, and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-joy, and believing eſtabliſhment, with ſweet ſatisfaction, nouriſhing delight, and great complacency, is the Word of the adored Almighties, clearly opened, well-agreeingly-collated, ſoundly underſtood, and rightly applyed: Chriſt and his word have their Authority with us, beyond any man or men whatſoever, or any or all of their ſayings to the contrary. His words do always beſt expreſs things, according to the true Nature of them in their own familiar ſenſe, which the Holy Spirit doth give of them in their reſpective places. The ſame Genuin ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy has this Phraſe in that paſſage to the <note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 2</note> Corinthians, where alſo it is, in true propriety of ſpeech, not the firſt day of the Week, but one of the Sabbaths, meaning according to the proper ſignificancy of the words, phraſe, and thing, either one of the Sabbaths between Paſſover and Pentecoſt incluſively, as in the former place; <note n="h" place="margin">i.

It is the confeſſion and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of an adverſary, as was Noted a few leafs before, that, about the time of the writing of the Books of the New-Teſtament, both the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and all the Heathen that took notice of them, called all their Feaſts and ſolemn aſſemblies, their Sabbaths: Becauſe, they did no ſervile work in them, they had the general Nature of the weekly Sabbath in a ceſſation from Labour. It is known and confeſſed, ſaith he, that at that time (when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Church at <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> which they ſuppoſe to be about twenty and nine years after Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven:) all Iudaical obſervation of daies, or the daies which they religiouſly obſerved, whether Feaſts or Faſts, Weekly, Monthly, or Annual, were by themſelves and all other called their Sabbaths. They were ſo called by God himſelf from their Analogy. Thus he. And this Firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians is reckoned by ſome to be ſent unto that Church about two and twenty years after Chriſts aſcenſion. So that to tranſlate the words, one of the Sabbaths is the moſt proper ſignificant Rendring, the moſt pertinent to the drift and Scope, and the moſt Harmonious in conſent with the whole Scripture

that treats of this matter: The believing Corinthians were to lay a way by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſomewhat of their income, proportionable to the LORD's proſpering of them in a way or Journey of their particular Trades, Functions, and callings: Thus, gathering ſome Treaſure, that, they might have in a readineſs, that which might afford a <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1, 2.

For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this that Firſt day was the next immediate day after his death, and could in no Senſe be called the Third day on which he roſe again: If he ſay, That the true Paſſover-day, which not Chriſt, but the Jews kept, was the day next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of Chriſt, we call for an Anſwer to the forecited Scriptures in the Margin, and expect a Word-proof for what he aſſerts: Although, if that could be cleared, yet has it no Rightneſs or Forcibleneſs of arguing in it to demonſtrate what it is brought for, as to a Firſt-day-Sabbath: But if thoſe Scriptures do, in ſo many expreſs Words, give the day of Chriſts being apprehended and condemned and crucified and killed the Firſt day of unleavened bread, and the Paſſover-day, whilſt we have the Scripture thus ſpeaking, we have no cauſe to be moved at what Humane Authorities and Church-Hiſtories do record to the contrary. And this has now brought me to an Examination of the validity or invalidity of Church-hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and of humane Authorities in theſe matters.</p>
            <p>Though ſeveral of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians have been examined by me upon this ſubject matter; and I have ſome Collections by me about it, enough to ſhew how little credit is to be given unto thoſe kind of Authorities, which are ſo fallible, and ſometimes ſo ſelf-contradicting, and ſo altogether unſatisfying, when the matter of Right comes to be Inquired after, and determined, any further than they do ſpeak the mind of Chriſt in his word (For, either in theſe Caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they write and ſpeak according to the word, or not? If they do, let theſe Scriptures be particularly pointed to, with which they accord. If not, they are not to be received or followed.) Yet, in regard, that, my deſign is to bring all to the Scriptures of truth, referring this and all elſe under <hi>Aelohim</hi> to their Judgment, I ſhall therefore now debate the Principle with this objector. <note n="m" place="margin">John 20. two laſt ver.</note> So much of matters of fact, as do relate to matters of right, and as are neceſſary for us to believe in order unto Salvation, is Recorded in the word of truth: Whereunto the whole Scripture is profitable; which is enough for us, if no more were written by me, concerning this particular queſtion in hand: For, that Scripture referred to, is proper and pertinent to this purpoſe, about Chriſt and his Reſurrection, and his appearing to his Diſciples, and his Bleſſing of them, and conference with them, as is plain, in the foregoing part of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and other Scriptures collated and compared with this, do evidently ſpeak it. But, we have yet much more to ſay about this. To aſſert the perfection of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50938:29"/>
the Scriptures, is one of the great truths of the preſent Age: The forces of Earth and of Hell are now joyning together and putting forth their ſtrength to aſſault and to attempt the overthrow of this uſeful Doctrine: As it was in the daies of Chriſts Fleſh, when he was familiarly Converſant here on Earth, the <hi>Roman</hi> Power the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wiſdom the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Traditions, <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoſophers, and <hi>Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> poſſeſſions, all the humane and deviliſh Force and Art and invention was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together to War againſt Chriſt and againſt his word. So in the latter daies; the Worldly might, Old and New Philoſophy, Inſtitutions and Impoſitions, Hiſtories and Traditions, Inventions and Authorities of men, unwritten (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended neceſſary) verities, Generall Councils, ſayings of thoſe whom they call <hi>Fathers,</hi> Articles of Faith compoſed by men, Confeſſions and practiſe of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reformed Churches, the judgment and practice of Learned and Godly men, theſe and ſuch like Extra-ſcriptural places, are the ſwaying Authority with many whereby Antichriſtianiſm and Antiſcripturaliſm in a many of particulars are ſtill held up and maintained againſt the LORD and againſt his word, <note n="n" place="margin">Iſai. 40. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> who in this Providential day is pouring contempt upon all Fleſh, upon men and upon their ſayings, bringing a Blaſt upon them (ſo far as they are contrary to ſound Doctrine, and do oppoſe the mind of Chriſts Revealed in the written word:) and is putting a Crown on Chriſt, and an Honour upon his word. the Teſtimony of men may be, and often is, in Fact, Erring and Fallible, uncertain and lying, ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and unſatisfying. Into which therefore the Chriſtian Doctrine Faith and Religion is not to be reſolved; either in whole or in part: For, the word of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is like himſelf, who is the Author of it, of invaluable veracity; and of unchangeable truthfulneſs. <note n="o" place="margin">John. 14. 6. &amp; 17. 17.

The aſſerters of the Seventh day to be the Weekly Sabbath (for which we have the whole Scripture) are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Errour, becauſe we will not be reſolved by humane Authorities to own the Firſt day in the Room of it: Whereas, if men do err, greatly err, it is <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 22. 29.

And how few are there of thoſe, to whom the Goſpel is preached, and upon whoſe Hearts that word of Grace and of Truth doth take moſt ſaving holds (to which word the LORD himſelf doth bear witneſs) are verſed and read in this kind of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory? And which way ſhall they be aſcertained, that, it has been all of it read over by others, by their Guides and teachers particularly, or that the report is faithfully brought to them, or if that were, whether they ought to be ſwayed by it? Were Church-Hiſtories unerringly inſpired? Who is ſo bold, as downright to aſſert this? Or if any were ſo daring, how can he prove it? Who of our plain Converted People had humane Hiſtories in his thoughts when he was thorowly Regenerated and gratiouſly viſited from Chriſt, and from the Father of Chriſt by the Spirit of Chriſt in the word of Chriſt? What a kind of Faith is that, which doth ultimate it ſelf into humane Church Hiſtories? He, that would have judged of the ſtate and Caſe of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Church and people in the daies of <note n="r" place="margin">Ezra. 4. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Ezra</hi> by making ſearch in the book of thoſe Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and have judged according to what was Hiſtorifyed there, would have brought in an hard Charge of Rebellion and of Sedition againſt them, and have been
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50938:29"/>
ready to have irritated the powers that were over them againſt them, as their Adverſaries did: Neither do men therefore err, becauſe they know not the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Elders, which has long obtained by common Cuſtom, and by little Controlled uſage, ſo as to plead preſcription. <note n="s" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 18, 19. Galat. 1. 4, 14.

He, who is of a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obſerving inquiring Spirit, and is verſed in this kind of the Hiſtorical part of human learning in Eccleſiaſtical Centuriators, may meet with enough to take him off from doting on ſuch fallible Authorities, which are not a ſure ground of judging in matters either of Doctrine or of Fact.</p>
            <p>In the matter of Doctrine, how common is it for one to affirm what another of them doth contradict, as about the Millennium, or the Thouſand years Reign, with many more inſtances that might be given, as about Free Grace and about Free will, about <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> about the viſion of God whether the Souls of departed Saints be Bleſſed with it till the Judgment of the great day, or not? with ſuch like. Which of thoſe now ſhall carry away the ſtate of the queſtion? In ſome Caſes, the Major party often went the wrong way as in the Rites and Ceremonies of Baptiſm and of Prayer, and in many Feaſts and Faſts, and divers ſuch humane inventions, by which they added their own corrupt mixtures to Chriſts Pure inſtitutions. As for the Churches in the firſt centuries after the Apoſtles, how ſhall we be aſcertained, that, they were the moſt pure and perfect Churches, ſeeing ſome of thoſe that were of Apoſtolical plantation did ſo apoſtatize, make ſuch a ſudden defection from the Goſpel-purity, and were ſo much corrupted in the Apoſtles own times, as thoſe particularly <note n="t" place="margin">1.

Were there no learned and Godly men, ſuch as were counted Fathers in the Churches, from whom we receive no Writings at all? May not ſome of their Writings have been loſt? Are there not falſe copies of the writings of ſome of them? Are they not ſuppoſititious and counterfeit and corrupt? Do they not vary widely in their Interpretations of one and the ſame Scripture? How can theſe uncertainties be a firm Ground and ſure evidence of the Authenticall meaning of the word of God?</p>
            <p>How unconcluding and unſatisfying alſo is their Teſtimony; in the matters of fact, when one of equal Antientneſs, and Authority doth gainſay another, or when ſome greater Authorities as ſome of them were eſteemed, would ſtep in &amp; over rule, and when they charge one another with miſreports and miſtakes, how Sandy a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is there here for any Spiritual diſcerner to build upon; take one or two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſome in the Hiſtory of Chriſts life do expreſly Record, that, he was near Fifty years old when he was put to death, whereas others of them in their Chronologies do with equal confidence write, that he was then but about thirty and three years of age.

Sound ſincere beleivers do often Experience, that, <hi>Jehovah</hi> through his Commandments doth make them wiſer than their Enemies, they have more underſtanding than all their teachers, becauſe they Love his Law, and make his Teſtimonies their meditation: The LORD Chriſt has declared againſt thoſe (be they otherwiſe of never ſo great a Name; and in never ſo much reputation amongſt men) who diſſolve one of the leaſt of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in the Law of his Ten words, and do teach men ſo: And how much is it to be lamented, that any of the teachers of others, have their hands ſo deep in this Treſpaſs, as to preach or to print any thing againſt this Glorious perfect Law, and the great Honourable things thereof! God is making the wiſdom of the wiſe to periſh, &amp; bringing to nought the underſtanding of the intelligent, when it doth oppoſe Chriſt and his word and Law, Whilſt precepts of men are taught the People, by their civil and Church-Guides, and are made the rule of fearing and of Serving <hi>Jehovah,</hi> he will proceed to deal Wonderfully with ſuch a people and marvellouſly: For, the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of their men of underſtanding ſhall hide it ſelf, though they hide their Counſels never ſo deep. Where is the wiſe, where is the Scribe? Where is the Inquirer of this Age? Hath not God made Fooliſh the wiſdom of this world, which doth meaſure and judge of the truths and things of God by unſcriptural Rules? How do ſuch Arguers ſay then, we are wiſe, and the Law of <hi>Jehovah</hi> is with us? Lo, certainly, in vain worketh the falſe pen of the Scribes: There will be a time, when ſuch wiſe men will be aſhamed, affrighted and taken: Behold they have rejected the word of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Wiſdom-what to them?

becauſe they know not the doubtful Queſtionings of unſettled Sceptick's and of Coſmical Suſpecters. The Doctrine of Probabilities: (So the word ſignifies in that place to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> cited in the margin:) is a miſleading Doctrine: It would beguil men by doubtful diſputations and by deceitful concluſions with ſuch cunning perſwaſions as do carry a fair ſhew; ſuch as Logicians and Rhetoricians, Philoſophers and Orators, do uſually bring, under the ſhadowie colour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reaſons and likely Arguments, to make nothing of all things and any thing of every thing, by their ſophiſtical <hi>Quidlibets,</hi> and Fallacious <hi>Quodlibets:</hi> But Sound, ſerious, well diſcerning, right Judging beleivers ſhould not ſuffer themſelves thus to be impoſed upon and deluded. A thorow, wholeſome Scripture-knowledge is one approved remedy againſt Heart-doubtings, either to prevent them or to cure them: This would bring in ſound Truth upon and leave them with a renewed Heart; with a no-doubt there of them. God cannot lye at any time, though men do ſo too often. He is true: Whilſt men are ſo overcome of doubtings and waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, (not in the way, which is ſometimes the caſe of ſound Beleivers, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the way) how can they go on with ſuch conviction and comfort, with ſuch ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction? Let not the Reader misjudge this a Diverſion and that too long a one alſo: For, beſides that, it contains a direct anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which did call for it, ſo doth it fully promote the grand deſigne of this Treatiſe. All unſcriptural, Antiſcriptural waies, methods, arguings, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavourings to turn any from the Errour of their way to the Truth, is no adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted means for the attaining of this end. And therefore in the Demonſtrating proofs that I have brought for the confirming and eſtabliſhing of the Seventh day, the laſt day of the Week, to be ſtill the weekly Sabbath, they are ſuch as are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the whole Scripture and have their Foundation in pure primitive cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Nature: I do not ſend and refer them to humane Authorities, and Hiſtories, and Traditions, as this Objector doth. The Scripture-way is the only convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing converting way: Other <hi>Mediums</hi> by ſelf-excogitated and man-invented Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices are like to leave Erring men but the more profound <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Infidels,</hi> and the more ſubtil <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Though arguments, as to men, may be drawn from their own Conceſſions, aſſertions, hiſtories, and other Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mens ſayings, writings, and printings, which was ſomewhat of the way that <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes took with Ethnicks and Philoſophers, whereby to ſtop their Mouths, and to convince them from thence; As Chriſt alſo will one day by the ſame Medium condemn many from their own acknowledged principles not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, yet this will not convincingly convert a plain ſound believer having Spiritual diſcerning in the truths and things of the Spirit of God, and being well acquainted with the Scriptures, is far better ſecured againſt dangerous dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Errours than the moſt learned of vain affecters of humane wiſdom. The only ſummary of all ſound truth, for the confuting and condemning of all Errour, is to be ſearched after in the Scriptures of truth, where the Reſtauration, Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and advancement, of all uſeful learning is. When can a ſerious inquiring Spirit come to any firm ſettlement and ſound ſatisfaction, if he were to refer all to the extraſcriptural Judgment and Hiſtories, of Churches? Hereſies and Schiſms, profaneneſses and diſorders, quickly crept in, into particular Churches that were of Apoſtolical plantation: As <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles to them do evidently declare. And ſince that, one particular Church doth ſometimes contradict another particular Church in their confeſſions of Faith; and the contention is ſo hot and ſo high, as that, they withdraw from one another, and will not have mutual Communion with each other. As for the univerſal Church how ſhall a particular beleiver be well groundedly aſcertained, what is the concurrent Judgement of the Univerſal Church? How fruitleſs and vain have their attempts hitherto been who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by conference, and Writing, and Coſt, and Labour and Pains, and Travel, to be Church-Reconciliators, Church-peace-makers? They dyed away, and never lived to ſee their deſigne accompliſhed. Still there are differences and diviſions kept up amongſt the Churches, one great cauſe whereof has been, that, the Attempters and promoters of Church-union and peace have been ſetting up ſome confeſſion of Faith, and Articles of Religion, of humane Compoſure, which they would have all to joyn in and ſubſcribe to: Which courſe will never be

able to accompliſh that deſigne. The whole Scripture of Truth is the one and the only rule of this. Suppoſe yet further, that, I knew, that, the Concurrent Judgment of all the Churches of Chriſt all the inhabited Earth over were of one mind and of one way in ſome things, yet neither could this alone, or mainly; ſecure me from fears of Erring.

(The difference between them being only in the divers form, and manner of diſpenſing, as will be more ſhewn hereafter.) The regulation now is to be made according to that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the new Adminiſtration doth call for, and the old Rules muſt be new applyed; which as to the matter now here under Queſtion have a clearer Revelation, and a more ſpiritual Diſpenſing. So that the New Teſtament Word is much the Old Teſtament Scripture gone over again, in more clearneſs, fulneſs, perfection, ſpirituality, glory and heavenlineſs. The Old and the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-Will of God, are not contrary Wills, but one and the ſame Will, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified only in ſome particulars of the manner of adminiſtring: the new Will is the old Will revived, and cleared, and confirmed, and ſo put into a more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly form. There is a well meaſured equality between the Old and the New, a well agreeing ſameneſs of word, and there ſhould be a true proportioned collation of both Teſtaments each with other. All and every of Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions had ever a word of his to warrant them: even in the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, a word written about ſuch Inſtitutions in the Old Teſtament in Type, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, or ſome ſuch like way: and a Word ſpoken by Chriſt before the New Teſtament was written, referring to the foregoing Patterns of them in the Old, which word afterwards alſo was put into the New Teſtament Scripture: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we know no word from Chriſt, either in the Old Teſtament or New, for the firſt day being a weekly day, ſeparated and appointed for a day of Holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the room of the Seventh day Sabbath. Thus far this Author himſelf
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50938:35"/>
doth acknowledge, that the firſt day was not inſtituted by Scripture, all the Old Teſtament through; which did not contain its Inſtitution; ſo that the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of that age in Chriſt's time, had no written word at for any ſuch obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the firſt day, any where all their Bible through. Let this conceſſion be improved by the wiſe and diſcerning, the ſerious and the conſidering Reader. However therefore the matter of fact may have been afterwards reported in Humane Hiſtories, we expect, that the matter of Right be proved from God-inſpired Scriptures. Whatever this Author do ſay, that this being the common uſage of ſo obſerving the firſt day in the Apoſtles times, by them and by the Churches of their Plantation, and that therefore there was no ſuch need of putting this pretended matter of fact into Scripture Hiſtory; it appears hereby, how bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Reed of his Aſſertion is, which he would have all the Chriſtian World to lean upon. After ſeveral years ſerious, diligent ſearch, I cannot find any ſuch common uſage, no not ſo much as one particular inſtance, that either any one of the Apoſtles themſelves, or any one of the Churches of their planting did ever ſo much as once ſo obſerve the firſt day, as the weekly Sabbath-day: Although if that could be proved, it doth not yet determine this caſe upon our hearts, who do expect Scripture Inſtitutions, Commands, Prophecies, Promiſes, and ſuch like appointments, as have harmonious conſent of the whole Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that ſpeaks of that matter, if there had been any ſuch great change of the weekly Sabbath-day, as is pretended. If the force of this Authors arguing do lye there, how evident is it, that there was great need of writing ſuch a Matter of Fact, that had ſo weighty a caſe of ſo great conſequence in it! <note n="g" place="margin">Jer. 33 6-15.

The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation hath foretold, that all the World would go a whoring after the Beaſt, and would worſhip the Beaſt and the Dragon that gave him power; yet are theſe ſome of their Notes of a viſible Church, Antiquity and Univerſality: which that they might be the ſooner impoſed upon, the hoodwinck'd credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous World, have another vain pretence going along with them, altogether as unſcriptural and vain, as they; that is, that the Church cannot err. And they falſly call their particular Romiſh Synagogue, the Catholick Church. I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly believe, and hopingly wait for a coming day, when our plain, tender, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, upright-hearted people will be undeceived, and no longer to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deluded and impoſed upon by ſuch confident Aſſertions as this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector doth bring them: As if that, which beyond all doubt muſt aſſure them, that <hi>de facto,</hi> the firſt day was by the Apoſtles ſeparated for holy Worſhip, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in publick Church Aſſemblies, is the full and unqueſtionable expoſitory e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the practice of all the Churches in the World, ſince the very days of the Apoſtles. For ſo has this Learned Author affirmed. Reader, bethink thy ſelf, what thy Faith muſt reſolve it ſelf into, if it will follow this miſguiding? How can ſuch believers as never traded in this kind of humane Learning ever

come to undoubted aſſurance about the matter?

Or, if it were poſſible and facible, that they could compaſs this (of which I can ſee no end; who yet have more helps and advantages this way than the moſt) How can they unqueſſionably be confirmed in this perſwaſion, that there never was any one Church of Chriſt that did eſcape the Humane Church-Record and Hiſtory? And if ſo, who can tell them, but that, that particular Church might be of a different judgement and practice? What doth this kind of arguing in this Author mean? What? would it have our people, to reſolve their ſatisfaction and aſſurance (concerning the pretended firſt day Sabbath) into that report which their humane fallible Guides do make unto them of this, without their tryal of it? <note n="i" place="margin">1 John 4 1-6. 1 Theſſ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

What a kind of Faith is that, which is a truſting of fallible men without tryal? a depending upon Humane Authorities without Scripture Evidence? The God-inſpired Authority of Chriſt, and of his Word, is fully atteſted within the holy Scriptures own bounds, and needs not ſtep out to Humane Hiſtories, Authorities and Traditions: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Author would buz into the ear ſuch amazing expreſſions as this, that it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe than as ſuch Humane Hiſtorie doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the practice of all the Churches ſince the times of the Apoſtles, and that this Teſtimony is infallible.</p>
            <p>Humane Hiſtory, and that part of it which they call Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, however it be a pleaſant ſtudy, and an employ ſomeways in its place profitable, yet of all kinds of Scientifick Learning, is one of the weakeſt common places of arguing, and the leaſt convincing for demonſtration, becauſe it doth reſolve its probations into the fallible Teſtimonies of lying men, and ſo doth not, cannot give any firm full ſatisfaction to an inquiring Spirit, and ſtudious Mind, who will ſtill be doubtful and afraid, how he doth bottom his Faith, in ſo weighty a caſe as is now before him, upon ſuch an unſure and unſafe ground, as he can build no firmneſs of belief and certainty of knowledge upon, even the uncertain witneſs of deceivable men, what their eyes, and ears, and tongues, and pens have reported to us, who are ſo many hundred years come into the World after they were dead and gone; that way of diſputing therefore, which this mighty man of Humane Reaſon has walked in to find out ſome place if he could, where to make his Firſt day Sabbath cauſe to ſtand, is ſuch a by-path as doth miſlead his Reader into bogs, where he cannot ſettle and ſtay with any good confidence, and ſound comfort, Such arguments may take with over credulous minds, and with paſſive intellects, who, through idleneſs and guile of ſpirit in a matter which would ingage them in ſo much of ſelf-denyal, and of croſs bearing, had rather uſe another man's writings and reaſonings, than be at the pains of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, and of exerciſing their own underſtanding.</p>

            <p>How can a change of the weekly Sabbath-day from one day to another, from the ſeventh to the firſt, be ſoundly proved from <note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 1. 10.</note> this other Scripture? where he, that is of a ſerious ſpirit, and doth diligently inquire after word-ſatisfaction about this matter, cannot find either <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Firſt day;</hi> either in terms plainly expreſſed, or clearly implyed, or neceſſarily inferred; in this place, or in the context, or in the deſign of the Holy Spirit here, or by comparing of it with other places of Scripture? Thoſe that would lay the foundation of ſo great a change, ſhould ſee their Scripture grounds to be more evident, convincing, and firm. What one Word is there in this Scripture, that doth warrant any new Inſtition from Chriſt, for the obſerving of the Firſt day, as the weekly Sabbath-day?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50938:36"/>
What one word is there here of command ſo to obſerve the Firſt day? What one word of Promiſe made to the obſervers of the Firſt day as ſuch? What one word of threatning againſt any that do not ſo obſerve the Firſt day, as the weekly Sabbath day? and if there be not any one word here, for the Firſt day, either as to Inſtitution or Command, or Promiſe, or Threating, how can any obſerver keep it aright, either in Faith or Obedience, in Hope or Fear? The direct plain meaning of this Scripture is, if I miſ-judge not, that this day doth evidently relate to that providential Day of the LORD Chriſt's appearing in the fulfilling of this Propheſie, who appeared to <hi>John</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Rev. 17. 14. &amp; 19. 16.</note> as LORD pleading the Cauſe of his Kingly Lordly Office, which has been too long, and too far invaded by the Kings and Lords of the Earth, who have not inforced Chriſt's Laws, nor made them to be the Rule of Government, but uſurped an unſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural authority over mens conſciences and ſouls.

As for the Day ſpoken of, which <hi>Jehovah</hi> made for his people to rejoyce in, it is the large Day of Grace under the New Teſtament Diſpenſation of Grace; which doth take in many a Natural Day: And <note n="d" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 16.

            <p>I muſt therefore return ſomewhat in anſwer unto this. It is much of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice in the preſent age, as in ſome other caſes, ſo concerning the matter under debate, to darken and obſcure ſome particular places of Scripture, either by corrupt Tranſlations, or by falſe Interpretations, upon which to ground their wrong Inferences, and conjectural conſequences; and then to perſwade the plain people how deep theſe things do lie: and how much they ſhould lean upon the Wiſdom and Advice of their Church Guides who much ſtudy humane Hiſtories for them, to lead them, through what? through thoſe dark Mazes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which theſe Guides have miſled them. Whereas, the Scriptures about the weekly Sabbath, are full of <note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 8. 8, 9. Deut. 27. 1, 8.</note> clear Light, and of ſatisfying ſelf-evidence, to thoſe who are made throughly willing to do the acceptable Will of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim.</hi> What conviction can there be brought in upon the underſtanding concerning any change of the weekly Sabbath-day, from the ſeventh to the firſt day of the week, where is not either expreſſed or implyed any thing at all of any ſuch change; and where the Reader cannot find the firſt day ſpoken of, or hinted to, to any ſuch purpoſe? The Paſſover is acknowledged by this Author, on this year of Chriſt's Death to be a Seventh-day Sabbath: If ſo, <note n="k" place="margin">Lev. 23. 11-16.</note> then including that day in the number of fifty, and ſeven Sabbaths reckoned and added to that day, <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> or the fiftieth day, was a Seventh-day Sabbath alſo; (for, ſo was the computation, ſeven times ſeven, being forty and nine) the Paſſover going before, and being put to the ſeven ſevennies, the laſt of thoſe ſeven Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days was the fiftieth day, and a Seventh day Sabbath. As in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting the Jubilee year, there were ſeven times ſeven years, which addeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do make up the number of forty nine years; which by reckoning of the former Jubilee year into the number, doth make up a fiftieth year; the laſt of thoſe ſeven ſevennies of years being the Jubilee year: For this honour did <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> put upon the number of ſeven in the Scriptures, with reſpect to divers of his Inſtitutions; the laſt day which was the ſeventh, being ſolemnly dignified, as in the weekly Sabbath, which is the laſt day in the week. And this, in the way, anſwereth that which ſome others do alledge for their firſt day; from ſuch Scriptures, which do ſpeak of an eighth day, and an eighth-days Sabbath, as a typical proof. As for that expreſſion, relating to the Feaſt of Booths or Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, that laſted ſeven days; now that on the <note n="l" place="margin">Lev. 23. 31, 36, 39.

But whatever it were, as to that; the Scripture proofs for the obſerving of the Seventh-day, the laſt day of the week, as the weekly Sabbath-day, are clear and full: For Objectors againſt this to pretend poſſibilities and probabilities of <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s declaring and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his mind about changing the day of the Sabbath, is a darkning of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in words without knowledge, and a going off from Scripture-Light, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural darkneſs: For the Seventh-day Sabbath we have evident expreſs commands and promiſes, to awe us, and to incourage us in the obſervation

Thus have I ſhewn, as to the former Objector, that his pretended Hiſtorical hints, both ſeverally, and apart by themſelves, do make nothing at all for his purpoſe about his firſt day. They prove not any ſuch uſage for the matter of Fact, as to the ſeparation of the firſt day, in the room of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, much leſs do they prove the matter of Right, which is the great thing here inquired after. And now if all of them be put together, and joyntly inforced, they ſpeak as little for this as each of them ſeverally, that is to ſay, not at all in favour of the firſt day, as a ſeparated day for holy Worſhip: but do either ſpeak of Feſtival Sabbaths of Paſſover, or the like, or of the Seventh-day Sabbaths; or of a Lordly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential day, which doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And were there an exact literal verſion, according to the true proper ſignificancy of the Words, I do not remember any one place all the New Teſtament through, where there is ſo much, as that particular expreſſion, of the Firſt day of the Week, much leſs as applyed unto a Day of Reſt, or ſolemn Worſhip, or weekly Sabbath.</p>

            <p>Having thus opened and applyed the Scriptures, that we might look the deeper, and ſee the clearer into the ſenſe and ſcope of it, I am next to ſhew, that the Day (to Day, or this Day) expreſſed in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and referred unto in the Epiſtle is not to be underſtood of the Firſt Day of the Week, in the weekly returns of it; ſo as to ſhut out all and every of the other Days of the Week, and particularly as to this of Reſt, excluding the Seventh day from being the weekly Sabbath for Chriſtians to obſerve under the New Teſtament Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace.</p>
            <p>Of this, I give theſe Reaſons, grounded upon Scripture, becauſe that Day, which is ſpoken of in that <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 95. 7. Heb. 3. 7 13, 15. &amp; 4. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and made uſe of in this Epiſtle, is ſuch a Day as doth take in <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> every Day in the Week; as the Author himſelf doth interpret, in the ſame Epiſtle, ſpeaking of the ſame Day, in this very eaſe and inſtance now under debate; where he puts the Chriſtian Hebrews upon the faithful diſcharge of that Goſpel-fellowſhip-duty of mutually exhorting one another daily, or according to every Day, as the Duty of every Day was, when they had occaſion and opportunity, ſo to do, whilſt it is called to Day, this Day, and the next, and ſtill the next after that, every Day; whilſt Grace is offered, and whilſt your time doth laſt; whilſt Chriſt's Voice from his Father doth ſpeak unto you; and whilſt the Spirit of Chriſt, in the Word and Miniſtry thereof, doth call upon you. That Hodiernal Day, of which the Holy Spirit doth make mention in this Exhortation, has its duration full home to this our Day, and it appertaineth no leſs unto us, than it did unto in <hi>David</hi>'s time. For the Illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conjunction Therefore, in the beginning of the ſeventh Verſe of the third Chapter doth properly belong, to Take heed, in the beginning of the twelfth Verſe; as went before, and ſo muſt be here underſtood: Therefore, as the holy Spirit exhorted your Fathers to obedience, under pain of excluſion from the Reſt of God, ſo ſee ye well unto it, that you yield obedience, leſt otherwiſe, you alſo be ſhut out of the ſame Holy, Heavenly Reſt.</p>

Theſe in <hi>David</hi>'s time had no Ground to expect to enjoy the Reſt of a pretended New day of Weekly Sabbath, under the New Teſtament Diſpenſation. It is therefore from Day to Day, in a continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Days.

            <p>As the Day is miſtaken by the Objector, ſo alſo is the Reſt. The Reſt ſpoken of in <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 3. 11, 18. &amp; 4. 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10.</note> this Epiſtle, brought thither out of <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 95. 11.</note> that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is not meant either there or here, of the Weekly-Sabbath-Reſt: As to the Firſt Day of the Week, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Seventh, let the following Arguments be exactly weighed in the Scripture ballance. One is becauſe the People in <hi>David</hi>'s time, were not bound to make out after the Firſt-Day-Reſt, not being under any obligation to keep the Firſt Day of the Week as their Weekly Day of Reſt or Sabbath: The Law of the Seventh-Day Sabbath was upon them, as was ſhewed but a few lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Further, The Reſt mentioned in both theſe places, in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and in this Epiſtle, was ſuch a Reſt as the people (to whom <hi>David</hi> and the Author of this Epiſtle did write this) had not as yet Then entred into; they were not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it whilſt they remained in a State of unbelief, neither ever would <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 4. 1, 11.</note> if they paſſed into the other World in that State of Unbelief, impenitence, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and unperſwadableneſs. What Reſt can then be named for the People of <hi>David</hi>'s Time, (as is proved in the fore cited place of this Epiſtle, in the Margin) to enter into, but only that Spiritual, Eternal Reſt of, with, and in <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> As for the Reſt of the Weekly-Sabbath, <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3. Heb. 4. 3, 4.</note> That was from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, when God Reſted from All His Works on the Seventh Day; and accordingly bleſſed and ſanctified that Particular Day, as the Day of the Weekly Sabbath. The <hi>Syriack</hi> and the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Languages do expreſs the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Day by the word Sabbath, in the fourth Verſe of this fourth Chapter. And this Reſt, at leaſt as to the outward part of it, was Entred upon by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>David</hi>'s time, and <note n="i" place="margin">Exod. 16. 22-30. &amp; 20. 8-11.</note> by their Forefathers long before.</p>
            <p>The Reſt mentioned in the forecited places of this Epiſtle is ſuch a Reſt as he and others had a Probability, as well as Poſſibility, (though with difficulty and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs) to enter yet into, unleſs by their own unbelief and hardening of their Heart they did <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 4. 1-11.</note> fall ſhort of it. <hi>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s fear: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> He includes Himſelf; Whereas if the Firſt-day-reſt, pretended from hence to be the Chriſtians Weekly-Sabbath, had been the Reſt here meant, what difficulty or ſtudiouſneſs was there as to their entring upon this, ſo far at leaſt, as to the External Duty and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege? and eſpecially, as to the particular Caſe of the Author of this Epiſtle, and of other of the Believing among thoſe Hebrews in his Day, who are ſuppoſed by theſe Objecters, to have already entred upon the Firſt-Day-Reſt that is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; which Author ſo earneſtly exhorted the Hebrews to Enter upon the ſame Reſt? For we are to obſerve, that he joyneth himſelf with the Hebrews to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up himſelf as well as them unto an Holy Fear, leſt <note n="l" place="margin">Heb 4. 1, 11.</note> he and they otherwiſe fell ſhort of the Promiſed Reſt through want of due diligence, and through careleſs

negligence, though he himſelf reckon himſelf among the <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> Believers: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth his exhortation by this Argument amongſt others, in the fourteenth Verſe of the third Chapter, drawn from a very profitable effect of it, even from the conſortſhip, and ſociety, and fellowſhip, that ſuch will have with Chriſt in that heavenly inheritance; if they retain firm even unto the end, that beginning of confidence or ſubſiſtence; (<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As for any partakerſhip of Chriſt, in a way of conformity to him, with reſpect to the obſervation of weekly Sabbath-day, it could have no relation to the Firſt Day of the Week, which Day Chriſt obſerved not as a Sabbath, but through the whole of his life kept the Seventh day, as the weekly Sabbath-day.</p>
            <p>The great Deſign of this Epiſtle, (the ſame thing which doth run all the Scripture through, where occaſion is given and taken, to ſpeak of this matter) is to prove, that a ſtate of unbelief, lived, layn, and dyed in, will ſhut the guilty of it, out of the ſweet ſatisfying injoyment of the True, Spiritual, Eternal, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Reſt: For, to this particular purpoſe is it, that he fetcheth his proof out of that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> confirming what he had ſaid by the Teſtimony of <hi>David,</hi> ſhewing that the Pſaimiſt by that Reſt, could mean nothing elſe, and nothing leſs, but the Spiritual, Eternal, heavenly Reſt: there being no other Reſt left, out of which the unbelieving were threatned to be ſhut in that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> called ſo great a Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the third Verſe of the ſecond Chapter of this Epiſtle: The Reſt of the weekly Sabbath had been entred upon already; and as for the <hi>Canaan</hi> Reſt, that was ſome ages before <hi>David</hi>'s Time, <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 4. 8. Act. 7. 45.</note> entred upon and into, by the ſurviving Iſraelites, under the leading of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> or Jeſus; or, if you will, of <hi>Jeſhuang,</hi> or Jeſus by <hi>Joſhuah.</hi> Whereas, the Reſt promiſed here, in the firſt verſe of the fourth Chapter, was ſuch a Reſt, as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did not bring the Iſraelites into, in the eighth Verſe, though he led them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Type of it; as the cauſal conjunction doth evidently prove, which is an Anſwer to a tacit Objection, if any did ſay, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> had placed the Fathers in that Reſt. As for that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> Reſt, it was actually poſſeſt by <hi>David,</hi> and the Iſraelites of his Day: This Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called the Land of <hi>Immanuel, Iſai.</hi> 8. 8. that is of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a ſign of the Heavenly Inheritance obtained by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9, 11. The Reſt therefore, that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, muſt be a Reſt yet to come: (The other Reſts particularly mentioned having been already then entred into;) a Reſt, which they ſhould fear, they might be ſhut out from, a Reſt, not paſt, but yet to come.</p>
            <p>This Epiſtle ſpeaks of Believers entring into this promiſed Reſt, <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 4. 10.</note> after their working ſeaſon is at an end; appears by comparing ſome <note n="q" place="margin">Verſ. 1, 2, 3, 9. &amp; 11. <hi>with</hi> verſ. 10.</note> Verſes in this place together: at leaſt, as to the full poſſeſſion of that Reſt: If it ſhould be pleaded by the Objectors, from <note n="r" place="margin">Verſ. 3.

O how often may the Spirit of a Believer be in the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſt in one Day! He may get thither into this Reſt, in one Holy Thought: and how many of ſuch thoughts may his thoughts be, who thus doth act Faith, Hope and Love aright, upon this Object! A ſound Believer ſhould check himſelf under his divertiſements from this Felicity, Return, O my Soul, to thy-my-Reſts: My Reſts are thy Reſts; thy Reſts are my Reſts: Be friendly to me and to thy ſelf: Sit down and ſilently Reſt in <hi>Jehovah Aelohim!</hi> There is an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſubminiſtred to thee, to me, ſo to do!</p>

The ſeventy two Greek Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters do uſe the Verb in <note n="g" place="margin">Lev. 26. 35.</note> one Scripture, where it doth ſet out the reſt of the Land every ſeventh year: they uſe it alſo in <note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 16. 30.</note> another place, where it is applyed to the Seventh-day-Sabbath, that being the weekly Sabbatizing-day, or reſting-day. The Greek Noun in the proper ſignificancy of the Word, is an actual or active reſting or Ceſſation from work, or labour, or from motion about ſuch work, and labour as is reſted from, a Requietion, or Requieſcence from this; This being uſed in the Greek of the New Teſtament but once, the means to come to a right apprehenſion of the true ſignification and the proper meaning of it in this place, will be to examine, what the Original of this Greek Word is, in that Language from whence it is borrowed in the Old Teſtament Hebrew; and what that word in the Hebrew Original doth contain and expreſs in it; How that word is uſed in the Scriptures, from whence this Greek Noun hath its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,

as alſo, what there is in the Context of this place in this part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> about this matter enquired after? What there is in that Pſalm, referred to here in this Epiſtle, that may bring ſome light to this matter? And what there is in the Word of Chriſt about this Phraſe of Sabbath-keeping or keeping a Sabbath, as the Objector doth render it.</p>
            <p>It is not here unworthy of our noting, That, the Greek Tongue in a multitude of Words has its Origination from the Hebrew Language: Its Alphabet and Letters hath its derivation from hence. What is its <hi>Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta,</hi> but <hi>Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth?</hi> the power and force, the vertue and value in the ſound for the manner of pronunciation is much the ſame: and <note n="i" place="margin">

               </note> many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular words do in their very ſound declare, though in ſome things the Greek Tongue is defective, at leaſt as now it is in uſe: particularly in that it wants a Jod Conſonant, as alſo in that it has not an H in the middle or in the end of a word: which is the reaſon why we ſo ſeldom meet with the Word of Words, <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or <hi>Jah,</hi> or <hi>Ehieh,</hi> in the Greek of the New Teſtament, though the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations brought out of the Old into the New, have often the word <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>Jah</hi> expreſſed. The Original of this Greek word <hi>Sabbatiſmos,</hi> or Sabbatiſm, is from the Hebrew word <hi>Shabbaton,</hi> as the Greek <hi>Sabbaton</hi> is from the Hebrew <hi>Shabath:</hi> The ſound and the ſenſe going together do enough ſpeak this to every intelligent Man's Ear: Thus in <hi>Chaldee, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Arabick, Shebath</hi> is a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm. <hi>Shabbathon,</hi> or <hi>Shabbaton,</hi> which is the Original of that Greek word <hi>Sabbatiſmos,</hi> or Sabbatiſm, doth ſometimes ſet out the <note n="k" place="margin">Exod. 16. 23.</note> Seventh-day-Sabbath, or reſt; which Seventh day is expreſſed by this word, as one of its Names and Appellations by which it is called. <note n="l" place="margin">Levit. 23. 24.</note> Sometimes the firſt day of the ſeventh Moon is expreſſed by this word: <note n="m" place="margin">Levit. 25 4, 5.</note> at another time, the ſeventh year has that denomination: and <note n="n" place="margin">Lev. 16. 29, 31.</note> the day of explation alſo, on the tenth day of the ſeventh Moon is ſo ſtiled: The reaſon whereof is, that theſe days and years were obſerved as Sabbaths, when there was an Actual reſt, a ceſſation from Work and Labour.</p>
            <p>The Context in this place of this Epiſtle doth evidence that what is expreſſed by Sabbatiſm <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 4. 9. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This diſcourſe being grounded upon the ninty fifth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> it is obſervable, that the word uſed there, in the laſt verſe, is <hi>Menuchah,</hi> reſt, quietneſs, a quiet reſt, an acquieſcing from <hi>Nuach,</hi> he reſted, he was quiet, he was at reſt, he acquieſced. A place of quiet, and of quiet reſt, in that place of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is ſet out by that word <note n="r" place="margin">Numb. 14. &amp; Chron. 10. 33.</note> relating to a former paſſage in <hi>Moſes</hi> time: The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a place of quiet reſt, when peaceably poſſeſſed by the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> And it was a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Figure of the promiſed reſt and Sabbatiſm mentioned in this place of this Epiſtle: <note n="s" place="margin">Menuchah, Pſ. 95. 11.</note> Which word is applyed to ſeveral other things beſides the weekly Sabbath: <note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 12. 9.</note> As it is the word uſed, to ſet out the ſhadowy reſt in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi>

            <p>As for the phraſe of keeping Sabbath, the Scriptures do uſually add ſome other word unto Sabbath, whereby to denote that expreſſiveneſs; <note n="y" place="margin">Exod 20. 8. &amp; 31. 13, 16. Deut. 5, 12.</note> Such as, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a Sabbath-day; to this end of ſanctifying it: To ſanctifie a Sabbath, to keep Sabbaths, to do the Sabbath, and ſuch like. And ſome ſuch phraſes are applyed unto ſomewhat elſe, beſides the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath: As <note n="z" place="margin">Lev. 25. 2, 3, 4. &amp; 26. 44.</note> to Sabbatize a Sabbath; which was on the ſeventh year: thus to enjoy, or to accept, or to will Sabbaths, meaning the ſeventh years.</p>
            <p>The next particular, which I expreſſed, that I would diſcover is, that, <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 4. 10.</note> the, He, mentioned in one paſſage of this part of this Epiſtle, is meant of the Believer. The grounds why I ſo apprehend are as follow: Becauſe</p>

               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:50938:43"/>
The tenth Verſe of this fourth Chapter doth reſume that which was ſpoken of in the third Verſe: in both which there is expreſs mention made of the ſame reſt, and of the ſame perſons, in ſome of the ſame expreſſions, where believing ones are ſaid to enter into that reſt: The, He, is every ſuch He, as is believing, and all ſuch.</p>
            <p>The ninth Verſe is an inference from the ſixth Verſe, and it hath reſpect unto that: by a corollary he forceth the remainingneſs of a reſt to the people of God. Which reſt is defined in the tenth Verſe by Believers ceſſation from his works: and this Definition is Illuſtrated by a collation of the example of God, who then reſted when he ceaſed from his works. Seeing therefore, it remaineth ſome to enter into that reſt, there remaineth therefore a Sabbatiſm to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. It muſt evidently follow, that, ſeeing the unperſwadeable ones, to whom this was firſt Evangelized; (or to whom the Goſpel was firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) did not enter into the Typical reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> therefore there is a reſt yet ſtill behind, which the believing people of God have a promiſe of entring into, in the firſt Verſe: which is Typilied by that Prophetical word in the fifty ninth <hi>Pſalm:</hi> of which more in the next reaſon.</p>
            <p>The Sabbatiſm, or reſt ſpoken of, in the ninth and tenth Verſes of this fourth Chapter, is that which being Typified doth anſwer directly unto the Type there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: This Type in the eleventh Verſe of the nineth fifth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> was the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> which is called <note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 12. 9, 10. 1 Chron. 23. 25.</note> a reſt, out of which thoſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who were twenty years old and upward were ſhut, ſuch as were <note n="c" place="margin">Numb. 14. 24, 28, 29, 30. Heb. 3. 22. 19.</note> unbelieving, murmuring, and unperſwadeable, who revolted from <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> and in their heart returned back again into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Their evil heart of unbelief made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the living God: Thoſe of them who were believing as <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Numb. 14. 24. Deut. 1. 36. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua 14. 6, 7, 8. Numb. 32. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Caleb</hi> has a remark of He, put upon him, as the He, eminently, that had another Spirit with him, and that did fulfill after <hi>Jehovah</hi> Chriſt: and <note n="e" place="margin">Numb. 14. 30. &amp; 32. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was another ſuch He. Theſe and ſuch as theſe, did enter into that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying reſt; where, after they had driven out their Enemies, they enjoyed a peaceable reſt and a quiet ſafety. This Typical reſt in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> did not Figure out a firſt day weekly Sabbath reſt; into which day, as into a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day weekly, none of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> either unbelieving or believing did enter upon, as an <hi>Hebdomadal.</hi> Sabbath: But it did Typifie that reſt, in the better, the <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 11. 9. 16.</note> Heavenly Countrey; as is expreſſed in this ſame Epiſtle; into which none do enter but the believing: So that the, He, who entring into the reſt of God, in the tenth Verſe, is any one of the Believing people of God, for whom the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Sabbatiſm was ſaid to be remaining, in the words immediately foregoing, in the ninth Verſe; Which alſo the reaſon brought to prove the ſoundneſs of the inference doth ſhew: The Illative particle, therefore, and the comparative, like as, in the ſeventh Verſe of the third Chapter, relating to the twelfth Verſe of the ſame Chapter, doth ſhew the exhortation to be inforced upon the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, therefore as the Holy Spirit exhorteth you to believe and obey the Voice of Chriſt, ſo look to it, that you do believe and obey his Voice; The reaſon is ſtrong, from an example of old, becauſe your Fathers who contemned the Voice of Chriſt, and did not contemper the word with Faith, were fruſtrated of the Heavenly reſt: The reaſon of which conſequence, is, ſeeing there is the like reaſon of you and of them: For, both to you and them it was Evangelized; in the ſecond Verſe of the fourth Chapter. The whole drift of the Diſcourſe from the ſeventh Verſe of the third Chapter, to the eleventh Verſe of the fourth Chapter, doth reſpect a profeſſing people, that would paſs for the people of God, and be accounted Travellers towards the promiſed Heavenly reſt, which none but the believing perſwadeable obedient true ſpiritual Iſrael of God would enter into.</p>
            <p>The Sabbatiſm or reſt ſpoken of, in the firſt, third, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, verſes of this fourth Chapter, is a rest that remaineth; in the ſixth and ninth verſes of the ſame Chapter: A reſt that was before them, towards which they were travelling, and ſhort of which they ſhould fear, leſt they came by their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering behind; in the firſt Verſe; A reſt that in the time of the Authour of this Epiſtle, when he wrote this, was as to himſelf and the believing people of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50938:43"/>
God then alive, before them, and they were left behind it, as yet ſhort of it: Into which they were not as then ſo fully entred: but they were under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or expectation thereof: And the ſame may be ſaid of his believing people, who are now alive in the preſent day, whilſt it is called, to day: There is a promiſed reſt, which they ſhould have in their eye, which they are not as yet, ſo thorowly paſſed into; Of which that place in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> was a Typical predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The reſt here, is a reſt yet in the promiſe, yet to come and hoped for, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, enterable and enjoyable, if <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 4. 1, 9, 10, 11.</note> unperſwadeableneſs hinder not. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verſe doth again introduce and enforce the principal exhortation by way of rational inferehee, and by a doubled Argument: Therefore let us ſtudy to enter into that reſt, that, not any one ſall by the ſame example of diſobedience: If we believe and obey Chriſt's Voice we ſhall then enter into it, but if not, we ſhall be ſhut out from it; as thoſe were who died away in their unperſwadeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The whole Context, both in this place, and in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> doth evidently demonſtrate, that, the reſt here treated of, and foretold by <hi>David,</hi> is ſuch a reſt, as out of which the unbelieving, unperſwadeable, and diſobedient, living and dying ſuch, would be ſhut; and into which, the believing, perſwadeable, and obedient, ſuch a people of God ſhould enter; and none but ſuch: Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be ineant of a pretended firſt day of weekly reſt. For, if that had been the reſt, the believing had already actually entred, into, not only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but alſo the inward reſt: and even the unbelieving had actually entred into the outward part of that reſt; had they ſo far obſerved it as the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: Whereas the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in Type in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, had not entred ſo much as into the outward part of the Type of it: That is to ſay, not thoſe of them who were above twenty years of Age, when the Spies returned from ſearching the Land; All, except <hi>Joſhuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> died ſhort of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that were above that number of years, whether Believers or unbelievers.</p>
            <p>All the Promiſes, and the Threatnings, the Exhortations, and the Cautions, and ſuch like, that are made uſe of, in all <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 3. 7-19. &amp; 4. 1-11.</note> this Diſcourſe, do plainly relate to a proſeſſing people; according as they believe, or believe not, and ſo do enter, or not enter, into this reſt.</p>
            <p>As for what doth concern the parallel, wherein it doth not hold, and wherein it doth hold, I ſhall open now my thoughts.</p>
            <p>The Parallel here, is not between God the Father, as Creator, and his Son Chriſt as Redeemer: (though there are ſome others that would have it ſo:) For the LORD Jeſus himſelf, the Chriſt, the Mediator, was the Creator: (not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Father, nor the Holy Spirit:) As I have proved <note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 89. 90, 91, 92, 93.</note> before in this Treatiſe: and have here again put ſome of the Scriptures into the <note n="k" place="margin">John 1. 1, 2, 3, 10. &amp; 5. 17, 19. 1 Cor. 8. 6.

The Authour of this Epiſtle doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly prove and promote this great Truth, of Chriſt's <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſhip, or God-ſhip, by his Creator-ſhip as well as by other Arguments from Scripture. That God who is ſpoken of in the tenth verſe of this fourth Chapter of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is the ſame Chriſt, by whom the Father made the Worlds, the Ages: He was the LORD in the beginning, who laid the Foundation of the Earth and the works of whoſe hands the Heavens were: as is declared in the ſecond and tenth Verſes of the firſt Chapter; the ſame God who built all things, in the fourth verſe of the third Chapter: Which doth make way for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe, concerning his reſt, and entring, or not entring into it, as Chriſtian Profeſſors did believe and obey, or not; As this Objector himſelf doth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where confeſs, upon the tenth Verſe of the third Chapter: that, Chriſt is ſo brought in as God, and expreſly called God, to make way for this following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about works and reſt; The ſame God, whoſe voice from his Father, by his Spirit in his Word, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of Old, and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in this Authour's time were called upon to hearken unto, in the ſeventh, and fifteenth Verſes of that third Chapter.

            <p>Neither is the parallel between the Works of the Father, and the Works of the Son; as if they were ſuch different Works, of a different Nature, and of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Time: which was not the matter under debate, in the third and fourth Chapters of this Epiſtle (as men have divided them;) the which what was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before doth alſo diſcover; <note n="n" place="margin">John 5. 17, 19.</note> For, what things ſoever the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Nor is the parallel between one Day of the Week, and another Day of the Week, and the firſt Day of the Week, in the weehly Revolution. For the, <hi>to day,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the ſeventh Verſe, doth not point out the particular firſt Day of the Week; as diſtinct from the others Days of the ſame Week: As if the Exhortation did peculiarly, properly and openly, belong unto that; but it takes in the whole of our Day and Time, wherein the ſound of Chriſt's Voice comes unto us; ſpeaking by his Spirit in his Word from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every Day of the Week; as appears from the thirteenth Verſe of the third Chapter. So that thoſe expreſſions in the ſeventh and eighth Verſes of the fourth Chapter, which do ſpeak of a <hi>certain day, and of another day,</hi> do ſet out a large providential Day, a long time after the Iſraelites entring into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Reſt: The Reſt ſpoken of in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> could not refer to this; or the weekly Sabbath from the Worlds Creation; for theſe were before; whereas the Pſalmiſt doth ſpeak of a Reſt that was future, and yet to come; as to thoſe who were then alive: As likewiſe it was to the Author of this Epiſtle, and to the Believers in his Day and Time: It was remaining even then: A Reſt, a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm; which was not then by him, and thoſe to whom he wrote, fully entred into, poſſeſſed, and injoyed: Though Believers, ſo far as they had their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenſhip, their Burgeſhip, in Heaven and in the Spirit did converſe with the glorious Inhabitants of the New City, of that Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 12. 22, 23, 24. &amp; 4. 3, 9. Philip. 3. 20.</note> did paſs into ſomewhat of it, and had ſome views and foretaſts, ſome beginnings and firſt fruits of it.</p>
            <p>So that the parallel here, is between Reſt and Reſt: For as <hi>Jehovab Aelobim</hi> the Creator, having finiſhed his Works of the ſix foregoing Days in the firſt Week of the Created World, did Reſt on the Seventh-day Sabbath; and look, as the Iſraclites did Reſt in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> after their labour and travel, when they had peaceable, quiet poſſeſſion of that Land: So ſhall believers alſo, when they have done their <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 13. 22, 36.</note> Generation-work, and have finiſhed the <note n="q" place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> Work of their Day and Time, in doing and in ſuffering the whole Will of our LORD, have and injoyed a Reſt, a Sabbatiſm, which will be fully compleated in that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Heavenly Country.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo is the parallel, between entring, or not entring into the typical Reſt in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and entring, or not entring into that Reſt which was typified thereby: which was not a Firſt-Day Reſt, as is pretended; but the Heavenly, Eternal Reſt. This parallel is held forth in the eleventh, eighteenth and nineteenth Verſes of the third Chapter, and in the firſt, third, ſixth, tenth and eleventh Verſes of the fourth Chapter.</p>
            <p>And the parallel further holds, between Believers and Unbelievers, in the paſſage towards, or entrance, or not entrance into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Typical Reſt, according as they were perſwadable and obedient, or not: And Believers, or Unbelievers, ſince the time of that <hi>Pſalm</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50938:44"/>
(which I therefore mention becauſe it is the Foundation of the Diſcourſe in this place to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and particularly at the time, when the Author of this Epiſtle did write, wherein all Ages ſince, and thoſe after us are alſo concerned:) For, even theſe alſo, according as they are found perſwadable and obedient, or not, ſo ſhall they, either enter into, or come ſhort of, this typified promiſed Reſt. As it was in the Prophet <hi>David's</hi> time; the offer of Grace, as to the Promiſed Reſt was made to the Iſraelites (for this ſame Goſpel was publiſhed unto them under that Miniſtration of Grace, as unto us now, under the preſent Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Grace, in the ſecond and third Verſes of the fourth Chapter: The Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> being the Doctrine in <hi>David's</hi> time, and in <hi>Moſes</hi> Days, and long enough before him:) and thoſe of them, who were believing, obedient, and perſwadable; in the ſixth, and ſeventh, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Verſes of that <hi>Pſalm.</hi> So that there was in part a fulfilling of this in <hi>David's</hi> time, both as to the threatning part upon the unbelieving, impenitent and diſobedint, dying away ſuch; and as to the promiſing part, as to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, repenting, and obeying ones, who died <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 11. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> in the Faith: And therefore, it cannot be underſtood of the Firſt Day of the Week, in oppoſition to the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as is pretended: there being nothing at all of any ſuch obſervation of the Firſt Day in <hi>David's</hi> time: And the ſame Goſpel was publiſhed unto thoſe in the time of the Author of this Epiſtle, in the ſecond Verſe, of the fourth Chapter; even as unto the Iſraelites before: and it had a further fulfilling than in that Authors time, in the third Verſe of the fourth Chapter: and it ſtill has and will have, as the Exhortations do prevail; in the firſt, ſixth, ſeventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth Verſes of the third Chapter; and the firſt, third, eleventh, fourteenth and ſixteenth Verſes of the fourth Chapter.</p>
            <p>The Works that Believers are ſaid to Reſt from, in the tenth Verſe of the fourth Chapter, are according to Scripture-phraſe, and meaning <note n="s" place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> elſewhere, their labours. Believers ſhall Reſt from their labours; from the labours of their particular Functions and Callings, wherein they were exerciſed in their life time here: and as for their labour in the LORD, whilſt they were here, in which time they did abound in the Work of their LORD; as alſo for their labour of Love in all their ſuffering, as well as doing for Chriſt, Believers will have ſatisfaction and complacency, ſweetneſs and delight, in ſuch works as theſe are: though above, in the heavenly Reſt, they will be wholly for ever free from ſufferings; as alſo from all corrupt mixtures and defectiveneſſes, which were their ſorrow, grief and trouble here, which they much laboured under: where the Tempter ſhall no more aſſault them. There is a Reſt promiſed to Believers, evidently and expreſly, in the firſt, third, and eleventh Verſes of this fourth Chapter: (not now to mention other Verſes in this paſſage of this Epiſtle:) which the Objector doth cauſleſly and groundleſly controvert. And Reſt is a ceſſation from ſuch Labour and Work, as into which that Labour and Reſt doth paſs; which Reſt in the better heavenly Country, is ſo far from being unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the purpoſe of the Author of this Epiſtle, that it is the main drift and ſcope of his arguing in the third and ſourth Chapters, to exhort the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anized, profeſſing Hebrews to take great heed, leſt they were ſhut out of it; by their unbelief, unperſwadableneſs, and diſobedience, <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 4. 1, 3, 5. &amp; 3. 18, 19. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And ſo ſhall Believers Reſt when they ſhall paſs into Glory, from what they did and ſuffered for Chriſt here. As Chriſt ſhall ſuffer no more, and dye no more; ſo Believers ſhall ſuffer no more, dye no more; when once raiſed as Chriſt is riſen: As Chriſt ſo ceaſed from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50938:45"/>
Working, as yet to continue the Work of his Grace in the preſervation of the New Creature, and orderly increaſe, and propagation of it by the Spirit, ſo ſhall Believers ſo ceaſe from this working here, as yet to continue in the full ſupplies of the holy Spirit for ever, in the acting of Grace, perfected in Glory, in the freeſt, largeſt exerciſing, and putting forth thereof, according to the capacities and powers of the New Creature, when thus growing up, to its well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned meaſure of a perfect man: keeping the New Creature by a Power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt, in its due order, and putting it forth to the Glory of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah Aelohim.</hi> As Chriſt ſo Reſted from his Works, as to take Refreſhment in his Works, to have ſatisfaction and complacency in them, as thoſe which did ſet forth his praiſe, and did ſatisfie his glorious deſign: Thus Believers ſo far are delighted with what they have done and ſuffered for Chriſt, as the Father is delighted and pleaſed in what his holy Spirit through Chriſt has in wrought in them, and inabled them to Work for the ſetting forth of his Praiſe, and for the promoting of his Glorious Deſign in the World, whilſt they were in it: and ſo far they were conformed here to Chriſt in their doing and ſuffering here for Chriſt, who will be their Eternal Righteouſneſs, even in Glory, though they own nothing in any, or in all their own Works as Meritorious of Reward, or ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice, theſe being the Works of Chriſt, the Mediator by his alone All-ſuffering Sacrifice. So that here is a fair apt reſemblance, as to Works, and as to Reſt. They do anſwer each other, ſo far as Believers have a capacity in a way of ſimilitude: And this kind of doing, and of ſuffering, doth laſt as long as a Believers life doth laſt, even upon the Seventh-day Sabbath, in their weekly Returns, according to the Duties of thoſe Days (as Chriſt's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuffering, did laſt as long as his life did laſt, even upon the Seventh-day Sabbath.) There is a Sabbath-ſervice, which a Believer is to do for Chriſt, in Obedience to his Command: and men of perſecuting ſpirits, will be laying on of croſſes upon the Believer, for his thus keeping the Seventh-day Sabbath holy to <hi>Jehovah;</hi> though a Believer will rejoyce in ſuch ſufferings for Chriſt. Only here the Reader may take notice, that this Objector doth lay the foundation of his Sabbatizing, on the Morning of the Firſt Day of the Week, when he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that Chriſt by his then firſt riſing from the dead, did lay and perfect the Foundation of the New Creation: I deſire that this may be conſidered; How can a ſerious inquiring ſpirit be ſatisfied from the Objectors arguing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Weekly-day of Reſt, or Sabbath, from Sun-riſing to Sun-ſet of that Firſt Day, by an Argument drawn from Chriſts ceaſing from his Works of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that Morning, as he affirms; when withal, he doth acknowledge, that Chriſt works did continue from his Inearnation to his Reſurrection, without any interruption, never ceaſing from it all the Firſt Days of his Life? Can a weekly half-day of reſting from work be demonſtratively inforced upon a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal intellect from three and thirty years continued working without any ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from that working? (For, that is the ſhorteſt time aſſigned to Chriſt's abode here on Earth: though ſome do reckon more years than three and thirty.) The Creation of the World was finiſhed in ſix Days, which did lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, both in Word and Nature, to continue every Week: As a Law, Rule and Pattern for man's working the ſix foregoing Days, and for his reſting on the Seventh, which is the laſt Day of the Week: Whereas now, this Objector would urge upon our conſciences a weekly obſerving of half a Day, as a weekly Day of Reſt or Sabbath, from a continued Work, thirty years out-right, if not more.</p>

            <p>As for what this Objector doth ſay, that the Reſt, which this perſon is ſaid to enter into, is called his Reſt abſolutely: Whereas, the Reſt which Believers are ſaid to enter into, is either called God's Reſt, or Reſt abſolutely, but not their Reſt, or our Reſt.</p>
            <p>If this be admitted, that the Reſt here, be the Reſt of him who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, the, <hi>He,</hi> who is entring into it, is not meant of the Believer: For the ſame Reſt, which is the Authors Reſt, is alſo the Reſt of the Believer, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer. This Sabbatiſm is <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 4. 9.</note> to the people of God, it belongs to them; there are the Subjects, or the perſons to whom this Reſt is <note n="n" place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> promiſed. <hi>Jehovah</hi> Chriſt hath purſued this Reſt for ſuch, and promiſed this Reſt to ſuch; and when they enter into it, it is theirs in more actual fulneſs: They poſſeſs it, they injoy it as their own. As the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was the Type of this Reſt, was <hi>Jehovah Aelohims,</hi> to promiſe it, and to give it to his <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet withal, it was the Iſraelites, called therefore <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 48 21.</note> the Region of the Fathers of the Iſraelites, and the <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 40. 15.</note> Land of the Hebrews: The place which <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 11. 8, 9.</note>

The Inheritance of <hi>Aelohim:</hi> This is called the place of Reſt: <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was more eſpecially the Reſt, there. More expreſly yet, it is ſaid concerning the Typical Land, that <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Reſt there, was a Type of this promiſed Reſt; in this place to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> brought out of the ninty fifth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> that this Land ſhould enjoy her Sabbaths; and that, this Land ſhould <note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 26. 34, 33, 43.</note> Reſt, and enjoy her Sabbaths: Whereas, it did not ſo Reſt in their Sabbaths, (your Sabbaths, they were theirs:) when the ſinning Iſraelites dwelt upon it. So alſo they are called <note n="u" place="margin">Lev. 26. 43: 2 Chron. 36. 21.</note> her Sabbaths or Reſts: The Sabbaths of that Land, when it was every ſeven years to have reſted from Tillage, and ſuch Labour and Work: And again, <note n="w" place="margin">Lev. 23. 32.</note> your Sabbaths, <hi>Your, Ye ſhall Reſt your Sabbaths;</hi> ſpeaking of the Typical Expiation-day-Sabbath, it was their Reſt.

In the mean while He has given and left His Peace with them, that their hearts might Reſt in Him; and when their time is come, they ſhall <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> Reſt from their Labours with Him in Glory. And now let the Reader, with me, make out after this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sabbatiſm, that this Promiſed Reſt may be ours, that we may not ſo much as ſeem to come ſhort of it. Then and there will be a Sabbatizing, a ceaſing as from much other Labour and Work, ſo from theſe Strifes and Diſputations: The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſanctified Spirit of Juſt men will come fully home to its Reſt; ſitting down in Glory; enjoying Chriſt, and Reſt in Him. O the Bleſſedneſs of ſuch! O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py we! and O happy our Progreſſes, our goings on with a ſtreight foot towards this! if we be ſuch believing, obeying, perſwadable ones as ſhall enter into this Reſt!</p>
            <p>If the Reader be one who hath met with this Objector's arguing againſt the Seventh Day Sabbath, it may be he would willingly have ſomewhat returned in Anſwer yet further, unto ſome Grounds, on which that learned Adverſary doth lay the pretended change of the Weekly-Sabbath-Day, from the Seventh to the Firſt day: I ſhall therefore tranſcribe what is written about this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>had of old determined the Renovation of All, by a new Creation, a new Law of that Creation, a new Covenant, and a new Sabbatical Reſt, unto His own Glory by Jeſus Chriſt. The Renovation of all things by Jeſus Chriſt is propheſied of, and foretold, as a new Creation of All; even of the Heavens, and of the Earth, and all things contained in them;</hi> Iſai. 65. 17, 18. <hi>and</hi> 66. 22. 2 Pet. 3. 13. <hi>Hence the State of things to be introduced thereby, was under the Old Teſtament called, the World to come;</hi> Heb. 2. 5. <hi>In the Prophety of the New Temple or Church-ſtate in thoſe Days, there is Eſpecial Direction given for the Service of the Sabbath-Day,</hi> Ezek. 46. 4. <hi>This Renovation of all things is ſaid accordingly to be accompliſhed in Chriſt; 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 17, 18. Old things are paſſed away; Behold, all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come New: <hi>The Old Law, Old Covenant, Old Worſhip, Old Sabbath; all that was peculiar unto the Covenant of Works, as ſuch, in the firſt Inſtitution of it and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Declaration on Mount</hi> Sinai; <hi>all are gone, and antiquated. The Moral Law, materially the ſame, is now the Rule of our Obedience; not merely and abſolutely unto God, as the Creator, the Firſt Cauſe and Laſt End of All; But as unto God in Chriſt, bringing of us into a New Relation unto Himſelf, There is now a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, part of the New Creation:</hi> Jerem. 31. 32. Heb. 8. 9. <hi>No man can aſſert the ſame day of Reſt, preciſely the Seventh-Day, to abide as of old; but he muſt likewiſe aſſert, the ſame Law, the ſame Covenant, the ſame Reſt of God, the ſame way of Entring into it; which yet, as all acknowledge, are changed. On this we lay the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50938:47"/>
Obſervation of the LORD's Day under the New Teſtament, or a new Work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Iſai. 65. 17. &amp; 66. 22, 23. 2 Pet 3. 13. Rev. 21. 1. Rom. 8. 19, 20. 2 Cor. 5. 17. Gal. 6. 15. <hi>Or a Work of new Creation is undertaken and compleated. This new Creation is accompanied with a new Law, and a new Covenant or the Law of Faith, and the Covenant of Grace,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. &amp; 8. 2, 3. 4. Jer. 31. 32, 33, 34. Heb. 8. 8-13. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this Law and Covenant, a day of Holy Reſt unto the LORD, doth belong, which cannot be the ſame day with the former, no more than it is the ſame Law, or the ſame Covenant which were Originally given unto us,</hi> Heb. 4. 9. Rev. 1. 10. <hi>This Day was limited and determined to the firſt day of the Week, by our LORD Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus this Objector.</p>
            <p>In my reply to this, after two premiſes, I am to ſhew that this new Heaven, and this new Earth ſpoken of in Prophetical Scripture; This Renovation by a new Creation; is not ſo finiſhed and compleated, but that it is yet to come, in the largeſt fulfilling and accompliſhing of it. That, there was a Covenant of Grace under the Old Teſtament Adminiſtration; that, the new Worſhip was Typically ſignified in the figuring pattern of old: That the Law of Faith was a Law under the Old Teſtament diſpenſation: That, the old Law of the ten words, is ſtill the ſame: It was the rule of obedience to them under the Old Teſtament, as unto God in Chriſt, and is ſtill ſo a rule unto us under the New: And then let me be diſcharged from this Scholaſtick War.</p>
            <p>Let this be one premiſe (which is ſeveral times in ſhort expreſſions, here and there in this Treatiſe:) That, it is a choice priviledge and a ſpecial liberty, which Believers do enjoy under the New Teſtament Adminiſtration of Grace: <note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> Chriſt profiteth them nothing by his coming in the Fleſh, (born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to accompliſh and to perfect the Types of old, which did ſo ſet out his thus coming) who keep themſelves ſtill under the former diſpenſation of Types, Shadows, and Figures: We thankfully acknowledge to the Honour of our LORD that gracious adminiſtration eſpecially now towards the latter-day glory of it, that we are brought under, which if compared with the former, under the Old Teſtament, as to the different manner of diſpenſing; (For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we are to diſcover in it's place, that, the Chriſtian Religion is one and the ſame for Doctrines, Duties, Gifts, Graces, Priviledges, under both) has excelling advantages; ſuch as theſe for the meaſures, and for the degrees of them; It has more <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3, 6. John 10. 10. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zck. 47. 9.</note> lively efficaciouſneſs, more quick ſenſible Fellowſhip: <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 15, 16, 18. Dan. 12. 4. Iſa. 119. Hab. 2. 14.

Heb. 8. 11.</note> It has more clear convincing Light, and more abounding ſpreading knowledge: And bleſſed be <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who is in this providential day, clearing up and reviving ſome too long neglected Truths and Duties! amongſt ſome others, this about the weekly Seventh day Sabbath. <note n="f" place="margin">Epheſ. 3. 2.

Heb. 8. 5. &amp; 9. 23.</note> It has more Royal privileges, ſet out therefore by a Kingdom of God, and of Heaven: And the things of it are called Heavenly things. This is meant of a Church State here on Earth: For, above, in the Heavenly glory, there are no unfruitful ones, no Tares, no Scandals, no Doers of Iniquity, no bad Fiſh, no fooliſh ones? This New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Church State has the name of a Kingdom of Heaven, as it doth much reſemble that glorious Kingdom which is above in Heaven, in its way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: In its order of ſubjection, in its ſights of Faith, in its enjoyments of Communion, in its ſervice of Delight, and in its conformity of Holineſs: Here theſe are in growingneſs of meaſure; There they are in fulneſs of Perfection. This new Church State has much brought down from Heaven to it; Such, as are gracious viſits from <hi>Jehovah-Aelohim,</hi> in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Miniſtry, like-affectionedneſs of the perfectly ſanctified ſpirits of juſt Men, and Heavenly Meſſengers with the Everlaſting Goſpel. This new Church State is drawn up to be much in the Spirit in Heaven above, by joynt unions; By mutual Fellowſhips: and it doth believe and expect a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and a new City, where they ſhall be all (the Saints and Believers
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50938:47"/>
both of Old and New Teſtament:) together with one another, and with the elect Angels, and with their LORD to hidden Age, ever as yet. Thus it grows up into a Spiritual Kingdom. How large and delightful a Field is here for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meditation! The manner of adminiſtring is not now, by obſcure Types, and by darkiſh ſhadows, as of old, but without a veil, and open faced: yet Chriſt is the ſubſtance of both the Old and the New Teſtament; the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and rewards of Life everlaſting were in this Chriſt, and purchaſed by him: and there was one way and the ſame mean of receiving of this under both: which was Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> The difference that is between the Old and the New doth diſcover it ſelf in the Form of diſpenſation; which had a diverſity for the manner of it, in the Old from the New: But this made no real ſpecifick difference or change in the eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion. Under the Old, Believers had an eye towards a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was then to come in the Fleſh to be born of a Virgin; and ſo they eyed the Pattern, and Propheties, and Promiſes, looking for the coming Chriſt: What were all the Figures and Types, the Rites, and Shadows, but confirmers of their Faith in, and encouragers of their hope of, Chriſt's coming? In the New, we have it revealed, that Chriſt is now actually already come, to accompliſh thoſe Types, and to perfect Salvation by his perſonal Sacrifice. The Reader may therefore be well ſatisfied in this, that, our pleading of the cauſe of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as it hath no tendency in it ſelf, ſo no deſign in me; To caſt any back, or to hold any under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Adminiſtration, as to the Types, Shadows, and Figures, of it; much leſs to draw off, or to thruſt back any from coming into, and enjoying of New Teſtament priviledges.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſay that it was the Objectors intended aim, but it is evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential from his manner of diſcourſe; that, his Lines about this, would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly inſinuate into the Reader of them, as if the Aſſertors and Obſervers of the weekly Seventh day Sabbath did Apoſtatize into Judaic ceremonies: I have here another opportunity to wipe off a ſlanderous charge which ſome have brought in againſt us; as if we ſtood guilty according to thoſe two Scriptures in the <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 4. 9, 10. Col. 2. 8, 18, 17.</note> Margin, of catching at the ſhadow, and letting go the body.

               <hi>Galatians,</hi> are the Moſaical Rites, ceremonial Laws, and ſhadows of a Chriſt, who under that diſpenſation was then to come, to be born of a Virgin; but is now already come, ſo born: This then doth ſhew, that, the Apoſtle condemneth their ſuperſtitions obſerving, or their keeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Right and Equity, (as that <note n="o" place="margin">

This were a foul matter of ſinful Fact, ſharply to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended: As when either the right object, a God in Chriſt, is not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; or when for the matter of obſerving, it is not New Teſtament Worſhip: Or when for the Form of obſerving of Times and of Worſhip, there was not an orderly addreſs unto <hi>Jehovah Aelohim:</hi> To the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit, in a word way; not in a ſpiritual manner; not from inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of new Nature, of Faith, of Love, and of Obedience: or when the ends of obſerving of Days and Times were not right ends: when the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of humbling, emptying, and abaſing of Man, and of exalting and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of a God in Chriſt, were not promoted thereby: when there was a carnal compliance either with old Judaizers, or with ſuperſtitious Pagans, who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded divers of their own Ethnick corrupt mixtures of Idolatrous Worſhip, which they gave to Sun, Moon, and Stars; By the courſe and motion whereof, Days, Times, Moons, and Years were meaſured. Gentile Philoſophers having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled out the power of the only true God, into the particular vertues of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Creatures; As the Lights in the Heavens, Fire, Water, and Earth; aſcribing ſome portion of Deity to every one of theſe: and ſo aſſigning a part of the Worſhip of God, unto them, too: appointing times and ſeaſons for their ſuperſtitious ſervice. Theſe practices are blame worthy. This were to go
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50938:48"/>
back either to the Old Teſtament diſpenſation, or to return to their former Heatheniſh Rites, which is three times rebuked and reproved, What? Again? Again? Backward? But what is all this to the ſtanding Law of the Seventh day Sabbath, kept in an Holy Spiritual manner, in obedience to <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s command, according to his Word Inſtitution? This is a matter of a diſtinct Nature from the other; being a Law of another kind. So, that to lay aſide all inſtituted natural ſeaſons of Worſhip, ſuch as daily Evening and Morning Worſhip, and weekly Sabbath Worſhip, as ſome would infer from this place, is in the iſſue to open a back-door for the main of Religion, to be turned out at; and to enforce it as others do from hence and from <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 14. 5, 6.</note> one Scripture more, which they alſo wreſt to the like wrong ill purpoſe, as if it mattered not what day of the Week were kept; or whether any day, or no day at all: So both were done to the LORD: and we were now under no ſuch particular Law. This were to open a Gap to all ſuperſtition and prophaneneſs: or to urge it, as if we were now under no obligation of one ſpecial day in a Week: but muſt keep every day of the week as Sabbath, as ſome others. Which is quite contrary to the whole Scripture, and to the Word and Nature of a Sabbath-day: Which is a ceſſation from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary labour, a reſting from the common work, of our particular Functions (which to do on every day of the Week, were a ſin, expreſly againſt the Letter of the Law of the fourth word, which doth command us to work ſix days:) To ſpend the day in the Inſtituted work of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim;</hi> This, under a pretence of being always in a Sabbath, is to miſlead them, to be never in a Sabbath: Or, as other ſome, to plead from hence, that, they may keep both firſt day, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day too, as Sabbaths every week, this alſo is directly againſt the precept; For, we muſt work the ſix foregoing days of the Week, and reſt on the Seventh. We do declare againſt all and every of theſe miſtakes and miſcarriages both in principle and in practice: in whomſoever they are found. <hi>Paul</hi> is ſuppoſed by theſe Objectors, to ſpeak againſt the obſerving of that which comes under the expreſſion of weak and poor Rudiments, Elements, or firſt beginnings: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ten Words are not ſuch. Theſe are <note n="q" place="margin">James 2. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> a Kingly Law, Obedience to theſe, is the Liberty of Children, whereas ſubjection to the other in compariſon of this was ſometimes <note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 4. 3. Rom. 8. 15.</note> the Bondage of Servants. The ten Words are a Kingly Law of Liberty. If it be objected, that, the Typical, Figuring, ſhadowy part annexed of old to the Seventh-day Sabbath, to be then obſerved, ſuch as the two He-Lambs, and ſuch like, was a part of theſe weak and poor Rudiments; We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that theſe have received their perfection and accompliſhment in Chriſt now come, born of a Virgin. So that, in this <note n="s" place="margin">See the Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Note on <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Bible.</note> part, which was Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſuperadded, we are not now ſo to obſerve the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath; by ſuch Types and Figures: but after that glorious, ſpiritual, Heavenly manner as becometh thoſe who are under this New Teſtament diſpenſation: and thus to keep it, is no bondage to a renewed Heart: The more excelling in Knowledge, in Grace, and in Experience, that any is, the more free will they be to this; when once they are led aright into it. Let that therefore which <note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 4. 12.</note>

If the Reader do diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, in his going over of this Epiſtle, he may find, the Law of the ten words eſtabliſhed, as a rule of Life, in the whole of it, and by enumeration and inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſeveral particular commands of it: though withal he ſet out the different manner of diſpenſing of Grace under the Old and New Teſtament. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and applyed might alſo be an anſwer to that part of the Objection, which is formed from wreſting that other place to the <note n="u" place="margin">2 Col. 2. 8, 16, 17.</note>

to the Tradition of Men, according to the Elements of the World, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt. <note n="y" place="margin">ver. 20. 21, 22, 23.</note> Another ſort of Adverſaries, were the Advocates for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inventions, the pleaders for the inſtitutions and impoſitions of Men beſides and againſt the Scriptures of Truth in the matters of Faith and of manners, of Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, Government and Converſation, they were Will-worſhippers: Some others there were who were hot contenders for the keeping up of ſuch Ceremonies, as were once Shadows and Types of a Chriſt, who was then to come to be born in the fleſh of a Virgin. Theſe Typical Inſtitutions were perfected in Chriſt, when he thus came: Theſe ſhadows now paſſed into the body and ſubſtance of them. Believers were now complete in their Head Chriſt, in the tenth Verſe; and had the true grace of what was under Types and Shadows before, in the eleventh and twelfth verſes. That Chirograph by Rites which before they had as it were written, exhibited, ſigned, ſealed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, was now blotted out or cancelled; Which before was their act and deed: in the fourteenth and fifteenth Verſes. As for what they object, that two He-Lambs of the firſt year perfect, were an annexed part of the worſhip on the Seventh day Sabbath; and two tenth parts of fine flower for a Meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering, mingled with Oyl, and the Drink offering thereof; the Burnt-offering of the Sabbath in his Sabbath: As if therefore the Sabbath too were to be laid aſide with theſe: If there were any force in this arguing, then we ſhould lay aſide all Religion and Worſhip: For, what was there under that former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which ſome way or other had not ſome Figures and ſhadows annexed to it? There was blood of a Bull ſprinkled on the Altar, Chriſt: and the Book of the Covenant it ſelf: and what? ſhall we therefore lay aſide Chriſt and his Book? The particular commands of the ten words had ſome Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures annexed to them: Doctrines, Duties, Graces, and Priviledges, relating to the firſt and ſecond words, were ſet out by the Ark, the Altars, the Burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, the Incenſe, the Fire on the Altar, and ſuch like: as any ſpiritual diſcerner may diſcover, by comparing the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> with the pattern in the Mount. <note n="z" place="margin">Numb. 5, 22, 25 26. Lev. 6. 3, 6. Numb. 6. 1-21.</note> The third word or command, in ſeveral duties of it, had annexed Ceremonials, as particularly about an Oath, about a Vow. Thus alſo about the ſixth word or command; <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 21. 1-9.</note> as in a caſe of Murther: about the ſeventh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: <note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 5. 11. 31</note> as in a caſe of Jealouſie: about the eight word or command, as in a caſe of <note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 6. 1-7.</note> Reſtitution: and generally when a Soul did ſin in omitting of ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in committing of a Treſpaſs, when it was ignorantly, or in ſome other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <note n="d" place="margin">Lev. 4. 5. ch. 6.</note> there were peculiar offerings that were appointed. So that, if this carnal reaſoning did hold, it would lay aſide all and every of the other ten words. This Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> doth eſtabliſh the Law of the ten words in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particulars of it; <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> and the firſt word, by forbidding the worſhipping of Angels: <note n="f" place="margin">ver. 20-23.</note> the ſecond, by condemning of Will-worſhip. The third by taxing of Balſphemy, <note n="g" place="margin">ch. 3. 8.</note> eſpecially when againſt the Holy Name of God, The fourth word, by ſhewing the accompliſhment <note n="h" place="margin">ch. 2. 16, 17.</note> of the Ceremonials annexed to Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, if it were admitted, that the Seventh-day Sabbath were here included: <note n="i" place="margin">ch. 3. 18-25. &amp; 4. 1.</note> The fifth word by preſſing to a diſcharge of Relation-duties: <note n="k" place="margin">ch. 3. 8.</note> The ſixth, by declaring againſt Anger, Wrath, and Malice: <note n="l" place="margin">ch. 3. 5.</note> The ſeventh, by threatning of Fornicators, and unclean Perſons with the Wrath of God: <note n="m" place="margin">ch. 3. 25. &amp; 4. 1.</note> The eight by for bidding of wrong, and commending of Juſtneſs and Equality in dealing: <note n="n" place="margin">ch. 3. 8. 9.</note> The ninth by prohibiting of lying and evil ſpeaking: The tenth by charging of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate luſting to be Idolatry: Which is alſo a breach of the firſt command. Thus is the Decalogue confirmed in this Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>The next premiſe is, that the LORD Jeſus Chriſt was Adminiſtrator under the Old, as well as New Teſtament diſpenſation of Grace. I take it to be one great occaſion of many miſapprehenſions, not only in the common ſort of profeſſing Chriſtians, but even in many who have gotten a name for Learning and for God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; that they eye Chriſt as Chriſt and Redeemer only under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and God as Creator only, under the Old: Whereas Chriſt <note n="o" place="margin">Prov. 8. 23. 2. 2. 6. &amp; 45. 8. 1 Sam. 2. 10. 25. 2 Chron. 6. 42.

that he was anointed from the beginning before the Earth was as yet made; and the Father ſpeaks of this his Son, under the Old Teſtament, that he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him; <hi>Aelohim</hi> anointed him by pouring out of the Oyl of his Spirit upon him, with an effuſion of a fulneſs of Gifts, and of Graces, and of Joys, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it expreſly as a matter of Fact done, <hi>Maſhiach,</hi> or Chriſt, or Anointed, is one of the Mediators names; often uſed in the Old Teſtament: This is attributed to his ſubſtance: The Father had ordained him to his Mediatoral Office of Prieſt, King and Prophet even then. It was Chriſt, who was tempted by the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Iſraelites of old: It was by Chriſt, that all things were created: Chriſt was the ſame under all Diſpenſations of Grace: The Fathers purpoſe and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning his people was in Chriſt: The whole Word, is the Word of Chriſt: Believers were reproached for Chriſt, in <hi>Moſes's</hi> time: It was the Spirit of Chriſt, who was in the Prophets; and the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> acknowledged the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> before they knew who was the very perſon, and this Chriſt acted as Mediator under the Old, as well as under the New Teſtament: Though his being born of a Virgin, and ſo taking the Humane Nature to his Godhead, were a great part of the New Teſtament Diſpenſation; when in the days of his fleſh here on earth he familiarly converſed with men: For he had a way of appearing as Man to ſeveral Believers upon ſeveral occaſions under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as a forerunning diſcovery of this latter. It was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or Chriſt, who made himſelf known, by open manifeſtation viſibly, audibly, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to ſeveral of the Prophets, and to ſome others. It was he who proclaimed the Law of the ten Words at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and who afterwards upon the ſame Mount, gave the typical pattern for that Diſpenſation privately to <hi>Moſes;</hi> It was he who was with the Iſraelitiſh Church in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he was the Mediator between God and Man, even then; he was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler, even in thoſe Ages. This and more to this purpoſe, I have already proved from the Scripture in this Book; and therefore if the Reader would be further informed and inlightned in it, I refer him to the Pages cited in the <note n="p" place="margin">Pag 67. 10 pag. 93.</note> Margin. <note n="q" place="margin">Acts 10. 43.</note> This is he, to whom all, (obſerve all; It was the received and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Doctrine of them all) the Prophets do give Witneſs, that through the Name of the LORD Jeſus Chriſt, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins. A great, full word, this: But a remark and obſervand, a ſpecial one upon it. It is acknowledged by this learned Man, that it was the Son, who from the Foundation of the World, immediately in his own perſon tranſacted the Affairs of God with Men; yet he oppoſeth the Seventh day Sabbath; whereas, it was a Law of Chriſt's giving to Mankind from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>Come we now unto the proofs of the ſeveral particulars forementioned; whereof this is one, that this New Heaven, and this New Earth, ſpoken of in prophetical Scripture, this Renovation by a New Creation, is not finiſhed and completed, but that it is yet to come in the large fufilling and accompliſhing of it. There will be. New Heavens, and a New Earth: This we believe; becauſe the Scriptures have foretold it: and we rejoyce in Hope of their Appearing: For they are not as yet come. Theſe glorious Creatures are antedated by ſuch Objectors, by many hundreds of years. For, although there were ſome begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a New Creation in the Days of Chriſt's Fleſh here on Earth, and after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, in the Apoſtle's time; in Regenerations and Converſions, as there were alſo in the Old; For, even there we may read of the <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 51. 10.</note> creating of a clean Heart, and of the renewing of a right conſtant Spirit: Chriſt's name was <note n="s" place="margin">Pſal. 72. 17. &amp; 105. 15.</note> filiated even under that Diſpenſation, and there were Sons and Daughters new createdly born unto him, even then; and Believers were inſtated in the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> then. As for that place in the <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature; Old things paſs away, beheld all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new;</hi> It doth ſpeak a wonderful change in the New Creature: The old carnal State; the old corrupt Principles; the old crooked Rules; the old ſelfiſh ends; the old bad Frames; the old uutoward Actings; the erroneous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes; the formality in Worſhip; the old unſcriptural Traditions; the old Sins; the old man's Converſion; and ſuch like: Theſe do paſs away: and all things,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50938:49"/>
contrary to theſe, are become new: A whole new man. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of what is peculiar to the New Creature in Chriſt, as ſuch: For, as for the old ceremonious Rites, and their paſſing away, even thoſe that were not new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but were carnal Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, yet had theſe things paſſing away, and they were put under a new Adminiſtation: the new diſpenſation of Grace had Ordinances now in a more ſpiritual heavenly way and manner. The paſſing away of old things here, is of old things ſo far as they ſtand in oppoſition to the new Creature; and <note n="u" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</note> unto that new life in and to Chriſt, which now the converted perſon ſhould live: That, as Chriſt ſo loved his people, as to dye and riſe again for them, ſo ſhould thoſe in Chriſt thus evidence their Love to Chriſt, by living no longer to themſelves, but unto him; crucifying the old man; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the ſins and luſts of that old man, and vivifying or quickning the new man: which was true in the Types and Figures before Chriſt was come, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and which is ſtill true, now after that Chriſt is come and aſcended up into Glory. But all this doth make nothing, as to the paſſing away of the Law of the ten Words; in all of them, or in <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 5. 17, 18, 19.</note> any one the leaſt of them. This is a diſtinct fort of Laws, from the Typical, Figuring, Shadowy, Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Law of the ten Words, as it always has been, ſo is it now, and ſtill will be, <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15, 16. &amp; 5. 6. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7 19.</note> the Rule of the new Creature in Chriſt Jeſus: For, what in one place, is called the new Creatures Rule, in another, ſpeaking to the ſame caſe, is the keeping of the Commandments of God. In Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion; but a new Creature: And as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace be on them and Mercy, and on the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God. The <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old had no ſaving benefit barely by the outward ſign of Circumciſion: whereas God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> then, who had the ſign and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified too, they had the Mercy and Peace, who were new Creatures, united to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>

To paſs from one ſort of Laws into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Laws, from the Law of figuring Types, to the Law of the ten Words; and to infer the paſſing away of any one of the Laws of the ten Words, from the paſſing of Types into the Antitypes, and of ſignifying Figures into their ſignified things; is a tranſition from one kind to another; a way of ſophiſtical arguing, of fallacious diſputing, captiouſly to over-reach the ignorant too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous vulgar, and to defraud them of their right to the Truth.</p>
            <p>As for that part of the Objection, which doth ſpeak of new Heavens, and of new Earth, pretended to be completed and finiſhed on the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection, from whence to conclude the paſſing away of the Seventh-day Sabbath, to make room for a Firſt-Day-weekly Sabbath, it is ſo ſcriptureleſs, ſo natureleſs, ſo reaſonleſs, an inference, that it ſhould have been more preconſidered by this Arguer, whether it do conclude and prove any thing but this, that the Adverſaries would fain have ſomething or other that might carry a little colour, and ſome ſhew with it, if they know what; For, let it be pondered, upon ſearch and examination, that all thoſe places of Scripture, which do ſpeak of the new Heavens, and the new Earth, do relate to a further time for their full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment than preciſely to the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>That Propheſie in <note n="z" place="margin">Iſai. 43. 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> hath an eye to the more large and ſpreading converſions of the two, and ten Tribes, in the latter days yet to come. How was this then fulfilled on Chriſt's Reſurrection-Day? who of them was then converted? what eminent new Creatorſhip was there then brought forth, which might put any ſuch ſignal remark upon the Firſt Day of the Week, as from thence to become the new weekly Sabbath? When the moſt of the Diſciples themſelves did ſcarce believe him to be raiſed, till after that Day was over: And two Diſciples, with whom he had walked ſome Miles that Day, had little
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50938:50"/>
belief of his Reſurrection; and little knowledge of him, till he diſappeared from them? How few in compariſon, were brought in unto Chriſt, and made new Creatures, in all Chriſt's life time, at his Death and Reſurrection, and forty Days after that, till after his Aſcenſion, and after the pourings out of the Holy Spirit? That forementioned Propheſie doth foretel, that Nations ſhall be brought under the <note n="a" place="margin">Iſai. 43. 3, 4.</note> Jews Dominions, when thoſe new Heavens, and new Earth ſhall appear. This was not at the time of Chriſt's Reſurrection-day; nor ever ſince: and they were then, and have been ſince, for ſixteen hundred years or more, ſo far Ruling over the Nations, that they have been a ſcattered, deſpiſed broken people, without ſo much as any <note n="b" place="margin">Hoſ. 3. 4, 5.</note> Political Kingly Government amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: It foretels, that thoſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be gathered out of all Quarters, <note n="c" place="margin">Iſai. 43. 5, 6.</note> Eaſt, Weſt, North and South: This alſo is behind yet unfulfilled: That <hi>Euphrates</hi> would be dry: Was this on Chriſt's Reſurrection Day?

            <p>Another Propheſie by <note n="e" place="margin">Iſai. 65. 17,</note> 
               <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> doth fortel, that at that time of the new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the new Earth, the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as the other two, of <hi>Judah,</hi> and of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> ſhall according as to an expreſs promiſe, <note n="f" place="margin">Iſai. 65. 10.</note> return home to their own Country and Land: For <note n="g" place="margin">1 Chron. 5. 16.

Thus alſo that Prophety by <hi>John,</hi> in the <note n="z" place="margin">Rev. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Revelation;</hi> when he had a Viſional ſight of a new Heaven and a new Earth, upon the paſſing away of the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth; and when he ſaw the Holy City, and the New <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and when a great Voice out of Heaven had told him, that God would wipe off all tears from the eyes of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-people; and that Death ſhould be no more, neither mourning nor crying, nor any more trouble; for the former things ſhould paſs away. <hi>He that ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne ſaid, Behold, I make all things new: Write, for theſe things are true and faithful.</hi> Is it not evident here, that this Prophetie was many years after the Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection? And muſt not the Fulfilling be after the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Is there not enough in this very place to confute the Objector's Arguing; Is the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth yet paſſed away? When ever was this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Is the new Heaven and the new Earth yet come? Is the Holy City, the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as yet come down from God <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 21. 2, 10. &amp; 3. 10.</note> out of Heaven? Are there not tears found in the eyes of the LORD'S people, to be wiped away? Is there not death ſtill? Are theſe former things yet paſſed away? Is not the LORD He, who then foretold, that he would make all things new? <hi>John</hi> ſaw in a Viſion, and heard in a voice, they would be ſo made; but they were not actually ſo excellent on earth in <hi>John's</hi> Day and Time. For there will be this new face of things in the Churches of Chriſt on earth: This New, Holy City, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is not ſaid to go up to God, into Heaven; <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 21. 2.</note> but it doth come down from God out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 21. 3.</note> God will renew his Covenant with his people, and he will Tabernacle with them. <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 21. 22.</note> God will put away Humane Ordinances, Inventions, Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Traditions, to ſet up his own Inſtitutions, all the Laws and Orders of his New Houſe, in their Purity and Power. <note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 21. 23-20.</note> The Nations ſhall receive Light from this New Church; ſo ſhiningly enlightned, ſo clearly taught of him. <note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 21. 27.</note> Church-Diſcipline ſhall be revived, ſet up, and exerciſed: Diſtempers, Diſeaſes, and Ulcers, of Spirit, of Soul, and Body, ſhall be healed, and cured, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <note n="g" place="margin">Rev. 22. 2.</note> by the Medicinal leaves of the Tree of Life.

               <hi>Hebrews,</hi> has the ſame Import and Deſign, as to the Covenant, and the renewing of it. Here is no determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Day of Chriſt's Reſurrection mentioned; when this Promiſe was to have its exact preciſe fulfilling: and if we would point any particular time more than other, according to this kind of arguing, it was rather the Fruit of Chriſt's <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 8. 1, 4.</note> Aſcenſion, if it relate to thoſe times ſo near Chriſt, when this High Prieſt entred into the Holy of Holies: For this Chapter doth more particularly ſet out the High Prieſthood of Chriſt, entred into Heaven with Blood, and with Incenſe, ſatisfying and interceding there; fitting at the Right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Raigning; having all Power; ſending Meſſengers to teach his People; and ſo is more conſummately a glorious Prieſt, King and Prophet together; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually beſtowing upon Believers all thoſe purchaſed, covenanted Bleſſings, for which he intercedes on their behalf; as Pardon, Peace, Grace, Mercy, Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, Aſſiſtance, Acceptance, and ſuch like: which he did for Believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but in another way of diſpenſing: For, whilſt he remained on Earth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after his Reſurrection, till he aſcended into Heaven, the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood did continue. So that, the Honour is more in ſome reſpect put upon Chriſt's Aſcenſion, if we will date theſe new things about that time, when Chriſt went up into the higheſt Heavens: For, then more eſpecially, was the <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21.</note> new and living Way new made, by Chriſt's entring into the Holy of Holies, into the higheſt Heaven. As to what doth relate to the New Teſtament Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, as ſuch more ſpiritually diſpenſed, we have ſeveral times acknowledged, that without making any change in the ſum and ſubſtance of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the Law of the ten Words.

            <p>I am now to evidence from the Scriptures of Truth, that there was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace under the Old Teſtament Adminiſtration. This Doctrine of Grace is that, which muſt lay the foundation for an after aſſertion of mine about a Law of faith, under the Old Teſtament; For <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 4 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In Order to the Augmentation of this Holy Science, I would propound theſe Queſtions to further Diſquiſition.</p>
            <p>Q. Whether, where ever in the Old Teſtament, he that appeared as a Man, or as an Angel, and withal is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> be not always Chriſt, manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under that Diſpenſation of Grace?</p>
            <p>Q. Whether, if all the Hebrew Words, which in the Old Teſtament do ſet out Grace, Mercy, Sweet Savour, Acceptance, free Favour, Covenanting, Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Reconciliation, Propitiation, Pardon and ſuch like; withal Synonyms
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50938:52"/>
and Phraſes relating thercunto. If all theſe were put together, it would not bring great Light to this Doctrine of a Covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>Q. Whether there be clear Scripture-Evidences, that ever there were any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made between God and Man, of Salvation by Works only, without Free Grace in a Mediator, on God's part; and without Faith in a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> on Man's part? So that Man's Juſtification and Eternal Life was ſolely and merely upon this one only condition of mans perfect, perpetual, abſolute, perſonal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the whole Law of God, to all and every of his Commands.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs more thorowly into the Proof of a Covenant of Grace under the old Diſpenſation, it may be of ſome uſe to open that expreſſion of a New, or a Renewed Covenant, <note n="n" place="margin">Jer. 31. 31, 32.

Hence the Renewing of our Mind, and the Renewnig of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. That it has this ſenſe in the eighth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, will yet more clearly appear; when I ſhall diſcover, that all and every of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars expreſſed in that Covenant, are ſuch as have been, as were in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, real Exiſtence, and actual Being, under the Old Teſtament diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>In this, as in other great Undertakings in this Treatiſe, my Calls are more vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal than others from the LORD; to commit my ſoul by well doing, unto this Faithful Creator, and loving Redeemer, <hi>Jehovah</hi> Chriſt. Conſidering the much oppoſition I have met with heretofore, about this and other ſuch Enquiries; and may yet further be exerciſed with. But he who made all things is alſo the Head of the Body; of his Body the Church; that in all he might hold the Chief. For ſo it pleaſed the Father; who in, and through, and by his Son, has in all Ages of the world, manifeſted and diſpenſed much of the freeneſs of this Love, and of the Riches of his Grace; which that <note n="s" place="margin">Rom. 4. 16. Heb. 6. 13-. 18.</note> it might be made firm unto his people, he hath put into a Promiſe, made ſure with his Oath.</p>
            <p>That Covenant which <hi>Aelobim</hi> in Chriſt made with his people, was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; one and the ſame both in the Old and New Teſtament, differing only in the manner of diſpenſing: As alſo is the whole of the Chriſtian Religion <note n="t" place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> one and the ſame in both, for Doctrines and Duties, for Graces and Privileges, and ſuch like parts of this Religion, which doth vary only in the ſeveral ways of Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>By a Covenant of Grace, I mean the LORD'S free promiſing of Life, of Wiſdome, of Righteouſneſs, of Sanctification, of Redemption, of all good things to his people, believing in Chriſt; who are thus ſpecally favoured by him. The Inſtances which I ſhall particularize in, will be thoſe after <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall. Such a Gracious Covenant the LORD made with his people, who were under the Old Teſtament-diſpenſation. <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> How much of Grace was there put into that one comprehenſive Promiſe, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's head.</hi>

               <hi>Peter</hi> calleth him, <hi>A Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi> That this was typical, and had ſome further ſpiritual meaning in it, the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> doth declare, by ſhewing, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm under the New Teſtament was an Anti-type to this, an anſwerable Figure, ſaving of Believers by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. This Doctrine of the Free Covenant of Mercy, of Righteouſneſs, and of Salvatiou by Faith in Chriſt, did <hi>Noah</hi> commend to his hearers; and it was ſealed up towards the Faithful, in that wonderful deliverance in the Ark, which did ſhadow forth Salvation through Faith in Chriſt, and that Believers, of the Poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſhould be Heirs by Faith of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; which was in this Type made a ſpecial Free Covenant with them; whilſt the unbelieving and unperſwadable, the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and diſobedient, living and dying ſuch, would periſh and be deſtroyed. <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 8. 20, 21.

The LORD Chriſt was hereby Typified, who performed his Office of Mediation, as in all the other parts of it, ſo in the diſcharge of his Prieſtly Function, offering up of himſelf a propitiatory Sacrifice to God his Father more eſpecially, for thoſe whom the Father gave unto him: This he did by the everlaſting Spirit without ſpot: This was ſignified hereby, expiation, and the doing away of ſin, by the ſlain Sacrifices of Chriſt himſelf: <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſmelled a ſmell of reſt, in what <hi>Noah</hi> did; graciouſly accepting of the Sacrifice thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: and again makes a Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> of rich Mercy in Chriſt: by and through whom Believers ſhould be freed from the Curſe.

            <p>This Law has in the Scriptures, the Name and the Thing of a Covenant of Grace.

            <p>As <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 20. 2, 5, 7, 10, 12.</note> this doth bring in the firſt great Word or Command, ſo alſo is it expreſly put into the Second, into the Third, and into the Fourth; into every Word of Command of the Firſt Table: In the Second Table alſo, we may find it in the Fifth Word. And thoſe that will diligently obſerve, and duly apply it in their reading of the Holy Scriptures, may diſcern it to be a rich Portion, going along with every one of the Ten Words in particular, as well as made over to all of them in general; eſpecially with reſpect to the Fourth Word. It is remarkable in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s repeating of this Law, that in his going over of the Law for the Seventh-Day-Sabbath, this Covenant of Grace, <hi>I am</hi> Jehovah, <hi>Thy God,</hi> is <note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 5. 12,  —5.</note> four times expreſly mentioned: beſides the Type of Spiritual Redemption by Chriſt; which is alſo about thirty nine years after Chriſt's firſt proclaiming of this Law at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> ſuperadded, and expreſly put into this Fourth Word, as a forcible Reaſon to engage Obedience to this holy Precept: The Figure of which Salvation by Chriſt, and of his delivering of his people from their Spiritual bondage and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry under Sin and <hi>Satan,</hi> is a choice part of the Covenant of Grace. This is that which doth lead in the Ten Words: By this manifeſted Grace doth he invite his people to Faith and Obedience.

            <p>It is further note-worthy, that moſt of the Ten Words, even Eight of them, as they are in the two Tables, are expreſt in that manner, that they are Precepts

            <p>If you meditate upon what did accompany the ten Words, and what was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, what were all the Shadows and Figures, and Types, but a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Commentary upon the Covenant of Grace?

            <p>This will yet further, be evidently demonſtrated, in that, this Prophetie and Promiſe was renewed and revived ſeveral years after Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven, as is clear by the mention of it in that Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in ſeveral places of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For the contrary to all this was ſome few years in the ſame generation or age after Chriſt's death; the Jew's were unchurched; the City and the Temple were deſtroyed, according to Chriſt's foretelling, in what is written in that <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 24. 1-2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There we may learn all ſaving Wiſdom: There is the perfect Knowledge to be had of all things, to be both believed and done, that Eternal Life may be obtained. There are Univerſal Principles of this Law of the ten Words, which do pertain to Faith and Manners; and theſe Practical Dictates which every one of theſe Laws doth include is a Fundamental Truth and Doctrine neceſſary to be believed; as, that we muſt have <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> for our God, and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: that we muſt worſhip him according to his Inſtitutions in his Word, and not in any other way of Humane Inventing, and impoſing, that we ought to have an holy reverent uſe of his Name: That the Seventh day is his Sabbath, in which we may not do the ſervile works of our particular calling; that the Father and Mother are to be honoured; and ſo of the reſt.

As this Seventh-day-Sabbath has its Nature, Inſtitution, Uſe and End, put into Scripture-Revelation, ſo it is a peculiar Sign to thoſe, unto whom this Word-diſcovery is made; eſpecially, when to their inner man; and will be ſuch to the Worlds end, to all and every of thoſe who are ſo choicely favoured.

believe from Word-Revelation, that the Weekly Seventh day-Sabbath would be ſuch a Sign as would (the holy Spirit of the LORD, witneſſing together with a renewed Spirit in the Saints;) point out unto them, and declare in them, that ſuch are ſome of <hi>Jehovah's</hi> peculiar people in ſpecial Covenant with them, (like as <note n="c" place="margin">1 John 3. 14.

This is a Sign that is ſtill put into a Promiſe; and will even now, and in after days be made good to right Spiritual Obſervers of <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath! A Sign to know (here is one great End and ſpecial Uſe of this Sign, which is alſo a laſting-ſtanding continued one) that <hi>Jehovah</hi> doth ſanctifie ſuch, and is their God. Whoever he be that can well evidence an Univerſal Obedience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to an whole Chriſt, and his whole Word, particularly as to his due ſanctifying of the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath of <hi>Jehovah</hi> his God (which would much influence and operate upon all other Religion:) would have <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>'s Covenanted-Love more manifeſted to him, by the incouraging Sign; it would be a token to him for this, and for much other good. <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 92. <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi> Iſal. 56. 1-8.

Thus a Natural Duty is ſometimes made a Sign of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Priviledge.</p>
            <p>Againſt this, it hath been further objected, that Circumciſion is called <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 17. 7, 11, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſo is, <note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 31. 13,</note> the Seventh-day-Sabbath, called a Sign between <hi>Jehovah</hi> and his people, throughout their Generations, which they were to obſerve throughout their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, for an everlaſting Covenant between him and the Sons of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it a Sign for ever. And therefore they were to ceaſe together.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this in the General: Here is a Fallacy of Compoſition and Diviſion; by taking ſome things ſeverally and apart, which are to be taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynedly: and by taking other things conjoynedly, which are to be taken apart. Some things here, would be well divided and ſevered, which are ill joyned; and other things would be well joyned, which are ill divided. Here the divided ſenſe muſt be ſeparated from the compounded; and the compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe from the divided. There is another Fallacy in the comparing of theſe two, Circumciſion, and the weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath. Becauſe it is not of the ſame thing in the ſame manner, according to the ſame part, to the ſame perſon and thing, in the ſame time. And there is a tranſlation from one kind to another. Though in ſome thing theſe two, do more generally agree; yet in other things they do ſpecially differ: which doth diſcover both a deceit and a defect, a confuſedneſs and a captiouſneſs in the Objector. This will further open it ſelf by a more particular diſtinct conſidering of what doth follow.

Theſe Luminaries are Witneſſes of God's faithfulneſs in his Covenant, to Generation of Generations. Thus alſo are Day and Night ſuch a Sign. The Rain-bow, whenever it doth appear, is to be a Sign to the Worlds end; a Sign or Token of God's Covenant with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that he will no more drown this whole Earth with Water. <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s weekly Seventh-day-Sabbath, has been already manifeſted, to be both a Natural, Inſtituted, and notifying Sign. Such an immutable unchangeable Sign, as that, <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> will in no Generation, not even under this New Teſtament Adminiſtration put an end to his ſanctifying of his people. Whereas Circumciſion was a Typical, Mutable, Changeable Sign; <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1, 2, 3. Col. 2. 11, 12. Rom. 28, 29. &amp; 11. 12.</note> which paſſed into it more ſpiritual

So that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was another kind of Law, than the Natural Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath. The Type and Figure of fleſhy Circumciſion was Temporary and Changeable. This Sign which was the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, did belong to other ſorts of Laws; to the Ceremonial Law, as it was Typical, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring and Shadowing; and ſo doth widely differ in the whole kind from the Natural Law of the ten Words (whereof this of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath is one.)

It was the Writing of <hi>Aelohim;</hi> and the Record of them is to remain for ever. So that, a due difference muſt be put, between this weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, as it is ſuch a ſtanding eſtabliſhed Rule of Life, in created Nature, one of the ten Words; and between ſome Typical Inſtitutions, and ſuperadded Rites, and Figuring Shadows, afterwards annexed to this Sabbath. <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 13. 14.</note> There is a plain evident difference between theſe two ſorts of Laws. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> be heard concerning this in what he ſaid to the Iſraelites; <hi>Jehovah</hi> declared unto you his Covenant, which he commanded you to do, the ten Words (obſerve theſe are diſtinctly expreſſed, and ſevered from the Figuring Laws) and he wrote them upon two Tables of Stone; and <hi>Jehovah</hi> commanded me at that time, to teach you Statutes and Iudgements, that ye may do them in the Land whither ye are going over to poſſeſs it. May we not diſcern here that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth put a clear difference between the Laws of the ten Words, which were publickly, openly ſpoken and given by the LORD Chriſt in his own Royal Perſon from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all the people, and were written with the Finger of his own Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe, and thoſe other ſhadowy Ordinances, which were privately ſpoken to <hi>Moſes,</hi> only and by him, and by his Miniſtery brought to the people and written by him? Theſe figuring Statutes admitted of a change, and yet the Law of the Seventh day Sabbath doth remain unchangeable; a perpetual Law. And if any think, that there is yet further any thing ſignificative annexed to this day by <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Inſtitution, of Chriſt's ſecond coming, and of the heavenly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm, then let that ſo far, when any will clear it up from Scripture, ſtand firm and unmoved till that time. If the naturalneſs and ſelf evidence of the Law of the ten Words were to receive a change, becauſe of ſuperadded Inſtitutions, fitted to that Diſpenſation; particularly as to Signs; then the naturalneſs and ſelf evidene of every one of them, by this kind of arguing, were to receive a change. Was there not a Law for Fringes, by the Inſtitution of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> himſelf, throughout the Generations of the Iſraelites; for this end <note n="m" place="margin">Numb. 15. 37-41.</note> that they might ſee and remember all his Commandments? This outward Rite was a memorative Sign, or a religious Sign, to help their memories, and to further their ſanctification. To lead them unto a continual remembrance and practice of all the Law of the ten Words. Thus alſo their <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 13. 9, 16. Deut. 6. 8. &amp; 11. 18. Mat. 23. 5.</note> Phylacteries were for a Sign upon their Hand, and for a Memorial between their eyes, that <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Law might be in their Mouth. This was a Typical Memorial, or Monument. Which is the proper meaning of the Original Word. By this outward Sign <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> would have them to apply all their ſerious ſtudy, and all their careful practice, unto the keeping of all and every of the Laws of the ten Words. All the outward Rites of the <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 74. 9. Heb. 10. 1. &amp; 9. 10. 13, 14.</note> Ceremonial Laws were Signs, typical Figures, and ſignificant Shadows, inſtituted of God, as Seals and Pledges to aſſure Believers of Chriſt, and of thoſe good things which his Faithful, Obedient, Perſwadable ones, have in and by him. A due difference therefore ſhould be put between Signs and Figures, Signs and Shadows: For although in the general, and in common, there be ſomewhat of a Sign in Figures and Shadows, yet every Sign is not a Figure and Shadow, but has ſomewhat particularly ſpecially diſtinct: A
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50938:60"/>
Figure doth ſet out and foreſhew ſome Truth, Duty, Grace or Priviledge, which is afterwards more clearly to be revealed, though even then to be known, believed, done, acted and injoyed: A Shadow doth give ſome dark reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and it is a betokener of a Body which is to come in the place thereof, and is in the appointed ſeaſon to be exhibited: whereas a Sign, as it doth in ſome inſtances point out ſomewhat, which is yet afterward to be looked for; ſo in other caſes it doth aſſure Believers of ſomewhat that is already gone and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: and in ſomewhat elſe it may ſtand and be joyned together with that which is ſignified thereby, and be of ſpecial uſefulneſs at one and the ſame preſent time. The Ark wherein was nothing but only the ten Words in two Tables; and the propitiatory Covering which was over the Ark were Types, Figures and Shadows of Chriſt: So that if Ceremonial Annexes ſhould make void the Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, that way of arguing would lay aſide and make void all the other Laws of theſe ten Words. Sanctification, is either that which was natural, and concreated at the firſt, and is now reſtored to and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought in ſome, a ſpiritual transforming-Sanctification, whereby <note n="p" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 23. 2 Theſſ. 2. 13.

(Baptiſm <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 6. 3-6. Tit. 3. 5. John 3. 6.</note> is ſuch a Sign under the new Diſpenſation.) Thus the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, if it be taken under this conſideration, as it had under the Old Teſtament Adminiſtration, divers Ceremonial Laws added unto it, both for preparation before, and for cleanſing in and after, in ſome caſes; in this reſpect, that which was ſuperadded to it, was a Sign of Sanctification to the Iſraelitiſh Church, beyond any other people, unleſs others came in and embraced the ſame true Religion; and then there was one Law for the Iſraelite, and for the Stranger: <note n="s" place="margin">Exod. 12. 45, 47, 48, 49. Deut. 4. 7, 8.</note> When the Forreigner or Sojourner did leave the Worſhip of Idols, and other heatheniſh practices, of the Infidel World. Thus, <note n="t" place="margin">

If this be conſidered, as it is, an abſolute and perfect Rule of Life, comprehending all duties whatſoever; and being that Image and Samplar, unto which all mankind, at the beginning, in their repreſentative Head, were created in Wiſdom, in Holineſs, and in Righteouſneſs, which was afterwards promulgated and proclaimed by <hi>Jehovah</hi> Chriſt, with a Covenant of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled; ſo it is that Law of Nature, which inlightned Intellect or right Reaſon doth teach; ſome notions whereof are ſtill retained, even now in man's fallen corrupted eſtate. There are ſome Seeds of thoſe Eternal Truths, and Things; ſome common principles of good and of evil; both for the knowledge of God, and of his Service, and for thoſe Duties, which we owe unto our ſelves, and unto our Neighbours. This is born and bred with reaſonable man: every one doth carry it about with him; every one coming into this World, is inlightned therewithal: which Remnants of this Law, do ſerve for many good uſes and purpoſes in civil converſe amongſt men, and for ſome other ends. In this ſenſe the Law of the ten Words, particularly that of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, is given to the whole World.

               <hi>The Law of Degrees,</hi> placed in external Rites, and by ſome ſuch other Expreſſions: Theſe Rites were uſed about outward fleſhie things; ſuch as Meats, Drinks, Waſhings, and the like. Theſe, ſo far as they were Typical, Figuring, and Repreſentative, of a Chriſt who was then to come, to be born of a Virgin, and to ſhed his blood; were perfected and accompliſhed in Chriſt, when he was ſo born, and had ſo ſuffered, was riſen and had aſcended. And they did peculiarly belong to the People under the former diſpenſation. Of this nature were ſome Ceremonies, annexed to the Weekly-ſeventh-day Sabbath. By theſe holy rites, the Church and People of God under that adminiſtration, were <note n="q" place="margin">Eſther. 3. 8. Epheſ. 2. 12.</note> differenced and diſcerned, as a People holy to God, diſtinct from other prophane Nations. An Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Ceremonie is ſet out in Scripture by Fleſh, a carnal Ordinance, an hand-writing of death, an Element of the World, weak and egene, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar of Heavenly things, unſtable; An Intolerable Yoak.

A Ceremonie has been, and is, a Sign of ſomewhat that is natural; and ſo they have been annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to natural Spiritual Duties. As <note n="s" place="margin">Numb. 28. 1-8.</note> Evening and Morning worſhipping of God, had divers Ceremonial Obſervances. <note n="t" place="margin">Numb. 28. 9, 10.</note> So the Weekly-Seventh-day-Sabbath.

The Epiſtle to the Hebrews is a Goſpel-Expoſition hereupon. Though Multitudes of theſe Ceremonies were ſuperadded to the Law of the ten Words, as an Evangelical Explanation and Interpretation of them, yet this doth not alter the true real na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any of theſe ten words, which are always a ſtanding unalterable Rule of holy Righteous living.</p>

To expound the whole of the Old Teſtament pattern, as to the matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in all the other parts of that Adminiſtration, and then to apply it in the new, how exactly one doth correſpond to the other, were task enough for a long Life.

The Reader ſhould not here miſtake me, as if I were in this againſt all the outward part of Worſhip now under the New Teſtament, whilſt I declare the aboliſhing of thoſe external ſacrifices, and outward Rites which were Typical and figuring of old.

promiſe, and ſo are under expectation, of having their bodies glorified as well as their ſpirits and ſouls, in the World and Life to come: and if they look for a glorifying reward, they ſhould perform a worſhiping work: though the inward worſhip be the life of the outward worſhip, yet the outward muſt be expreſſive of the inward, the one is not complete without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Where there is only the outward worſhip without the inward, there the worſhip doth not ſo commend it ſelf to God, not being well teſtified before him, who ſearcheth the Heart, <note n="s" place="margin">John 4. 23, 24.</note> and who being a Spirit, will be worſhipped in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and if there be only inward worſhip, without the outward worſhip, there the worſhip is not well witneſſed <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 4-15.</note> before Men and Angels.

            <p>Here to avoid miſtakes and cavils, (for, we are for ſtanding upon plain firm ground, having the whole Scripture in plain expreſs words for the Weekly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day Sabbath:) I notice the Reader, that to believe actually in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as Mediator between God and Man, and actually to believe in this <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as he that was in the Fulneſs of Time to come in the Fleſh, born of a Virgin, was a Law under the Old Adminiſtration. And to believe actually in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, this Chriſt, when come in the Fleſh, as ſo born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is a Law of the New Teſtament; yet ſo, as that this <hi>Quateneity,</hi> as ſo born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is one part of the New Teſtament Miniſtration, properly as ſuch; and ſo in that reſpect doth belong to another matter. And thus in ſome places Faith doth ſet out the New Diſpenſation of Grace. The ſhort and plain is this; Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or in Chriſt, was a Law under the Old Teſtament-diſpenſation; or it was then a commanded Duty to believe in Chriſt; which was to be done in obedience to a Law of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Advancement of this ſort of profitable Learning, I propound theſe following Inquiries; which if well cleared up from Scripture, might bring in ſome conſiderable Augment to this Holy Science.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether there be not convincing evidence in the Word of Truth, that fallen <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did actually repent, and believe in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> for Juſtification, Acceptation and Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What Names are there in the Old Teſtament given to Chriſt, which do ſet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50938:64"/>
him out, as Mediator, as Saviour, as the Juſtifier of his people, and as being their Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What Types, and Figures, and Shadows were there of this Doctrine of Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> under old Teſtament Diſpenſation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether, if all the Hebrew expreſſions were put together, that in the Old Teſtament are expreſſive * deſcriptions of Faith, Truſt, Hope, Expectation in the New, with all the Synonyma's and Phraſes referring to this ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it would not diſcover much of lively Faith in the Saints, under that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Diſpenſation?</p>
            <p>That, Faith was a Law under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, I thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, both in the general ſignificancy of the word, grounded on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightneſs, and Faithfulneſs of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> and alſo in the ſpecial accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; for cloſing with, applying of, relying on, <hi>Jehovah</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs, for juſtification in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>In its general ſignificancy, it has a firm Foundation, a rockie bottom, even <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 1. 15. 1, 6. Rom. 10. 17. Heb. 11. 3. 1 Pet. 1. 22. 2 Theſſ. 2. 13. Rom. 4, 20. Heb. 11. 1, 6.</note> the Power and Truth of the omnipotent unchangeable <hi>Jehovah,</hi> a God of ability to perform, and of veracity to fulfil, what he has ſpoken and promiſed. Every Word and Truth of God revealed, is the general, and common object of Faith. A lively working belief of this; though ſeemingly but in the general, yet has great influence upon the ſpecial actings of juſtifying Faith; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do give us inſtances of too much, and too often queſtioning the Power and Fidelity of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> in his Word and Promiſes, in ſome particular trying Caſes, as long hiding of his Faces, great withdrawing, delay of fulfilling of Propheties and Promiſes, not anſwering of Prayer, carrying himſelf as one angry at the very Prayers of his people; much conflicting with, and yet frequent foyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſome particular bewailed, confeſſed corruption, under violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the LORD's ſeeming forſaking of his Churches and people, his ſhining upon, and proſpering of the Enemies of the LORD, and of his people, his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act contrary in his works, from what he covenanteth in his Word; with more of this kind.</p>
            <p>But, I ſuppoſe, that it is the notion of Faith in its ſpecial acceptation, that is intended by this pretended new Law of Faith in this Objection: That this Faith in Chriſt is now in more clearneſs, ſpiritualneſs, evidence, growingneſs, heavenlyneſs, for the manner and degrees of it, we thankfully and admiringly, acknowledge to the praiſe of God, of rich Grace, and of free Love, who has brought us under this new and more glorious Adminiſtration. But, there was the ſame Grace of Faith in Truth, and in reality, for its Nature and Eſſence, in the ſavingneſs and juſtifyingneſs of it, for the kind and ſpecifickneſs of it, under the Old: This we alſo affirm, was it not this ſaving and juſtifying Faith which the Author of the Epiſtle <note n="n" place="margin">

Heb. 10. 38.</note> Old Teſtament, which is uſed once and again, and a third time in the new?

So in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi> the Righteouſneſs of God (of Chriſt who was God as well as Man, for the complete ſatisfactory righteouſneſs of ſuch an one did we ſtand in need of:) is revealed in the ſame Goſpel of Chriſt from Faith to Faith; as it is written, <hi>But the juſt by faith ſhall live:</hi> That Righteouſneſs by which a Believer doth ſtand juſtified before the Judgement Seat of God, and can be no other Righteouſneſs, but only the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, this is a free gift from the Father, and is through the inworking of the holy Spirit, by Faith imputed to Believers.

Was it not <note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 11. 4. Mat. 23. 35.

Is not <hi>Abraham</hi> propounded as an Example to after-Believers in this? being called the Father of all that believe, in the Foot ſteps of whoſe Faith after-Believers are to walk? For what was ſo counted to him for Righteouſneſs, was written, not for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for the ſake of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of others in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time; and ſo ſtill for our ſakes, in the preſent day, to whom it ſhall be imputed, namely to them that do believe in him; <note n="w" place="margin">Deut. 30. 11-14.

It was the open confeſſion of <note n="y" place="margin">Acts 15. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith in one of the firſt Councils or Synods, held in the New Teſtament, when the Apoſtles and Elders were aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to debate ſome weighty Queſtion of the Chriſtian Religion; <hi>We believe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by the Grace of the LORD Jeſus Chriſt, to be ſaved in ſuch manner as they alſo; as the believing Fore-fathers under the Old Teſtament were, merely through free Grace, by Faith in Grace, by Faith in Chriſt, in his righteouſneſs.</hi>
               <hi>They by Faith in Chriſt, who was then to come to be in due time born of the Virgin, which was held forth in Types of old to this end; We in Chriſt, as the perfect Anti-type thus already come.</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 12. 1, 2, 3, 6.</note> The Analogy of Faith in both Teſtaments ſhould be attended unto by a diligent diſcerning Reader of the Word, a due proportional collating of them, between and to each other, would diſcover the uniformneſs and well-agreingneſs of the Will of our LORD in them both, by a particular right application and limitation of their Analogy, the orderly regulation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of muſt be made according to that meaſure and number of proportion, which the different manner of diſpenſing doth call for, and no further is it to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as to any ſubſtantial and eſſential part of the Chriſtian Religion; there is a likeneſs of Word, a ſameneſs of Senſe, a oneneſs of intendment on them both, unto which Analogy he muſt keep cloſe, who would give forth a true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſound Doctrine. That Faith, which is required and promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, is for the ſubſtance of it, one and the ſame Grace, which is commanded in the Law of the ten Words; and let it be further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearched into by the ingenuous for the augment of this Spiritual Science; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Faith of <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocence (I do not put here into this inquiry, as to the ſpecial uſe, and the proper object of it) were not for the ſubſtance of the

Was not <hi>Adam</hi> in all things to give confident credence to all as to every Truth which <hi>Aelohim</hi> his Creator had revealed or ſhould further reveal, was he not bound to believe in the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> by the Law of Creation and of Nature, as ſoon as ever <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> ſhould reveal this to him? The whole Scripture is profitable for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of the oneneſs and ſameneſs of old and New Teſtament Faith, and I am perſwaded after ſome years reſearch into the word of Truth, about this matter, and long experience ſuited thereunto, that one great occaſion at leaſt, if not cauſe, of the Apoſtaſies and Backſlidings of ſome, of the looſe ungoſpel-like, and ill-principled-converſation of others, and of the practical Atheiſm and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of ſome others, and of the doubts and fears, and unprofitable walking of other ſome, has been men's unſcriptural unwarrantable ſetting up of ſo many different Religions in the Old and New Teſtament, and the urging of ſome one, or a few miſunderſtood, miſinterpreted Scriptures, wreſted and wryed to ſome particular purpoſe, contrary to the drift, and intent, and ſcope, of the whole Scripture beſides, which doth write about that Caſe: Whereas the whole Scripture is uniform and harmonious, ſpeaking with one mouth, one and the ſame thing. The only difference between the Old and the New, being in the mode of Adminiſtration, as has been opened once and again. Let me here further add, (ſeeing this Objector doth call this a New Law of Faith, as a part of the the New Creation; brought in and perfected particularly, and only upon the firſt day of the Week, and upon no other day, as he pretends:) that, this, Grace of Faith was put into a Law under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation; for, beſides that, if there had been no Law for this Faith, under that Diſpenſation, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4. 15, &amp; 5. 13. 1 John 3. 4.</note> it had been no ſin, no tranſgreſſion not to have believed with that Faith; for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of ſome Law; and I have ſhewn, it was Chriſt manifeſting himſelf to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in the wilderneſs, whom the Iſraelites did ſo often tempt, grieve, provoke, and not <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 18. 22, 32. Heb. 3. 12, 18, 19. &amp; 4. 2, 11.</note> not believe. But further, Faith in that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah Aelohim,</hi> who proclaimed the ten words at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was a plain du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, injoyned in the firſt word or command; and that Promulgator, I have proved to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or Chriſt. So that it was a duty actually to believe him, to believe in him. Faith in the Lawgiver is <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 18. 25. 26. 2 Chron. 20. 20.</note> one of the ways and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had here given a diſmiſs unto this (that I might haſten to the laſt particular:) but that I called to mind, how another adverſary of, and objector againſt, the Seventh-day Sabbath had affirmed, that the Decalogue had leſs in it than the Law of Nature, and that therefore it was never intended for a mere or perfect Tranſcript of the Law of Nature. (Although, if he had improved his own conceſſion, he might have ſeen how he tacitely gave an anſwer to his own Objection; for he ſays, That the chief Heads of Natutes Law are contained in the Decalogue:) He gives inſtances in divers particulars; ſome of the chief of them, in which he ſeems much to glory, I ſhall examine: In which he judgeth the Decalogue is defective, ſuch as the belief of the Soul, to love our ſelves with a juſt and neceſſary Love, to fame and mortifie all our fleſhly luſts, in order to our Salvation, to deny all bodily Pleaſure, Profit, Honour, Liberty and Life, for the ſecuring of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>Let the conſiderate Reader now ſpiritually, according to the Word of Truth, diſcern in theſe matters. If the Scripture-rules of interpreting theſe ten Words, Laws or Commands be obſerved, allowed and applyed, it will be manifeſt, That they are a comprehenſive, as for other things, ſo for the particulars ſpecified; ſo far as doth concern the diſcharge of Duty, and the avoiding of Sin. Theſe general Laws do take in more particulars, than is commonly obſerved, for the particulars are expreſſed by ſome word or other, in the general Law, which by collating of other Scriptures in the Original words and phraſes doth evidently demonſtrate this; which is well worth the noting and improving for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of this decalogue-Science. The definition of every one of the ten Words, is ſo fully and comprehenſively fitted, as they take in all the Laws of Natural Holineſs and Righteouſneſs: So that, we may ſay with the <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 11, 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is it not plain here, that the Scripture Doctrine of the Soul, is to be believed? And this as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the due bounds of the Decalogue? That Chriſt doth here ſpeak of the Law of the ten words is evident, by collating of <note n="f" place="margin">Mar. 12. 28.-34.

This expoſition of the Law-maker himſelf, is a ſufficient warranting of this interpretation; For, he doth make the ſum of the firſt Table, (to which the four firſt words do belong:) to be the loving of <hi>Jehovah</hi> our <hi>Aelohim, with all our heart, and with all our ſoul, and with all our might.</hi> And the ſum of the ſecond Table; (which takes in the ſix laſt words:) to be; <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> And <note n="h" place="margin">Mar. 12. 30.

So that the whole in his All, and in every part of him is concerned and engaged in this Love.

They give two Inſtances: one in the twelfth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the beginning of that Chapter; the other in the fifth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> the ninth, tenth, and ſo on to the ſixteenth Verſe. As to the the former, concerning Chriſt's Diſciples plucking the Ears of Corn, and eating, on the Seventh-day, and Chriſt's plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cauſe, Conſider well their Caſe, in all the Circumſtances of it. They did what was lawful on the Seventh day, it being a needful refreſhing of their outer man, thereby to ſtrengthen for Sabbath-worſhip and Service, where other proviſion was wanting, a work of Mercy, as Chriſt ſhewed it to be; an action tending towards the Sanctification of the Sabbath, and not bringing any Duty thereof. It was according to what the Law of <hi>Jehovah</hi> did allow, in the two laſt Verſes of the twenty third Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which had founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in right Nature, and in juſt Equity amongſt all Mankind, who did allow this in a caſe of preſent neceſſity. And this Chriſt's doth further exemplifie in a like caſe of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the later: Where Chriſt healed the man diſeaſed, and bid him, <hi>To take up his bed and walk:</hi> And this on the Sabbath-day. The diſeaſed man was there on his bed, in the way of his cure; a cure was lawful on the Sabbath-day, a doing good on ſuch a day, a work of neceſſity, and of mercy; and ſo lawful. This was a Work that the diſeaſed man could not foreſee, or prevent before the Sabbath came; nor being healed, was he to delay it till the Sabbath was over; left he had loſt that of his goods, which his duty was ſo to preſerve; (the Creator on the Seventh-day Sabbath preſerved his Creatutes, which he had made on the ſix foregoing days of the ſame week) It was a publick Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the truth of the Cure, and of the power of the Healer, who as God-man ſpake the cure; It was an act of Faith and of Obedience, in him who was whole, and did not hinder any Sabbath-worſhip: For you may find him in the Temple, in the fourteenth Verſe.</p>
            <p>Having already proved, that the LORD Jeſus Chriſt was Admininiſtrator under the Old Teſtament: and that he was the Promulgator of the Law of the ten Words at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> who was to be believed and obeyed in that Day, as well as now; and that, the end of the Law alſo, the great deſign, drift, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and meaning of it was, Chriſt for Righteouſneſs to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth: That which is now upon my hand to defend and maintain is, that it is ſtill a Rule of Obedience now unto the New Teſtament; for the confutation of <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 24. 12.</note> Anomy or Antinomianiſm.</p>
            <p>This Law of the ten Words was confirmed by the expreſs Doctrine of our LORD Jeſus Chriſt, when he took to his God-head the Humane Nature, born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and dwelt here on Earth, and converſed with men for ſome years, <note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 5th, 6th and 7th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> particularly in his Sermon at the Mount.

The Will of the LORD, concerning what is or is not to be done, which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he has revealed it to all, or to any of Mankind, is ſtill the ſame with this holy, righteous Law, when ever he has ſignified to man, what his requirements from man in theſe matters are: Unto his Will muſt the will of all Mankind be conformed; all Mankind is always bound to will that, which God would have them to will; all Mankind, who have the uſe and the exerciſe of right Reaſon, cannot but acknowledge, that the two great comprehenſive Summaries of the ten Words do bind them all, which are, <hi>To love the LORD our God with all our heart, and with all our ſoul, and with all our mind; and to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves;</hi> all are reduced to this bipartite Univerſal Law. Though the LORD variouſly reveal his Will and his Word for the manner, yet his Will and his Word is one and the ſame for the Matter. That Law of the ten Words, which was written on Tables of Stone, is the ſame in the true Nature of it, with that which is written in the hearts of men; all the ten Words are the prime dictates of right pure Nature, as ſoon as they are offered to a man's mind and cogitations, they preſently command his aſſent and conſent, and require his Faith and Obedience; they carry along with them a clear ſelf-evidence, leaving no place for doubtingneſs, where the proper ſignification of the words is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently perceived, they are ſelf-credible, and ſhine forth in their own light and authority, ſo conſentaneous to innate light, is the whole matter of them; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Revelations thereof, do exactly agree to its internal expreſſions, this Law has been publickly Read and Preached in that Miniſtery of the Word, Which the Church did injoy in all Ages, a perpetual means, and a bleſſed Inſtrument which God hath uſed, for information in what is the Duty of Man, for convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what is ſin in Man, and for exhortation to all Holineſs, as an abſolute Law, and an Univerſal Rule. There never was, never will be, a repeal of this Law, which is ſo lively an expreſſion and draught of the Holy Righteous Nature of <hi>Aelohim</hi> himſelf.

There is Non-inhabited un-inhabitable Earth ſpoken off, by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who, a little after that, doth make mention particularly of the Seventh-day Sabbath: It ſhould therefore be examined by theſe Contenders, whether all Mankind ſhould not dwell there, where Sabbaths may unqueſtionably be kept without any ſuch ſtrifes of diſputations, and where the means of ſaving Knowledge, and of ſanctifying Grace are injoyable? As for the people of half-year-night, and of half-year-day, or of any people near either the North or South Pole, where ſome ſay is continual Day-light for many years together: Where do the holy Scriptures make mention of any ſuch people, whom the LORD would have ſo to meaſure their time? they are Scripture-days, which we muſt ſtick to, and reckon by.

meaſure of Time: Nights and Days, Weeks, and Months, and Years, have their conſtant motions, their ſucceſſive courſes, their unchangeable periods, and renewed returns. In every Nation and Country, where-ever men do inhabite, they muſt begin the Seventh day at that time, when that Seventh-day doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally begin in that place; and ſome of the Objectors do acknowledge that, even in thoſe Climates between ſeventy and ninety Degrees, there is an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpace of time, meaſured by hours, days, weeks, months and years, by which they overthrow moſt of the force of their own Argument. God commanded no impoſſibility in Nature, in requiring a determinate day in every week to be kept, as a weekly Sabbath by man, by all mankind, though ſome daringly would infer the quite contrary. We muſt take the Seventh-day as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath made, and continued it to us: The Law of the Seventh-day Sabbath, is not bottomed upon Ethnick Philoſophy, which has corrupted the Principles of Aſtronomy, and of Geometry, of Theology, and of Chriſtianity, but upon holy Scriptures, and created Nature. The Seventh-day Sabbath, inſtituted and commanded in Paradiſe, and renewed, and re-inforced at Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> (neither of which places were in the leſſer <hi>Judaea,</hi> or <hi>Canaan,</hi> and therefore, this Law of the fourth Word was not a local Precept, of force no where but in that leſſer <hi>Judaea</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> as ſome affirm; this Seventh day Sabbath) is ſuch a kind of day, as may be known, kept and obſerved by men: where-ever they ſhould inhabit: That day in every week, which followeth the ſix foregoing known days of labour, is none of ours; it is the day of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> he hath plainly pointed it out to us in this Law; none need to ſay, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hereof is hidden from us, who ſhall aſcend for us into Heaven, and bring the knowledge thereof to us, that we may know it, and obſerve it? it is clearly demonſtrated to us by <hi>Aelohim</hi> himſelf: we may not make the Sabbath-day the ſixth day, for then we ſhould ſhew our ſelves unthankful in not receiving the LORD's own bountiful allowance unto us of ſix days for labour in our particular Functions: Neither are we to make it the eight day, for then we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on the LORD's Right, and are not contented with his liberal Grant of ſix days for our own employments. It might be asked of theſe Objectors, whether God have any Covenant People near the North Pole and South Pole? if ſo, whether they have not the Scriptures?

Oh how much is it to be lamented, that although the Seventh day Sabbath be ſo evidently and plainly aſſerted through the whole Scripture, yet multitudes who have and do own the Scriptures, will not as yet receive this holy Law of Chriſt, whilſt there is any thing that doth but look like ſomewhat of an Objection againſt it, they take up with every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conjecture, though beſides and againſt the Word; many there are who will rather boldly attempt to throw down all weekly Sabbaths, than humbly ſubmit, and obedientially conform to <hi>Jehovah's</hi> determinate weekly time of the Seventh-day, though Scripture and Nature have joyntly eſtabliſhed it. <note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 30. 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12. 13, 14.

The firſt Creational days and week were the juſt meaſure of every after week, and of the days thereof in the ordinary courſe, ſucceſſion, and revolution; and particularly the fourth, fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh days of that firſt created week were meaſured out by the heavenly luminaries, and the three foregoing days of that week were of the ſame nature. As to evening, darkneſs and night going before the after morning, light, and day: all and every of the ſeven days of that week, As days, were ſuch as the after-days, and were the meaſure of after-days in their ſtated order; it was night and day in the ſeveral parts of the earth, as it is now: the well ſetled frame of the ſtanding ſtatute of created Nature is not to be inverted. Could not, did not, the creating <hi>Aelohim</hi> carry the foregoing created evening, darkneſs and night, and the following, morning light and day in the ſame moments of time to cauſe the ſame beginnings, continuings and endings of nights and of days, whereſoever and whenſoever it is night and day, any where, in any part of the earth then as it is now? Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and light were ſevered, then both in nature and in time: this Author doth acknowledge a revolution of them on the firſt created day: and that, the night was before the day in one Hemiſphere. From this part of the earth is the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture account, in the oppoſite part it is Sea; by his own arguing, it could not be night every where at the ſame time, for light was in the other Hemiſphere, and ſo the firſt day did not every where begin at the ſame time; for, it could not be day where it was evening and dark, nor night where it was morning and light; thus, has he intangled himſelf in his own net of humane reaſoning, which he ſo ſpread to have catched ſeventh-day-ſabbath obſervers. If when Sun, Moon, and Stars were created and put into their moving walks, on the fourth day, they made an univerſal day that ſo all ſeven might in a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of length and number anſwer to one another, as he affirmeth, Then at the ſame time it was night in ſome parts at full noon when the Sun ſhone in its ſtrength and the light was cleareſt and fulleſt; and then alſo it was day in ſome parts at the mid of night when it was darkeſt (as the two parts of a natural day are diſtinguiſhed) and yet both theſe he aſſerts to be an univerſal day, contrary to Scripture and Nature, he ſaith, a little after, that, Sun ſetting was in ſome places on the fourth day before Sun-riſing, and therefore it may be inferred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this conceſſion, that, it was night in ſome places when it was day in other places; in other places it was Sun-riſing before it was Sun-ſetting; he, who would make it otherwiſe in reſpect of the wide earth, muſt take this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors bare words for it without any proof: our weeks and the days thereof here in <hi>England</hi> are as the firſt week and the days thereof were at the firſt creation of this part of the earth, unleſs he can evidence, that it was ſince that brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſome other part of the earth, and if he could do that, yet it would make nothing for the proving of his main general aſſertion, whilſt the main of the preſent inhabited earth doth ſtand firmly in the ſame place where it was at the firſt before it was inhabited.</p>
            <p>There is one part of his objection, which doth expect to have ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to it, wherein he thus argueth and reaſoneth; our Sunday ſabbath, ſaith he, is the very ſame day of the week, which was anciently obſerved by Jews and Gentiles for the ſolemn day of their ſolemn weekly worſhip, beginning at the light part or morning of the day, before <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and after that by the Gentiles, and ſince Chriſts time by Gentil pagans and by Gentil-Chriſtians, thus far he, the proof whereof, he referreth us to ſome humane Authorities, having quite contrary humane hiſtories, which do relate a different practice, ſome whereof I am upon this occaſion even neceſſitated to point unto;
