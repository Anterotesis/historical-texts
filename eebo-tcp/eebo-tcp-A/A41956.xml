            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43515:4"/>
Importance, that it requires both your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Attention, and ſerious Conſideration; eſpecially of thoſe who are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned in it; and a Subject too, which from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Precept to the Prieſts, appears in ſome meaſure a Duty incumbent on me to treat on: Thus the Exhortation begins, <hi>verſe 1. When thou goeſt out to battel againſt thine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enemies, and ſeeſt horſes, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: For the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</hi> And then 'tis added in the next verſe, <hi>And it ſhall be when ye are come nigh unto the battel, that the Prieſt ſhall approach and ſpeak unto the people, and ſhall ſay unto them, Hear, O Iſrael, you approach this day unto battel againſt your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble; neither be ye terrified becauſe of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you againſt your enemies, to ſave you.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43515:4"/>The Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> foreſeeing the great Conſternation the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, by reaſon of the dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that ſhould poſſeſs them, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the mighty Power, and boaſting Inſults of their Enemies, directs the Prieſts to animate and encourage them againſt theſe terrors in the day of battel; and for this end and purpoſe preſcribes ſuch a method in the words of my Text, as in all probability might raiſe their ſpirits above thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dangers; which Words are a Dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Fear or Puſilanimity, deſcribed in all its kinds and degrees: <hi>Let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ye terrified becauſe of them:</hi> Which Dehortation is founded on this infallible Antidote againſt Fear, or the moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Reaſon to expel it, in the Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following: <hi>For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your enemies, to ſave you.</hi> Tho the Enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> appeared in all reſpects terrible, and in a manner invincible, by reaſon of their Strength and Numbers,

yet allowing there was one mightier than they, ſo long as the Lord of Hoſts was their God, ſince they might aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that he would not only accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and aſſiſt them againſt their Enemies, but protect and ſhelter them under the ſhield of his Power, they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves like men, and in the moſt extreme dangers baniſh all Fear, in a full aſſurance of Victory and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>The Promiſes made by God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed, That they ſhould be a Numerous People; that they ſhould be reſcued and delivered from their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage; that they ſhould diſcomfit and deſtroy the mighty Hoſts of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and enjoy a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, that is, full of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Plenty, was in every Circumſtance fulfilled and compleated. The Miracles that were wrought for the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> at ſundry times, and divers places, ſufficiently teſtifie, that they were under
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43515:5"/>
the peculiar Care and Protection of the Almighty; as the Judgments that fell on their Adverſaries, declared them to be under his Diſpleaſure. Whilſt they were journeying in the Wilderneſs towards the Land of Promiſe, they had a Cloud that led them by day, and a Pillar of Fire to direct them in their way by night: They had <hi>Manna,</hi> the Food of Angels, ſhowered on them for Bread; and Quails for Fleſh, to ſatisfie their Hunger; and the Rocks guſhed forth Water to quench their Thirſts: As to the Succeſs that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended their Arms, <hi>Joſhua</hi> declares (when he cautions them neither to ſerve nor bow down to the falſe Gods of their Enemies) this as a reaſon, <hi>Joſhua 23. 9, 10. For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and ſtrong; but as for you, no man hath been able to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you unto this day. One man of you ſhall chaſe a thouſand; for the Lord your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promiſed you.</hi> But on the other ſide, as for their Enemies, <hi>when they had ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43515:6"/>
craftily, taken ſecret counſel, and ſaid, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people, and that the name of Iſrael may be no more in remembrance:</hi> when they were grown ſo inſolent as to boaſt their own ſtrength, and deſpiſe their Adverſaries as weak; when they ſpoke diſdainfully, and blaſphemed the Name of the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> then it was that the mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them were ſlain; then it was that the deſtroying Plagues were inflicted on them. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> repreſents <hi>Pharaoh</hi> proudly boaſting in the <hi>15th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and the <hi>9th</hi> Verſe, <hi>I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil; my luſt ſhall be ſatisfied upon them; I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt marching after them, were ſore afraid, and began to expoſtulate with <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Becauſe there were no graves in Egypt, haſt thou taken us away to die in the wilderneſs? Wherefore haſt thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto the People, <hi>Fear ye not, ſtand ſtill,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43515:6"/>
and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew to you to day: For the Egyptians whom ye have ſeen to day, ye ſhall ſee them again no more for ever.</hi> All which was ſoon verified in the event. <hi>For the children of Iſrael went into the midſt of the Sea upon the dry ground, and the waters were a wall unto them on the right hand, and on the left.</hi> But when their Enemies purſued them, <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters returned, and covered the charets, and the horſemen, and all the hoſts of Pharaoh that came into the Sea after them: there remained not ſo much as one of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus far briefly ſhewed how the words of my Text have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in relation to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in thoſe viſible Aſſiſtances and ſignal Deliverances wrought for them by the Arm of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and reflecting of what force the ſucceſsful Conſequences were, to embolden and inſpirit them againſt their Enemies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the undoubted Conſideration, that God was on their ſide. I ſhall now proceed to apply this Dehortation to you all; Vigour and Cheerfulneſs being as neceſſary in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43515:7"/>
Promoters of any Deſign, as well as in thoſe who are to put it in execution. Every man who loves his Country, his Religion, his Liberty, and who doth not eſpouſe a <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; that is, every honeſt <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and thoſe engaged in our Intereſts, being like to ſhare either in the Miſcarriages or Succeſs. And now would to God I could addreſs my ſelf to you with the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of prevailing (as the Prieſts of <hi>Levi</hi> did to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi>) and tho it would look like too much preſumption in me to declare any thing abſolutely and poſitively; yet I will endeavour, and I am ſure I may adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to offer ſuch Reaſons to your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as may raiſe your Hopes, expel all Fears, and ſtrengthen your Faith, that ye may ſtedfaſtly believe that the Almighty go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with you, to fight for you, and to ſave you. Therefore, <hi>Let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neitheir be ye terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied becauſe of them</hi>—</p>
            <p>Fear is properly diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts or kinds, Fear, and fearfulneſs; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43515:7"/>
The Affection or Paſſion of Fear, as it is oppoſed to Hope. 'Tis a Diffidence or Deſpondency, tamely yielding to, or timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly flying from an approaching evil; it hath its different ſymptoms and degrees ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Object or Subject-matter it is concerned in. The latter, which I call fearfulneſs, is a Vice, as it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or want of Fortitude; It renders men either unwilling to undergo any hardſhips, or to expoſe themſelves to Hazards and Danger, and cauſes them to ſhrink from, and avoid what is the duty of a valiant man to perform; this, as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath its effects and degrees, both kinds being comprehended in the ſenſe of my Text, expreſt by Faintheartedneſs, viſible by its external or outward Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, ſuch as a palpitation or beating of Heart, trembling of the Joints, paleneſs of the Face, and heſitation of the Tongue, ariſing by degrees to a Pannick or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Fear, when men are over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove terrified by ſome approaching Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43515:8"/>For as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to contend with the mighty Hoſts of the dreadful Enemies, the Race of <hi>Anak,</hi> Gigantick men, arm'd with the moſt formidable Weapons; ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> directed the Prieſts to encourage and animate them againſt thoſe frightful Apprehenſions they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd of them: And though they were unequal, both in reſpect of their numbers, ſtature and ſtrength, yet this one convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Motive or Reaſon, <hi>that the Lord would be on their ſide,</hi> was ſufficient to ſupport their fainting Hearts, and raiſe them to ſuch a degree of aſſurance, as was of force to inſpirit their benum'd Bodies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all the damping Fears and Terrors they might be poſſeſs'd with. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>As there is a Vicious, ſo there is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and Religious Fear too; mention'd by <hi>Solomon</hi> in theſe words, <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom,</hi> that is, an awful dread of God, when we have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43515:8"/>
for his Name and Word. And here I cannot but reflect on thoſe who are guilty of blaſpheming the Holy and tremendous Name of God in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcourſe; if any ſuch there ſhould be here, to them, I am ſure, I might have ſpared this Dehortation from fear, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe who do not fear, who dare provoke the Anger and Deteſtation of the Almighty by their Imprecations, and fooliſh Oaths, cannot fear the weak weak Efforts of mortal men; can any man be more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring than he who calls upon God for Damnation? Certainly Death in all its frightful Shapes cannot be terrible to him, who ſlights and deſpiſes the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger of Eternal Flames and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments: And as the fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, by diſobeying his Commands, is the beginning of Wiſdom (that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>will make us wiſe unto ſalvation</hi>); ſo alſo the fear of God is the beginning of Fortitude; 'tis that which lays the ſure foundation of Courage; For 'tis almoſt impoſſible, that

he that doth not fear God, ſhould be fearleſs of Man: There may be other Motives indeed which may oblige a man not to misbehave himſelf, or play the Coward, ſuch as Honour, Duty, and Intereſt, but theſe are accidental, and from without: But on the other ſide, if he fears God, his Courage is rais'd from a nobler Principle, Dangers become inſignificant, Death hath loſt its Terrors, becauſe his paſſage out of this Life is but to a better, and he hath a hopeful proſpect of future Rewards: So that if we take care to ſecure an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the next World, I preſume the way thither will prove far eaſier, by a Sword, or Bullet, than by the lingring Deaths of the Gout; or Stone, or by the acute Diſeaſe of a burning and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Fever.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to enquire into the nature and cauſes of Fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhew how little reaſon any man hath to fear, who is engaged in this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43515:9"/>
Honourable undertaking. 'Tis an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity incident to the nature of Man, to fear, ſo long as we are clothed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible fleſh, we are and ſhall be ſubject to paſſions (the <hi>Stoicks</hi> indeed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility enough maintained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but their Opinions have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently derided and exploded) yet the ſtrength of natural courage in ſome men, hath made the ſame difficulties eaſily ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable by them, which others have trembled at. Uſe and Cuſtom (which is a ſecond and more powerful nature) makes men gain ſo full a maſtery over fear, that they willingly undertake and eaſily perform the moſt dangerous enterprizes. So that when I reflect, that many of you here have been well acquainted, and long accuſtom'd to hazards, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd them with bravery and reſolution, I may eaſily affirm, that no danger can ſhake that rooted habit of courage you are maſters of: And I dare alſo be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that thoſe who have had little or no experience, animated by your examples,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43515:10"/>
will attempt to equal, if not out do, the pattern you ſhall ſet them. It may not perhaps be an unjuſt or improbable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to think, that there are ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, <hi>falſe-hearted</hi> as well as <hi>faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted</hi> men, among us, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as there were <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, who frighted their Companions with the ſtature and ſtrength of the <hi>Anakims</hi>) there are I fear too many bribed and unthinking men, who induſtriouſly make it their buſineſs to diſcourage us. by leſſening our actions, magnifying and aggrandizing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and courage of our enemies. It muſt be confeſt, that we have to do with powerful and ſubtle Enemies, and 'twould be imprudent as well as unſafe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and deſpiſe them, yet at the ſame time, 'tis true, that we are upon equal terms with them in every reſpect, and 'twill be no great conceſſion to allow them preference, in <hi>unworthy corruptions</hi> and <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble treacheries.</hi> Beſides, we will grant them to be men of Courage, becauſe mean
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43515:10"/>
Adverſaries give no Honour to the ſucceſs of their Competitors, and thoſe Atcheiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are moſt glorious, when the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes meet with oppoſition and difficulties. But we are not altogether ſtrangers to their methods, when they would paſs <hi>treachery</hi> upon us for <hi>bravery,</hi> and it is not long ſince they have undeceiv'd us as to their <hi>bribed Character,</hi> and have viſibly verified, what Hiſtorians have always recorded of them, <hi>That at their firſt onſet they were more than Men, at the ſecond leſs then Women.</hi> We have leſs reaſon, I hope, to fear them, and they more to fear us, and I queſtion not, but they will find that we are not wholly degenerated, and tho' all methods have been formerly uſed to make us <hi>diſſolute,</hi> and ſo conſequently <hi>effeminate,</hi> yet ſtill the ſame Seeds of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Courage remain in us undeſtroyed, and the preſent example of an <hi>Heroick</hi> and <hi>Gallant</hi> King will make them ſhoot up and flouriſh, and excite us to imitate what even our <hi>Forefathers</hi> acted in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43515:11"/>
the <hi>French</hi> may experimentally find, that we have neither forgot to attempt and perhaps ſucceed too. Beſides, 'tis <hi>Liberry</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> that for the moſt part makes men valiant and couragious, when on the contrary, <hi>cowardice</hi> is the natural Product and Off-ſpring of <hi>Slavery.</hi> Thoſe who are kept under and trampled on, can hardly aſpire to noble and brave attempts. For which reaſon in an Air and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo well temper'd as ours, where neither extream heat or cold is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, where neither <hi>arbitrary Power</hi> nor an <hi>ungovernable Liberty</hi> prevails, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe the Hearts and Spirits of thoſe Subjects will be ſprightly and bold, agreeable to their Conſtitution and Climate. Nor is this conſideration im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to encourage you, ſince your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are <hi>abſolute Slaves.</hi> Nor is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they will fight heartily, who have nothing to defend they can properly call their own, and I preſume 'twill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evident upon Trial, that when men are <hi>Slaves</hi> to a <hi>barbarous Tyrant,</hi> they will
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43515:11"/>
be ſo too, to fear and baſeneſs of Spirit. Again, The deſign it ſelf, barely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is enough to raiſe the moſt dejected ſpirit into courage; but when reflected on in all its glorious Circumſtances and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Conſequences, then it hath force enough to tranſport us beyond the bounds, even of prudential Fortitude, to attack an <hi>inſulting enemy</hi> at his own door, to endeavour ſomething extraordinary to reſettle our Friends and Allies into their own poſſeſſions unjuſtly ſeiz'd and detain'd from them, to be the generous inſtruments of ſo great and ſo much good to all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> at leaſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> in attempting to lower the grandeur of that <hi>Pharaoh-like</hi> and <hi>ſwelling Tyrant,</hi> to redeem and retreive the Intereſt and Honour of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is in a manner loſt, to be the Arbitrators of the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to have it in our power to hold the Ballance ſo equal, that none ſhall over-run or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Neighbour, which is in effect, to give Laws to all other Princes, certainly this muſt give ſuch an edge to the attempt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43515:12"/>
as muſt make thoſe who are actors in it even out do themſelves. It was bravely ſaid of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the affrighted Marriners who almoſt deſpair'd of ſafety in a violent Storm, <hi>Be of good cheer, ye carry</hi> Caeſar <hi>with his Fortune;</hi> thus ye go with <hi>Caeſars</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune too, ye fight under his Banner who was always a ſtranger to fear, yet well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with never avoided dangers. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are weighed with <hi>Judgment,</hi> and his <hi>Counſels</hi> with <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>circumſpection,</hi> his <hi>deſigns</hi> becauſe laid with <hi>wiſdom</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with <hi>reſolution,</hi> have ſeldom prov'd abortive or fail'd of ſucceſs. If he hath been diſappointed at one time, he hath ſucceeded at another with intereſt, and made amends for the loſs, with a double advantage. He never imprudently truſted in the uncertain arm of fleſh, or vainly and proudly boaſted his Victories as ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own ſtrength or conduct, but always with a <hi>religious deference,</hi> gave the whole Honour and Glory to the <hi>Lord of Hoſts, ſtrong and mighty in Battle;</hi> therefore I cannot, for my own part, but believe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43515:12"/>
that God, will, in his own due time, Crown his Endeavours and Deſigns with <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Succeſs,</hi> and cloth his enemies, whether Foreign or Domeſtick, with <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>confuſion of face.</hi> I could not but offer this weighty Conſideration as a forcible Motive, amongſt many others, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to Embarque in this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whatſoever it is or whereſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) with vigour and courage, ſince 'tis in his ſervice, and in obedience to his commands, who hitherto hath been, and I truſt in God, will ſtill continue, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of Heaven.</p>
            <p>'Tis hardly poſſible to enumerate or foreſee the invaluable advantages we may reap, by an undaunted proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Expedition;</hi> how far 'twill tend to procure an uninterrupted tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at home, under the happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we now enjoy, how much 'twill ſecure and enlarge our <hi>Trade and Commerce</hi> abroad, and make us both a terror to our enemies, and the admiration and envy even of our Confederates and Allies. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43515:13"/>
but on theſe Conſiderations, for they ſpeak an <hi>Exhortation.</hi> For my part, I muſt declare, I am ſo fully perſwaded of your forwardneſs, that could I be guilty of a thought, that look'd like a miſtruſt of any mans zeal amongſt you to promote and purſue this noble enterprize, the next words ſhould be an Apology for it. Having thus far obſerv'd, and laid before you theſe obvious reaſons to expel all the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of fear. I proceed now to offer ſome few Conſiderations to perſwade you, that in all probability God will go with you, to fight for you and to ſave you. The works of Providence are framed in the depth of God's Wiſdom. His Counſells are ſteady and immutable. He who ſhall look ſlightly on the different poſition of the Wheels of a Clock, at the firſt ſight perhaps they will appear confuſedly mixt among each other, yet by the skill and judgment of the Artificer, every the leaſt part is ſo order'd, that the motion is both juſt and regular, and anſwers the end for which it was at firſt deſign'd. So let a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43515:13"/>
man caſt his eyes round, view, and reflect on the affairs of this World, what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of intereſts there ſeems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men? what alterations in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms? what Revolutions of things? one Country deſtroyed and loſt, another regain'd? one intereſt prevailing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinking; to our ſhallow apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the whole Scene of Affairs appears full of giddy and unſteady Chance; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in this ſeeming diſcord of jarring of things, the All-wiſe God makes them all Harmonious, and compoſed, and ſerve the purpoſes and deſigns he intended to bring to paſs. He beholds at once, things paſt, preſent, and to come, they muſt obey his unbounded Will, becauſe his Power is <hi>Almighty.</hi> Through the paſt favours and influences of his Providence we have already experimented, abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie, that God hath taken our Cauſe into his own hand and management; He hath viſibly eſpouſed our intereſt and will ſupport it, if our ingratitude and ſins do not force him from it. He who hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43515:14"/>
commanded the Winds and the Waves to conduct our <hi>Joſhua</hi> (as great a Deliver to us as the former to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) through the perils and dangers of the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and foaming Waves, to reſcue us from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> (a Bondage, which would have equal'd that of <hi>Egypt</hi>) He who hath wonderfully preſerv'd the Perſon of our King, expos'd to the moſt apparent dangers both by Sea and Land, that God who hath rais'd the Spirits and Courage of our Officers and Souldiers to attempt the greateſt and almoſt inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties, and hath given them ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and victory in the total reduction of <hi>Ireland.</hi> He who hath united the divided intereſts of the Confederates, that their Counſels and Armies are cemented into one common Obligation to ſecure and aſſiſt each other, notwithſtanding all the powerful and tempting Artifices that have been cunningly deviſed to break it. At the ſame time, that we do not own theſe providential Diſpenſations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, we muſt commence <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43515:14"/>
What ſhall I ſay more, that God, who hath diſcover'd and defeated the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ungrateful deſigns of thoſe, who would have expos'd us to the power of the moſt barbarous and mercyleſs enemy, who would have betray'd us to irrecoverable <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>ſlavery,</hi> to have been <hi>dragoon'd</hi> out of our <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> who would have ſubjected us to all the <hi>inſolencies</hi> and <hi>indignities</hi> that could have been inflicted on us, though at the ſame time, the encouragers and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the exquiſite miſcheifs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their conceited, but deluded fancies, would have been liable to this unavoidable <hi>dilemma,</hi> if they had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, they muſt have been <hi>Slaves</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> or if they miſcarried, mark'd with the diſgrace and infamy of being <hi>betrayers of their native Country.</hi> But as a Crown to all, they, who will not willfully ſhut their eyes, againſt thoſe viſible Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which attended and procur'd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to our Fleet, muſt own and muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>that God was on our ſide and fought for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43515:15"/>
us,</hi> to have winds continue contrary when our enemies had a proſpect of compaſſing their deſigns againſt us, which at the ſame time favour'd us, by giving a timely and ſeaſonable opportunity to joyn our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Fleets, and then to have another wind to drive them upon us, when the advantage was on our ſide, to deſtroy ſo many of our enemies Ships and not ſuffer the loſs of one, ſeems ſtrange e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us now, and will hardly be believ'd by future ages. If all that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to your conſiderations, all this train of <hi>paſt Providences</hi> are not ſufficient to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh and confirm a relying Faith in you, to believe that God will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you with his guiding aſſiſtance and mighty power, all other <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> will prove ineffectual, and nothing will provoke his diſpleaſure more then this in conſiderate ſin of infidelity and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>God is juſt and righteous in all his dealings towards the Children of Men,</hi> he will deliver the oppreſſed and puniſh the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43515:15"/>
Oppreſſor, but we muſt wait his appointed, becauſe the moſt ſeaſonable time; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not be impatient and think it long when we have all the moſt cogent reaſons to believe it ſure and certain. God hath chained and limited the power of the <hi>Devil:</hi> He hath ſet bounds to the wide and maſterleſs Ocean, and when his infinite Wiſdom ſhall judge it beſt, he can humble the Pride, and will ſtop the Progreſs of the <hi>moſt inſolent</hi> and <hi>threatning Tyrant:</hi> And as all <hi>Empires</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> have had their growth and decay by ſteps and degrees, ſo the common enemy hath lately receiv'd a wound in his vital part, which I hope, and I believe, will be a certain fore-runner of his unpitied Fall. 'Tis uſual for men who unjuſtly graſp at all to loſe all: And God many times ſuffers <hi>Tyrants</hi> to raiſe themſelves to the higheſt pitch of grandeur, that their fall may be greater and more remarkable. And now, I cannot but mention the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>Spaniſh Invaſion</hi> againſt our Country and Religion, with their vainly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43515:16"/>
boaſted <hi>invincible Armado,</hi> which by the bleſſing of the Almighty upon our Forces at that time, not only came to nothing, and prov'd an infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bravado, but that defeat gave ſo deep a wound to that Kingdom, that all the healing Gold and Silver of the <hi>Indies</hi> ſince that time hath prov'd inſufficient for its recovery or cure: ſo that they, who at that time aſpired to a <hi>Weſtern Monarchy,</hi> have ever ſince, (cauſed by that fatal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,) been utterly unable to ſecure their own Territories: Nor is it in the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, but that the deſigns of the <hi>ſecond Weſtern Monarch</hi> may be blaſted, and that he may ſhare the ſame fate with his <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring Predeceſſor,</hi> having already receiv'd a wound too, in his moſt ſenſible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying part. For which reaſon amongſt thoſe many others I have enumerated, let not your hearts faint, fear not and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified becauſe of them; <hi>For the Lord your God is that goeth with you, to fight for you againſt your enemies, to ſave you.</hi>

            <p>

               <hi>To Conclude the whole,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is our indiſpenſible duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, and gratefully own all thoſe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd Mercies and Bleſſings we have from time to time receiv'd from the inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Fountain of Love and Bounty, ſo let us return our beſt Thanks to God, which cannot be better acknowledged and performed, than by a true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience to his Commands, let us adorn the Religion we profeſs, (and which God alone hath preſerv'd,) with our unſpotted Converſations and Lives viſibly Reform'd and Chriſtian; let us be <hi>Zealous</hi> to carry on and purſue with our utmoſt vigour the <hi>great Work,</hi> which by a train of Providences God Almighty ſeems to have deſign'd, that ſo in ſome meaſure we may engage his particular protection and favour, and ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the <hi>9th Pſalm, God is our ſtrength, in whom we will put our truſt.</hi> How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have we been ſurrounded with fears
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43515:17"/>
and dangers? How often have we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpair'd of thoſe Bleſſings which we now enjoy? God hath moſt undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably manifeſted himſelf our Protector, Reſcuer and Preſerver. If paſt Mercies and Deliverances will not be of force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to an hearty and ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment of your Lives, 'twill be in vain for me to offer any reaſons or arguments to ſhake off and lay aſide your provoking Sins. When men unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent, God will repent him of the Judgments he hath purpoſed to bring upon them, and avert them. So that if we ſtill continue obſtinate and unreform'd in our Lives the fault only lies at our own doors, and we juſtly ſuffer what we have fooliſhly and wilfully deſerv'd.
