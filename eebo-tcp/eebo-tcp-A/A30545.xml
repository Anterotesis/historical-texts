         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Covenant of God is unity betwixt God and man,
and a binding each to other to serve each other, the one
is bound to obey, and submit, and worship; and the other
to blesse, and keep, and lead, and preserve; this Covenant
is established with his own seed for ever, and there is no
teacher but God, all is taught of him, from the least to the
greatest, who are in this Covenant, his just Law is written
in their heart to condemn all transgression, and his pure
Spirit is put into the inward parts, to be the rule and
guide of life in all things, and none need to say know the
Lord, but all knows him in the Spirit, and worships him,
and obeys him, and follows him in spirit, and in truth,
and such are come into peace and reconciliation and God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and the Covenant with Hell and death is broken: and in
this Covenant, there is no Priest nor offering but Christ
Jesus the high Priest of God, the one offering for sinne, he
takes away sin and makes intercession, and in it is no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but our bodies are the temple of God, and he dwells
in us, and walks in us, and there is no circumcision but
the circumcision of the heart, which is the putting away
of all the uncleanness of the flesh, nor in it there is no means
of salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Christ the onely way the truth and the life,
and none comes to the Father but by him, he declares of
the Father and there is no light but the light of the Lamb,
all that are saved shall walk in the light of the Lamb, and
there shall be no need of any other light, no need of the
light of the Sun, nor of the Moon, nor of a candle, but the
Lord is unto them an everlasting light, and God alone
is their glory, and this Covenant is for ever, and cannot
alter nor change, but is sure unto the seed of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
but he that is born of the flesh hath no part in it,
who is shut out from the knowledge of God, who is not
known to the wisdom of this World, which is foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with God; and the knowledge of God is received no

other way but only by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and
by the working of the Spirit of the Father in the heart, he
opens the blind eye, and unstops the deaf ear, and changeth
the heart, and causeth it to understand, and he removes that
which hath stood in the way betwixt God and the creature,
which hath caused ignorance in the creature, that the Lord
could not be seen nor perceived. Christ Jesus the second
<hi>Adam</hi> lighteth every man and all mankind that cometh into
the world with the true light, but some hates the light, and
they will not come to the light, least their deeds should be
reproved, and their deeds are evill, and they are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

Christ hath enlightened them, they bring all their deeds
to the light, and walks in the light, and their deeds are
wrought in God never to be condemned, and such as loves
the light receives Christ and the knowledge of God, which
is eternall life, and none comes to the knowledge of God,
and of Christ any other way but through the light of Christ,
and by the operation of the Spirit of God, and evill is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

the traditions of men or any outward observance in the will

through all sufferings and tribulations with joy and patience:
Faith is an act of God in the creature, through it peace and

by Faith all things are received that are received of God by
any of his children: He that hath Faith sees and feels

               <p>WHatsoever work man is moved and led unto by the
Spirit of God, and guided and ruled in the practice
of, to speak or act whatsoever by the same Spirit (which
moveth and leadeth into all the works of righteousnesse,
and not into any evill) this is acceptable in the sight of the
Lord, and these works are well pleasing to him: where the
Lord goes before, and is the leader in all things, and this
man and his works who is led with the Spirit of the Father
is justified and accepted of God, and not for the creatures
sake, who respects not the person of any but for his own
Name sake, because they are wrought in him through faith,
and is moved unto, and guided in by his own Spirit, and
they arise from Gods righteousness revealed in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not from the righteousness of the creature, for
man being changed and replanted into the living Vine,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52817:14"/>
and the root being good, every work which springeth forth
from it is good also, and accepted of God, because the
root is so: But whatsoever works are brought forth by any
creature, though the same in appearance which are accepted
of God from another, yet not being moved unto, nor guided
in by the Spirit of the Father, but brought forth in the will
and wisdom of the creature, which is from below, and acted
in imitation from the Saints words; these works are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and well pleasing unto God, but is offence unto him,
and sin against him, even the sacrifice of the wicked is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
unto him, and if a man come before the Lord
with thousands of Rams, and ten thousand of Rivers of Oyl,
and if he give the fruit of his body for the sin of the soul,
and cover the Altar with tears, and is not led with a measure
of Gods Spirit, none of all these works are accepted; nor his
preaching, praying baptism, nor breaking of bread, nor any
other observances towards God whatsoever, are not good in
his sight but evill, and to be contemnted, and the root from
whence they spring; because man is in the enmity against
him, and not changed out of the old root, nor in that state
is not led with the holy Spirit of the Father; and the root
being bad, the branches are evill, and none are accepted of
God in any thing which they perform towards him,
but such as are in Christ Jesus, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and
such are new creatures, so that it is not for the creatures sake
that any work is accepted of, or offence against God, but
onely for his Name sake, and because of being guided, or
not of being guided with the measure of Gods pure Spirit:
Therefore is man and his works good and accepted; or evill
and not regarded, but condemned of God.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning mans state in the first Adam before conversion,
and his state after conversion, and what conversion is.</head>
               <p>MAns state in the first <hi>Adam</hi> in transgression, is a state
of perfect enmity against God, and death reigns in
every man, and he is possessed with blindnesse and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and unbelief, and is wholly imperfect to receive
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52817:14"/>
the things of Gods Kingdom, or to act any thing for God
acceptable to him; man in that state is wholly dead to
God, and insensible of the presence, and power, and life of
his Creator, for he is drove from God, and is not led by him,
he hath no power to perform any good in the sight of God,
but is possessed with evill, and led into all evill continually;
hee is free from righteousnesse, and free to all evill, being
the servant of the Devil, and subject to him, and overcome
of him every moment, and is led by him to transgresse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lord; his heart is unclean, and out of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
continually uncleannesse in all manner of words,
thoughts, and actions, which floweth out of the corrupt
fountain, which grieveth and vexeth the Lord and his
Spirit, who is dishonoured daily by man through his abuse
of Gods creatures, who is a devourer and destroyer of
them, and not a preserver as he ought to be, who abuseth
them upon his lust, and not to the glory of the Lord; he
loves the creature and worships the creature, and is gone a
whoring after the creatures, and hath forgotten God that
made him and all things, and hath lost his own dominion
wherein hee was set in his Creation, and his state in his
transgression is cursed of God, and without the peace of
God, it being in the enmity against him; and in all things
he is wholly unprofitable to his Maker, and onely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to himself and to the Devill, and this in short is the
state of every man in transgression before conversion; but
his state after conversion is a state more blessed, for man
is changed, and renewed, and translated by the power
of the Lord, through the working of the eternall Spirit
through conversion, his mind is changed, and his heart is
renewed, the old is done away, and a new heart is given,
and all things are become new, even every word and work,
and every intent and purpose of his mind, is converted into
another end, and guided by another spirit than before his
conversion; and man is again returned to God, into the sense
and feeling of his Maker, and into covenant with him
where he is blessed, and all things to him; for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
is made with God, and the evill is judged and
condemned, and sin is taken away and blotted out, and not
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52817:15"/>
remembred: for man is become servant unto God, and
onely serves him in all things, and not himself or any other
creature in any thing, for he hath received power to become
Sonne to God, and hath received power over the Devill
and his temptations, and death is destroyed, and the
effects of it are ceased, and the sting of it is taken away,
and life and immortality is brought to light, and man is
made capable to act in all things for the glory of his Maker,
and God hath made Christ wisdome to him, to rule him
and guide him in all things, and righteousnesse to cover
him, and justification to him to clear him in his sight,
and the new man is brought forth, and the creating in Christ
Jesus unto good works is known, and the birth, which
is heir of Gods Kingdome is witnessed, and unto this man
is the Lord become an everlasting light and a sure hiding
place, for he is not the servant of sin but of righteousnesse,
nor an offence to God in any of his works, but for his names
sake is well pleased with him; he is his teacher in all the
waies of peace, he is his helmet, and his shield, and
his hope of salvation, and his shepheard to feed him and
preserve him at all times; though he may be tempted, yet
he is not overcome, for God is his strength, though he may
be tryed, ye the is not forsaken of the Lord; though he
may be cast into the fire it is not to consume him, for the
Lord is with him; all things he receives as from the hand of
God, &amp; all creatures he enjoyes in the Covenant with God,
and peace is in all his waies, for it is the Lord that works
in him both to will and to do of his own good pleasure;
and this is the state of the new man brought forth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
which is a turning of the creature from the power
of Satan (which rules in every man before conversion,
to the power of God which is the ruler of every man that
is truly converted; and this is the truth as it is in Jesus,
which I have received from God, he that can receive it
let him, and if any have an ear let him hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

that all people may come to the knowledge of them, and
may tast, and handle, and feel of the same word of life in

our fellowship is with the Father and with the Son.</p>
               <p>And now be it known to all the world, and to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and power in all the earth, and of these truths with
many more, which are but one in Christ Jesus, hath God
given us the perfect knowledge of, even wrought them in

we may serve God in our generation, by bearing witnesse
of these things, which we have heard and seen; nothing
of this world, our liberty, our life, nor any other thing

that the Name of the Lord may be testified of, do we give
up our selves continually to suffer all manner of evil in words

truth and righteousness may be exalted, and this is the cause

               <p>And know ye assuredly that God, who is just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in all his wayes, it is he that setteth the way of life and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52817:16"/>
the way of death before every man, and he hath appeared
in this generation, and he hath caused his voice to be heard
in the earth, and he hath set the way of death and the way
of life before you, and all that perish it is through unbeliefe;
and because they do despise the way which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
who hath prepared a way for life and salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all people, that all may come to life and salvation, and
may not perish, and he hath not shut out any creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was brought forth into the world, but giveth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that cometh into the world a day of visitation and
a time of repentance and returning, that healing may be
received from the Lord, who is the restorer of lost man, and
there is not another; so that if man perish, it is of himself,
and not of God, who hath so loved mankind, that he hath
given his Son, his own wisdome and his power into the
world, that all that doth receive him (Christ Jesus) may
have everlasting life, and they that receive him not, they
perish because of unbelief, whereby they are hardened for
destruction, and unto such our Gospell, the Gospell of
God is hid, whose eye is blinded by the God of this world,

even above knowledge and all wisdome, which is of this
world which comes to nothing, but the Lord will confound
that and bring it to nothing, for the world by its wisdome
doth not know God, neither can it receive the things of
God, but is foolishnesse in the sight of God, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

and the wise men must stumble and fall, the powers of the
earth must be offended at him, that they may be confounded
and brought to nought, all the heathen shall rage, and
the people shall imagine a vain thing: but what of all this,
the testimony of the Lord is true which he hath given us to
bear of his Name, and of it we are not ashamed before the
face of the whole world, and we are armed to suffer for it,
and not only to subscribe to the truth of it with our hand,
or to declare of it with our tongue and pen, but also if we
be called to it, may seal it with our blood: Wherefore this

world; this is sent among: you as to give you the certain
knowledge of what we hold and bear witnesse to, which is
received of us from God, and born witnesse of to you by his
Spirit, even those things with many others which we have
not received from man but from God, are we purposed in
the Lord to declare abroad, and he hath put it into our
hearts to fulfill his will herein; for he hath spoken, who can
but prophesie, and he hath given the word, and many are
they that publish it in faithfulnesse against the kingdome of
the man of sin, which hath long been exalted in the earth
over the seed of God, which the Lord is now a gathering and
establishing his Covenant with, an <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that hath
long lain wast, shall be made the praise of the whole earth,
and the Gentiles which hath polluted her shall be cast out,
and the Saints shall rejoyce over all their enemies.</p>
               <p>And know you assuredly from us, who know the Lord,
that God is doing great things in the earth, he is begun to
work and his arm shall bring it to passe, he will overturn and
overturn, till he come to reign whose right it is, who will
change times and things, even that which cannot be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
though a man declare it unto you, is the Lord bringing
to passe; the eye shall blesse that sees it, and the heart shall

whatsoever, know ye assuredly that we are not enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
but friends unto all Civill Government, and to all
just and righteous orders and decrees, and wholsome Law
and Customs of any Common-wealth, and no way are we
destructive to, or destroyers of the Peace, and welfare, and
wholsome Laws (which is according to God) of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatsoever. But are preservers of the peace of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and waits in patience for the establishment of justice
and true judgement, and that righteousnesse may spring
forth, and the Government of all Nations may be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law of God. Neither are we such who makes
void the just Government of any Nation or City; neither
are we such who through evill purposes, plotteth, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spireth,
or contriveth evill in our hearts against any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
or Government whatsoever; but wisheth peace and
truth, and the fear of the Lord unto all men and Nations, and
desireth not the overthrow or evill to any people, or their
Government: but is subject to just Government every
where by obedience to it, and subject to evill Government
by suffering in patience under it; so that righteousnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
we wait to see set up through the world, and for that
cause suffereth patiently under our enemies, not seeking
revenge against them, nor envying the persons of any; but
pitties our enemies, and desireth their repentance rather
than their destruction: Yet this we give all to know, that
the Lord will be avenged on all them who hates the way of
righteousnesse, and all that opposeth the Lord and his way,
and despiseth his truth which he hath revealed, they shall
be confounded and broken to pieces, and shall confesse to
the Lord, and his way, and his truth in the day of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>Again, let all the earth know, that against all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
injustice, oppression, whoredom, murder and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
and all sin whatsoever, we do declare and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our selves to be enemies against all sin, and they that
commit it, and we cannot hide sin and iniquity in any, but
gives our testimony against it, and against all that live in it
whatsoever, without respect to men or places, and cannot
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52817:17"/>
flatter any man in his transgressions, but saith, that lying,
swearing, drunkenness, covetousness, injustice, dissimulation,
hypocrisie, murder, and envy, lust of the flesh, pride and
wantonnesse, and all the works of the flesh whatsoever, are
contrary to God, and of the devill, and they that lives in
them, and brings them forth, are the servants of the devill,
and must not inherit that kingdome of God, who brings
forth those works which grieves the Spirit of God, and vexes
his righteous soul, and this is that Government onely which
is the Government of sin and death, which we declare our
selves enemies to, which is of the devill and not of God;
and this is that Government which we testifie against, and
warrs against by the sword of the Spirit of God, and by
his power, and not by the carnall weapons or subtill conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
or violent insurrections; for this way, and by this
means shall not the Government of Satan be overthrown,
or the kingdom of Christ ever exalted.</p>
               <p>Again, let all the world know, that we are not such as
disanuls or makes voyd the Covenant and bond of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or teach any so to do, or give any example by our
practice to any subjects to be rebellious to their Governors,
or children to be disobedient to their Parents, or that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
be undutifull to their Masters. But on the contrary,
doth say and affirm it, that it is the duty of Subjects to be
obedient and subject in the Lord to their Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
whether Kings, Dukes or others, who have rule
over them; and also that Children should be obedient to
their Parents; and Servants to be dutifull and subject to
their Masters in the Lord in all things, and that Husbands
and Wives live in all unity and peace in the Lord: Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
onely, where Rulers, Parents, or Masters, or Husbands
requireth of their Subjects, Children or Servants or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whatsoever, requiring of their relations that which
is unjust and contrary to God and his righteous law; in
such a case we say, that Subjects, Children, Servants, and all
other whatsoever are free, and we say, where man requires
any thing contrary to God, and God requires another thing
contrary to man, the obedience to God is rather to be
chosen, and the obedience to all men is to be denyed; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52817:18"/>
this is our judgement which is according to truth, and is the
mind of God concerning subjection and obedience, and the
duty of Relations one to another.</p>
               <p>And lastly, know ye assuredly that we do not hold and
maintain any thing by conversation or doctrine, but the very
same truth in word and practice, as all our fore-Fathers
did, but bears witnesse of the same salvation by the same
Christ as they did, and are not setters forth of strange gods,
for no other God is worshipped by us than he, which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all the rest of the servants of
the Lord in every generation worshipped, served and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
neither are we such as doth maintain Heresie, Errour,
or Idolatry, or the worship of any strange god, though
hereof we are accused falsely, yet against us cannot it be
proved truly, and this we give the whole world to know,
that no other end, or purpose, or design is in our hearts, but
only to fulfil the will of God in all things as it is to us made
manifest. Even this is the resolution of our hearts, and the
full purpose of our minds. to give testimony through the
world as we are moved, both by writing and declaring of
these Truths which to us is known from the Lord, that truth
and righteousnesse may come to reign, and this may we do
as the Lord provideth way for us, nor fearing the face of
any man, nor being afraid of the threatning of high looks,
and that we may finish the testimony given us of God, our
life nor any other thing is dear unto us, and all ye people
every where, for your sake is this written to come abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, to give you warning and true information of
the work of the Lord, and what he is about to do, that you
may hear and understand, and may receive the knowledge of
those things which belong to your peace, and may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with an eternall salvation, or otherwise through this
are you wholly left without excuse if you perish: And unto
this was I pressed in spirit for many daies, that all the world
may be satisfied, what we are, and what we hold, and what
the purpose of the Lord is; and I whom God hath warned,
do warn all people upon the face of the earth, that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
prepare to meet the Lord, for his coming and his day
is nigh at hand, and his judgements shall be revealed in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52817:18"/>
Earth, and all flesh shall tremble before him, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the world shall be confounded at his presence;
The proud shall be abased, and the poor shall be exalted;
the high and lofty shall be brought down, and the meek and
upright shall be set up; Truth shall reign as King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
shall utterly be confounded; they that now suffer all
manner of evill for the Name of Jesus, shall possesse ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
freedome, and the dominion shall be in their hands,
and they that now cause the just to suffer, shall go into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
captivity, the seed of God shall spring forth and flourish,
but the seed of evill-doers shall never be renowned: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these two seeds is an enmity put, and they can never
be reconciled, each seed hath his fruit, the one is cursed and
the other is blessed, and each seed is known by its fruit, and
must receive from the Lord accordingly.</p>
               <p>And this is the testimony of the servants of the Lord, and
the witnesse which they give unto all the world of those
things which we have handled, tasted, heard, seen and felt;
blessed are all they thar can receive it.</p>
               <p>We are known to God in the Spirit, and one to another
in his life, and are known in the world by the name of
<hi>Quakers,</hi> cast upon us through the derision of the heathen.</p>
               <p>But Quaking and trembling at the World of the Lord; by
the servants of the Lord, we do own, when the power of
God reacheth to the witnesse of God in the creature, which
brings condemnation upon all high looks, and upon the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nature, which causeth the earthly part to tremble, we do
own and many of us do witness, the Quaking and Trembling
which is by the operation of the Spirit of God, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
operations by the one Spirit we own: which brings
down proud flesh, whose honour God will lay in the dust,
and bring it to everlasting contempt, and when this comes to
pass, quaking shall not be a strange thing, nor the Name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
as it is at this day by the proud spirits of men, who
knows not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his
Spirit.</p>
               <p>Moreover and besides all this, let all the world know, that
our conversation, life and practice is one and the same with
what we hold forth in words, and that we give as large a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52817:19"/>
testimony of God amongst us by pure conversation as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and doth deny them who gives testimony in words
onely, and answers not in their conversation, for that is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
and our souls loath it, and it is abomination in the
fight of the Lord, where he is profest in words, and not wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to in purity and righteousnesse of life, for righteousnesse
being brought forth in the heart, works of righteousnesse
will spring forth in the world, and where righteousnesse
springs not forth in the world, and the fruits of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, it shews that righteousnesse is not in the heart,
and that God is not known.</p>
               <p>Also concerning our Government, it is according to
Christ, whom we own to be head amongst us, and no other
head we have or do bow unto, and we are but members of
his body, joyned to him through the Spirit as head over us
all, and the greatest of us is but a member of Christ, who is
the head alone, and we have not another, neither can we
be subject to any other Government but his, or to obey any
Government but what is justly according to his, whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
must be set up in the earth, and for it we wait, and
labours, and travels, and counts nothing hard, but all things
are easie to us for this prise which is before us, even the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Christ to be set up, and all Governments of
men establisht according to it, and this is our testimony
which we give forth in words and practice, and if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
can seal it with our blood.</p>
               <p>And this is written for no other end, but that you may be
certainly informed what we are, and what we hold, and what
the Lord hath done, and what he is about to do in all the
earth, who is arisen, and hath said, Ah! I will ease me of my
Adversaries.</p>
