         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Formerly published half a Sheet
on this Subject, and having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of all I printed, I found
my self necessitated to Print
more, to gratify those who bought the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of me, but considering with my
self the scantiness of that paper, I took the
pains to write a larger which should be more
effectual, and as I hope will give better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
'Tis confest that there is very little
new in this (as in most other Books written
now a days) but what may be found among
former Authors. My chiefest care herein
hath been to collect and alter so that it might
<pb facs="tcp:36910:7"/>
serve my present purpose. As for the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
it self, being carefully made and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated
as is here described, I know of none
for Portableness, Universality, and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that doth exceed it, I mean with respect
to its finding the hour, whereby it becomes
absolutely useful for any Gentleman to carry
in his pocket, or to rectify his Watch or
Pendulum by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have endeavoured to
be as plain as possible for the sake of young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners,
that the reading of this might Create
in some a farther Inclination to the <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
which I heartily wish may flourish
not only as they are my Trade, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it is my Interest to promote them, but
because they are of so great and general
use and advantage to the Kingdom.</p>

the hour of the day, not in one place only
(as most sorts of <hi>Dyals</hi> do) but generally in all

3. That which crosseth the middle noted with

               <head>4. The Divisions on each part.</head>
               <p>One side of this Instrument according to
<hi>fig.</hi> I. is thus divided. 1. The <hi>Cursor</hi> of the
<hi>Meridian</hi> hath but one division or Notch as at
O. 2. One half of the <hi>Meridian</hi> is divided into
twice 90 degrees, which are again subdivided
into halfs, and these halfs are distinguished
from the Degrees, by a shorter line, these
Degrees are numbered at every ten, from their
middle O both wayes, by 10, 20, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 90,
and in these Degrees are the Latitudes of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
reckoned when you would find the hour
of the day. 3. The <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> is divided into
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36910:8"/>
24 hours, and each hour is subdivided into eight
parts, <hi>viz.</hi> halfs, quarters, and half quarters, and
some of them have the hours divided into 12
parts, and then every division stands for five
Minutes of time, whereof 60 make one hour,
these hours are numbred with I. II. III. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to twice XII. from the two opposite points in
the <hi>Meridian</hi> where this Circle is fastned. 4. On
this side the <hi>Axis</hi> is divided into months and
dayes, every division expressing 2 days, except
in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> at which time the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Suns course is almost insensible
for several days together, these Months are
known on one side the slit by these Letters,
<hi>I. F. M. A. M. I.</hi> Signifying, <hi>January, February,
March, April, May, June,</hi> on the other side by
these, <hi>I. A. S. O. N. D.</hi> for <hi>July, August, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,
October, November, December.</hi> 5. The
<hi>Cursor</hi> of the <hi>Axis</hi> hath a little hole through
it and a line a cross the hole, which line when
it is used is to be set to the day of the Month.</p>
               <p>The other side according to <hi>figure</hi> II. hath
only the <hi>Meridian</hi> and the <hi>Axis</hi> divided 1. The
<hi>Meridian</hi> hath a quadrant or 90 Degrees divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on it, whose center is at <hi>H.</hi> These Degrees
are again subdivided into halfs, and this I call
the <hi>Quadrant of Altitudes,</hi> it serving to give
the Altitude of the Sun, by the shadow of a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36910:9"/>
pin, or such like wire, which shall be stuck
upwright in the Center or hole <hi>H.</hi> 2. The
<hi>Axis</hi> on that side the slit <hi>D</hi> is divided into twice
23 ½ and numbered both ways from the middle O
by 10, 20, <hi>&amp;c</hi> and this is called the <hi>Line of Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
its use being to give the Declination of
the <g ref="char:circdot">⊙</g>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the other side the slit <hi>R,</hi> are divided
four hours and a half, which are again subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
Numbred by IIII / 8 V / 7 VI / 6 VII / 5 VIII / 4
and this line is to shew the Sun's rising and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at <hi>London,</hi> but because it is particular this
Line is left out in most Dyals. The Cursor on
this side as on the other hath the little hole
and a line a cross it.</p>
               <p>Besides these divisions on each side, on the
inside the Aequinoctial, in the middle, is a Line
upon which is graduated the 24 hours, and
parts agreeable to those on the side described in
<hi>fig</hi> I.</p>
               <p>Note that the Instrument thus made is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and will serve wheresoever you are, and
therefore most proper for Seamen and those
that Travel far. But for such as shall use them
about these his Majesties Dominions, it will
be sufficient to have but one Quadrant of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
graduated, and no more than 18 hours or
thereabouts, <hi>viz.</hi> from 3 in the morning to 9
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36910:9"/>
at night, and then the Instrument may be
afforded so much the cheaper.</p>

                     <p>THe Sun moves not alwayes in the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,
but Declines from it sometimes
toward the North, and sometimes towards the
South, every day, either moving in it or in
Circle parallel to it, this diversity of motion is
called the <hi>Suns Declination,</hi> now about the
10 day of <hi>March</hi> and 13 of <hi>September</hi> the Suns
course is in the Aequinoctial, and then he is said
to have no declination, and from the 10 of 
<hi>March</hi> to the 13 of <hi>September,</hi> the sun moves
on the North side the Aequinoctial, and it
called his <hi>Northern Declination,</hi> also from the
13 of <hi>September</hi> to the 10 of <hi>March</hi> his motion
being on the South side, is called <hi>Southern Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

caused the diversity of Seasons and inequalities
of day and night. Note also, that the greatest

                     <p>THe Altitude or height of the Sun is the
the number of deg. contained between the
middle or Center of the Sun, and the Horizon
or Circle which bounds our sight, and the

touch the Meridian. To find it,</p>

turn it gently towards the Sun, so that the

whereon the shadow falleth is the Suns Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at that time, but to know the Meridian
Altitude you must observe the Suns height just
it 12, now that you may be sure to have it
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36910:12"/>
right make several observations just about 12,
and the greatest is the truest, for as the Sun all
the morning from its rising grows higher and
higher untill it comes to the Meridian where it
is highest, so having past the Meridian, all
the Afternoon it grows lower and lower until
it sets: Wherefore the Suns greatest Altitude
on any day is the Meridian Altitude for that
day.</p>

likewise one deg. containing 60 Minutes, 45

Rules, or by the Table at the end of this book,
slide the division on the Cursor of the Meridian
to it, either in the North or South Quadrants, according
as the place is situated. Secondly slide
the Cursor of the Axis to the day of the month.
Thirdly open the Equinox as far as 'twill go,
which is just to cross the Meridian, then guess
as near as you can at the hour, and turn the
Axis towards the hour you guess, that the Sun
may the better shine through the hole, and
holding the Instrument by the little ring so that
it may hang freely, move it gently this way and
that, till the Sun shining through the hole you

            <head>How to place an Horizontal Dyal upon
a levell Plane, and to find the Meridian
several wayes.</head>
            <p>1. PRepare a smooth board or Stone, and
place it truly Horizontal or levell,
which may be done with such an Instrument as
the Artificers call a <hi>Plumb-Rule,</hi> or otherwise,
then find the hour of the day by such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
as is before described, or by some
other as true, or having a good <hi>Watch</hi> go to
some <hi>Sun-Dyal</hi> that you know to go true, and
set the <hi>Watch</hi> by it, afterwards turn the Dial
(which you are to place) about, untill it
shews the same hour with your Instrument or
<hi>Watch,</hi> and there fasten it.</p>
            <p>2. Or having prepared your plain as before,
near the middle of it set up a wire which
shall stand exactly perpendicular or upright,
and the Sun Shining clear, observe a little
before Noon when the shadow of the wire is
at the shortest, and there make a point, and
through that point and the center where the
wire stood draw a line, upon which place the
12 a Clock line of your Dyal, and fix it.</p>
            <p>3. And which is better, near the middle of
your Plain choose a point as a center, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36910:22"/>
thereon describe a Circle of a convenient
bigness, and erect a wire at Right Angles to
your plain as before, then observe in the
forenoon when the shadow of the top of
the Pin just toucheth the Circle, and there
make a mark, and again in the Afternoon
watch when the shadow of the top of the Pin
just toucheth the Circle, and there make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mark, then with a pair of Compasses
divide the space between those two Markes
into two equal parts, and there make a third
Mark, through this last point and the center
of the Circle where the wire stood, draw a
line and it shall be a true Meridian-line. This
last conclusion may be done with more ease, if
there be several Circles described one within
another on the same center, also then you
may make several observations for the
doing it with more certainty.</p>
            <p>4. The Meridian may be found by the help
of a good magnetical needle, well made and
fitted to a square Box, if in the useing of it
there be an allowance made for the Variation,
the use of which is so plain, even to those that
have but seen them, that I think it needless
here to treat of.</p>
            <p>I shall set down only two ways more, which
will require more knowledge in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36910:22"/>
than any of the Former, and so conclude.
The first is in <hi>Dary's Misscellanies,</hi>
page 22, thus.</p>
            <p>1. Let a piece of Mettal or Wood be
made a true Plain, then in some convenient
point thereof (taken as a Center,) erect a
Gnomon of sufficient length at right angles to
the plain, this done, fix the Plain truly
Horizontal; secondly if you take the Suns
Co-altitude (that is his distance from the
<hi>Zenith</hi>) 3 several times in one day, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Stereographick Projection having
a line of Tangents by you set off from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of your plain or foot of the Gnomon, the
Tangent of half each arch upon his respective
Azimuth or Shadow (continued if need be)
made by the Gnomon, at that Instant when
the Co-altitude is taken, so shall you insert
three points upon the plain. Thirdly if you find
out the Center to those 3 inserted points, then
a right line infinitely extended by this Center
found and the foot of the Gnomon or the
Center of the plain, is the true Meridian line.</p>
            <p>2. The other way, is by the help of the
Suns Azimuth, and it is hinted in most Books
of Dyalling, thus, 1. Your plain being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
as before, hold up a string and Plummet,
so that the shadow of the string may fall a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36910:23"/>
cross an assigned point in the plain, and in the
same line of shadow make another point at
a convenient distance from the first, then
through these two points draw a right line,
secondly at the same instant get the Suns
Azimuth or Horizontal distance from the
south part of the Meridian, and having a line of
chords by you, set off the angle of the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth
from the assigned point, either on the
west side of the line drawn, if your observation
be made in the Morning, or on the east side if
your observation be in the Afternoon,
and draw the line. Thirdly this last line so
drawn shall be in the true Meridian.</p>
