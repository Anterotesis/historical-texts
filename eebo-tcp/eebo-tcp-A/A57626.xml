            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been made a Question long agoe, whether more mischief then advantage were not occasion'd to the Christian world by the Invention of Typography. But never was any Question more fully determin'd then this has been of late years in these Nations. We have seen the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> traduc'd and profan'd by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of zealous Incendiaries, the pious and learned Governours of it loaded with loaded and accusations, the reverend Clergy decry'd and almost proscrib'd, yea Religion it self publickly struck at, the mysteries of it despis'd by notorious Hereticks the Holy Ordinances declaim'd against by Fanaticks and Enthusiasts. This in the Church. In the State we have seen Sedition and Rebellion defended and propagated in full Treatises, Murder, Treachery, Rapine, Perjury, Ambition, Tyranny, Oppression, Persidiousnesse justify'd and applauded, Calumny taken into the Arts of State, the steps of Gods Annointed stander'd, his Honour wounded with scurrility and reproach, his person expos'd to scorn and derision, his sufferings insulted over, his just Title maliciously and impudently debas'd. and the Honourable and Loyal of the Land basely aspers'd and derided. Writings of this strain, and many-others as they have been the issue of trayterous and postilent minds, so they have been brought into the world and propagated by the assistance of the Presse. But what was by others singly attempted in several waies, has been in all practis'd by the late Writer of <hi>Politious, Marchemont Nedham,</hi> whose scurrilous Pamphlets flying eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:48698:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Week into all parts of the Nation, 'tis incredible what influence they had upon numbers of unconsidering persons, who have a strange presumption that all must needs be true that is in Print. This was the <hi>Goliah</hi> of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the great Champion of the late Vsurper, whose Pen was in comparison of others like a Weavers beam: and certainly he that shall peruse these Papers will judge that had the Devil himself (the Father of Lies and who has his name from Calnmny) been in this mans office, he could not have exceeded him. It will therefore, I conceive, be demanded wherefore these exceptions are now publish'd, and not rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to perish in perpetual oblivion, and perhaps it will be judg'd that they deserve rather to be burn'd then read? That they may be so, &amp; that so grand a Delinquent &amp; Blasphemer of Gods annointed, as the Author, may not (through the inconsider ablenesse of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) passe untaken notice of, but may have some share in that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which is now intended to Iustice, is the reason of this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication. I have no enmity to his person, but me thinks there is some kind of necessity, that he that hath with so much malice calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated his Sovereign, so scurrulously abused the Nobility, so impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently blasphemed the Church, and so industriously poysoned the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with dangerous principles, should (at least) carry some mark about him, as the recompence of his villanies.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48698:10"/>
Function. The time was, when this Nation was wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the vanity of admiring Kings, placing them in a lofty seat of impunity like Gods, that were not bound to give men an Account of their Actions, but had a Liberty to thunder at Pleasure, and put the world into combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, so that there was no Love, but Lust; no Rule, but the Princes will, which so vassalized the Spirits of this great and mighty people, that they were content to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the highest piece of Injustice by such <hi>Maxims</hi> of<note place="margin">P. 886.</note> Law, as said, The King can do no wrong; as if whatsoever he did could not make him a Delinquent, or Traytor; nor was it Law onely, but those antiquated Cheats of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy too made it pass for Divinity; so that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England</hi> for almost 600. yeares hath been pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion'd like a Captive, with that twofold Cord of the Law and the Gospel, which the corrupt Professors have made use of after their own Inventions.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding that this glorious Idol of Royalty was elevated to such a Height over the Liberties of the Parliament, and set upon the very Pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we have lived to see a noble generation of <hi>English</hi> hearts, that have fetcht it down with a vengeance, and cured the Land of that Idolatry, by one of the most He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and exemplary Acts of Iustice that ever was done under the Sun.</p>
            <p>Nothing farther (speaking of transactions in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Num. 57:</note> and news a little before) save that the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour<note place="margin">P. 915.</note>

            <p>So great was the stupidity of Elder Times, being ridden<note place="margin">Num. 58.</note> by the Clergy, that in all our Chronicles we can hardly<note place="margin">P. 917.</note> meet with a piece of Iustice done upon any of that Tribe, till the time of <hi>Harry</hi> the VIII. when Bishop <hi>Fisher</hi> was brought to the block as a Martyr for the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48698:11"/>
and yet from Sodomy and private murder to publick Treason and Rebellion there is not any crime whereof they were not guilty; and from the penalty whereof they were not guarded by impunity and exemption from secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power. This having been so in time past, may prompt us upon the consideration of the present Actions of many of our Ministers, to believe that we may be still at the same passe that our forefathers were, and that our new Clergy are still the same Idol, onely a little disguised with a new dresse of Mummery; they have taken a new Form, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to hold up the old Grandeur, and Punctilio's of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,<note place="margin">P. 918.</note> onely here is the difference: heretofore they got an outward power to controul the temporal Jurisdiction; from which Plea being now non-suited in all civil Courts, they now renew their sanctimonious pretences by tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring every where in the Court of Conscience; but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science well inform'd knows, that with God there is no respect of persons; and methinks in those dayes it ought to be so too among men, yea it must be so, since he that sate in the Royal Throne, in the midst of his iniquity could not rest secure; but being disrobed of all his sacred Titles, laid him down upon the Block, to shew all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onr Orders of men how vain it is to hope for impunity, and that they must all expect to submit and bow before the Throne ofe Justice.</p>
            <p>It is the old Cavaliers Interest (speaking of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties<note place="margin">Num. 62.</note> leaving <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now coming into <hi>England</hi>) that<note place="margin">P. 982.</note> comes in new clad with a new Cloak of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> after the <hi>Scottish</hi> fashion; and it comes attended by the <hi>Scot,</hi> the apostatizing <hi>Scot,</hi> that will cide any way for a thriving voyage into <hi>England.</hi> Let the <hi>Presbytery</hi> remember, that though they laid not the old Tyrant down upon the Block, yet the young one knows they were the men that brought him to the Scaffold, and they are the old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Family; in which respect, he ever bore a mortal hatred to their whole faction, (and a little after) and we will<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

allow both Cavalier and Presbyter so much sense, (were their spleen never so high) as not to embarque their heads and Estates in the bottom of a beaten rabble, for the sake of a Toy call'd King; who as he first sail'd into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so now he is driven out again by pure necessity; yet for fashion sake he pretends great matters, and playing the second part of <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> who once invaded the <hi>North</hi> after the same manner, with a crew of <hi>Scots</hi> at his heels, and had every jot as good a Title as himself, or as his Predecessour <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, and play'd the King with as good a Grace; issuing out Proclamations and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; calling folks Rebels with as brazen à considence, and tossing pardons about to no purpose; till at length poor <hi>Perkin</hi> and his <hi>Scots</hi> were pack't out again with a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, as that Lowsy Nation ever hath been upon every offer of Invasion, as may be seen in the Chronicles of both Countreys.</p>

            <p>What a happinesse it is, to live to see this day, wherein<note place="margin">Num. 64.</note> we have experience of the noble temper of our Nation <note place="margin">P. 1013.</note> that though many of them be divided in matter of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interest and Opinion, yet they so well understand the General Interest of <hi>England,</hi> that they scorn to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque themselves in such courses, as must of necessity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther debase us under the miserable yoak of a <hi>Scottish</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or vassalize us under the will of an everlasting Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: for, had God given over the people to run a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after the Royal <hi>Puppet,</hi> we could have expected no other consequents, but endlesse Taxes, and inevitable slavery.</p>
            <p>But the world is grown wiser now, then to throw away<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> their Lives and Estates for a <hi>Trifle</hi> call'd a King; an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer that we have little cause to be in love with, if we take a view of them all since the Conquest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48698:12"/>As it was said of old concerning <hi>Israel,</hi> that God gave<note place="margin">Num. 65.</note> them a King in his wrath.

            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> being in the Saddle took a course to ride the<note place="margin">P. 1032.</note> Nation quite off its Legs; all his Reign was to enslave, and embroile the People, and to enhance the Prerogative; for which he died a Martyr, being executed a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer, and a publick Enemy to the Nation.</p>
            <p>As for the Title of the present young Pretender (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> his most gracious Majesty) remember from whence he had it, and how it is now tainted: had it been just, yet the Treason of the Father hath cut off the Son; who hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already to embroile <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now takes the same course in <hi>England.</hi> His Interest is revenge against the very Nation; for the effecting whereof, he hath harassed the Land with a desperate crew of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Consider what misery we have had by Kings in times past, and how they

may be multiplied in time to come. Tyranny hath been the practise and design (you see) of the whole race; but, admit this young <hi>Boutefeu,</hi> and he will soon bring it to perfection; then farewell to Parliaments, Laws, Liberties and Estates, which will be little enough for the haughty <hi>Scot,</hi> whose hopes and aims are all levelled at these, and his quarrel at the very name and Nation of the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If after so many eminent discoveries of the will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose<note place="margin">N. 66.</note> of God, touching the establishment of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,<note place="margin">P. 1045.</note> any man shall be such a Sot, as to continue a Malignant, let him remember how God useth to dispose of his incorrigible, and implacable enemies. But I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one main impediment, that keeps men from quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their old corrupt principles, is, the fear of being counted a Turn-coat; yet know, that if God once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, as it were from heaven against thy wayes, thy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or thy Party; then it is no dishonour, but ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and thy duty to turn: for, he hath said in this case; <hi>If a man do not turn, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready; he hath prepared for him the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death and destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the old Malignants and Cavaliers consider, that<note place="margin">P. 1047.</note> in what shape they have appeared, with what pretences so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have clothed their Conferences, yet God hath found them out and confounded them. Let the new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> opinion consider, how often, and notoriously God hath check't them, and cursed their unrighteous combination with the old Malignants. Let both <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> consider, what an inseparable course is annexed (as I have often told you) to the Family and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> that it proves ruine and destruction to all that own it. Let <hi>England</hi> her self, and all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about consider, what God hath done for <hi>England;</hi> and how in this auspicious time of Triall, he gave in the hearts of the people to live and dye for the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Lastly, let all Parties consider, it is high time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48698:13"/>
to lay aside animosities, and unite again upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon interest of our Nation; and there is no doubt but the Parliament will consider, that as God hath his design of glory in all these things, so it should be their design to improve them all to that end; and for the ease and benefit of so willing and obedient a people.</p>
            <p>If ever there were a season of observation, (or rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration)<note place="margin">N. 67</note> certainly it is the present; wherein we have<note place="margin">P. 1061.</note> been eye-witnesses of so many outgoings of God's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence among us, and the many miraculous turns of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence within a short Revolution. Some memorable hints of those things you had in our last (meaning his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the fight at <hi>Worcester</hi>) But now observe farther; and in the first place, from whence came the rise of all our distractions; of which we may truly say, according to the old Proverb used by our Fathers; <hi>In nomine Domini incipit omne malum,</hi> all our evills have been derived from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Clergy, and such of the Laity as have been wedded to their Faction. The first War may be truly called <hi>Bellum Episcopale,</hi> the Bishops War, as being made for the upholding the second correlated Interests of Prerogative and Prelacy. The two last Wars, may as well be called <hi>Bellum Presbyteriale,</hi> being raised by the ranting Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for erecting of a new Tyranny, upon the ruine of the<note place="margin">P. 1062.</note> old one; by labouring to make one Compound of two Incompossibles, <hi>viz. Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Thus you see, how when one part of the Clergy prove Bankrupt, the other fell to traffick for the old ambitious Interest in a new form, upon a new stock of Reputation; wherein, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry observeable, how they have thrived accordingly; by joyning issue and Interest with the old Malignant Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Regality. The end then of this observation is, to shew, that it concerns the peace of every Commnowealth to see that the Civil Interest be secured out of the reach of any Clerical Encroachments or Pretences.</p>

mightily the Lord hath prospered the Commonwealth in a short time, since it began to execute Justice upon our modern Traytors of the Clergy, for that blood which hath been shed through their designs and instigation: yet, notwithstanding their confidence is more observeable than all, seeing, when they suffer for manifest Treasons, they dubbe themselves with the Title of Confessours and Martyrs: Thus the late <hi>Charles</hi> died a Martyr for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Treason; thus Mr. <hi>Love</hi> followed him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming himself a Martyr, when under his own hand, and with his own mouth, he had confessed himself guilty of the Treasons charged upon him; and it appears unto all the impartiall part of the World, that he died a Martyr for the old Tyrannick Interest (which he had so oft cried down) as it is now setled in the person of the young Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, though cloaked with a pretence of the <hi>Covenant.</hi>

            <p>The day following (that is the 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King of <hi>Scots,</hi> the Duke of <hi>York</hi> (that would be the<note place="margin">N. 78.</note> Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and <hi>Madamoselle d'Orleance</hi> (in his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence<note place="margin">P. 1248.</note> from <hi>Paris</hi>) are much given to Hunting, Dancing, Balls and Masking. The pretended King (meaning our most gracious Soveraign) is much in discourse about the miracle of his escape, and his <hi>Episcoparians</hi> doe much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large

upon it in their Sermons, hinting out to the World, as if God did thereby declare his will to restore him.</p>
            <p>He much magnifies the fidelity of the <hi>English Papists</hi> to him above all other friends, and as much vilifies the <hi>Scots;</hi> whom he seems resolv'd never more to trouble. It seems too, that the Covenant lay very foul upon his stomach, having voyded it, and lickt up the old vomit of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Common-Prayer-Book, which is now become again the Rosary of his Devotions; his Chappel being crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Copes, Surplices</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> that would be. The great kindnesses, the frequent visits and revels that passe between him and <hi>Madamoselle d'Orleans</hi> minister to all men large occasion of discourse, as if there were an intent of marriage that way, and that thereupon his quarrel would be owned by that valiant man the Duke, her Father, who is able to doe wonders, if we may credit Town-talke, or could they but believe quarrelling with each other. But the wiser sort say, that this often sporting of <hi>Madamoiselle</hi> with him, is onely to make a sport of him, he being now of late become a great pretender to Wit, and jesting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ladies; a thing wherein things of his Leaden complexion are seldome happy.</p>
            <p>What, more of thy scurrilous language still, profane Rebel? but 'tis no matter, thy tongue is no slander, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis nothing else but slander.</p>
            <p>We hear how the fugitive King of <hi>Scots</hi> hath resumed<note place="margin">N. 79.</note> his Masse-Book of Common-Prayer again, at which the<note place="margin">P. 1265.</note> King-doting <hi>Scots</hi> are much offended, and cry shame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Are these the fruits of his sitting in the Stool of Repentance? of his taking the Covenant? have the silly <hi>Scots</hi> ventured their Lives and Estates for such an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite? It appears well that he observed his good Mothers counsell, to doe any thing till he had gotten strength and power, and then do afterward as he list. How finely had the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> been served, if their designgs had taken effect, to enthrone such a dissembler for the enslaving of themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48698:15"/>This was remarkable in the late Tyrant <hi>Charles</hi> (falsly<note place="margin">N. 97.</note> accusing Princes of perjury, and violation of promises)<note place="margin">P. 1523.</note> whose inconstancy in this kind was beyond compare; who no sooner had past any promises, made vowes and protestations, and first appeals in the High Court of Heaven, in the behalf of himself and his Family, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently he forfeited all, and cancel'd them by his actions. How closely his Son also hath troden the Fathers steps, appears by the last Game with the Presbyters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he plaid fast and loose with the Covenant and the Stool of Repentance.</p>
            <p>Believe it, all your other enemies are tame Beasts to<note place="margin">N. 98.</note> the high Presbyter, and yet with the winding and turning<note place="margin">P. 1552.</note> of a religious pretence, and artificial zeal against Heresie, he will, like a tame Snake, (if not warily avoided) get into your bosome. As the <hi>Scottish</hi> Presbyter and the Cavalier look several wayes, but are tied together by the tayle with a point of <hi>Stewarts</hi> Interest.</p>
            <p>We have a very notable instance also in our own Nation,<note place="margin">N. 105.</note> which may serve for a just example to all the world in<note place="margin">P. 1644.</note> point of behaviour; for, if we reflect upon these 30 yeares past, we shall find how cautious the Parliaments and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> have been, before they proceeded to Armes, the utmost and most desperate Remedy. If we run over the Catalogue of the late Tyrants defaults in Government, we find extraordinary patience in the people, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his extraordinary incroachments from time to time. It were needlesse to reckon up the several Monopolies, Impositions and other Oppressions of the people, both in Soul and Body, which were made publick and known to all the world; together with that highest of all practises, not onely in dissolving Parliament, abruptly, but profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly designing the ruine of Parliaments, in depriving the People of their due Succession. Though all these Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his were sufficiently felt and known, yet such was the wisdome and caution of our Nation from time to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48698:15"/>
time, and particularly of this Parliament, that they used all the wayes under heaven, by Petitioning, Declaring, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating to God and man, in hope to reduce him; and though all would not doe; yet notwithstanding, that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate remedy of the Sword was forborn, till after he had first taken it up, and that invincible necessity did put it into their hands, for the preservation of themselves, with the Rights and Liberties of the People.</p>

passed by <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Council) that the people of God in these Dominions have abundant cause to blesse the Lord, who hath put it into the hearts of our Governours to make such provision against the Faction (called Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) of Popery, and those desperate Engineers, the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests, who seek the ruine of us, our Countrey, and of the Gospel of Christ, which is above all other considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and truly, there was never more need then now of such a Law; seeing Popery is become the great Interest of that Family, which the Lord hath cast out before us (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Family of the <hi>Stewarts</hi>) If ever they procure any force or power again, it must be upon a <hi>Popish</hi> account.

He is daily

seen among the Pastimes of the Common people; he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of no Comedy or Stage-play, and is a constant spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatour of all kinds of Puppet-plays; he is seen every where, and therefore is neglected of all; and having lately received a very considerable summe of money, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently wasted it.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

two or three at the most of his attendants. Many conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures are made about his stealing away from thence at this conjuncture of time, when your Countrey is said to be generally discontented, and Commissions ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at your gates.

               <p>Some further light was given touching the dangerous<note place="margin">P. 5179.</note> Conspiracies in divers parts on the behalf of <hi>Charles Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi> and that fatal interest of his, which hath sunk so many.</p>
               <p>The late Queen of <hi>England</hi> went to the <hi>Louvre</hi> to visit<note place="margin">N. 248.</note> the Queen: thereupon it was presently raised about, that<note place="margin">P. 5191.</note> the occasion of her going was to communicate a Letter which she had received from her son <hi>Charles,</hi> relating how that on the 5. instant he arrived at <hi>Hull,</hi> a strong Town and Sea-port of <hi>England,</hi> having none in company with him but the Marquesse of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Col. <hi>Blague,</hi> and his Barber, and a Groom.</p>
               <p>Here are Letters come hither from the <hi>Hague</hi> which<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> say, that <hi>Charles</hi> went from <hi>Colen</hi> the 24 last past, about 5 in the morning, with the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Col. <hi>Blague,</hi> his Barber &amp; a Groom, intending to imbarque himself at <hi>Embden</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> divers Sea-Ports and Inland.

               <p>We are still in expectation, to hear what successe <hi>Charles</hi>

               <p>The last Letters that are come from <hi>England,</hi> have<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> much calmed the reports that were here invented by the Royalists, of the Risings and Commotions there; that <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Newcastle</hi> were revolted, but now we hear the contrary, and their fabulous stories are but laughed at;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48698:22"/>
yet we have no certainty to what place <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> is gone, the newes thereof is as diverse as uncertain. Some will have him in <hi>England,</hi> others that he is gone towards <hi>Hamburgh;</hi> and some will have him to be still in these parts, which is the most likely of any: for the present state of affairs of <hi>England</hi> is not so bad and declining as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, for him to venture himself there. In the mean time I hope we shall not be ill thought on by you for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him here among us, since we cannot prevent it, he coming in a disguise; otherwise he would soon be made to retreat hence.</p>
               <p>I am wholly in the dark how it goes with you, whilst<note place="margin">P. 5193.</note> from all parts it's generally reported and written, that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> is gone to imbarque himself in some Port, in or about <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>England, Hull</hi> or <hi>Lynne</hi> being his designed Landing place; both which places they say, are certainly made for him; and that he hath such assurance from his party in <hi>England,</hi> as that he doubts not to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in thither, and carry on his design, notwithstanding the large discovery you made of it: and all this (as they also say) comes from the encouragement he hath presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from some in <hi>England:</hi> But I trust, as you have been long fore-warned, so you are well fore-armed, to perceive them to their cost; and that you have secured those, and all other important Ports and places, in more faithfull hands then to betray them. Your enemies glory much in their expectations at this time, however former at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts have failed: but I trust they will be taken in their own snare; God can, and I hope will do it.</p>
               <p>Here is a fresh report of the King of <hi>Scots</hi> being in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 5194.</note> whereof we expect a confirmation by the next.</p>
               <p>Three dayes past hath produced some matters of newes<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in these parts: there is a considerable party of old Cavaliers risen, and in Armes in <hi>Montgomery</hi> shire in <hi>North-Wales:</hi> they act very publickly, and are confident. It's conceived upon good grounds, their purpose was, and perhaps is,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48698:23"/>
to possesse themselves of some holds, as <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and <hi>Chirk</hi> Castle.</p>
               <p>They cannot leave their old tricks, and honest men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> forget their old malice. We know a little what Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cost, and would not lose it to them, though it cost us another knock.</p>
               <p>We have Prisoners here, most of the considerable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers<note place="margin">P. 5195.</note> in this County; some evidently guilty, others on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected.</p>
               <p>Also that there was an endeavour in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> to form a<note place="margin">P. 5196.</note> Party, with an intent to seize <hi>York</hi> for <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> They had two Cart-fulls of Arms and Ammunition with them, and divers of the Gentry; among whom was Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Maleverer;</hi> but they dispersed, perceiving no such appearance as they expected: and Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> is taken by Col. <hi>Lilburn:</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer</hi> escaped home, took leave of his Lady, and told her his condition, despaired of his estate and is fled; Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Ingraham</hi> is also in hold. The Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> had sent in six Horses with his Groom, who will also be secured. The Lord doth confound and scatter this phrenetick Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their conspiracies. The like we are to expect to hear from other parts; knowing, they imbarque in a cause, that will sink all it's owners and defenders. How much then doth it concern all sober men, to be active in resolution for the maintenance of the publick peace.</p>
               <p>The expectation here is, that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> should be<note place="margin">N. 249.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">P. 5261.</note> entred <hi>England;</hi> and it's said, that before his entry he took a solemn Oath to allow a Liberty of Conscience. The Titular Duke of <hi>York</hi> gives out to all his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he is ready to take Horse upon the first order that shall be sent him from his Brother.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Hague</hi> things are represented, as if there were great<note place="margin">P. 5204.</note> inclinations to a change in <hi>England,</hi> and that for this cause <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> went from <hi>Colen</hi> Feb. 24. in design to make some advantage by the present occasion; but since that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48698:23"/>
we hear the wind hath been so contrary, that he can find no place convenient to Land in.</p>
               <p>It's meet you should hear from me sometimes, though<note place="margin">P. 5208.</note> I have been long silent. The reason why I trouble you now, is the report of a Comet which appeared lately here, I mean young <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Colen;</hi> for the <hi>Papists</hi> have long enthroned and enshrined three Kings at <hi>Colen,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> is come thither for a fourth of the same Litter.</p>
               <p>The Princesse withdraws from the <hi>Hague,</hi> because the<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> States of <hi>Holland</hi> have straitned her Lodging Rooms in the <hi>Hoss,</hi> for their own use, which she saith belong unto her; and therefore will not come thither again untill they be restored her, which will be done at the Greek Kalends, or at the Feast of St. <hi>Charles</hi> the second: for there is talke here, he shall be Canoniz'd for a Saint and a Martyr, if <hi>Walter Montague</hi> or Sir <hi>Toby Matthews</hi> be chose Pope in this vacancy.</p>
               <p>Here has been of late no small conflux, not onely of<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Royal stock, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom the Princesse calls one of mine Aunts; and the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> who has as much profit of his Dukedom, as the Aunt and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have of their Kingdomes: but also a great Tayl of <hi>English</hi> Fugitives and Hucksters, and Chaplains and Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Gamesters of both Sexes. This Tayl made me call young Charles a Comet. They have been marvellous merry at <hi>Teyling,</hi> with Balls and Ballets, crying <hi>Victoria</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And indeed, as the blaze, so the gaze here was very great, and that in the judgement of many Potent ones; so that we long to here the issue among you, which we believe to be bad to the <hi>Carolists;</hi> for it was told him at <hi>Teyling,</hi> that by Letters from <hi>England</hi> to the States, it was clear, his Highnesse the Protector knew of young <hi>Charles</hi> his coming from <hi>Colen,</hi> long before he came thence; which as they tell us here, hath made him turn back to his Kingdome of <hi>Colen,</hi> and there to enshrine himself again with his three Brethren, <hi>Melchior, Belthazar</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48698:24"/>
and <hi>Caspar,</hi> because the design was known, although they gave out here, that all <hi>England</hi> was up in Arms for him; and by their healthing and dancing, drabbing and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, you would judge all their own: but in very sooth, it appears that you in <hi>England</hi> are notable <hi>Astrologers,</hi> who could foretell a Comet before he rose, and that some <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> was, and is in conjunction with him, that has revealed his designs and motions; and that our States are faithfull to the Protector, who upon a bare rumour onely sent to the Princesse Royal, that if young <hi>Charles</hi> were there, he should depart the Countrey.</p>
