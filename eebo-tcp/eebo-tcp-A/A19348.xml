            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>OF a stout Cripple that kept the high way,</l>
               <l>and beg'd for his liuing all time of the day,</l>
               <l>A story Ile tell you that pleasant shall be,</l>
               <l>the Cripple of Cornwall sir-named was he.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He crept on his hands and his knées vp and down,</l>
               <l>in a torne Iacket and ragged patcht Gowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>For he had neuer a legge to the knée,</l>
               <l>the Cripple of Cornwall sir-named was hee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He was of stomacke couragious and stout,</l>
               <l>for he had no cause to complaine of the Gout:</l>
               <l>To goe vpon stilts most cunning was hee,</l>
               <l>with a staffe on his necke gallant and frée.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yea, no good fellowship would he forsake,</l>
               <l>were it in secret a purse for to take:</l>
               <l>His helpe was as good as any might be,</l>
               <l>the Cripple of Cornwall sir-named was he.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When he vpon any such seruice did goe,</l>
               <l>the craftie young Cripple prouided it so:</l>
               <l>His tooles he kept close in an old hollow Tree,</l>
               <l>that stood from the Citie a mile two or thrée.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus all the day long he begd for reliefe,</l>
               <l>and late in the night he plaid the false Théefe:</l>
               <l>And seuen yeares together this custome kept he,</l>
               <l>and no man knew him such a person to be.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There were few Grafters went on the way,</l>
               <l>but vnto the Cripple for passage did pay,</l>
               <l>And euery braue Merchant that he did descry,</l>
               <l>he emptied their purses ere they passed by.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The gallant Lord <hi>Courtney</hi> both valiant and bold,</l>
               <l>rode forth with great plentie of siluer and Gold:</l>
               <l>At <hi>Exeter</hi> there a purchase to pay,</l>
               <l>but that the false Cripple his iourney did stay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For why the false Cripple heard tydings of late,</l>
               <l>as he lay for almes at this Noblemans gate:</l>
               <l>What day and what houre his iourney should be,</l>
               <l>this is (quoth the Cripple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a bootie for me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then to his Companions the matter he moned,</l>
               <l>which their like actions beforetime had proned:</l>
               <l>They make themselues ready &amp; déeply they sweare</l>
               <l>this mony's their owne before they come there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Upon his two stilts the Cripple doth mount,</l>
               <l>to haue his best share he makes his account:</l>
               <l>All clothed in Canuas downe to the ground,</l>
               <l>he takes vp his standing his mates with him round</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then comes the L. <hi>Courtney</hi> with halfe a scoremen</l>
               <l>that little suspecting these theeues in their den:</l>
               <l>And they perceiuing them come to their hand,</l>
               <l>in a darke euening they bid him to stand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Deliuer thy purse quoth the Cripple with spéed,</l>
               <l>for we be good fellowes and thereof haue néed:</l>
               <l>Not so, quoth Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> but this I tell thée,</l>
               <l>win it, and weare it, else get none of me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With that the Lord <hi>Courtney</hi> stood in his defence,</l>
               <l>and so did his seruants, but ere they went since</l>
               <l>Two of the true men were slaine in the fight,</l>
               <l>and foure of the theeues were put to their flight</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And while for their safegard they ran thus away,</l>
               <l>the iolly bold Cripple did hold the rest play:</l>
               <l>And with his pike-staffe he wounded them so,</l>
               <l>as they were vnable to runne or to goe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With fight the L. <hi>Courtney</hi> was driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of breath</l>
               <l>and most of his seruants wounded to death:</l>
               <l>Then came other horsemen riding so fast,</l>
               <l>the Cripple was forced to flie at the last,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ouer a Riuer that ran there beside,</l>
               <l>which was very déepe and eightéene foot wide:</l>
               <l>With his long staffe and his stilts leaped hee,</l>
               <l>and shifted himselfe in an old hallow Tree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then thorow the Country was hue and cry made,</l>
               <l>to haue these theeues apprehended and stayed:</l>
               <l>The Cripple he creeps on his hands and his knées,</l>
               <l>and on the high way great posting he sees.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And as they came riding he begging doth say,</l>
               <l>O giue me one penny, good Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I pray:</l>
               <l>And thus vnto <hi>Exeter</hi> creepes he along,</l>
               <l>no man suspecting that he had done wrong.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Anon the Lord <hi>Courtney</hi> he spyde in the street</l>
