            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is so generally desired and sought for at Gods hands, that I hope the God who heareth prayers, will not leave the happinesse imperfect, which he seemes to have prepared by your meanes, nor deprive us of the good which you are working.

               <note place="margin">Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> therein fore-promised to doe those great thinges which  he effected against Idolaters, and the reliques of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. And it was as wonderfull to thinke in what a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate condition, and time of the Church he was borne, in the darkest midnight of apostasie, when the ten Tribes were carried away captive, and <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> onely lest, and they (as farre as the eye of man could see) wholly and generally fallen from the Lord their God to all manner of Idols and Idolatries; when the very Temple of God was made a denne of Idols; nay, <note place="margin">2 Chr 33.</note> his Altar the onely Altar of Israel destroied, to make roome for Altars erected to Idols: When the true Church had hardly any visible being upon the face of the earth; yea I am perswaded that in the darkest times of Antichristianity; the true Church of Christ was never more invisible, then it was about that time when <hi>Iosiah</hi> was borne. And it was another wonder, that in such a strong faction as Idolatry then had, that any could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly so prevaile in the Court as to give such education to the young Prince: Nor is it lesse wonderfull that by that time he was but sixteeen years old, hee stood out a perfect godly man, undertaking the cause of God, and the reformation of Religion, and that with such a perfect <note place="margin">2 Chro. 34. 3.</note> heart to make the most compleat and absolute reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church that ever was wrought by any mortall man since God had a Church on earth. But the successe of his labours seems to me the most wonderfull of all the rest, whether you looke upon the successe it had with the people, or the successe it had with God.</p>
            <p>The successe with the people was this, that although at <hi>Iosiahs</hi> first appearing as a right Orient, and illustrious Starre in a darke night there was hardly any visible wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96240:4"/>
or worshipper to bee found; yet hee carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him like a torrent, and walked like a man of fire, (as his name signifies the fire of the Lord) and brought the whole Nation so about, that there was scarce ever such a Covenant made as hee procured, and that not by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party, but the universality of his Kingdome joined with him in it, and continued in it, and held close to it all the time that <hi>Iosiah</hi> lived in the world. <note place="margin">2 Chr. 2 4 31. 32. 33</note> This was the successe that hee found among the people.</p>
            <p>But now the successe that all this found with God is yet more wonderfull, and this my Text will tell you of, <hi>viz.</hi> That not withstanding such a rare man was thus wonderfully stirred up, thus miraculously carried on with such a perfect heart, with such an unanimous consent of his people, to set upon the worke of reforming Religion; and did it so as never mortall man did the like before, nor any arose afterward like unto him; yet <hi>notwithstanding all this the Lord turned not away from the fiercenesse of his great wrath, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The scope of the Text and parts of it.</note> And so now you see my Text is a description of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hopelesse and helplesse condition of the Church  of the Jewes, though there was a Physitian risen up who had found out the most pretious balme that ever was, and faithfully applyied it, yet the hurt of Gods people could receive no cure, but they must die for it.</p>
            <p>And this may be reduced to these two heads.</p>
            <p>First, you have their miserable and forlorne estate in these words. <hi>(Notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fiercenesse of his great wrath which was kindlcd, against Iudah.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, you have the cause of all this, what it was


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96240:5"/>
that made God irreconciliably and inexorably set against them in these words: <hi>Because of all the provocations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi> Manasses <hi>had provoked him;</hi> though hee were dead betweene thirty and forty yeares before <hi>Iosiah</hi> ended his dayes, yet his provocations were the cause that God would never bee reconciled to his people, though hee was reconciled to <hi>Manasses</hi> person before hee dyed. I purpose not any exact or large handling of this Text, nor is it possible to bee done in one Sermon: I shall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cull out such things as are most intended by the holy Ghost, and most sutable to the occasion of our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</note> And first, let us in a few words consider it in relation to the former Verse, and secondly, as it lyes in it selfe. As it stands in relation to the former description made of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> and the high praises which God there bestowes upon him, I thence observe, That <hi>when God raises up any excellent instruments to appear in his cause, they are most graciously accepted with him, though their endeavours should come to nothing:</hi> There shall be glory and honour, and immortality, and eternall life to themselves, though there be indignation, and wrath, tribulation, anguish and woe, upon the people whom they would willingly doe good unto. This you see plainly in this Text, <hi>Ioshiah</hi> sets up a building which was instantly throwne downe sticke and stone, yet never man received better wages and greater reward than hee did. God hath raised up many instruments to doe him service who have had admirable successe in their way. <hi>Moses</hi> brought Gods people out of the bondage of Egypt, carried them through a deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 5. Josh. 23. 4. 5.</note> wastefull, howling wildernesse, and that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously for forty yeares together: <hi>Ioshua</hi> gave them the


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96240:5"/>
possession of the promised land, and left them in it in peace. <hi>David</hi> subdued all their enemies about them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were all <hi>put under the soles of their feet, leaving</hi> 
               <note place="margin">King. 53. 4</note> 
               <hi>them neither adversary nor evill occurrent. Solomon</hi> built Gods Temple, and established the Church in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods Worship and Ordinances, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth with admirable peace and prosperity; yet, not any of these more magnified by the Lord than <hi>Iosiah,</hi> whose work came to nothing. This is my first observation; and it hath these two <hi>branches;</hi> first it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that <hi>the endevours of rare Instruments may come to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In two branches.</note> 
               <hi>nothing,</hi> that men may bee stirred up with admirable spirits to attempt great things for God, and yet their work miscarry.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>though their work come to nothing, yet themselves shall be highly magnified with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could easily give abundant testimonies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances <note place="margin">1. Branch, The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouts of rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments may come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> of such whom God hath raised up with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary spirits; men that wee might think had been fit to carry the world before them who have effected little or nothing: <hi>Elias</hi> for one, a man (as it were) made of fire, who at one time called a <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>all the Heads of Israel together,</hi> convinced them of their halting between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Baal,</hi> and wrought so at <note place="margin">2. King. 18 19.</note> the present, that all the people cryed out <hi>the Lord is God,</hi> and seemed to have their <hi>hearts brought back again to the Lord their God;</hi> and likewise that eight hundred Idolatrous Priests and false Prophets were put to the sword; yet the very next day, he was faine to run away to save his life, undertaking a journey of forty dayes to keepe himselfe from the fury of <hi>Iezabel. Ieremy</hi> was another rare man, one of the most zealous Instruments


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96240:6"/>

               <hi>Gods wrath:</hi> God is not easily provoked, hee is slow to wrath: his wrath is as a great Bell long raising, but when it is once up, makes such a dreadfull sound, as no tongue can expresse. Many a poore soule feeles a great deale of it, whole Nations have laine under it; but never was any creature able to say what the power of Gods fierce <hi>wrath</hi> is. But if you will give your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent attention one quarter of an houre, I shall (God willing) out of the holy Scriptures open something, which may in some degree make you conceive, how fearfull the <hi>wrath</hi> of God is, when it is once <hi>kindled.</hi> And doe not think that I shall speak of what concerns strangers, and not your selves; for I greatly feare, that before we part it will be too evident, that this fierce wrath is kindled against some of our owne soules who are here present. Indeed your calling and meeting this day for <hi>humiliation, fasting,</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> seemes to tell all the world, that you beleeve that Gods wrath is kindled; and therefore being kindled, it is fit you should know what kinde of <hi>flame</hi> it is.</p>

Yea it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>lake</hi> or <hi>river</hi> of fire, <hi>Esai. 30. ult.</hi> The breath of the Lord (speaking of Tophet) like a <hi>river of fire and brimstone kindles it.</hi> Imagine the anger of the Lord thus set out, as if from Gods <hi>nostrils,</hi> and out of <hi>his mouth</hi> should come huge <hi>lakes</hi> or <hi>floods</hi> of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, streaming out upon the people with whom hee is angry: What dreadfull things are these? Yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gods wrath is set out to bee such a fire as is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>irresistible;</hi> so that the poore creatures on whom it falls, cannot possibly stand before it: and therefore usually when God is said to arise in <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> the people, that bee the vessels of this wrath, are said to bee <hi>wax,</hi> and <hi>straw,</hi> and <hi>stubble, dry leaves,</hi> and <hi>rotten hedges;</hi> and what are these to stand before huge stormes and floods, lakes of fire and brimstone?</p>
            <p>And as it is <hi>irresistible,</hi> so it is <hi>intolerable;</hi> which is usually set out by <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>wailing,</hi> and <hi>gnashing of teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, Such a fire, when once throughly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, can <hi>never be quenched.</hi> There bee two expressions (among many others) in the Scripture, which bee very dreadfull, to this purpose: The one is <hi>Deuter.</hi> 32. 26. Where the Lord saith, that a <hi>fire is kindled in his anger;</hi> and mark what a fire it is, <hi>it shall burne to the lowest hell,

and shall consume the earth with her encrease, and set on fire the foundations of the Mountaines.</hi> Such a fire as when once kindled burnes up Mountaines, earth, and world, and all, and never rests till it abide in hell, where there is no bottome, and there it burnes for ever.

The throwing of many millions of Angels out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the lowest hell, was nothing but the effect of Gods <hi>wrath.</hi> The opening the flood-gate of all sin and misery upon all mankind, was nothing but an effect of Gods <hi>wrath.</hi> The deluge that over-whelmed all the world, all the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> burning of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the earths opening and swallowing up <hi>Korah</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, all the famine, pestilence, blood, that ever the world lay under, are but so many effects of Gods <hi>wrath.</hi> Nay, the dreadfull appearance at the last day, when the <hi>Potentates</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the world will bee humble Suiters to the hills and mountaines to fall on them, will bee nothing but an effect of the Lords comming in <hi>wrath,</hi> to render vengeance to his enemies. Yea, to be thrown to all eternity into the pit of hell, into utter darknesse, into the fire that never is quenched, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wormes that shall never cease gnawing, all these are nothing but to be under the <hi>wrath of God.</hi> But above all these, and if ten thousand more could bee named,

that one effect of it, in the Lords powring out his viall of his revenging justice upon the body and soule of our <hi>blessed Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ,</hi> is most able to in forme us, how <hi>great</hi> and <hi>fierce</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> of God is: that when he had but <hi>one Son</hi> who was his <hi>fellow</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith, <hi>Awake sword, and smite the man that is my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;)</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> I Answer; First, Gods wrath may be kindled <hi>mildly,</hi> and <hi>gently</hi> against his owne <hi>deare children,</hi> when they walke not faithfully in his Covenant, when they lay aside their filiall obedience, when they give occasion to his enimies to blaspheme his Name: though hee <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 21. 2 Sam. 11. 27.

                  </gap>.</note> will not suffer all his indignation to arise, yet his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly displeasure may bee kindled against them. And even this fatherly wrath, this gentle wrath, (if it bee not a contradiction to call it so) these small drops of his displeasure, are more unsupportable to them than all the miseries of the world: Yea, they could more willingly submit to the torments in hell (provided that Gods countenance did but shine upon them) than to undergoe that which this wrath of God sometimes distills upon them: And yet all this while wee may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say of them, they are children <hi>under wrath,</hi> but not the children <hi>of wrath;</hi> not the people of his wrath, not the vessels of his wrath.</p>
            <p>But if you will know, Secondly, What are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple against whom God hath indignation for ever; the Scripture tells it you in this expression ordinarily, they are the <hi>children of Belial;</hi> so they are usually called in the Old Testament; that is, such as will not beare <hi>Gods yoke;</hi> master-lesse children, yoke-lesse children: And in the New Testament, they are called <hi>children of</hi>

               <hi>disobedience;</hi> as the Apostle, <hi>For which things sake the wrath of God commeth on the children of disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who these children of <hi>Belial,</hi> and of <hi>disobedience</hi> are, I must a little explaine to you, and then the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication will bee easie. I say therefore that these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will not carry the yoke, are, First, <hi>all unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> I doe not meane <hi>Negative unbeleevers,</hi> that is, those that doe not beleeve in Christ, because they never heard of him; but <hi>Positive unbeleevers,</hi> who have had the glorious light of the Gospel shining to them, to whom the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> hath been freely offered, as a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to deliver them from wrath to come; and yet they refuse to come in, and to accept of him, <hi>as hee offers, himselfe in his Gospel;</hi> because they doe not like to take him upon such hard termes: you may be sure the wrath of God rests upon these men. Turne but to <hi>Iohn 3. ult. Hee that beleeves in Christ shall be saved,</hi> hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves not is a damned man: and how? <hi>the wrath of God abides on him.</hi> Mark that expression, <hi>abides on him:</hi> The wrath of God takes up, as it were, his <hi>habitation</hi> in an unbeleever. So that what Gods grace sometimes said of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, <hi>Here will I dwell for I have a delight in it:</hi> So the wrath of God seemes to say of an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, <hi>Here I will dwell,</hi> here I will abide for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The children of disobedience and sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> are such, whose lives and conversations are contrary to the rules of the Gospel; who as they will not take <hi>Christ</hi> to be their <hi>portion</hi> by faith, so they will not take Christs <hi>word</hi> in the Gospel to be their <hi>guide;</hi> but they will live indeed without all yoke, doing what is good in their owne eyes; these are the sonnes of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial.</hi> You may see a notable description of them in the prophesie of <hi>Zacharie, ch. 7. v.</hi> 8. where the wilfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96240:11"/>
obstinate stubbornesse and intractablenesse is expressed by divers similitudes, all tending to the same purpose. <hi>They refuse to hearken, stop their eares,</hi> as not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear Gods counsel, they pull'd away the shoulder, as an Oxe or Bullock that shrinks back from the yoak, or as one that should carry a burthen, pulls away his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when he should take it, and lets it fall: so these deale with the easie yoak, and the light burthen of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Yea, they make their hearts as an <hi>Adamant Stone;</hi> there is in them a stiffe and wilfull resolution to sin, whereby their hearts are as intractable to any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the hardest sort of stones, Flints, or Diamonds are to be wrought by the toole into any fashion we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: when you have said all you can against their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, uncleannesse, prophanness, pride, covetousness, &amp;c. you prevaile no more than when an hammer strikes upon an anvile: Their hearts can easily reject all yee cannot beat a splinter off from them: then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it followes in the next verse, <hi>Therefore there came a great wrath from the Lord of Hostes.</hi> These are the sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> these are the <hi>vessels of Gods wrath.</hi>

               <note place="margin">How this may bee done.</note> But there are two things which keep most people frombeing affected with them. The first is, These things are looked upon as things <hi>a farre off:</hi> Now it is a rule in <hi>Opticks,</hi> That things farre off, though they be <hi>marvellous great,</hi> yet seeme <hi>very little:</hi> a Starre that is bigger than all the earth, seemes no bigger than a candle being many miles distant from us. So while men look at the wrath of God, as <hi>they</hi> did at the Prophets Vision, <hi>The Vision that he sees is for many dayes to come, and he prophesies of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 27.</note> 
               <hi>the times that are farre off:</hi> And put the evill day from them: All these threatnings are but light matters. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it fares with most men in this point, as with some men that have shrewish wives; though their businesse lie within doors, yet they have no heart to be there for feare of chiding: So though it be the most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work to think of these things; yet because their unquiet consciences upon the least serious meditation, are ready to gnaw and teare them, and make them sleep uncomfortably, they labour to drive off the thought of this thing as farre as they can, and will not think of Gods wrath due to sinne, from yeers end to yeeres end. Whereas if men would bring it in <hi>rempraesentem,</hi> and keep their eyes open to behold it, as a thing which <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably</hi> will come upon them, how admirably would it work upon mens hearts!</p>
            <p>To this end, let me tell you a story which I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten read to this purpose. It is reported of a certaine <hi>Christian King of Hungary,</hi> who being on a time mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous sad and heavie, his brother that was a resolute Courtier would needs know what he ailed; Oh brother,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96240:13"/>
(saith he,) I have been a great sinner against God, and I know not how I shall appeare before him, when he comes to judgment: These are (said his brother) melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly thoughts, and makes a toy of them, as Gallants use to doe: The <hi>King</hi> replyes nothing for the present; but the <hi>custome</hi> of that Countrey was, that if the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of justice came and sounded a Trumpet before any mans doore, the man was presently to be led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: the King in the dead time of the night sends his Deaths-man, and causeth him to sound his Trumpet before his brothers doore, who hearing and seeing the messenger of death, springs in <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> into his brothers presence, and beseeches the King to let him know wherein hee had offended. O Brother, replyes the King, thou hast loved me, and never offended me, and is the sight of my Executioner so dreadfull to thee; and shall not I, so great a sinner, feare to be brought to judgment before Jesus Christ? If we would thus sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with <hi>Hierom,</hi> that we heard this Trumpet sounding, <hi>Arise ye dead, and come to judgment,</hi> it would work to the purpose. O set yóur selves therefore in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and behold the Lord shaking his lap, (as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> when hee shook his lap, and said, so God shake <note place="margin">Neh. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96240:14"/>
God strike theea full blow, and sinke thee to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of hell, where thou shalt wish that thou hadst been a toad, or (as one in desperation sometimes wished) that thou mightst live there a thousand yeers, so thou mightst have any hope in the end, that the wrath of God might cease towards thee. Would not these things then work upon thee? Couldst thou then passe such a day as this, without trembling? Couldst thou be before the Lord, and not have thy heart rent and torn? Be perswaded therefore once more to bring it home to thy own soule, and say, as he said of his green fig, this grew in <hi>Carthage</hi> yesterday: This wrath, this sea of misery may break in upon me the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I am yet joviall and merry, but Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with woollen feet follows me close at the back, <note place="margin">Rarò ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedentem scelestum descruit pede poena claudo, <hi>Horace.</hi>

I know such is the depravation of mans nature, that if there were any possibility of avoiding Gods wrath without leaving their sinnes, many men would resolve with that wicked <hi>Cardinall</hi> not to leave their part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for their part in <hi>Paradise:</hi>

And with that <hi>noble man</hi> (which <hi>Luther</hi> speaks of) who professed, that if this life of going from whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house to whore-house might last ever, hee would not envie any mans going to heaven. But this will not last; <hi>There is great wrath prepared for the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> And therefore my humble request is, that if any of you finde your hearts unwilling to submit to that godly counsell, given you in the morning, of turning to God, doe but think what your sinnes, which you <hi>prize</hi> so much, will <hi>cost</hi> you. They say the Pope hath a book called <hi>Taxa camerae Apostolicae,</hi> wherein men may know the <hi>rate</hi> of any sinne; upon what termes a man may keep a whore, be a Sodomite, or murder his Father, &amp;c. But here is a <hi>rate-book,</hi> where any of you may know what a beloved sinne will <hi>cost</hi> you; not a farthing token lesse, than to lie under the devouring fire of Gods wrath to all eternity. Porters will try their burthens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their shoulders before they engage themselves to carry it, doe thou so. It is reported of Master <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> when he thought he should be burnt, he would put his finger into the candle to see how he could endure burning, doe thou often so; goe often alone and say, here is a sinne marvellous pleasant, such a sinne gaines me thus much every yeere, but there is wrath to come: And therefore as <hi>Elihu</hi> said to <hi>Iob, Because there is</hi>

               <note place="margin">God may go on to desolation.</note> For the truth of it, were there no other Instance to be found in any other story, but this in my Text, it were sufficient to prove that such a thing may bee. That which hath been already, may bee so againe. <hi>Iosiah,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Proved by Scripture. 2 Chro. 34.</note> we see, wrought such a <hi>Reformation,</hi> that the <hi>whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did, all his dayes, follow the Lord; and notwith stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, God turned not from his fierce wrath;</hi> but went on to destroy them. The Lord threatens else-where that he would doe it, <hi>Zeph. 2. 1, 2. Gather your selves together before the decree bring forth, before the day passe as the chaffe, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you:</hi> As if he should have said, The <hi>decree</hi> is not <hi>yet</hi> come forth; but if once it bring forth, it will be too <hi>late</hi> for you to seek for mercy. There be other examples (though not so full as this) sufficient to prove this truth: As <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh</hi> for one: The Lord sent the Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> to preach <hi>repentance</hi> or <hi>destruction</hi> to them; and you know it is said, The <hi>King</hi> laid aside his Crown, and called them all to repentance; and repent they did; and God saw their works, and for a while forbore that City; and <note place="margin">Ionah 3.</note> yet the judgement of most Interpreters is, that within fourty years after, the City was destroyed, even in the same age wherein the Reformation was made.</p>
            <p>That Instance of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is most remarkable, in our Saviour <hi>Christs</hi> time: <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> came before him, and <hi>turned the hearts of the parents to the children, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the parents; made ready a people prepared for the Lord; there went out to him Ierusalem and all Iudea, and all the region about Iordan, and were baptized of him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing their sins.</hi> And Christ had so many followers, that the Scribes and Pharisees said, all <hi>the world went after him;</hi> that is, the body of their Nation.

In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of these things and some others which might bee <note place="margin">Psa. 106 23</note> suggested, I thinke I may say, no mortall man can possibly determine when the <hi>precise time</hi> of this or that Nations utter ruine is certainly come.

And what learned men say of them, who have studied for the <hi>Philosophers stone,</hi> though they could never finde out the <hi>Elixar;</hi> yet in their search after <hi>it</hi> they have found out <hi>many excellent things,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably usefull for mankinde: so in this search if wee cannot determine that such a Nation will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly

bee ruined, yet wee may certainly finde such things as thereby to learne what to <hi>feare,</hi> what to <hi>expect,</hi> what to <hi>pray against,</hi> what to <hi>strive after,</hi> &amp;c. And so consequently the handling of this question may bee exceedingly usefull to such an Assembly, as I am now called to speak to in the name of God.</p>
            <p>This then is a second step that wee may know such things as may make us feare desolation, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour to prevent it, or prepare for it.</p>

               <note place="margin">And how it may be known.</note> Thirdly, the maine question is to enquire what are the Tokens, the <hi>gray haires,</hi> the <hi>flourishing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond tree,</hi> whereby wee may guesse at <hi>mans going to his long home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, Politicians, and some Divines will tell you of the fatall period of Kingdoms, that they have their youth, their strength, and after a time their declination; and shew by abundance of experience, that States sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome continue above five or six hundred years without some fatall change: But we must goe by a surer rule than this. It is not length of time, which makes God weary of shewing mercy; but, what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of <note place="margin">Prov. 28.</note> Kings, <hi>for the transgressions of a land many are the Princes thereof:</hi> so for the <hi>transgressions</hi> of a land, and the transgressions <hi>only,</hi> many are the ruines thereof. Now there is one rule which God hath alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by in the dissolution of Churches and Kingdoms ever since the beginning of the world, and that is this. That whensoever the sins of any <hi>Church, Nation, City,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Fulnesse of sin the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it.</note> 
               <hi>Family,</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> (you may take it as large or as narrow as you will) are come to a full measure, then God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly brings ruine upon them. This is the rule which


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96240:18"/>
I shall make plaine to you: God hath set severall ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to limit the sinnes of all Nations, beyond which they shall not goe; as once God said to the waves of the Sea, <hi>hitherto thou shalt goe, but here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy proud waves shall be staied:</hi> so God hath said of the sinnes of Nations, Families, Persons: thus farre I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare thee, but farther thy wickednesse shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; then comes thy end. Take foure or five cleare evidences for it in the Scripture. First that speech of God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> I will give thy posterity all this land, but not yet, because <hi>the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>full:</hi> though they were <hi>Amorites,</hi> God would beare with them, till their iniquities were come to the full, and then he would spare them no longer. Another is <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> 5. verse 6. The prophet in a vision saw an <hi>Ephah,</hi> a thing like a bushell, and moreover the Lord told him, <hi>this is the resemblance of the Ephah, throughout all the earth:</hi> as if God should have said, this is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this people, but this rule I go by throughout the whole world: and what was that? the <hi>Ephah</hi> is brought out, and into the Ephah is cast a <hi>Woman;</hi> this woman sate and filled the Ephah: then one brings a talent of lead for a cover to it, and that stops the mouth of it, and shuts the woman in; then come two women with the wind in their wings, and they take up the Ephah and carry it between heaven and earth, and place it in the land of <hi>Shinar</hi> or Babylon, there to build it an house, and to set it upon its own base. Now what is the meaning of all this? there is one word in the vision, which is a <hi>key</hi> to open this <hi>lock, viz. this is wickednesse:</hi> the meaning whereof is, That the Lord had brought the Jewes from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they had


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96240:18"/>
beene seventy yeeres: as soone as they came home; though they turned not to idolatry, yet they proved stark naught. God sets them their Ephah, puts their iniquity into a vessell, and doth (as it were) say, Goe on, till yee have filled the Ephah; but as soone as that is full, I will clap a talent of lead in the mouth of it, I will take a course yee shall sinne no longer in this land, but will scatter you into <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> into the land of <hi>Shinar,</hi> and there be as wicked as yee will. So you see when the measure is full, then ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance comes.</p>
            <p>Take another instance, in the first of <hi>Iames</hi> verse 15. <hi>When lust hath conceived, it brings forth sinne; and sinne when it is finished, brings forth death;</hi> which is of the same interpretation with the former, and shewes us sins progresse in the rising, reigning, and ruine. First a man hath <hi>lust,</hi> a wicked corrupt heart that hee brings into the world; every man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comes into the world with a heart full of lust, now this lust brings forth iniquity; God leaves people to goe on in wickednesse, if they be not such as he means to save; and when their sinne is <hi>perfected,</hi> it brings forth death; when it comes to the full fourty weeks, and hath gone the full time, then comes destruction. Take yet two instances more, both in the fourteenth of the Revelation verse 14, &amp;c. in the Parables of the vintage, and of the harvest; when they were ripe, then ruine comes. Till then God useth to beare with people: <hi>smaller judgements</hi> often come before sinne is ripe, and are removed againe; but when once the measure is full, then God saith, as in <hi>Nahum</hi> chap. 1. verse 6. <hi>He will make an utier end, affliction shall not rise up the second time;</hi> hee will


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96240:19"/>
so doe it at once, that they shall not need to feare a second.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why God defers till sin be full.</note> Now if by the way you desire to know why God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers so long, and rather cuts not off wicked men sooner. I answer, it should suffice us, that it is his <hi>will</hi> to do it; but further he doth it, partly that they may be for <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi> to his people to <hi>purge</hi> and <hi>humble them,</hi> as <hi>Ashur</hi> was his rod to whip his people, before the rod was <note place="margin">Esay 10.</note> burnt. And partly to declare his long-suffering, and patience, thereby to leave them without excuse if they prove incorrigible. Thirdly, this is for salvation <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4, 5.</note> to some, who in the meane time are to be gathered in: and this I take it, the Apostle meanes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. when he saith, the Lord defers his comming to judgement, because the Nation of the Jews is first to be gathered in. So that as the Angel staid till <hi>Lot</hi> was plucked out of <hi>Sodom:</hi> so God hath some brands to snatch out of the fire, for whose sakes he defers the execution of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance against them, whose sins call for it. For these causes, and it may be others not known to us, but secret to himselfe, doth God deferre the full execution of his wrath till sinne be ripe.</p>

               <note place="margin">How the fulnesse of a Peoples sin may be known.</note> But how may wee judge when the sins of a people grow to the full?
