            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF the Dedication of Books were not in use, yet here I think I might have been a precedent. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Phytological Science is one part of Your Work; and 'tis You have called me to the management of this part, for some time have intrusted
<pb facs="tcp:105413:3"/>
me herein, and by Your most benign and candid acceptance of what I have performed thus far, have encouraged me hereunto: I therefore present but Your own into Your hands.</p>
            <p>The great Honour and Advantage of Your Fellowship, I first obtained by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the late most Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Chester;</hi> whom I cannot name without saying thus much of him, That He was a Person of that eminent and happy Worth, which as it was too good to fear envy, so is it too great to need an Elogie.</p>
            <p>With Him it was You were pleased to approve of me for that Vndertaking which I have here begun. Had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted my own abilities altogether, I should scarcely have ventured upon it; seeing very little for which I could think well of my self, saving that I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon good grounds, to think of You with greatest Honour. But I also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, That to insist hereon too much,
<pb facs="tcp:105413:3"/>
might be a reflection upon Your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who had thought fit to make choice of me. And, That You were not more the Patrons of Wit, than of Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and of all who shall endeavour to find out, or to confirm the Truth of Things. Withal, I looked upon Nature as a Treasure so infinitely full, that as all men together cannot exhaust it; so no man, but may find out somewhat therein, if he be resolved to Try.</p>
            <p>In compliance therefore with Your Commands, I have hereunto devoted my self. These adding force to my own desires of being somewhat instrumental to the improvement of Medicinal and and other wholesom Knowledge: if peradventure, as we increase herein, we may become better and more happy. As to which Improvement, though I could not hope, yet I would not despair. I have already prepared the Soil, and made some Plantation; what remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth behind, and the Vintage of the whole,
<pb facs="tcp:105413:4"/>
will depend much upon the continued In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Your Beams: for how unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising soever the Stock may be, yet the Fruit cannot but be somewhat matured upon which You are pleas'd to shine. I am also confident, that the same Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Goodness which accept the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, will likewise pardon the faults, of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HAving divers years since di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Anatomy of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; what Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I had from time to time occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally made, I published some time since. In making whereof, I proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Seed sown, throughout all the Parts, to the Seed again. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning to the Anatomy of every Part, my thoughts of their oeconomical Uses thence deduced.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I had examined the Parts chiefly by the bare eye: some few Observations excepted, which were made by the Microscope. And this
<pb facs="tcp:105413:5"/>
I did, to the intent I might make proof, both for my self and others, how far it is possible to go with the eye, without the help of Glasses: pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing afterward to make the utmost use of those also.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the Publication of These, a Discourse from the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Malpighius</hi> (to whose most inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and accurate industry the World is much beholden) was presented to the <hi>Royal Society</hi> upon the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 7. 1671. and Dated at <hi>Bononia, Novemb.</hi> 1. 1671. By whose Suffrage I was glad to see the Truth of my Observations all along confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; his very little differing from mine, though He hath every where made use of the Microscope. As for the Air-vessels, (which he calls the <hi>Fistulae Spirales</hi>) although I have long since taken notice of them, as those which, being much larger than the rest, are more easily discoverable; yet
<pb facs="tcp:105413:5"/>
the manner of their Spiral Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (not observable but by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croscope) I first learned from Him, who hath given a very elegant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of them. He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates not many of his thoughts of the oeconomical Use of the Parts. And some Things observable of the Parts of the Flower, Fruit, and Seed, not there found, He may possibly reserve by him amongst others. I could heartily wish He would have publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Discourse, but that He is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to, before it be furnished with Figures: for which reason I thought good to give this account of it.</p>
            <p>Presently after the Impression of my first Endeavours, I resolved upon a further prosecution of them. The Series of my Thoughts and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following thereupon, I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed into three Parts, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Command of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> have now made publick.
<pb facs="tcp:105413:6"/>
Which I have the more willingly done, that others may hence take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the better to consider, what they have to do as well as I. For we may as well commit the Government of the World, as the Management of Philosophy to any one: and much better, since Things are far more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than Men, and no less various and out of sight.</p>
            <p>For the first, it is as comprehensive as I could at present make it. I doubt not, but that further Means and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries may be suggested; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no way better than in the prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of these: the generation of Experiments being like that of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, where one thing introduceth an hundred more which otherwise would never have been thought of.</p>
            <p>The second is the prosecution of what I had before begun, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to continue, both of the Root, and all the other Parts. For this I
<pb facs="tcp:105413:6"/>
apologize not; for what I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, are neither Words, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Things; but both the real and the visible Works of God.</p>
            <p>As to the last, I only desire it may be remembred, That while I speak of Natural Causes, and particularly of those of Vegetation, I intend only the Material ones, which (whatever others, besides the first, be assigned) we must allow to be so qualified as to become instrumental thereto; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be denied that there is such a Thing as a Material Cause.</p>
            <p>If it be asked why I insist so much on These, whilst I am silent of the Existence, Nature, and Energy of the <hi>Anima Vegetalis,</hi> the <hi>Vis formatrix,</hi> the <hi>Vis Motiva,</hi> or other Immaterial one? To this, because I am willing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Question soberly propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I answer; That it is not for that I have had no thoughts hereof; but because I do not find they do so well
<pb facs="tcp:105413:7"/>
answer the Scope whereto I am more obliged: for the investigation of the Nature of any other Secondary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, than such as are Material, cannot be so useful to one that is considering the Nature of a Disease, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding or Applying a Remedy thereunto. And if any of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or Discourses of <hi>Cartesius, Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendus,</hi> or others about Material Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, may, upon a right Judgment made, be found culpable, I am not about to answer for them.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:105413:12"/>
            <head>AN IDEA OF A PHYTOLOGICAL HISTORY Propounded. THE FIRST PART.</head>
            <p>IF we take account of the degrees whereunto the knowledge of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables is advanced, it appeareth, That their Descriptions, Places, and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are with good preciseness and curiosity set before us. Likewise, that we are informed of the Natures and infallible Faculties of many of them. Whereunto so many as have assisted, have much obliged their Posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105413:13"/>By due reflection upon what they have performed, it also appears, what they have lest imperfect, and what undone. For the Vertues of many Vetegables are with much uncertainty, and too promiscuously ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them. And of the Vertues of many they are altogether silent. And although, for the finding out and just appropriation of them, they have left us some Rules, yet not all. The Descriptions likewise of many are yet to be perfected; as also their Draughts, especially as to their Roots. And their proper ranks and affinities much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined. But for the Reason of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Causes of all those infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties therein observable (I mean so far as matter, and the various affections hereof are instrumental thereto) almost all men have seemed to be unconcerned.</p>
            <p>That nothing hereof remaineth further to be known, is a thought not well calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. For if we consider how long and gradual a Journey the knowledge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, and how short a time we have to proceed therein; as on the one hand, we shall conclude it our ease and profit to see how far others have gone before us: so shall we beware on the other, that we conceive not unduly of Nature, whilst we have a just value for those who were but her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105413:13"/>
and instructed by her. Their time and abilities both being short to her, which as she was first designed by Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so may her vast dimensions best be judged of, in being compared therewith. It will therefore be our prudence, not to insist upon the invidious question, which of her Scholars have taken the fairest measure of her; but to be well satisfied, that as yet she hath not be circumscribed by any.</p>
            <p>Nor doth it more behove us to consider how much of the Nature of Vegetation may lie before us yet unknown, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a great part thereof to be knowable: not concluding from the acknowledged, much less supposed insuccessfulness of any mens undertakings; but from what may be accounted possible as to the Nature of things themselves; and from Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by infinite ways conducting to the knowledge of them. Neither can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how great a part this may be; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is impossible to measure what we see not. And since we are most likely to under-measure, we shall hereby but intrench our endeavours, which we are not wont to carry beyond the Idea which we have of our Work.</p>
            <p>And how far soever this kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be attainable, its being so far also
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105413:14"/>
worthy our attainment will be granted. For beholding the many and elegant varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherewith a Field or Garden is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who would not say, That it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pleasant to know what we see; and not more delightful to one who has eyes, to discern that all is very fine; than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother who hath reason, to understand how. This surely were for a man to take a true Inventory of his Goods, and his best way to put a price upon them. Yea it seems, that this were not only to be partaker of Divine Bounty; but also, in some degree, to be Copartner in the Secrets of Divine Art. That which were very desirable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we should think it impertinent for us to design the knowing of that, which God hath once thought fit to do.</p>
            <p>If for these and other reasons an inquiry into the Nature of Vegetation may be of good import; it will be requisite to see first of all what may offer it self to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of, or to understand what our Scope is; that so doing, we may take our aim the better in making, and having made, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying our observations thereunto. Amongst other inquiries therefore, such as these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be proposed. First, by what means it is that a Plant, or any part of it, comes to grow; a Seed to put forth a Root and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105413:14"/>
Trunk; and this, all the other parts to the Seed again; and all these being formed, by continual nutrition still to be increased. How the Aliment by which a Plant is fed, is duly prepared in its several parts; which way it is conveyed unto them; and in what manner it is assimilated to their respective Natures in them all. Whence this growth and augmentation is not made of one, but many differing degrees, unto both extremes of small and great; whether the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be made betwixt several Plants, or the several parts of one. How not only their sizes, but also their shapes are so exceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng various; as of Roots, in being th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, stringed or ramified, and the like; of Trunks, some being more entire, others branched, others shrub'd; of Leaves, which are long or round, even edg'd or escallop'd, and many other ways diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the other parts. Then to inquire, what should be the reason of their various Motions, that the Root should d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>mes be perpendicular, sometimes more level; that the Trunk doth ascend; and that the ascent thereof, as to the space of time wherein it is made, is of different measures; and of divers other Motions, as they are observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105413:15"/>
in the Roots, Trunks, and other parts of Vegetables. Whence again, these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have their different and stated Terms; that Plants have their set and peculiar sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for their spring or birth, for their full growth, and for their teeming, and the like. Further, what may be the causes as of the seasons of their growth, so of the periods of their lives; some being annual, others biennial, others perennial; some perennial both as to their Roots and Trunks; and some as to their Roots only. Then, as they pass through these several seasons of their lives, in what manner their convenient feeding, housing, cloathing, or protection otherwise, is contrived; wherein in this kind and harmonious oeconomy, one part may be officious to another for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the health and life of the whole. And lastly, what care is taken, not only for themselves, but for their posterity; in what manner the seed is prepared, formed, and fitted for propagation: and this being of so great concernment, how sometimes the other parts also, as Roots in putting forth Trunks, Trunks in putting forth Roots, yea in turning oftentimes into Roots them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; whereof I shall in the following Discourse give some instances: with other Heads of Inquiry of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105413:15"/>Nor are the Natures, Faculties, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Vegetables less various, or a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inspection hereinto of less concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For since all, or most, seem to grow in the same manner, with one Sun, one Rain, indifferently well upon one Soil, and to outward appearance to have the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parts; it may be asked, How it comes to pass, that their liquors, or other contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts are of such different kinds, one being watry, another winy, a third oily, a fourth milky, and the like. How also there is such a variety in their sensible qualities, as their Colours, Tastes, and Smells; what those Materials are, which are necessary to the being of these qualities; and those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities wherein their Essence doth consist; as what it is that makes a Plant or Flower to be white or red; fragrant or fetid; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or sweet; or to be of any other colour, smell, or taste. In like manner their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Powers, what that is or those things are by which they are constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as whence one becomes purgative, another vomitory, a third Diaphoretick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These, I say, with many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inquiries depending hereupon, as they cannot but much oblige the reason of man to be obsequious to them; so by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in at least some satisfaction with no less
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105413:16"/>
reward it. Especially if it be withal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that besides our satisfaction as to the Nature of Vegetation, some further light to divers other parts of Knowledge may likewise hence arise.</p>
            <p>For since the present Design will ingage us to an accurate and multifarious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vegetables; we may hereby be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to range and sort them with more certainty, according to the degrees of their affinity. And all Exoticks, Plants or parts of Plants, may probably be reduced to some such Domesticks, unto which they may bear the best resemblance. Again, it may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conduct our minds to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the state of Animals; as whether there are not divers material agreements betwixt them both, and what they are. Wherein also they may considerably differ, and what those things are which are more essential to their distinguishment. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, not only to compare what is already known of both, but also by what may be observed in the one, to suggest and facilitate the finding out of what may yet be unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the other So also the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Colours, Smells, and Tastes of Vegetables, may conduce to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the same Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alities in general; or of what it is that constitutes them such in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105413:16"/>
any other body: not as they are actually received by sense; but so far as such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials or external Circumstances are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to their becoming the adequate objects thereof. It may lead us also to inquire into further ways of Cultivation, with respect to the whole Plant, or to the Flower, Fruit, or other part: To amend them as to their Sizes, Colours, Tastes, Fruitfulness, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: To think of other ways of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, or to apply those already known to other Vegetables than hath been used. Likewise the knowledge of their Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uses may hereby be enlarged; both as to the reason of their use, in such particular Trades and Manufactures, already known; and the discovery of other uses yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. As also their Alimental, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect both to Meats and Drinks; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of some, and the finding out of others. But especially their Medicinal; some Vegetables which have hitherto been neglected, may be applied to use; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted uses of some, and the confused uses of others may be rectified. What may best correct their Malignancies, or inforce their Vertues; when needful to add the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Art to that of Nature; how to enlarge those of Art, and rectifie those which are indeed inartificial, may hereby be better
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105413:17"/>
conjectured. The knowledge of all which, that we may know how far it is accessible, and what probable approaches may be made towards it; those several means I have thought of, and suppose necessary thereunto are next to be proposed.</p>
            <p>Reflecting then upon the present Design, and seeing this to lie wide; we shall in the first place conclude the Means attending thereon should do so likewise. Wherefore although some may present themselves unto us as more promising; yet let us suppose what others also were they hereunto enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, each according to his sense and Genius, would possibly make choice of. Believing, that although considering men may vary in the approval of their own sense and notion; yet not always meerly, because it is their own, but because each may probably see somewhat more in his own, than others do. Wherefore it will be our surest Logick to conclude, not because no Mean may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all, that all should be rejected; but rather because each may be approved by some, that therefore all be made choice of.</p>
            <p>And first of all, whatever is of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal consideration, as the Figures, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, Motions, Seasons, Situations of Vegetables, and of their several parts,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105413:17"/>
should be observed. In doing which, a particular survey of all their varieties should be taken. And then a comparison made betwixt these and the several Plants or parts of Plants whereof they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. To the end we may, if possible, be thereby conducted to find out what other sensible, or more recluse property any of them may agree together in. For it is not more certain, that the three Angles of every Rectilinear Triangle, because all ways equal to two Right Angles, are therefore, if put together, always the same: than that one property agreeing to divers Vegetables, should have one cause: for although the scope and end may vary, yet the cause, as it is the cause of that property, must be one: and consequently must also import some Identity in the Nature of all those Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles wherein it acts. Wherefore by thus comparing of them, we shall be able more exactly to state the Orders and Degrees of their Affinities, better to understand both the Causes and Ends of their Varieties, and more probably to conjecture of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Vertues.</p>
            <p>First then the various figures of their several parts should be observed; and that with respect both to the forms, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions by which their Roots, Trunks, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105413:18"/>
Leaves, Flowers, Fruits, and Seeds may vary or agree; and those several Lines by which both the said Varieties are draw. In which of these parts the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chiefly lies; this being both more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, and material in some of them, less in the Root, more in the Flower or Seed. And in how many of these parts together, whether one, more, or all. By both which the Orders and Degrees of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity may be accounted, either as to what we strictly call Kindred, or else Analogy. Thus all Strawberries are 'akin together in the first degree, with Cinquefoyl in the second, with Tormentil in the third, and with Avens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in others more remote. So Agrimony hath alike Analogy unto Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, as Goats-Rue hath to Claver; and Strawberry the like unto the Rasp, as Goos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry to the Vine, or Burnet to the Rose. So all Pulse are not only of kin in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees to one another; but likewise to almost all kinds of Trefoyls, as Melilot, Foenugreek, and the common Clavers themselves; as by comparing not only their Leaves, but Flowers, Seeds, and Cods toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be evident. For the several parts of the flower of a Trefoyl are so many more Flowers, containing so many Cods of small Seeds, all in shape agreeable to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105413:18"/>
Flowers, Cods, and Seeds of Pulse.</p>
            <p>From hence likewise the Natures of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables may be conjectured. For in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon divers Plants, though of different names and kinds; yet if some affinity may be found betwixt them, then the nature of any one of them being well known, we have thence ground of conjecture as to the nature of all the rest. So that as every Plant may have somewhat of nature indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual to it self; so as far as it obtaineth any visible communities with other Plants, so far may it partake of common Nature with those also. Thus the Wild and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cucumers have this difference, that the one purgeth strongly, the other not at all; yet in being Diuretick, they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. The Natures of Umbelliferous Plants we know are various; yet 'tis most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they all agree in this one, <hi>scil.</hi> in being Carminative. The several sorts both of Corn and Grass are all 'akin; there is no doubt therefore but that the seeds of Grass themselves (of Rye and Oats it is tryed) if it were worth the while to order them, as Barley, would yield an inflammable Spirit. So likewise the several kinds of Pulse, as is said: for which reason I question not, but that in some cases wherein Ciches are esteemed a good Medicine, a Decoction of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105413:19"/>
the better sort of Pease, especially that we call Sugar-Pease, may go beyond them. As doth also the flower of Beans that of the seeds of Foenugreek, even there where they are accounted excellent. So Tulips, Lillies, Crocuses, Jacynths, and Onions themselves, with many others in their several degrees, are all allied. If therefore Crocuses, Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Lillies agree in one or more faculties, then why may not all the rest? as in being anodyne; or in some other common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby in their Vegetation, their parts are governed and over-ruled to one common or analogous form.</p>
            <p>The Proportions likewise amongst the several parts of Vegetables, for the same reasons, deserve to be observed; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison being made both betwixt the parts of several Plants, and the several parts of one. And here again, either betwixt any two of the parts, or any one of them, and the whole besides, or all the rest put together. So some larger Seeds, produce a small Root; as those of Cucumer: and others smaller, produce one very great; as those of Briony. Some Plants, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, though themselves but very slender, yet have a vast and bulky fruit; others again, as Thistles, and many yet more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, have no other fruit besides their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105413:19"/>
seed. So the seeds of all Pulse, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Garden Bean, though very large, yet produce but a small Plant: but those of Foxglove, Mullen, Burdock, Sun-flower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being themselves much less, do yet produce a far greater. And especially those seeds which are inclosed in the thicker sort of Cover, (analogous to that I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where called the Secondine) as that of Peony; whose seed so called, is only the Nest wherein the true and real seed is lodged, no bigger than a little Pins head: which is also observable of the seeds of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Plants. These and the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, as they lie betwixt the several parts, should be noted: and to what plants or parts especially, any of them may agree: comparing also in what other kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties an agreement betwixt the said parts may be found: that so doing, we may, if possible, amongst all their individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be instructed to single out those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, which are concomitant to such agreeing properties.</p>
            <p>The several Seasons also of plants and of their parts should be considered. Observing at what particular times of the year any of them chiefly spring, early or late. The times wherein they germinate; whether for some space only, or all the year long.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105413:20"/>
Wherein they spring after sowing; or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er after springing, sooner or flower. Which flower the first year, or not till the second. Which before the Leaves, or afterwards. The maturation of the fruit or seed, how long after the flower, and the like. All or some of which varieties being laid together, we may probably conjecture the causes thereof; and the Natures of the Plants in which they are seen; <hi>scil.</hi> as such a degree of heat may be necessary for the fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the better distribution of the sap of such a Plant, or the impregnation of the Air to be mixed therewith, or the due dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Soil to render the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient aliment thereunto.</p>
            <p>The proper Places also of Plants, or such wherein they have from their seeds or other way of propagation, a spontaneous growth, should be considered. And that as to the Climate, whether in one colder, temperate, or more hot. The Region, Continent, or Island. The seat, as Sea or Land, watry, boggy, or dry; Hills, Plains, or Vallies; open, in Woods, or under Hedges, and the like. From whence in like manner as from their seasons, their particular Natures may be directed unto: in that so far as we may conjecture the nature of such an Air, Soil, or Seat, we may also of such a Plant to which they are congenial.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105413:20"/>So likewise, those many varieties obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the Motions of Plants and of their parts, both kinds and degrees; Ascending, Descending, and Collateral; Rectilinear, and Spiral Motions, should be noted; to what Plants they agree, and wherein any of them may be analogous to those of Animals. And in a word, any other forensick properties of Plants. And then to compare them all together, both being necessary. For thoughts cannot work upon nothing, no more than hands; he that will build an house, must provide Materials. And on the contrary, the Materials will never become an house, unless by certain Rules he joyn them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So it is not simply the knowledge of many things, but a multifarious copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in the mind, that becomes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick of further knowledge. And thus much for the first general Mean.</p>
            <p>The next which I propose, and that a most necessary one, is Anatomy. For when upon the dissection of Vegetables, we see so great a difference in them, that not only their outward figures, but also their inward structure is so elegant, and in all so various, it must needs lead us thus to think, That these inward varieties were either to no end; or if they were, we must assign to what. To imagine the first, were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105413:21"/>
vain; as if Nature, the Handmaid of Divine Wisdom, should with her fine Needle and Thred, stitch up so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pieces, of so difficult, and yet so groundless a Work. But if for some end, then either only to be looked upon, or some other besides. If for this only, then this must be such as in respect whereof, her work is at no time, nor in any degree fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; the contrary thereunto is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest. For although men do every where with frequent pleasure behold the outward elegancies of Plants; yet the inward ones, which generally are as precise and various as the outward, we see how usual it is for the beholding of these to be omitted by them. And besides, when we have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Natures work as well as we can, it may be no impediment to our best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to believe, that somewhat of it will still remain behind unseen. So that if to be seen, were the only end of it, it must needs be wholly frustrate, as to the greater number of men, and in some part as to all. Wherefore we must suppose some other ends of the said varieties, which should have their effect, and so these not be in vain, whether men beheld them, or not; which are therefore such as have respect to Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: that the Corn might grow so, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105413:21"/>
the flower so, whether or no men had a mind, leisure, or ability to understand how.</p>
            <p>If then the Anatomy of Vegetables be so useful a Mean, we ought not to streighten it, but to force this as well as the rest to its utmost extent. And therefore first of all, to go through all the parts, with equal care examining the Root, Trunk, Branch, Leaf, Flower, Fruit, and Seed. Then to repeat or retrograde the Dissection from part to part: in that although the best Method of delivery, for clear discourse, can be but one, according to that of Nature, from the seed forward to the seed: yet can it not but be useful for that of Dissection to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to and fro; somewhat or other being more visible in each several part, from whence still an <hi>Item</hi> may be taken for the ushering in the observation of it in the other. To examine again, not only all the parts, but kinds of Vegetables, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to observe divers of the same size, shape, motion, age, sap, quality, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or any other way the same, which may also agree in some one or more particulars as to their interior structure: and to make this comparison throughout all their parts and properties. To observe them likewise in several seasons of the year, and in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105413:22"/>
ages of the Vegetables, and of its parts; in both which div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs of them may be noted to change not only their dimensions, but their Natures also; as Vessels do into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments, and Cartilages into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ones some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Animals. And to do all this by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways of Section, oblique, perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and transverse; all three being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, if not to observe, yet the better to comprehend some things. And it will be convenient sometimes to break, tear, or otherwise divide without a Section. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Knife it will be necessary to joyn the Microscope, and to examine all the parts, and every way, in the use of that. As also, that both immediate and micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopical Inspections be compared; since it is certain, that some things may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by reason and the eye conjunct, without the Glass, which cannot be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by it; or else the discovery is so dark, as which alone may not be safely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, when two be unequal, and then they produce six varieties. Thirdly, when three be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105413:23"/>
which produceth twelve varieties. Or lastly, when all four be unequal, which produceth twenty four: which general va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties may be further multiplied by their several degrees.</p>
            <p>From all which we may come to know, what the Communities of Vegetables are, as belonging to all; what their Distinctions to such a kind; their Properties, to such a Species; and their Peculiarities to such particular ones. And as in Metaphysical or other contemplative matters, when we have a distinct knowledge of the communities and differences of things, we may then be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to give their true Definitions: so may we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> another, but also wherein; so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s not more surely to define by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward figure, than by the inward structure, what that is, or those things are, whereby any Plant or sort of Plants may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all others. And having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a knowledge of the Communities and Differences amongst the parts of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, it may conduct us through a Series of more facile and probable Conclusions of the ways of their causality, as to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Differences of Vegetation. And thus much for the second general Mean.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105413:23"/>Having thus far examined the organical and containing parts of Vegetables; it will be requisite more designedly to observe those also which are fluid, or any others contained in them: and that for our better understanding both of the Nature of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and of the said contained parts. And to make inquiry, first of their kinds, as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; both such as agree in general in being vinous, and those that are special to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Plants. Airs and Vapours; for the existence whereof in all Vegetables there are certain Arguments. And for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their natures, as they are existent in several parts, there are probable ones. <hi>Lymphas</hi> or clear Saps; Milks, Oyls, Gums, Sugars, Salts, or other concrete and fixed parts. Where by Salts I mean not such as are separated by Calcination, but are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly existent in Plants in their natural estate, and in some of them, as in the Roots of Iris, are discoverable, even without the help of a Microscope. To which may be added such Mucilages, which though not so properly contained within the parts, yet are found lying over them; as over the first Spring-leaves of all kinds of Docks, betwixt the Leaves and the Veil wherein they are involved.</p>
            <p>Of all these should be observed, first their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105413:24"/>
Receptacles, some of them being proper to one, others common to two or more of them: since it is certain, that some of them do transmigrate from one into another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle, or that the same Receptacle is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with bodies of a quite different nature, at the different seasons of the year, and ages of the Vegetable. And it is also very probable, that two of some of them may sometimes be contained in one Receptacle at the same time; as in Animals, the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> in the D. <hi>Thoracicus,</hi> and that and the Chyle in the sanguineous Vessels.</p>
            <p>Then their Motions; both natural, and such as may be effected by Art: and those either by descent or ascent. And in ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, through what different Chanels or parts of the Trunk; since it is certain, that there is a variety both in respect of the season and of Vegetables. Where it will fall in to observe the Tapping of Trees: As also their Bleeding: to what Trees it is proper to bleed: in those to which it is, with what difference of celerity: and when their peculiar season: for none will bleed at all times; neither will all bleed at the same. And then their collateral motion, together with the mode of their transition from one organical part to another.</p>
            <p>Next their Quantities, either of one; as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105413:24"/>
the comparison is made betwixt several Plants, or betwixt the parts of the same: So the true Seed of all Plants containeth more Oyl in proportion than any of the rest. Or else of divers as coexistent and bearing such a proportion one to another in the same part: of most of which it may be known by their respective Receptacles. Yet the computation must not be made from the number of the said Receptacles simply, but as that is in conjunction with their capacity, and as their capacity is proportioned to their surrounding sides; the sides of those of the least capacity being usually as thick as those of the greatest: so that suppose ten lesser, to lye within the compass of one greater; the content of these altogether would scarce be equal to half the content of that one.</p>
            <p>Also their Consistence; <hi>scil.</hi> of so many of them as are discriminable by touch; in being soft or hard, thin or thick, mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, gummous, glutinous, friable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these in their several degrees, in which there is a variety, as in the Milks of some Plants, which are more dilute than that of others: in their Lympha's or clear Saps, that of most being thin, of Cumfry and some others mucilaginous. And by this to be compared in the same manner as by their Quantity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:105413:25"/>Likewise their Colours, Smells, and Tastes: The general and particular kinds of all which should be noted. And to what contained parts, and in what variety, they appertain. So the Milks of some are paler, as in Burdock; of others whiter, as in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera; Citrine, in Angelica; Yellow, in Lovage. In some Plants odorous, as in Umbelliferous; in others not, as in Cicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raceous: and in most bitter, but with many diversities. And most Mucilages have little either Colour, Taste, or Smell, and the like. Here also the same Qualities are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, as in general speaking they are said to be belonging to a Vegetable: since it is more than probable, that all Colours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">

               </gap> parts more single, as always in the Seed; or more compounded, as in the Flower; and in what Plants more especially, as in Pancy. Which proper to Plants that have such a taste or smell, as both in white Flowers are usually less strong. To Plants that flower in such a season, as a yellow Flower, I think chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Spring-plants. And to Plants that are natural to such a Soil or Seat, as to Water-plants more usually a white Flower. What, amongst all Colours, more common to Plants, as green; or more rare, as black. And what all these varieties of Colours are upon Cultivation, but chiefly in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soil. To observe also with their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Colours, those within: so the Roots of Docks are yellow, of Bistort red, of Avens purple, but of most white. Where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and superficial Colours agree, as in the Leaves; or vary, as in the other parts frequently. And in what manner they are situated; some universally spreading, others running only along with the Vessels, as in the Leaves of red Dock, and the Flowers of Wood-Sorrel.</p>
            <p>Next their Odours; what may be their principal Seat; whether one or divers seats in the same Plant. What the chief matter
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105413:26"/>
out of which they are continually bred. What similitude betwixt the smells of divers Vegetables, as betwixt Baume and a Limon, the green Leaves of Meadow-sweet and the green Pills of Walnuts. Or betwixt those of Plants and Animals, as the smell of green and well-grown Carduus is like to that rank scent <hi>ab axillis nonnullorum spiranti.</hi> Which have a more sensible smell, as most have; and which have less, as Corn. Where the green Leaf is the most fragrant part, as in Musk-Cranesbill; where the Flower, as in Roses; the Root, as in sweet Calamus. Where all the parts have some odour, where some, or one only; as in Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grass only the flowers; and in Arum the Pestil only, for neither the Leaf nor Root hath any smell, but this is strong enough, not much unlike to humane excrements.</p>
            <p>But especially their Tastes, which it much importeth us more precisely to distinguish; first by their general kinds; for the number even of these may be computed greater than usually it is. I remember not that Heat and Acritude, with respect to Taste, are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; yet Arum Root is very pungent without any proper heat, and Cloves are very hot without any proper pungency. So the white Roots of Yarrow have a Taste hardly any other way perceptible, than by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105413:26"/>
causing a gentle glowing and continuing warmth upon the tongue. Also their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondencies one to another; as that of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doary, and of the lesser Cardamoms is somewhat like to Camphire. Likewise their degrees; in which there is a great latitude, and may be extended from one to ten, or with easie distinction from one to five; so the Root of Sorrel is bitter in the first, of Dock in the second, of Dog-Rose in the third, of Dandelyon in the fourth, of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in the fifth: observing them not only as they vary in several kinds, but the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Species of one, as in Cichory, Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed, Dandelyon. And then their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; for Tastes are as truly conjunct in one part, as Colours: by which the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is still greater; in that all kinds of Tastes, in all their degrees, and in differing numbers may be variously compounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: for the most part two, as in the Leaves of sharp-pointed Dock, astringent and sowre; in Sorrel Roots astringent and bitter; and in Aloes bitter and sweet, the one in the fifth, the other in the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as upon an unprejudiced tryal may be perceived: and yet more evidently in the Gall of any Land-Animal. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three, as in Agrimony bitter, rough, and sowrish; and in Agarick bitter, rough,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105413:27"/>
and sweet. And sometimes perhaps more: the sensible distinctions of all which may lye almost as wide as of Plants themselves. Wherefore although it were great rashness to take away the distinctions of Hot, Cold, Moist, Dry, Thin, Gross, and other Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in their several degrees, which the Ancients have affixed to particular Plants; yet since they have done it to many of them with much uncertainty, and that withal they are more properly the effects and operations of Plants than their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; practical observation may therefore approve it useful, to add these sensible ones of various Tastes, precisely distinguishing their Conjugations and Degrees. Lastly, their several varieties, and mutuations with respect to the subject wherein they reside, should also be noted. As, of all Tastes found in Plants, bitter and sowre are most common; sweet and salt most rare. How they vary with the age of the Plant or part, as the Roots of Radishes, growing up to seed, lose their strength; so most Fruits are first sowre, then sweet. What proper to the several parts of any one Plant; so the Leaves of Wormwood are extraordinary bitter, the Root scarcely so at all, of an hot, but quite different taste. What more common or rare to any part; so no Root,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105413:27"/>
that I ever tasted, is sowre. And how they alternate in several Plants; as the Root of Stock Gillow-flower is biting, not the Leaves; on the contrary, the Leaves of the smaller Arsmart are biting, but not the Root, and the like. To which we may add the difference of time wherein the tastes of Plants are perceived; as those of Arum and Rape-Crowfoot are both biting; but that of the first as it is slowly perceived, so it continues long; that of the other quickly comes and quickly goes.</p>
            <p>Amongst the other adjuncts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained parts, though not of these only, the Faculties of Vegetables are to be reputed: for so the Rosin of Jalap, which is purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is as truly contained in the organical parts of that Root, as blood is in Veins. It will be requisite therefore to make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular observation of these also. And first, what Faculties chiefly may reside in Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables above others: so there is none of known use in Salivation, except by holding in the mouth: although we may ask, why some amongst them may not (being taken inwardly) have a power to evacuate by this, as well as other violent ways? Where more universally spread over all the parts of a Vegetable, as in Asarum. Where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing chiefly or wholly to any particular
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105413:28"/>
parts or part; as chiefly to the Root of Rhubarb; and only to the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per seed of <hi>Barbado</hi> Nuts. Whether such faculties may be proper to such parts espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. What conjunction they may have with tastes, or other qualities; so such as are purging and vomitory, though some of them have a strong taste, yet the greater part, and of those many of the stronger sort, have no taste, or not much; as Senna, Jalap, Scammony, Hellebore, Asarum, and others. So also those that are more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tasted, are, I think for the most part, more or less bitter; either simply, as Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthis; or bitter and astringent, as Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb; or bitter and sweet, as Aloe; or bitter, astringent, and sweet, as Agarick. Few are hot, as Iris. Or simply sweet, as Manna. And though some may be subacid that are mollifying or lenitive, yet no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Purge or Vomit is sowre. How like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their faculties and qualities may vary their degrees either differently or together; so Aloe and Colocynthis are both bitter in the highest degree; yet Aloe, which is also sweet, purgeth more moderately; Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthis, which is only bitter, most violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. How far the faculties of Vegetables, as well as their qualities, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, where, and which chiefly; as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105413:28"/>
astrictive and purgative in Rhabarb. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re this Question may be put, Whether divers other and yet more extreme faculties, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> well as these of astrictive and purgative, may not somewh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what affinity there may be betwixt them, as most Plants that are strong Purgative<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and especially Vomitories, I think are also Sternutatory, as white Hellebore, Jalap, Tabacco: and on the contrary, such as are Sternutatory, are some of the most proper and most potent Medicines for the Head, Brain, and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus far a particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Qualities and Faculties of the Contents of Vegetables may proceed, as they are existent in their natural estate. From which, although some probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures may be made of their material and formal Essences, and of the Causes of their determinate Varieties, or the Modes of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation necessary thereunto: yet will our conceptions hereof be more facile, clear, and comprehensive, if by all other ways of observation they be likewise examin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105413:29"/>
according as Experiment may be applicable to any of them.</p>
            <p>As by Contusion; so some Plants give their smell not without rubbing, or not so well; as the green Leaves of Stramonium, Scurvygrass, and many more: others lose it by rubbing, as the flowers of Violets, Carnations, Borage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others yield it both ways, as Rosemary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So some Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mend their taste by scoaping, and Pears by rowling, especially that called the Rowling Pear.</p>
            <p>By Agitation; which doth that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by force, which Digestion doth by heat: so any cold Oyl and a Syrup being in a due manner agitated together, of two fluid bodies will become one consistent, as is known.</p>
            <p>By Frigifaction; how far the Juyces of Vegetables, either without or within them, may be any of them, or some more than others, subject to Cold: and thereby to be deprived of their motion or natural consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, or may suffer alteration in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Taste, or Smell.</p>
            <p>By Infusion; where I mean Infusion only in simple water; and so to observe, which of them may be dissolved herein, and how far; for some may be wholly, some but in part, others not at all; or very little; which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105413:29"/>
is proper to some Milks as well as Gums. So what different Colours, Smells, or Tastes they hereupon yield; which are found various, and in some very unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as the green Leaves of Bawm being duly infused in plain water, without any other body added, tincture it with a pure and deep red, near that of Claret Wine, as I have often tryed.</p>
            <p>By Digestion with Fermentation; either of the entire Vegetables, or of the Juyces or other Contents; and these by themselves or with simple Water. And hereby to note what difference may be in the strength, celerity, or continuance of the Fermentation. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how their Qualities may thereby be altered; as the smell of Violet-flowers, from a most excellent fragrancy, may by Digestion be reduced to an odious and abominable stink, like that of the black Mud of Gutters, as I have tryed more than once.</p>
            <p>By Digestion with Calefaction; so the colour of the Juyce of Limons from trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency (if that be a colour) may be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a perfect red. Whence it is that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are deceived in the preparation called the Tincture of Corals; supposing the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to give the Menstruum its colour; whereas the Menstruum will obtain it only
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105413:30"/>
by Digestion without any Corals mixed with it.</p>
            <p>By Decoction; either of Vegetables themselves, or of their Liquors; and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what alterations follow. So Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine boiled becometh friable; Sugar bitter and of a brown red. Turneps lose their biting taste, Onions their picquancy; yet neither of them convey those self same qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to the water. The same may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Decoction of sweet Fennel-seeds, Aniseeds, and others, losing much of their tastes themselves, and yet conveying very little of them to the Liquors wherein they are boiled, the greater portion of their volatile parts, and their vertue and taste therewith, flying away: whereof therefore it is much better to make an Emulsion, than to decoct them, or to make an Emulsion from them with their own Decoction, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Medicine be intended to be Carminative, as I have frequently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Decoction should also be carried on throughout all degrees to that of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; by which the qualities thereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are much altered; as in that of the green Leaves of Violets, which from a kind of yellow, deepens at last into a dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour as black as pitch, and that without the least Empyreuma.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:105413:30"/>By Distillations; both with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Still, Alembick, Chappel, or open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and to note what Vegetables thus give the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> smell or taste, and in what degrees of strength either under or over their natural ones; as Mint, Pennyroyal, and the like, which are Aromatick and hot, give their tastes perfect: but Wormwood, which is Aromatick and bitter, gives it but by halfs, only as Aromatick, little as bitter. And Carduus, though also so exceeding bitter, yet not being Aromatick, scarce yieldeth any taste at all. Also what Vegetables yield Oyl most plentifully; and what difference may be in those Oyls as to their colour, weight, or otherwise, as that of Cloves is sometimes red, of Cinnamon lympid, both ponderous. So to distill Juices, Gums, or other Contents with an hot fire, and to see what bodies they yield, and of what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as Turpentine is known to yield be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides its Oyl a subacid Water, Vinegar an eager Spirit, as that part may be called, which Chymists are wont to call the Phlegm.</p>
            <p>By Arefaction; so Milks which are liquid and white in their natural estate, in standing grow gummous, yellow, and otherwise dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, so doth that of Scorzonera; and that of Fenil into a balsamical, but limpid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105413:31"/>
Oyl. So the Roots of Arum upon drying lose much of the strength of their taste; but the contrary may be noted of many other Roots, which upon drying increase it. Some being cut and laid by, change their natural colours into red, purple, yellow, green, or white; as Liquorish into white in some places, and Peony into red; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into two, as Patience, into yellow and red.</p>
            <p>By Assation; thus Apples by roasting eat more sowre. The Root of Horse Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish toasted tasteth like a Turnep. Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, Onions, and many other Roots and parts have their tastes either altered or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fracted; which chiefly and in what manner should be observed. There is one altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as remarkable as commonly known, and is that which followeth upon roasting or baking in one kind of the <hi>Waldensian</hi> Pears, which for a Walden we corruptly call a Warden.</p>
            <p>By Ustion; wherein some Vegetables lose their smell, as Roses; others keep it, as Rosemary; and others mend it, as Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Aloes. To note not only the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their qualities, but what they yield; as Turpentine, which in Distillation yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Oyl and Water both lympid, upon Usti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sheweth nothing but a black Soot. So
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105413:31"/>
Benzonie by Distillation Oyl, by Ustion white Flowers, as is known.</p>
            <p>By Calcination; and here to obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. And to compare them with what they yield by Distillation and Ustion as to both. Thus far they have been tryed simply or by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. They should also be examined.</p>
            <p>By Composition; not only with Water, as in simple Infusions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodies which may have a power of acting upon them, or upon which these may have a power to act. And so to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, Destillations, Decoctions, Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in divers kinds of Liquors, as Vinegar, Urine, Spirit of H. H. Wine, Blood, Milk, or others. So in Infusions some red colours are heightned by acids, blews turned pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So fetid Spirits may doubtless be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred much more grateful by being rectified once or twice with fresh Aromaticks. To observe also what follows upon mixing the Liquors or other parts of Plants toget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er; as Oyl of Turpentine by Digestion with a Lixivial Salt extracteth thence a red Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Or with Salts, Earths, Metals, or any other bodies, as the Juyce of the green
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105413:32"/>
Leaves of Rose, Raspberry, Primrose, and divers other Plants (I think principally such as are astringent) expressed upon Steel, as it drieth, becometh of a purple colour.</p>
            <p>Lastly, by Compounding the Experiment it self, or joyning two or more of them upon the same matter: as Fermentation and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation, as is used for some Waters. Infusion and Fermentation, as in making of Beer. Fermentation and Coction, or rather Assa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in making of Bread. Arefaction and Destillation, as may be tryed upon some Herbs, and with what difference from what may be noted upon their being distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moist.</p>
            <p>Having proceeded thus far by all the above particular ways of observation; a comparative prospect must be taken of them: by which at last the Communities and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of the Contents of Vegetables may be discerned; the manner of their Causation and Original partly be judged of; and wherein it is that the Essence of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Natures and Qualities doth consist, in some measure comprehended. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both from the knowledge of their particular Natures, and the Analogy found betwixt them, we may be able better to conjecture and try what any of them are or may be good for. For certainly, we shall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105413:32"/>
then know more readily to apply things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and more fitly to prepare them for their proper uses, when we first know what they are. Notwithstanding, since the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Plants do often lie more recluse; it is best therefore not wholly to acquiesce in such Conjectures as their tastes or other properties may suggest; but to subjoyn Experiment. In making which, and in passing a Judgment thereon, many cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in respect of the Plant whereof, and the subject whereupon it is made, are requisite to be attended. Which yet, in regard they result not so directly from the matter at present in hand, I shall not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here insist upon. And thus much for the third general Mean.</p>
            <p>Together with the Contents of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts of Vegetables, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to examine their Principles also, or the Bodies which are not so properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the said Organical parts, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concurrent and essential to their Being. And of these we are to observe, first their Number; whether well reducible to five, six, seven, or more, or fewer: and the special differences observable under any one general; since there are many bodies of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different natures confounded under one name. Next their Conjugation; which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105413:33"/>
they are that either under or over those observable in animal or other Bodies, are here joyned together in a Vegetable; How far common to the Organical parts of divers Vegetables; or to the several Organical parts of one; or how far different in them. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their Proportions; which stand in the greatest, which in the least, or in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quantities, and in what degrees; both in divers Vegetables, and in the several or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts of one. And then the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration and Union of them altogether; as to the degrees of their closeness or laxity; or the manner of their Implication and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency; or as to their Location, one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more central, another more exposed and rampant over the rest; or otherwise diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. To examine these Principles by their Colour, Taste, Smell, Consistence, Fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Volatily, Weight, Figures, or other Accidents. And to these purposes, to go through the fore-mentioned ways of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, as Ustion, Calcination, Destillation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as any of them may appear applicable hereunto. And to make Experiment not only upon the several organical parts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, but also upon the Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves whereinto they are resolved, as by mixing them with one another, or with other bodies, or otherwise. I know it will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105413:33"/>
be difficult to make observations of this kind upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he organical parts of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles severally. Yet I have thought of some ways whereby true and undeceivable ones may be made upon some of them; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably on the rest also: which yet, in regard I have not made much tryal of them, I shall not now mention.</p>
            <p>The prosecution of what is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded will be requisite, to a fuller and clearer view, of the Modes of Vegetation, of the sensible Natures of Vegetables, and of their more recluse Faculties and Powers. First, of the Modes of Vegetation. For suppose we were speaking of a Root; from a due consideration of the properties of any part or parts thereof; 'tis true, that the real and genuine Causes may be rendred of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other dependent properties as spoken generally of the whole Root. But it will be asked again, What may be the Causes of those first and independent ones? Which if we will seek, we must do it by inquiring also, What are the Principles of those parts? For it is necessary that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereof a Body doth consist should be, if not all of them the active, yet the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citating Causes, or such as are called <hi>Causae sine qua non</hi> of its be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oming and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing, in all re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pects both as to Subst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nce and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105413:34"/>
what it is: otherwise, their existence in that body were altogether superfluous, since it might have been without them: which if so, it might then have been made of any other; there being no necessity of putting any difference, if neither those whereof it is made are thought necessary to its being. Wherefore if we will allow a Body, and so the organical parts of a Vegetable to have Principles; we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so allow these Principles their necessary use, and that the shapes, or other properties of the said parts are as much dependent upon the Nature of these, as is the roundness of a drop of Ink upon the fluidity of water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient to it.</p>
            <p>Again, the Principles of the organical parts being known, we may from thence obtain a further knowledge of the Natures and Causation or Original of their Contents; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105413:34"/>
part from amongst others, as are apt to combine and mix together in such a form, and so to constitute such a Liquor; it is as clear, that the existence, if not of those principles, yet of that Liquor, is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the said part.</p>
            <p>And if by means of the said parts it is that their Contents become such and such pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Mixtures; it is hence also manifest, that by the same means they are of such distinct faculties and powers: Because the faculty or power of a Body lieth not in any of its principles apart, but is a resultance from them all, or from their being in such pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar sort and manner united and combined together. So the principles of the purgative parts of a Root, as of Rhubarb, although we should suppose them to be existent in the surrounding Earth, yet we cannot say that that Earth, or the principles therein contained are purgative; but only such as by being combined together in such a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way may become so. So the several parts of a Clock, although they are and must be all praeexistent to it, and it is their form by which they are what they are themselves; yet is it the setting together of such kind of parts, and in such a kind of way only, that makes them a Clock. And since we see that the mixture of two Bodies
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105413:35"/>
of two different quali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as of two colours, will produce a third colour differing from them both, as blue and red do a murrey; why should not two or more bodies of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent natures also, be so combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to produce a third nature? Or wherefore may not that be allowed to be performed by Nature, which by artificial compounding of Medicines or other Bodies is designed, and often times eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted? I'le give but one instance; Water, Grease, and an Alcalizate Salt may be easily so ordered as to be invested with new qualities, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and powers; the Salt to lose its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme fiery pungent taste; the Tallow its smell; and being before unsociable with water, to mingle therewith; neither Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Salt, nor Water alone will fetch out a spot of Grease, but all united easily do it; the same three parts united are, in some cases, as in the Jaundies, an excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, any of which given alone may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove prejudicial than a Cure: and all this done only by duly boiling them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one body, which we call Sope.</p>
            <p>Whence again, if it be such an union and proportion of such a sort of principles which produceth such a faculty; and that we may by any means come to know what these are; we may possibly also attain to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105413:35"/>
the knowledge of such Rules as whereby any kind of Faculty may be made, as to compound such bodies which are neither purgative nor vomitory, so together as to be invested with these Faculties. And if to make them, then consequently to mend, exalt, strengthen, and ennoble them with greater ease and certainty. And thus much for the fourth general Mean.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have considered the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of a Vegetable only as ingredient to it: there yet remains a fifth story to be ascended, which is to consider these Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials also as they are derived from abroad: or as after they are received and naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, they may with others yet abroad have any kind of correspondence. And these are four in general, <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il</hi> Earth, Water, Air, and Sun, all which in that they contribute so universally to Vegetation, and to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is contained in a Vegetable, it is therefore requisite, that of these likewise particular observation should be made.</p>
            <p>And first of the Earth, and of all solid Receptacles of Plants. Where we are to consider their several kinds, as Mellow, Sandy, Clayie, Chalky, and others. Their Ingredients, as rank and mellow Earth with Sand, or with Clay, or Sand with Clay, or altogether, and in what proportions. The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105413:36"/>
Principles whereinto any one of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients separated from the rest, and put to the Test of Distillation, Ustion, Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or other, either alone, or by mixture with other bodies, may be resolved. And by their qualities, as Colour, Smell, Taste, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> both Ingredients and Principles to be examined. To make tryal of the growth of Plants in all kinds of simple Soils; either Earthy or Mineral, as Clay, Marl, Oker, Fullers Earth, Bole Armeniac, Vitriol, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Vegetable, as ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten Wood, Brans, Starch, or Flower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Animal, as Dungs, pounded Flesh, dried and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Blood, and the like; that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how far any of these may contribute to the growth of a Plant, or to one above another.</p>
            <p>Next of the Water, and of all liquid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles. Where the several kinds of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Wells, Springs, Rain, and Rivers are by their qualities and faculties to be examined, as these and by these their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples either in their natural state or upon digestion, or otherwise may be observable: since plain Water it self is undoubtedly compounded of several Principles; the simplicity thereof being argued, neither from its clearness and transparency, for a solution of Alum, though it containeth a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105413:36"/>
considerable quantity of Earth is yet very clear; nor from its seeming to have neither smell nor taste, for Water drinkers will tell you of the varieties of both in different Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Besides, if these qualities should be accounted rather phansie than sense, the difference of Waters is yet more manifest from their different effects, observed by Cooks, Laundresses, Brewers, and others that have occasion to use them: for not to mix with Sope without curdling, not to boil meat tender, or without colouring it red, and the like, are the vices of some Waters, not of others, which yet would seem in colour, taste, and smell to be the same. Tryal should also be made of the growth of Plants in all kind of liquid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, as common Water, Snow water, Sea water, Urine, Milk, Whey, Wine, Oyl, Ink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or any of these with a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Salt, Nitre, Sal prunellae, Sope, or other body. And hereby to observe what follows either in the Liquor, or in the Plant it self: as if any fixed body being weighed before its dissolution in water, and if the Plant set herein groweth, the water being then evaporated, whether the quantity of that dissolved body continue the same, or is lessened. So whether any Vegetable will become Opiate by growing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105413:37"/>
a considerable time in a plain solution or Water-tincture of Opium, and the like. Which Experiments what event soever they have, yet at least for our further instruction in the Nature of Vegetation may be of use.</p>
            <p>Next of Air; where it will be requisite to inquire, what sort of bodies may be herein contained: It being probable, from the variety of Meteors formed herein, and of Vapours and Exhalations continually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced hereinto, that some or other of them may bear an Analogy to all volatile bodies, whether Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral. And to consider the peculiar nature of that body which is strictly called Air. As also to try what different effects a diversity of Air may have upon a Vegetable; as by setting a Plant or Seed either exceeding low, as at the bottom of a deep Well; or exceeding high, as on the top of a Steeple. Or else by exposing some Soil to the Air, which is assuredly free from any Seed, and so as no Seed can light upon it, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve whether the Air hath a power of producing a Vegetable therein, or not: and the like.</p>
            <p>Lastly of the Sun; as to which it may be considered, what influence it may have upon the Plant it self, upon the Soil, or upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105413:37"/>
the Air. Whether that influence is any thing else besides heat, or may differ from that of a fire otherwise than by being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and more equal. Although it will be found very difficult here to make any sincere Experiments. As for that of the Collection of the Sun-beams by the help of Glasses in the form of a Magistery or of Flowers, and such like, I desire to suspend my thoughts of them till I see them. I will only say thus much at present, That I do not understand why the Sun should not have some influence upon bodies besides by heat, if it may be granted that the Moon hath, for which it should seem there are some good arguments.</p>
            <p>We have thus far examined the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples necessary to Vegetation; the Question may be put once more, In what manner are these Principles so adapted as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come capable of being assembled together in such a Number, Conjugation, Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Union, as to make a Vegetable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? For the comprehension whereof, we must also know, what are the Principles of these Principles. Which although they lie in so great an abyss of obscurity, yet I think I have some reason to believe they are not altogether undiscoverable: How far they may be so, I am so far from deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105413:38"/>
that I shall not now conjecture.</p>
            <p>This is the Design, and these the Means I propound in order thereunto. To which I suppose they may all appear to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. For what we obtain of Nature, we must not do it by commanding, but by courting of her. Those that woo her may possibly have her for their Wife; but she is not so common as to prostitute her self to the best behaved Wit, which only pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiseth upon it self, and is not applied to Her. I mean, that where ever men will go beyond phansie and imagination, depending upon the conduct of Divine Wisdom, they must labour, hope, and persevere. And as the Means propounded are all necessary, so they may in some measure prove effectual. How far I promise not; the way is long and dark: and as Travellers sometimes amongst Mountains, by gaining the top of one, are so far from their Journies end, that they only come to see another lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: so the way of Nature is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervious, and, as I may say, down hill and up hill, that how far soever we go, yet the surmounting of one difficulty, is wont still to give us the prospect of another. We may therefore believe our attainments will be imperfect after we have done all: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot attain to all, that therefore
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105413:38"/>
we should endeavour after nothing, is an inference which looks so much awry from the practical sense of men, that it ought not to be answered. Nor with better reason may we go about determining what may be done. The greatest designs that any men undertake, are of the greatest uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to their success: which if they appear to be of good import, though we know not how far they are attainable, we are to propound the means, in the utmost use whereof only we can be able to judge: a War is not to be quitted for the hazards which attend it; nor the Councils of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces broken up, because those that sit at them have not the Spirit of Prophecy, as well as of Wisdom. To conclude, Although but little should be effected, yet to design more can do us no harm: For although a man shall never be able to hit Stars by shooting at them, yet he shall come much nearer to them, than another that throws at Apples.</p>

               <p>BEing to speak of Roots, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, for our better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what follows, that some things, as to their Figures, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Ages, be premised.</p>
               <p>Roots are generally distinguished, as to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105413:39"/>
their Figures, in being more Entire, as is Liquorish; or parted, as St. Johns wort. Parted either at the bottom, as most Roots; or at the top, as Dandelyon and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Parted again, are either Ramified, as Cumfry; or Manifold, as Crowfoot: both are parted, but the former, by the subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of greater branches into lesser; these, when divers Roots have all their distinct original from one head. Some are straight, as a Radish; others crooked, as Bistort. Smooth, as Bugloss; or stringy all round about, as Columbine. Thick, as Rhubarb; slender, as the Vine. Long, as Fenil; short, as a Turnep: which are distinct from great and little, in that these are so called with respect to several Roots; those with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the several dimensions of one. Short are stubbed, as Iris tuberosa; or round, as Dracontium. Round are tuberous, as Rape Crowfoot; bulbous, as Onion. Where note, That all bulbous Roots are as it were Hermaphrodites, or Root and Trunk both together: for the strings only are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Roots; the Bulb actually containing those parts, which springing up, make the Leaves or Body; and is as it were, a great Bud under ground. Roots, again, are plain or uneven: Plain are Cylindrical, as Eryngo; or Pyramidal, as Borage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105413:40"/>
smaller downwards, as do most; or greater, as Skirrets. Uneven are pitted, as Potato's, where the eyes of the future Trunks lie inward; or knobbed, as Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Artichoke, where they stand out. These differences are also compounded: so some Roots are both entire and smooth, as Peony; others entire, but stringy, as Clary. Some both plain and knobbed, as Filipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, <hi>Lilium non bulbosum,</hi> and others. And amongst them all there are several degrees: all which, with other differences, by those that undertake the Descriptions of Plants, are accurately to be noted: and in Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these, and all the other parts, their sizes withal should be adjusted by a Scale. But the differences above mentioned will serve for our present purpose.</p>
               <p>The Motions of Roots are also divers. Sometimes level, as of Hops, and all such as properly creep: sometimes perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r, as of a Parsnep: which is diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rent from straightness, for some straight Roots are level. Both of them are either shallow, or deep: some run level, and near the Turfe, as wild Anemony; others lower, as Dogs-Grass: some strike down but a little way, as Stramonium; others grow deep, as Hors-Radish: which is different from being long; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>any long Roots are level, as Hops.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105413:40"/>
Some again descend, as Tulips and other bulbous Roots: which differs from growing downwards; in that here the head of the Root is immoveable; but in descending, the whole Root doth <hi>locum mutare,</hi> running deeper time after time into the Earth. Some also ascend sometimes, and in some part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing above ground, as Turneps. These Motions are also compounded, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the several parts of the Root, and of several times. So the main Root of Primrose is level, the stringy are perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The Roots of most Seedlings grow downward and upward at the same time. Those of Bistort, Iris, and some others, grow in part both downward and upward at several times: whence it is that Bistort is crooked; and that some parts of Iris Root appear oftentimes above the ground. And many are writhed or twisted without being moved out of their place; which motion cannot be observed but only by the oblique process of the Vessels, which we shall presently describe.</p>
               <p>The Motion of Descent hath as yet been observed of Bulbous Roots only. But it is common to many Roots besides, as those of Arum, Primrose, Ammi, Avens, Iris, and others. For of the Trunks of these and many other Plants it is observable, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:105413:41"/>
gradually and continually descending below the surface of the ground, and hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein, they are thus both in nature, place, and office changed into true Roots, which, by the continuance of the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Trunk, also descend. This is more especially demonstrated by some, as by the level and knobed Roots of Wood-Sorrel, Primrose, &amp;c. For the Leaves of these Plants rotting off successively, and their Trunk gradually descending into the Mould, each Basis of these Leaves is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with a more copious Sap, and so swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into so many knobs. The notice of this motion here, leadeth to the discovery of the like in other Plants, where the Leaves fall off close by the surface of the Trunk, as in Iris tuberosa, where only the seats of the perished Leaves and the ends of their Vessels are obscurely visible.</p>
               <p>The Cause of this Descent, so far as it is dependent on the inward conformation of the Root, I shall hereafter shew. But the immediate visible one, are the String-Roots which these kind of Trunks frequently put forth; which descending themselves direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ground, like so many Ropes, lug the Trunk after them. Hence the Tube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Roots of Iris, upon the rotting or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding away of the String-Roots hanging at
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105413:41"/>
them, sometimes a little re-ascend. Hence also the shape of some Roots is inverted; for whereas most are parted downwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several Legs, some are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rted upwards into divers Necks, as Dandelyon and others. For these sending forth at the top several Trunk-buds, the said Buds successively put forth new and cast their old Leaves, and continually also making their descent, are at length formed into so many Necks of three, four, five, or more inches long under ground.</p>
               <p>Hence also we understand in what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way some Roots become perennial. Some are wholly so, as those of Trees, Shrubs, and divers woody Plants. Others in part, or by a new Progenies of Roots, from the old head or body, in the room of those that die yearly, or after a certain time; as of <hi>Lilium non bulbosum,</hi> Jerusalem Artichoke, Potato, Dog-stones, Monks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, little Celandine, and others: in which Plants, one or more of their Roots are firm, the other spongy and superannuated, and partly by the ravine of the Trunk and other younger Roots reduced to a consumption and death. With these Tulips and other Bulbous Roots consort: for the several Rindes and Shells, whereof chiefly the Bulb consists, successively perish and shrink up
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105413:42"/>
into so many thin and dry skins: betwixt which, and in their centre, other Leaves and shells being successively formed, the Bulb is thus perpetuated. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the String-Roots also succeed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annually. So that at the end of divers years, although it be still looked upon as the same individual Root, yet is it in truth another as to every particle thereof. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, many other Roots are perpetuated by the aforesaid descent of the Trunk, out of which it is still annually repaired, as by the gradual perishing of its lower parts it is diminished; as the tuberous Roots of Arum, Iris, Strawberry, Avens, &amp;c. the extreme and elder parts whereof first fade, and by degrees rot off. Whence also we see the reason of the rugged and blunt extremities of these and some other Roots, as of that Plant superstitiously called Devils-bit; which is not so originally, but part thereof rotting off, the living remainder becometh stumped or seemeth bitten. Thus far of the general Shapes, Motions, and Ages of Roots.</p>

               <p>I Next proceed to the several Parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Root is compounded. The outer part of all is the skin; which is common to all Roots. 'Tis diversly coloured, whiter in Skirrets, yellow in Dock, red in Potato, brown in Lovage, black in Bugloss. Its surface sometimes smooth, as in Horsradish; rough, as in Scorzonera. 'Tis of various size; very thin in Parsnep, somewhat thick in Bugloss, very thick in Iris. Sometimes it is opacous, as in Thistle; and sometimes transparent, as in Madder. Every Root hath successively two kind of skins: the one coetaneous with the other parts; and hath its original from that which involveth the parts of the Seed it self. The other post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, succeeding in the room of the former as the Root ageth; and is originated from the Bark.</p>
               <p>This skin is usually, if not always, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two kinds of bodies: which also is probable of the coetaneous. The one parenchymous, and frequently constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of exceeding little Cells or Bubles; which in some Roots, as of Asparagus, cut traverse, and viewed through a Microscope are plainly visible. See the Figure. These
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105413:43"/>
Bubles are of different sizes, in Bugloss lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in Asparagus less; and sometimes they coincide and disappear. But in these and all other Roots, even where these Bubles appear not, the Parenchyma of the skin is of the same substantial nature with that other more vivid and bulky one of the Bark: as is manifest from its being thence origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and alike conformed, as shall be seen; and not only adjacent to it, as a Glove is to the Hand; but continuous therewith, as the parts of a piece of flesh are one with another.</p>
               <p>Of this parenchymous body the skin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth chiefly, but not wholly; there being many tubulary Vessels mixed therewith: which though hardly by the Microscope, yet otherwise is demonstrable. For in tearing the skin, you shall do it more easily by the length than bredth; because by the first way, the continuity only of the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma is dissolved; but by the latter, both of this and of the Vessels, these being posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the length of the Root: So that as by the smalness of the Bubles of the Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyma, the skin is dense; so by these Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels is it tough. Again, if you cut a Root traverse, and let it lie by for some time, all the parts, where there are no Vessels, shrink below the surface of the cut-end; but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105413:43"/>
where-ever these are posited, there is no shrinking; which oftentimes evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears also in the skin: because the said ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, though, as the Bubles, they may coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, yet they cannot visibly shorten or shrink up in length; no more than a Straw, whose sides may yet be easily crushed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Further, the Root being cut traverse, if near the cut-end you very gently press the side of the Root with the edge of your nail, the sap will thereupon arise sometimes from the skin; in the same manner, as from any other part of the Root where the like Vessels are posited. And although the sap may likewise be expressed from the pith and other parts where sometimes there are none of these Vessels; yet not without a solution of their continuity; which here doth not follow, as appears from the disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the sap, together with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the pressure, the said Vessels then dilating themselves by a motion of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so sucking up the sap again. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be added the testimony of sight; the very Vessels themselves, in many Roots, coming under an apparent view, and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the utmost surface of the Root all round about, as in that of Liquorish, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbine, Scorzonera, and others. [<hi>See the Figure of Scorzonera Root.</hi>] Which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105413:44"/>
I have here once for all more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly set down, because I shall have occasion hereafter to refer to them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>NExt within the skin lieth the Bark. 'Tis sometimes yellow, as in Dock; red, in Bistort; but usually, and in seedling Roots I think always, white. It is derived from the seed it self; being but the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or prolongation of part of one of those bodies therein originally existent, and which I have elsewhere called the Radicle. It is variously sized; sometimes very thin, as in Jerusalem Artichoke, Goats beard, and most Trees; where it also retains the name of a Bark or Rinde. Sometimes 'tis more thick, and maketh up the far greatest part of the Root, as in the String-Roots of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus, Dandelyon, and others. The thinnest and the thickest are all analogous, and obtain the same general uses. The degrees of its size amongst all Roots may be well reckoned about twenty, and seen in the following examples, <hi>sc.</hi> Beet, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Jerusalem Artichoke, Orpine, Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Goats-beard, Nettle, Brownwort,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105413:44"/>
Columbine, Celandine, Asparagus, Hors-Radish, Peony, Bryony, Eryngo, Borage, Lovage, Dandelyon, Parsnep, Carrot: in which the Bark is considered absolutely, and not in comparison with the other parts. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>It is compounded of two Bodies. The one parenchymous; continuous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; yet somewhat pliable without a solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its continuity. Exceeding porous; as appeareth from its so much shrinking up in drying. The pores hereof are extended much alike both by the length and bredth of the Root; therefore it shrinketh up by both those dimensions more equally. And they are very dilative; as is also manifest from its restorableness to its former bulk again, upon its infusion in water: that is to say, it is a most curious and exquisitely fine wrought Sponge. Thus much the eye and reason may discover.</p>
               <p>The Microscope confirms the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and more precisely shews, That these pores are all, in a manner, spherical, and this part nothing else but an infinite Mass of little Cells or fixed Bubles. The sides of none of them are visibly pervious from one into another, but each is bounded within it self: So that the Parenchyma of the Bark is much the same thing, as to conformation,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105413:45"/>
which the froth of Beer or Eggs is as a fluid, or a piece of fine Manchet as a fixed body. The sides also of these Bubles are as transparent as those of Water. [<hi>See any of the Microscopical Figures.</hi>]</p>
               <p>But their size is usually much smaller; and their posture more regular. In all Roots they are so small, as scarcely without the Microscope to be discerned: yet are they of different sizes both in the same and in divers Roots; the varieties whereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all Roots may be reduced to about ten or twelve, some of those in Dandelyon being of the smallest, and in Bugloss of the greatest. [<hi>See the Microscopical Figures.</hi>] They are posited for the most part at equal height; and piled even one over another: so that oftentimes they visibly run in ranks or trains both by the length and bredth of the Root, as in the Root of Bugloss or Dandelyon split through the middle may be seen. Although they are usually sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, yet sometimes and in some places they are more oblong, as in the outward part of the Bark of Bugloss. [<hi>See the Microscopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Figure.</hi>] These Bubles are sometimes best seen, after the Root, being cut tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, hath layn by a while to dry.</p>
               <p>They are the Receptacles of Liquor; which is ever of a limpid colour; and I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105413:45"/>
think always more thin. They are in all Seed-Roots filled herewith; and usually in those also which are well grown, as of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Radish, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This parenchymous part is, in many Roots, of one uniform contexture; as in Asparagus, Hors-Radish, Peony, Potato, and others. In many others it is as it were of a diversified woof; the Bubles being, though regular, yet either in shape, size, or situation different in some parts hereof from what they are in other intermediate ones. For these parts are like so many white Rays streaming, by the diameter of the Root, from the inward edge toward the circumference of the Bark; as in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, Melilot, Parsnep, &amp;c. They are, though not in direct lines, continued also by the length of the Root; so that they are as it were so many Membranes by which the other parts of the Bark are distermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Compare the Figures.</p>
               <p>The continuation of these diametral Rays or Portions is divers: sometimes but half through the Bark, or somewhat more or less, as in Melilot. Sometimes, and usually running quite through to the very skin, as in Parsley: wherewith the skin seems to have a closer communion, and in this and the like Roots, to be originated especially there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105413:46"/>
from. They usually stand at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the same Root; but with respect to divers, their distance varies; so less in Parsnep, greater in Angelica. They are commonly rectilinear, as in Lovage; but sometimes winding to and fro, as in Carrot, Burnet. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>They are not always of one size: in a Carrot exceeding slender, and scarcely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable; in others thicker, as in the three greater ones of Melilot, common Chervil. Both by their distance and size they are also less or more numerous, some only as they are nearer, some as smaller, others as both. Sometimes they are of the same thickness through the Bark from edge to edge, as in Lovage. See the Figure. And sometimes are considerably spread or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards the skin, wherewith they are joyned, and whereinto they more visibly run, as in Parsley. See the Root it self. The Bubles of these diametral portions are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greater than those of the other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous parts, as in Parsley; and I think, sometimes less. Yet as there so here variously sized; to about six or eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and those of Parsley about the third, fourth, and fifth. Their figure is sometimes more oblong; and their direction or respect more towards the centre of the Root.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:105413:46"/>As the other parenchymous parts of the Bark are the Receptacles of Liquor, so these (where they are) of Air. This is argued from their being more white, and not transparent, as such Roots and parts use to be, which are more copiously and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled up with liquor: as the pith of Elder, which in the old stalks is white, was once, and by being well soaked, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come again transparent. And from their being more dry and void of liquor; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon their bubles, which cannot be vacui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must be filled with more or less Air, mixed with the sap or the vaporous parts thereof. This is more observable in those diametral Portions which terminate upon and run into the skin.</p>
               <p>The Bark is not only of a divers woof, but, as is said, of a compounded substance; there being a certain number of <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> fewer or more , in some place or other, mixed with the parenchymous part above described; and some way or other are demonstrable in all Roots: as by the toughness of the Bark in being broken by the bredth: by the visible continuation of the said Vessels through the length of the bark in the resemblance of small threds: and by the rising up of the sap in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse cut of the Root, in such places of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105413:47"/>
Bark, where these threds terminate: as the existence of those of the Skin was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>These tubulary Threds run not through the bark in direct lines, but are frequently braced together in the form of Net-work; the parenchymous parts every where filling up the spaces betwixt the braced threds; as in Burnet, Scorzonera, &amp;c. the bark being paired or striped off is apparent. See the Figures. They seem at first, where they are braced, to be inosculated, so as to be pervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one into another: but a more accurate view, especially assisted by a Microscope, discovers the contrary. Neither are they wond any way one about another, as threds are in a Rope: nor implicated, as in ravled Yarn or the knots of a Net: but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous or simply tangent, as the several Cords in the Braces of a Drum: being thus joyned together by the parenchymous parts, as in speaking of the Pith will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood how. Yet do not always the same threds belong and keep entire to one brace; but are frequently parted into lesser threds transposed from brace to brace. Nor do they always, in whole or in part, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after their contingence, mutually fall off again; but oftentimes run along collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally joyned together for some space, as in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105413:47"/>
Jerusalem Artichoke. These braces are of various number in divers Roots; more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Jerusalem Artichoke, less in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonera, more rare in Cumfry. The threds likewise are variously divaricated; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more where the braces are frequent, as in Jerusalem Artichoke; and sometimes less where the braces are rare, as in Scorzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera, Dandelyon: And in all Roots more frequent towards the inner Verge of the bark. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>By what is said it is partly implied, That these threds are not single Vessels; but a cluster of them, twenty, thirty, or more or fewer of them together. Yet as the threds are not in the braces; so neither are the Vessels, in the threds, inosculated. Nor yet twisted; but only stand collateral to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; as the several twires of the Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm do in slieve-silk. Neither are these Vessels Pyramidal, so far as the Glass will discover, or from probable reason may be conjectured. Nor ramified, so as to be successively propagated one from another, after the manner of Veins: but Cylindri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and distinctly continued throughout the length of the Root, as the several fibres in a Tendon or Nerve.</p>
               <p>These Vessels are of divers kinds in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Roots: of the different natures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105413:48"/>
of, although there may be other ways whereby to judge; yet so far as by inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we may do it chiefly by the diversity of those liquors which they severally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Sometimes they yield a Lympha; and that thin, as they do in a Parsnep; especially those that make a Ring at the inward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the bark. See the Root it self. That this clear sap ascendeth only from these Vessels, is certain; because no liquor will do so from any parenchymous part, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. hath been said. And because it is of a different nature from the sap contained in the bubles of the Parenchyma; although of the same colour, yet sensibly more sweet.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they yield a thick and muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laginous Lympha, as in Cumfry, as appeareth by its tenacity. From the mucilaginous Content of these Vessels it is, I suppose, that the sap contained in the bubles is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the like nature, so far as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches hereto; which sometimes is more, as in Marsh-mallow; and sometimes but little, as in Borage: For in pressing out the liquor of this Plant, and then heating it over an indifferent fire; the far greater part hereof remaineth thin; only some certain strings and little bits of a gellied substance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re mixed herewith; which I suppose, were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105413:48"/>
originally the proper liquor of these Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaeducts.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes these succiferous Vessels yield a milky or white sap; and sometimes yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and of other colours; as in Sonchus, and most Cichoraceous Plants; in Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and most Umbelliferous; in Burdock, and divers Thistles, to which that is 'akin: in Scorzonera, Common Bells, and many other Plants not commonly taken notice of to be milky. The milky saps of all which, although they differ in colour and other qualities, yet agree in being more oily; it being the mixture of the oily parts with some other limpid liquor, but of a different nature, which causeth that colour. In the same manner as common Oyl and a strong Liquamen Tartari shaked in a Bottle toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, presently mix into a white Liquor: and although they will for the greatest part separate again; yet some of their parts without any boiling, or so much as the least digestion with heat, by agitation only, or standing together for some time, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the form of a thin milky Sope, which will also dissolve in Water. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose therefore that it is the volatile Salt chiefly of these Plants, which being mixed with their Oyl, renders this Liquor of a white or other colour. Sometimes the Oyl
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105413:49"/>
will separate and discover it self: for if you cut a Fenil root traverse, after it hath layn some days out of the ground; the same Vessels, which in a fresh Root yields Milk, will now yield Oyl.</p>
               <p>All Gums and Balsams are likewise to be reputed the proper Contents of these Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels: for these and Milks are very near 'akin. So the Milk of Fenil, upon standing, turns to a clear Balsam; of Scorzonera, Dandelyon, and others to a Gum. And in the dried Root of Angelica, &amp;c. being split, the Milk, according to the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these Vessels, appeareth, as blood clodders in the Veins, condensed to an hard and shining Rosin. See the Roots them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>These succiferous Vessels are not only of divers kinds in divers Roots, but in the same. Whether in all, I doubt: but in some it is certain they are: For if you cut a Fenil root traverse, both milks and limpid sap will presently ascend, and upon accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate inspection appear thereupon distinctly. [<hi>See both the Figure and the Root it self.</hi>] Whether all Roots have Lymphaeducts, it is also doubtful; but most probable that they have, more or fewer, standing for the most part in a Ring at the inner Verge of the Bark: the sap whereof may be so far off
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105413:49"/>
common Nature in all Roots as to be clear and less oily.</p>
               <p>The Quantity of these Vessels is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: In Borage, Peony, Bistort but few; in Asparagus fewer: in Parsnep, Celandine many; in Fenil, Marsh-mallow many more: and betwixt these extremes there are many degrees, as by comparing the Roots of Horsradish, Turnep, Briony, Skirrets, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sley, Goats-beard, and as many more as you please, may be seen. See the Figures. There are two ways of judging of their number; either as their extremities are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible upon the traverse cut of the bark; or as the bark is diversly brittle or tough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so from the various number of these Vessels therein, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. hath been said.</p>
               <p>The quantity of the ascending Sap, is a doubtful argument, whether of the number or size of these Vessels. For it is common to most milky Roots, for the Milk to ascend more copiously: yet in some of them, the Vessels seem not to be, in proportion with the parenchymous part, so numerous as in some other Roots, where the ascending sap is less; as by comparing the Lacteals of Dandelyon and the Lymphaeducts of Fenil together may appear: so that it should seem, that the bore of the lacteal Vessels is greater than that of the Lymphaeducts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:105413:50"/>The Situation of these Vessels is various and elegant. Sometimes they are posited only at the inner edge of the bark, where they make a Ring, as in Asparagus. In which place and position they stand in most, if not in all, Roots, how variously soever otherwise they are posited. This Ring is either more entire, as in Eryngo, Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Valerian, &amp;c. or it is a prick'd Ring, as in Butterbur. Sometimes they are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly posturd in a Prick-ring towards the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the bark, as in Peony: and some are pricked all over the bark, as in Melilot. In others they stand not so much in pricks, as portions or Columns, as in Cumfry. In others again they all stand in in more continued lines, either Rays or dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral, as in Borage; or Peripherial, as in Celandine. The Rays are not equally extended in all Roots: in Parsnep towards the circumference of the bark; in Bugloss about half way. In Borage, the rays are more continuous; in a Carrot, more prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Here also the pricks stand in even lines; in Lovage they are divaricated. Of which, and those of some other Roots, it is also observable, that they are not all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly pricks, but most of them very little circles, which, after the Milk hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently licked off, and ceaseth to ascend,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105413:50"/>
are visible. See the Figures. And note, that in observing all Milk-vessels, the Milk is to be taken off, not with the finger but the tongue, so often till it riseth no more, or but little. And some Roots may also be soaked in Water, whereby the position of the Milk-vessels will be visible by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er colour of the bark where they stand.</p>
               <p>The Rays sometimes run more parallel, and keep several, as in Monkshood; and sometimes towards the circumference of the bark they are occurrent, as in Eryngo: here in a termination more circular, and in Bryony angular, or in the form of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as also in Horsradish through a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope. The peripherial lines are in some more entire Circles, as in Dandelyon; in others made up of shorter Chords, as in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato, Cumfry, and the smaller part of the Root of Monkshood. In some the pricks are so exceeding small, and stand so close, that, to the bare eye, they seem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Rings, which yet through the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scope appear distinct, as in Marsh-mallow and Liquorish. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Columns and Chords are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as in Burnet; Pricks and Chords, in Potato; Rays and Rings, in Monkshood; where the Ring is single. In Fenil there is a double or treple order both of Rays and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105413:51"/>
Rings, the Lymphaeducts standing in Rays and the Lacteals in Rings. And in Marsh-mallow the Vessels are so posited as to make both those kinds of lines. In Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine they seem all, to the bare eye, to stand in numerous Rings lying even one within another. See the Figures. As also in Dandelyon; in which yet, being viewed through a Microscope, there is an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of very many small Rays, which strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the inner Verge of the Bark, cross three or four of the smaller Rings, and there terminate. See the Microscopical Figure. Whence it should seem, that Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Rays and milky Rings are so far mixed together; only the Lympha being confounded with the Milk cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And where the milky Vessels are evacuated, or at such seasons wherein they are less full, divers milky Roots will yield a clear Liquor at the inner Verge of the Bark, where, at other times, they seem to yield only Milk. And this is the Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Bark.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:105413:51"/>
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>THat Portion of the Root which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth next within the Bark, is also compounded of two bodies, Parenchymous and Lignous. The Parenchymous is of the same substantial Nature with that of the Bark: and is originated from it; being not only adjacent to it, but all round about continuous therewith, even as that is with the skin; the Parenchyma of the Bark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distributed, from time to time, partly outward into the skin, and partly inward into this.</p>
               <p>The position of the several parts hereof is different. For the most part they have a diametral continuation in several Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, running betwixt as many more of the Lignous parts from the circumference to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Centre of the Root. In the Roots of some Plants they are more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, as in Cumfry; which leadeth to the notice of them in all others both of Plants and Trees. See the Figure. Sometimes part of this parenchymous Body is disposed into Rings, as in Fenil. The number and size of which Rings differ; in Fenil they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105413:52"/>
are in some places broader, but fewer; in Beet they are narrower, but more. See the Figure. The diametral portions are in like manner much varied; in Cumfry, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine larger; in Beet, Bugloss, meaner; in Borage, Parsnep more and lesser; and in most woody Roots, streaming betwixt the pith and the bark as so many small Rays. Their continuation is also different; in some Roots to the Centre, as in Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine; in others not, as in Parsnep. See the Figures. And sometimes different in the same Root, as in the Vine. See the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopical Figure.</p>
               <p>The Contexture of these parenchymous Portions is sometimes uniform, as in Bugloss, Peony; and sometimes also, as it is in the bark, different; in part more sappy and transparent, in part more white, dry, and airy, as in Carrot, Lovage, Scorzonera, and others; which yet cannot be observed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wary view. See the Figures. But their general texture is the same being all made up of many small bubles: which are of different sizes, like those of the bark; but for the most part smaller. Their shape likewise is usually round; but sometimes oblong and oval, as in Borage; or oblong and square, as in the Vine.</p>
               <p>The Lignous part, if not always, yet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105413:52"/>
usually, is also compounded of two kinds of bodies, <hi>scil.</hi> Succiferous and Air-vessels. The Succiferous are, as far as discernable, of the same conformation and nature with those of the bark, and in the transverse cut of the Root, do oftentimes, as those, emit a Liquor. They are also Braced; and many of them run in distinct Threds or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions collaterally together. The Air-ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels I so call, because they contain no Li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quor, but an airy Vapour. They are mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are frequently conjugated divers of them together; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fewer, and for the most part single, as in Asparagus; sometimes many, as in Hors-Radish. See the Microscopical Figures. And their Conjugations are also braced as the threds of the Succiferous Vessels. But they are no where Inosculated: nor twisted one about another; but only tangent or collateral. Neither are they Ramified, the greater into less; but are all distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from one end of the Root to the other.</p>
               <p>Their Braces, as those of the Succiferous
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105413:53"/>
Vessels, are also of various number; in Cumfry, Scorzonera more rare; in Borage more frequent; as by stripping off the bark of such Roots where it is easily separable, may be seen. See the Figure of Scorzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera. And they often vary in the same Root; so in Borage, Scorzonera, &amp;c. they are more frequent in the Centre and next the bark than in the intermediate space, as by splitting those Roots down the middle doth appear. See the Figures. They also vary from those of the succiferous Vessels; those being usually more frequent, as in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem Artichoke, than these of the Aerial. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>Betwixt these braced Air-vessels run the parenchymous parts above described, as they do betwixt the succiferous in the bark. See the Figures. An agreeable structure hereto may be observed in the parts of a Muscle; wherein some, more membranous and white, are posited and knit together in the form of Lozenges or close Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work: others, more red, or soft, fill up all the interjacent spaces, and have a counter-process or continuation; the one by the bredth or thickness of the Muscle, the other by the length. The same structure is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise visible in Tendons, but more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:105413:53"/>The position of both these kinds of Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels is various. The Succiferous are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times posited in diametral lines or portions, as in the Vine: Sometimes oppositely to the Aerial, as in Beet; each Ring herein being double, and made both of Sap and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r-vessels. In Nettle the Succiferous run cross the Aerial in several, five, six, seven, or more Rings. In Bryony the several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tions of the Aerial are surrounded with the Succiferous. In Patience the Succife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous are disposed, besides Rays, into many small Rings of different sizes sprinkled up and down, and not having one common Centre: within divers whereof Aerial are included: especially within those which are drawn not into Rings, but as it were strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Hedges. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>That also of the Air-vessels is various and elegant. In <hi>Ammi, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In others they make not Rings, but longer Rays, extended either towards the Centre, as in Scorzonera; or meeting in it, as in Columbine. In Beet they stand in several Rings, and every Ring made of Rays. In Cumfry the Rays and Rings are separate, those stand without, these next the Centre.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105413:54"/>
In Celandine they are of a parallel, in Monkshood of a wedged form. In Borage the position of many of them is spiral In Horse Radish, they stand more confused nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Rings nor in Rays; yet their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conjugations are radiated: with very many other differences. See the Figures.</p>

                  </gap>ze. Their Number may, in some Roots, and in some measure, be judged of by the bare eye, having frequently a whiter sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face than the other parts. As also their Size; the bore of these Vessels being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than that of the Succiferous in all Roots; especially some. For if you take the Roots of Vine, Fenil, Dandelyon, Plum-tree, Elder, Willow, &amp;c. and lay them by for some time to dry; and then having cut off a very thin slice of each transversly, if you hold up those slices before your eye, so as the sight may be trajected through the said Vessels, they hereby become visible, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably different both in number and size.</p>
               <p>But undeceitful and accurate observation of both their Number and Size must be made by the Microscope; and so they will appear to be much more various. In Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stort, Skirret, they are very few; in Beet
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105413:54"/>
very many: betwixt which extremes there are all degrees; as in Orpine, Monkshood, Scorzonera, great Celandine, Peony, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Fenil, &amp;c. m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y be seen. So their Size in some is extreme small, as in Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, Bistort, Valerian; in others very great, as in Asparagus, Bugloss, Vine. They are also of several sizes in the same Root; but in some are less varied, as in <hi>Lilium non bulbosum,</hi> Asparagus, Bugloss; in others more, as in Bryony, Lovage. Amongst all Roots they vary by about twenty degrees; as by comparing the Roots of Vine, Thorn, Apple, Bryony, Lovage, Fenil, wild Carrot, Saxifrage, Parsley, Peony, Horehound, Cinquefoyl, Strawberry, &amp;c. together, may be seen. See the Figures of so many of them as are drawn.</p>
               <p>In some Roots they are small and few; as in Jerusalem Artichoke; in others small, but many, as in Horse-Radish: in Bugloss they are great, but few; in Vine great and many. So that the proportion which those of a Vine, their number and size being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together, bear to those of Jerusalem Artichoke, may be at least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s fifty to one. See the Microscopical Figures. Of the smallest kinds, as those of Cinquefoyl, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem Artichoke, and the like, it is to be noted, that they are scarce ever visible in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105413:55"/>
fresh slices of these Roots, but after they have layn by a while, at last by a good Glass, clear light, and steddy view, are discernable.</p>
               <p>In some Roots the greater of these Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels stand in or next the Centre, as in Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxicum; in others next the circumference, as in Horse Radish. Somtimes each of them is from one end of the Root to the other, of a more equal size, or more Cylindrical, as in Marsh-mallow; but usually they wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den more or less from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Root, as in Thorn-Apple; about the top whereof they are for the most part but of the sixth, seventh, and eighth mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, some of the fifth, but none of the third; but about the bottom they are most of the third and fifth: whence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that some of them are, in the manner of Veins, somewhat pyramidal: yet their ampliation proceedeth not towards, but from their Original, as in N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the Spiral Zone, which he so calls, is not one absolutely entire piece; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of two or more round and perfect Fibres standing collaterally together: and according as fewer or more of these Fibres happen to break off, from their spiral loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together, the Zone is narrower or broader; usually narrower in the Trunk, and broader in the Root.</p>
               <p>Of these Fibres it is also observable, that they are not Inosculated side to side, but are knit or stitched together by other small<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Spiration of the Fibres of these Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels may be more easily observed in the Trunk than in the Root; and better in younger Plants; and not so well by cutting as splitting, or tearing off some small piece through which they run, their conformation being by this means not spoiled, Yet this

The process of their spiration is not, so far as I have observed, accidental, but constantly the same; <hi>scil.</hi> in the Root by South from West to East; but in the Trunk contrarily, by South from East to West.</p>
               <p>The Content of these Vessels is, as hath already been intimated, more airy. The proof whereof is, that upon a transverse cut of the Root, the Sap never ascendeth there where these stand. Being also viewed through a Microscope, they are never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be filled with liquor. Besides, a Root cut and immersed in water, till it is in some part got into these Vessels, and then taken out and crushed; the other parts wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which bubles rise from some small quantity of Liquor mixed with the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contained in the said Vessels. To which other arguments will arise out of those things that follow. As also for this Content its not being a pure, but vaporous Air. Whether these Vessels may not, in some Vegetables, and at some times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liquor, is doubtful. Thus far of the Lignous Part.</p>

               <p>WIthin the Lignous Part lyeth the Pith. This part is not common to all Roots, for some have none, as Nicotian, Stramonium, and others. Yet many which have none or little throughout all their lower parts, have one fair enough about their tops, as Mallow, Borage, Dandelyon, and the like. See the Roots. And in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others there are Parenchymous parts, of the same substantial nature with the Pith, visible from the top to the bottom, as in Beet, Fenil, &amp;c. See the Roots and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. The size of the Pith is varied by many degrees easily reckoned an hundred; in Fenil, Dandelyon, Asparagus but small;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105413:57"/>
in Horsradish, Valerian, Bistort great. See the Figures. The shape hereof in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of most Roots is pyramidal; but at the tops various, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent distribution of the Vessels, as in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot, Hyperbolical, in Parsley Oval; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in cutting the Roots length-ways. See the Figures.</p>
               <p>The Pith, for the most part, especially in Trees, is a simple body: but sometimes it is, as the Bark, compounded, some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Succiferous Vessels being mixed herewith; as in Jerusalem Artichoke, Horsradish, &amp;c. upon a traverse cut, by a strict view, may be discerned. See the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. Their position is sometimes confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as in Carrot; and sometimes regular, as in Parsley, appearing by the traverse cut in Rings, and in cutting by the length in Arches. See the Figure.</p>
               <p>As all the other parts of the Root are originated from the Seed; so sometimes is the Pith it self. But sometimes it hath its more immediate derivation from the Bark. Hence it is, that many Roots which have no Pith in their lower parts, have one at their top, as Columbine, Lovage, &amp;c. See the Roots. For the parenchymous parts of the Bark being by degrees distributed into dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral Portions, running betwixt those of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105413:57"/>
Lignous body, and at length meeting and uniting in the Centre, thus constitute the Pith. In the same manner, at the top of some Roots, the Pith is either made or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented out of the Parenchymous Rings above described, these being gradually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to and embodied in the Centre; as in Fenil and some other Roots, their lower and upper parts compared together, may be seen.</p>
               <p>From hence the Pith appears to be also of the same substantial nature with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchyma of the Bark, and with the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral Portions, and that they are all one body differing only in shape and place. As also from its being continuous with the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral Portions, in like manner as these are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus far the contexture of the Pith is well discoverable in the Root. In the Trunk farther and more easily. Yet since I am giving the Description hereof, I shall therefore further illustrate it by Examples from thence: And to what hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, I further add, That the sides by which the aforesaid Bubles of the Pith are circumscribed, are not meer paper skins,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105413:58"/>
but so many several ranks or piles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding small Fibrous Threds, lying for the most part evenly one over another from the bottom to the top of every Buble, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cross, as the Threds in the Weavers Warp, from one Buble to another; which is to say, That the Pith is nothing else but a <hi>Rete mirabile,</hi> or an infinite number of small Fibres admirably complicated together; as by cutting the Pith with a Razor may be seen.</p>
               <p>All Vegetables exhibit this spectable not alike distinctly, those best with the largest Bubles. Nor the same Pith in any condition, but best when dry; because then, the Sap being voided, the spaces betwixt the fibrous Threds, and so the Threds themselves are more distinctly discernable. Yet is it not to be dryed after cutting; because its several parts will thereupon coincide and become deformed; but to be chosen while the plant is yet growing, when it may be often found dry, yet undeformed, as in the Trunks of common Thistle, Jerusalem Artichoke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These Threds, so far as I can observe, are not single Fibres, but usually consist of several. Nor are they simply collateral, but by the weftage of other single ones, in their natural estate, knit together; much
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105413:59"/>
after the same manner as the Spiral Fibres of the Air-vessels. This connexion I have no where so well seen, as in the white bottoms of the Bubles of a Bulrush, being cut tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; wherein they have the appearance of very fine and close Needle work.</p>
               <p>The single fibres are seldom and scarcely visible, except by obliquely tearing the Pith; by which means they will appear, through the Glass, broken off sometimes a quarter or h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scernable in cutting by the length. These Fibres and the Threds composed of them, being for the most part so pellucid, and closely situate, they frequently seem to make one entire body, as a piece of Ice or a film of Water it self: or even as Animal Skins sometimes shew, which yet are known and commonly allowed to be Fibrous.</p>
               <p>The situation of these Threds, is contrary to that of the Vessels, as those by the length, so these chiefly by the bredth of the Root, or horizontally from one edge of the Pith to the other. They are continued circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; whereby as oft as they keep within the compass of the several Bubles, the said Bubles are round; but where they winde out of one Buble into another, they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105413:59"/>
intersect a Chord of their several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by which means the Bubles become angular.</p>
               <p>The Contexture likewise both of the Parenchymous part of the Bark, and of the diametral Portions inserted betwixt the Lignous, is the same with this of the Pith now described, that is Fibrous. Whence we understand, How the several Braces and Threds of the Vessels are made: For the Vessels running by the length of the Root, as the Warp, by the Parenchymous Fibres running cross or horizontally, as the Woof, are thus knit and as it were stitched up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Yet their weftage seemeth not to be simple, as in Cloath; but that many of the fibrous Threds are wraped round about each Vessel, and in the same manner are continued from one to another; thereby knitting them altogether more closely into one tubulary Thred; and those Threds again into one Brace: much after the manner of the Needle-work called Back Stitch, or that used in quilting of Balls. Some obscure sight hereof may be taken in the threds of Cambrick in the use of a Microscope; but it is most visible in the Leaves and Flowers of some Plants. The Delineation of these things I shall therefore omit, till we come hereafter to speak of those parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:105413:60"/>From what hath been said, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured; That the Air-vessels successively appearing in the Bark, are formed, not out of any fluid matter, as are the original ones, but of the Parenchymous Fibres; <hi>sc.</hi> by changing them from a spherical to a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulary, and from a circular to a spiral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
               <p>From the precedents it is also manifest, That all the Parenchymous parts of a Root are Fibrous. Whence it is probable, That all the parenchymous parts of Animals are likewise fibrous, even of the Glandules and of all the Viscera: which yet through the fineness of the work, and less consistency of the parts, may here be more difficult to observe.</p>
               <p>And lastly, That the whole body of a Root consisteth of Vessels and Fibres. And that these fibres themselves are tubulary or so many more Vessels, is most probable: There only wanteth a greater perfection of Microscopical Glasses to determine. Whence it is also probable, That all the parts of an Animal, even Bones themselves, upon the original formation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of Vessels; or at least of Vessels and Fibres. For which conjecture I have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds which I shall not now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:105413:60"/>The Contents of the Pith are, sometimes Liquor, and sometimes a vaporous Air. The Liquor is always limpid, as that of the Parenchymous part of the Bark; and in nature not much differing from it. The Air is sometimes less, and sometimes more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous than that of the Bark. By this Air I mean that which is contained in the Bubles. Within the Concaves of the Fibres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there is another different one: So that as in the Bubles is contained a more aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in the Vessels a more essential Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; so sometimes in the Bubles is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a more vaporous, and in the Fibres a more simple and essential Air.</p>

            <p>By the same means we have a greater assurance of the excellency of his <hi>Sacred Word</hi>; that he who hath <hi>done</hi> all things so transcendently well, must needs <hi>speak</hi> as

himself. It is not therefore the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Nature, but the <hi>wanton phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> of mens minds that dispose them either to forget <hi>God,</hi> or to think unduly of him.</p>
            <p>Nor have we reason to fear going <hi>too far</hi> in the Study of Nature, more than the <hi>entring</hi> into it; because the higher we rise in the true knowledge and due contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>This,</hi> the nearer we come to the <hi>Divine Author</hi> hereof. Or to think, that there is any contradiction, when <hi>Philosophy</hi> teaches that to be done by <hi>Nature,</hi> which <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> teach us to be done by <hi>God:</hi> no more than to say, that the <hi>Ballance</hi> of a <hi>Watch</hi> is moved by the next <hi>Wheel,</hi> is to deny that <hi>Wheel</hi> and the rest to be moved by the <hi>Spring,</hi> or that both the <hi>Spring</hi> and all the other parts are caused to move together by the <hi>Maker</hi> of them. So <hi>God</hi> may be truly the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>This</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, although a thousand other <hi>Causes</hi> should be supposed to intervene; for all <hi>Nature</hi> is as one great <hi>Engine</hi> made by and held in his hand. And as it is the Watch makers <hi>Art,</hi> that the <hi>Hand</hi> moves regularly from hour to hour, although he put not his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger still to it: so is it the demonstration of <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> that the Parts of <hi>Nature</hi> are so harmoniously contrived and set together as to conspire to all kind of natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

and effects without the extraordinary-immediate influence of the <hi>Author</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore as the <hi>Original Being</hi> of all things is the most proper demonstration of <hi>Gods Power,</hi> so are the <hi>successive Generations</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of Things the most proper demonstration of his <hi>Wisdom.</hi> For if we should suppose <hi>God</hi> did now make or do any thing by any thing, then no <hi>Effect</hi> would be produced by a <hi>natural Cause</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently He would still be upon the Work of <hi>Creation,</hi> which yet <hi>Sacred Scripture</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureth us he <hi>resteth from</hi>; and we might expect the formation of a Child in an <hi>Egg,</hi> as well as in a <hi>Womb,</hi> or of a Chicken out of a <hi>Stone</hi> as an <hi>Egg</hi>; For <hi>Infinite Power</hi> maketh no difference in the things it useth.

            <p>Let us say then, that the Root of a Plant being lodged in some Soil for its more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient growth; 'tis necessary the Soil should be duly prepared thereunto. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And the warm <hi>Sun</hi> joyned with the mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying <hi>Rain,</hi> by both, as it were a <hi>Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Soil, or a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These <hi>Principles</hi> being with the growth of Plants continually exhausted, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a repair; the successions therefore of wet, wind, and other weather, beat down and rot the Leaves and other parts of Plants: whereby (as Weeds which are wont to be buried under ground) they become a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Manure,</hi> and re-impregnate the Soil; being thus, in part, out of their own resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Principles,</hi> annually compounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Many of these <hi>Principles</hi> upon their <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> being by the <hi>Sun</hi> more attenuated and volatilized, continually ascend into the

               <hi>Air,</hi> and are mixed therewith. Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they lose not their vegetable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet being amongst other purer <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> these also, depositing their earthy fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culencies, become more subtile, simple and essential bodies.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Air</hi> being of an <hi>Elastick</hi> or <hi>Springie</hi> Nature, pressing more or less upon all bodies; it thereby forceth and insinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self into the Soil through all its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable pores. Upon its own entrance, it carries also many of the said <hi>Vegetable</hi> and <hi>essential Principles</hi> along with it, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the rest are spread all over the body of the Soil. By which means, though a less vehement, yet more subtile <hi>Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and with the least advantage of warmth continuable, will be effected.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Principles</hi> being thus farther <hi>resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> and subtilized, would presently exhale away, if the <hi>Rain</hi> again did not prevent: which therefore falling upon and soaking through the Soil, is as a fresh <hi>Menstruum</hi> saturate or impregnate with many of them, and as it still sinketh lower, carries them along with it from the superficial to the deeper parts of the Soil; thus not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing those parts also, which otherwise would be more lean and cold; but therein likewise laying up and securing a store
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105413:65"/>
more gradually and thriftily to be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the upper parts again as they need.</p>
            <p>And Autumn having laid up the store, Winter following thereupon, doth as it were lock the doors upon it. In which time some warmer intervals serve further and gradually to mature the stored <hi>Principles,</hi> without hazard of their being exhaled. And the Spring returning, sets the doors open again, with warmer and more constant <hi>Sun,</hi> gentle and frequent <hi>Rain</hi> fully resolves the said <hi>Principles,</hi> and so furnisheth a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful diet for all kind of <hi>Vegetables</hi>; being a Composition of <hi>Water</hi> chiefly, wherein are resolved some portion of <hi>Earth, Salt, Acid, Oyl, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Air</hi>; or other bodies of affinity herewith.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Root</hi> standing in the Soil thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and being always surrounded with a <hi>Bark,</hi> which consisteth chiefly of a <hi>paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous</hi> and spongy body; it will thus, as Sponges do, naturally suck up the watry parts of the Soil impregnate with the said <hi>Principles.</hi> Which <hi>Principles</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being in proportion with the watry parts but sew, and also more <hi>essential,</hi> and though <hi>mixed</hi> yet as yet little <hi>united</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this <hi>parenchymous</hi> part, are they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much discovered either by colour,

            <p>The entrance of this impregnate Water or <hi>Sap</hi> is not without difference, but by the regulation of the intervening <hi>Skin</hi>; being thereby <hi>strained</hi> and rendred more pure: the <hi>Skin,</hi> according to the thickness or closeness thereof, becoming sometimes only as a <hi>brown paper,</hi> sometimes as a <hi>Cotton,</hi> and sometimes as a <hi>Bag</hi> of <hi>Leather</hi> to the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Sap,</hi> as the nature of it doth require.

a due supply of aliment would be star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but the <hi>Vessels</hi> both of <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Sap</hi> being every where divided into <hi>braced</hi> portions, and other <hi>parenchymous,</hi> filling up the spaces betwixt them, intermixed; there is therefore a free and copious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Sap,</hi> and of all the <hi>Tinctures</hi> successively transfused into it, from part to part, and to every portion of every one of them; the <hi>parenchymous</hi> portions run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betwixt the <hi>Braces,</hi> as the smaller <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> do amongst the other parts in <hi>Animals</hi>; whereby none of them want that due mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is necessary either for their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or the good estate of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>For the due distribution of the several parts of the <hi>Sap, Diametral</hi> portions of the <hi>parenchymous</hi> Body run sometimes directly through the <hi>Bark,</hi> as in <hi>Lovage, Parsley,</hi> &amp;c. and so are all or most of them continuous betwixt both the <hi>succiferous</hi> and <hi>Air-vessels</hi> from the circumference to the centre; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by carrying off a more copious and <hi>aerial Ferment</hi> from the one, and communicating it unto the other.

betwixt the <hi>portions</hi> of the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> is all along communicated to them. Yet is it not a pure and <hi>simple Air,</hi> but such as carries a <hi>Tincture</hi> with it from the <hi>succiferous Vessels:</hi> and therefore when the <hi>diametral</hi> portions are more distant, the <hi>Vessels</hi> run not in a straight line betwixt them, but are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally inclined so, as to touch upon them, as in <hi>Lovage</hi> is visible; thereby communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their <hi>Tincture</hi> to the <hi>Air</hi> as it passeth by them through the said <hi>diametral</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>By the continual appulse of fresh <hi>Sap,</hi> some both of the <hi>airy</hi> and all the other parts thereof, are transmitted into the <hi>Pith</hi>; where finding more room, it will yet more kindly be <hi>digested.</hi> Especially having the advantage herein of some degree of warmth, being remoter from the Soil, and as it were <hi>tunn'd</hi> up within the <hi>Wood,</hi> or the <hi>Mass</hi> of surrounding <hi>Vessels.</hi> So that the <hi>Pith</hi> is as it were a <hi>Repository</hi> of better <hi>Aliment</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually supplied to those <hi>succiferous Vessels</hi> which are frequently scattered up and down therein, and which ascend into the <hi>Trunk.</hi> But where no <hi>succiferous Vessels</hi> are mixed herewith, it usually becomes dryer, and is replenished with a more <hi>aerial</hi> and warmer <hi>Sap</hi>; whereby the growth of the <hi>Caulis</hi> is promoted as by an <hi>hot Bed</hi> set just under it.

            <p>In this <hi>Nourishment</hi> the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Sap</hi> are, as is said, <hi>concentred,</hi> and <hi>locked</hi> up one within another: whence it is that the <hi>Organical</hi> parts, being cleansed of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> have none of them any <hi>taste</hi> or <hi>smell,</hi> as in the <hi>Piths</hi> of Plants, <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Linen Cloth</hi> is evident; because till by <hi>digestion,</hi> violent <hi>distillation</hi> or some other way they are <hi>resolved,</hi> they cannot act upon the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> of those senses.

            </p>
            <p>And as from the <hi>Concentration</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> in every <hi>Organical</hi> part they all agree thus far; so from the <hi>Predominion</hi> of those of each part the rest are controuled, not only to a <hi>Concentration,</hi> but an <hi>Assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> also, and their respective properties are thus preserved. Hence the <hi>succiferous

Vessels</hi> are always <hi>tough</hi> and most pliable; for so are all <hi>Barks</hi> wherein these <hi>Vessels</hi> abound: so are the <hi>Twires</hi> of Flax, which are nothing else but the <hi>succiferous Vessels</hi> of that Plant. For <hi>Sal Alkali, Oyl, Water,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are, as is said, the predominant <hi>Principles</hi> of these <hi>Vessels.</hi> Now it is the <hi>Oyl</hi> chiefly by which Bodies are <hi>tough</hi>: for being of it self viscous and tenacious, by taking hold of other <hi>Principles,</hi> marries them together; and the <hi>Sal Alkali</hi> and <hi>Earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred</hi> with it, addeth to it more strength.

so are their <hi>Figures.</hi> And first the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> from their <hi>Sal Alkali</hi> grow in length; for by that dimension chiefly this <hi>Salt</hi> always <hi>shoots</hi>; and being a less moveable <hi>Principle</hi> than the rest, and so apt more speedily to <hi>fix</hi> or shoot; thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules them to its own <hi>Figure.</hi> And even as the shape of a <hi>Button</hi> dependeth on the <hi>Mould,</hi> the Silk and other Materials wrought upon it, being always conformable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: so here; the <hi>Salt</hi> is as it were the <hi>Mould,</hi> about which the other more passive <hi>Principles</hi> gathering themselves, they all consort and fashion to it.

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:105413:71"/>By mediation of their <hi>Principles</hi> the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous</hi> parts likewise of a <hi>Root</hi> have their proper <hi>Contexture.</hi> For from their <hi>acid Salt</hi> they are <hi>fibrous</hi>; from their <hi>Oyl</hi> the <hi>Fibres</hi> are <hi>round</hi> and in all parts even within themselves; and from their <hi>Spirit</hi> it is most probable that they are also <hi>hollow.</hi> But because the <hi>Spirit</hi> is here more copious than the <hi>Air</hi>; and the <hi>saline Principle</hi> a <hi>Saldacidum,</hi> and more under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spirit</hi> than an <hi>Alkali</hi>; therefore are not the said <hi>Fibres</hi> continued in <hi>straight</hi> lines, as the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi>; or by one <hi>uniform</hi> motion into <hi>spiral</hi> lines, as the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> in the <hi>Aerial</hi>; but <hi>winding</hi> in a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner to and fro a <hi>thousand ways,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the like <hi>motions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that most <hi>active,</hi> and here most <hi>predominant, Principle.</hi> And the <hi>spirituous</hi> parts being, as is said, here more copious and redundant, they will not only suffice to fill up the Concaves of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> but will gather together into innumerable little spaces up and down without them: whence the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> cannot winde and wreath close toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but are forced to keep at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance one parcel from another, and so are disposed, as Bread is in baking, into <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the under <hi>Fibres</hi> being <hi>set</hi> first as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105413:72"/>
the <hi>Warp,</hi> the <hi>spirituous</hi> parts next adjacent will incline also to <hi>fix,</hi> and so govern an over-work of <hi>Fibres</hi> wrapping as the <hi>Woof</hi> in still smaller Circles round the other, whereby they are all knit together. For the same reason the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> being first formed, the <hi>Parenchymous Fibres set</hi> and wrap about these also. And the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> being formed in the Centre, the <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferous</hi> run along those likewise; as <hi>vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salts shoot</hi> along the sides of a Glass, or <hi>frost</hi> upon a Window; and so are as it were incrustate about them in a Ring.</p>
            <p>All the more aetherial and subtile parts of the <hi>Air,</hi> as they stream through the <hi>Root,</hi> it should seem do gradually dispose the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> where there are more of them, into <hi>Rays.</hi> Therefore in the inferiour parts of the <hi>Root</hi> they are less regular, because more remote from the <hi>Air.</hi> And in the upper parts of many <hi>Roots,</hi> as <hi>Cumfry, Borage, Parsnep,</hi> where those that are next the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre are confused, or differently disposed; those next the <hi>Bark</hi> and so nearer the <hi>Air,</hi> are postured more regularly and always into <hi>Rays.</hi> For the same reason it may be; that the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> in the <hi>Bark</hi> where the <hi>Air vessels</hi> are more numerous, are usually disposed into <hi>Rays</hi>; and that the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi> is disposed into
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105413:72"/>
               <hi>Diametral Portions</hi>; and that where the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are fewer or smaller, these <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are likewise smaller or none, as in <hi>Chervil, Asparagus, Taraxium, Orpine, Bistort, Horse-Radish, Potato's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The said aetherial parts of the <hi>Air</hi> have a power over the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> not only thus to dispose them; but also to sollicite and spread them abroad from the Centre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Circumference of the <hi>Root</hi>; which power, in speaking according to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sense, I take leave to call Attraction. This Attraction or <hi>Magnetick power</hi> betwixt the <hi>Air</hi> and these <hi>Vessels</hi> may be argued, from the Nature of the <hi>Principles</hi> common to them both. From the <hi>Electral</hi> Nature of divers other Bodies, the <hi>Load stone</hi> being not the only one which is attractive. And from the spreading of these <hi>Vessels</hi> always more or less at the upper part of the <hi>Root</hi> where nearer to the <hi>Air</hi>: which is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the spreading of the whole <hi>Root,</hi> but a particular motion of these <hi>Vessels</hi> visibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching farther upon the <hi>Bark.</hi> And from other Effects hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>The spreading of these <hi>Vessels</hi> is varied, not only according to the <hi>force</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath upon them, but their own <hi>aptitude</hi> to yield thereto. As oft therefore as they are slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, they will also be more pliable and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105413:73"/>
recessive from the Centre towards the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference: hence in such <hi>Roots</hi> where they are small they stand more distant, as in <hi>Turnep, Jerusalem Artichoke, Potato's,</hi> and others; and so their <hi>Braces</hi> are fewer; and in the same <hi>Root,</hi> where they are smaller, their distance is greater. Besides, in these smaller <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> the <hi>Rings</hi> being less, and the <hi>spiral Fibres</hi> whereof they are made continuing to <hi>shoot</hi>; the said <hi>Rings</hi> therefore must needs be so many more, as they are smaller, and so take up more space by the length of the <hi>Root</hi>; and so not being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being crowded in a right line, every <hi>Vessel</hi> will be forced to recede to a crooked or bowed one.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> being by the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous Fibres</hi> knit to <hi>These,</hi> will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise comply with their motion and spread abroad with them. Yet being still smaller and more pliable than the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> and so more yielding to the intercurrent <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> their <hi>braced Threds</hi> will sometimes be much more divaricated, than these <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> as in <hi>Jerusalem Artichoke.</hi> And because the <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> although they are joyned to the <hi>Aerial</hi> by the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renchymous Fibres,</hi> yet are not continuous with them; neither fall under the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive power of the <hi>Air</hi> as the <hi>Aerial</hi> do;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105413:73"/>
the <hi>Aerial</hi> therefore upon their spreading, do not always carry all the <hi>Succiferous</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, but often, if not always, leave many of them behind them sprinkled up and down the <hi>Pith</hi>; as in <hi>Parsley, Carrot, Jerusalem Artichoke, Turnep,</hi> &amp;c. may be seen.</p>
            <p>The spreading of the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> still con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinued, several of them at length break forth beyond the circumference of the <hi>Root,</hi> and so are distributed, either in the lower parts into <hi>Branches</hi> and <hi>Strings,</hi> or at the top into <hi>Leaves.</hi> And least they should all spread themselves into <hi>Leaves,</hi> and none be left for the <hi>Caulis</hi>; as where they are very small, or the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> to bound them are but few, they might; therefore divers of them are oftentimes more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>braced</hi> in the Centre; for which reason they cannot so easily separate and spread themselves from thence, but run more inwardly up into the <hi>Caulis,</hi> as in <hi>Borage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the various <hi>Sizes, Proportions,</hi> and <hi>Dispositions</hi> of the Parts, <hi>Roots</hi> are variously <hi>sized, shaped, moved,</hi> and <hi>aged.</hi> Those that by annual growth are large, have fewer both <hi>Aerial</hi> and <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> and a more copious <hi>Parenchyma.</hi> So that the <hi>Aerial Vessels,</hi> or rather the <hi>Airy Ferment</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:105413:74"/>
contained in them, <hi>volatilizing</hi> a smaller portion of the <hi>Sap</hi>; this therefore being less capable of advancement into the <hi>Trunk,</hi> must needs remain and <hi>fix</hi> more copiously in the <hi>Root,</hi> which is thereby more aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. So where the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> are few, the <hi>Root</hi> is yet proportionably large; and where they are numerous, it is never so, as to its annual growth, in any proportion to their number; because their <hi>Tincture</hi> will go farther in <hi>setting</hi> the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymous</hi> parts, than the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>these</hi> will in <hi>setting them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> are more pliable and sequent to the attraction of the <hi>Air,</hi> and so spread themselves, and the <hi>Succife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> together with them more abroad; in the manner as hath been said; the <hi>Root</hi> also will grow more in bredth; the nutrition of the <hi>Parenchymous</hi> parts, to which the <hi>Vessels</hi> are adjacent, being thus by the same dimension more augmented; as in <hi>Turnep, Jerusalem Artichoke,</hi> &amp;c. But where these are not spread abroad, the <hi>Root</hi> is but slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as in <hi>Asparagus, Dandelyon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vessels</hi> as they thus spread and move towards the circumference, because the <hi>Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> are no where <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osculated</hi> or continuous with them, but only <hi>wrapped</hi> about them, and their motion so
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105413:74"/>
exquisitely slow; therefore they make not their passage through the said <hi>Parenchymae</hi> by tearing of it, or causing any <hi>rupture</hi>; but only by <hi>slipping</hi> themselves along its <hi>Fibres,</hi> as it were from <hi>Buble</hi> to <hi>Buble,</hi> (as we are wont the <hi>Rings</hi> of a <hi>Tarring Iron)</hi> and so as they move forward themselves, leave the said <hi>Fibres</hi> behind them all knit together in the Centre, thus either <hi>making</hi> or <hi>aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting</hi> the <hi>Pith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> be contracted, and somewhat large or numerous, and the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferous</hi> also more copious round about them; the <hi>Root</hi> grows very long, as those of <hi>Fenil, Vine, Liquorish,</hi> &amp;c. For the <hi>Air-Vessels</hi> containing a more copious <hi>Ferment,</hi> it will well digest and mature the <hi>Sap</hi>; yet the <hi>Succiferous</hi> being over proportioned to them, it will not therefore be so far vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized as to ascend chiefly into the <hi>Trunk,</hi> but only to subserve a fuller growth of these <hi>Vessels</hi>: and these being more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and so more sturdy, and less sequent to the expansive motion of the <hi>Aerial</hi>; this their own growth, and consequently that of all the other parts, cannot be so much in bredth as length.</p>
            <p>Where the same <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> are fewer, or more contracted, or sheathed in a thicker and closer <hi>Bark</hi>; the <hi>Root</hi> is smooth, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105413:75"/>
less Ramified; as in <hi>Asparagus, Peony, Tara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xicum.</hi> But where more numerous, sheathed in a thinner <hi>Bark,</hi> smaller, more dilated; the <hi>Root</hi> is more Ramified, or more Strin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, as in <hi>Columbine, Clary, Beet, Nicotian.</hi> For being, as is said, by these means, more sequent to the Attraction of the <hi>Air,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching still nearer the circumference of the <hi>Bark,</hi> they at last strike through it into the <hi>Moulds.</hi> And the <hi>parenchymous Fibres</hi> being wrapped about them, and the <hi>Succi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Vessels</hi> knit to them by those <hi>Fibres</hi>; therefore they never break forth naked, but always invested with some quantity of these parts as their <hi>Bark</hi>: where by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever essential part is in the <hi>main Body</hi> of the <hi>Root,</hi> is also in every <hi>Branch</hi> or <hi>String.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the same expansion and pliability of the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> oftentimes put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth <hi>Root-buds</hi>; in the formation of which <hi>Buds</hi> they are pliable and recessive all kinds of ways; being not only invited outward toward the circumference of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Root-strings</hi>; but spread more abroad every way in the <hi>Bud</hi>; whereas in the said <hi>Root-strings</hi> they are always more contracted; which, in respect of the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>Parts,</hi> is the principal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Root</hi> and the <hi>Trunk.</hi> Hence those <hi>Roots</hi> chiefly have <hi>Root Buds,</hi> which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105413:75"/>
have the smallest <hi>Air-vessels</hi>; these, as is said, being most pliable and expansive.</p>
            <p>But because the expansiveness of the <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> dependeth also in part upon the fewness of their <hi>Braces</hi>; therefore the <hi>Buds</hi> shoot forth differently in divers <hi>Roots.</hi> Where fewer, they shoot forth beyond the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the <hi>Root,</hi> as in <hi>Jerusalem Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choke</hi>; where more close, as in <hi>Potato's,</hi> the <hi>Buds</hi> lie a little absconded beneath it, the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> being by their <hi>Braces</hi> somewhat checked and curbed in, while the <hi>Bark</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to swell in a fuller growth.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> are all along more equally sized, the <hi>Root</hi> is so also, or <hi>Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical</hi>; as those of <hi>Eryngo, Horse-Radish, Marsh-mallow, Liquorish,</hi> &amp;c. But if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, growing still wider towards the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Root</hi>; the <hi>Root</hi> is unequal also, but groweth, quite contrary to the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> still smaller or <hi>pyramidally</hi>; and the more numerous and larger the <hi>Vessels</hi> are, the <hi>Bark</hi> is proportionably the less, and so the <hi>Root</hi> more sharp and spiring, as in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Nettle, Patience, Thorn Apple,</hi> &amp;c. For here where the said <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are wider, they contain a more copious <hi>Ferment,</hi> whereby the <hi>Sap</hi> is thereabout more vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized, and copiously advanced to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts. Withal, thus receiving within
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105413:76"/>
themselves, and transmitting to the upper parts a more plentiful <hi>Vapour,</hi> they hereby rob the <hi>parenchymous</hi> parts of their aliment, and so stint them in their growth.</p>
            <p>From the different <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>situation</hi> of the parts, the <hi>Motions</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> are also various. For where the <hi>Air vessels</hi> are spread abroad and invested with a thinner <hi>Bark,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> runs or lyes <hi>level,</hi> as in the <hi>level Roots</hi> of <hi>Primrose, Ammi, Anemone,</hi> &amp;c. may be seen. So that these <hi>Roots</hi> as by the <hi>perpendicular</hi> ones shooting from them into the <hi>Moulds</hi> they are plucked down; so by the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> standing nearer the <hi>Air</hi> and more under its attractive power, they are invited upwards; whereby they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ascent</hi> nor <hi>descent,</hi> but keep <hi>level</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both.</p>
            <p>But if these <hi>Vessels</hi> are contracted stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either in or near the Centre, and are invested with a <hi>Bark</hi> proportionably thick; the <hi>Root</hi> striketh down <hi>perpendicularly,</hi> as <hi>Dandelyon, Bugloss, Parsnep,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> although they are spread abroad in the <hi>level,</hi> yet in the <hi>perpendicular Roots</hi> of the same Plant they are always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; as by comparing the <hi>level</hi> and <hi>down right Roots</hi> of <hi>Ammi, Primrose, Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Artichoke, Cowslip,</hi> and others, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:105413:76"/>If the <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> are contracted and environed with a greater number of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferous,</hi> the <hi>Root</hi> grows <hi>deep,</hi> that is, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular</hi> and <hi>long; perpendicular</hi> from the contraction of the <hi>Aerial,</hi> and <hi>long</hi> from the predominion of the <hi>Succiferous,</hi> which in their growth are extended only by that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mension, as in <hi>Liquorish, Eryngo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Succiferous</hi> are over proportioned to the <hi>parenchymous</hi> parts, but under to the <hi>Aerial</hi>; the <hi>Root</hi> is <hi>perpendicular</hi> still, but groweth <hi>shallow</hi>; the <hi>Succiferous</hi> being sturdy enough to keep it <hi>perpendicular,</hi> and the <hi>Aerial</hi> having a predominion to keep it from growing <hi>deep</hi>; as in <hi>Stramonium, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotian, Beet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If on the contrary the <hi>parenchymous</hi> are predominant to the <hi>Aerial,</hi> and that both in the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Trunk</hi>; then the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Root</hi> changeth place or <hi>descends:</hi> for the said <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> haveing neither in the <hi>Trunk,</hi> nor in the <hi>Root</hi> a sufficient pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to draw it upwards; it therefore gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually yields to the motion of its <hi>String-Roots</hi>; which as they strike into the Soil pluck it down after them. And because the old <hi>Strings</hi> annually rot off, and new ones successively shoot down into the Soil; it therefore annually still descendeth lower, as in <hi>Tulip, Lily,</hi> &amp;c. may be observed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:105413:77"/>Where the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> are much spread abroad and also numerous, the <hi>Root</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as to its several parts, <hi>descends</hi> and <hi>ascends</hi> both at once: so <hi>Radishes</hi> and <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps,</hi> at the same time their nether parts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, their upper ascend, where therefore the said <hi>Vessels</hi> are more loosely <hi>braced</hi> and <hi>spread</hi> much more abroad than in the lower parts. Hence also the upper part of the <hi>Roots</hi> of most <hi>Seedlings</hi> ascends; because the first <hi>Leaves</hi> being proportionably large, and standing in a free <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> in them have a dominion over the young <hi>Root,</hi> and so yielding themselves to the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the <hi>Air upwards,</hi> draw the <hi>Root</hi> in part after them.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>situation</hi> and <hi>proportions</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Root</hi> is also varied.

            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>parenchymous</hi> parts have much the greatest, the <hi>Root</hi> seldom liveth beyond two years, but afterwards perisheth either in whole or in part, as do divers <hi>bulbous, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous,</hi>

and other <hi>Roots</hi>; whether they are more porous and succulent, or more close and dry. If porous, all the fluid <hi>Principles</hi> standing herein more abundantly, either by a stronger fermentation, or otherwise, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>From the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> their <hi>Contents</hi> and the several <hi>Qualities</hi> hereof are also various; the <hi>fluid</hi> of each <hi>Organical</hi> Part being made chiefly by <hi>Filtration</hi> through the sides thereof; such of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> in the <hi>Sap</hi> being admitted into and transmitted through them, as are aptest thereto: in the same manner as when <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> being poured upon a Paper, the <hi>Water</hi> passeth through, the <hi>Oyl</hi> sticks: or as the <hi>Chyle</hi> is strained through the <hi>Coats</hi> of the <hi>Guts</hi> into the <hi>Lacteal Vessels:</hi> or as <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in <hi>Purgations,</hi> is strained through the same <hi>Coats</hi> from the <hi>Mesenterical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Principles</hi> therefore of the <hi>parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fibres</hi> being <hi>spirituous, acid,</hi> and <hi>aerial,</hi> they will also admit the like into them; excluding those chiefly which are <hi>Alkalizale</hi> and <hi>Oleous.</hi> And as by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation</hi> of such <hi>Principles</hi> in the <hi>Fibres,</hi> the like are capable of <hi>admittance</hi> into them; so the <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>union</hi> of the same <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> regulates their <hi>transmission</hi> into their <hi>Concave:</hi> wherefore the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Fibres</hi> being chiefly <hi>acid,</hi> next <hi>spirituous,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:105413:78"/>
and least <hi>aery</hi>; the more <hi>aery</hi> ones will be <hi>transmitted:</hi> for if more of <hi>them</hi> should <hi>fix,</hi> they must do so by similitude and adhesion; but where there are fewer similary parts to adhere to, fewer must adhere. The <hi>Fibres</hi> then contain so many parts of <hi>Air</hi> as to <hi>admit</hi> many more into their body; but not to <hi>fix</hi> them; which therefore must needs upon admission pass through into their <hi>Concave</hi>; where, together with some other more <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous</hi> parts, they make an <hi>aetherial fluid.</hi> And because some <hi>aqueous</hi> or <hi>vaporous</hi> parts will also strain through with them; hence it is, that as more and more of these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they by degrees still thrust out the <hi>aery</hi> ones, which quitting the more <hi>succulent Fibres</hi> of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> are forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to the dryer ones, <hi>scil.</hi> all those whereof the <hi>diametral portions</hi> do consist. For the same reason the <hi>Aery</hi> parts being gradually excluded the <hi>succulent Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi> of the <hi>Bark</hi>; they are forced to recede and transmigrate into those of the <hi>Pith</hi>: And the <hi>Fibres</hi> themselves being filled, and the <hi>Aery</hi> parts still forced into them; they at length also strain through the <hi>Fibres</hi> into the <hi>Bubles</hi>; whence while the <hi>Bark</hi> is <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent,</hi> the <hi>Pith</hi> is often filled with <hi>Air.</hi>

and copiously <hi>fix</hi> the like <hi>Principles</hi>; yet the <hi>Water</hi> being more <hi>perfluent</hi> than the rest, will therefore strain, with a lighter <hi>Tincture</hi> of them, into their <hi>Concave.</hi> Especially the <hi>oleous Principles</hi> hereof being <hi>rampant,</hi> and less apt to <hi>fix</hi> and <hi>seize</hi> the <hi>aqueous</hi> parts, upon their entrance, than the <hi>saline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Lactiferous</hi> being somewhat less <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>oleous</hi> than the <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> and the <hi>oleous</hi> parts being herein less <hi>rampant</hi>; therefore the <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>oleous</hi> parts will be both copiously <hi>transmitted</hi> hereinto. So that the <hi>Lymphaeducts</hi> being more <hi>oily,</hi> both <hi>admit,</hi> and <hi>fix</hi> the like <hi>Principles</hi>; the <hi>Lacteals</hi> being moderately <hi>oily, admit</hi> them, but <hi>fix</hi> them not, letting them pass through; but the <hi>parenchymous Fibres</hi> being scarce at all <hi>oily,</hi> do not so much as <hi>admit</hi> them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fluid Ferment</hi> contained in the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> is also in part dependent on the <hi>Principles</hi> of those <hi>Vessels,</hi> being in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colation <hi>tinctured</hi> therewith. But because the percolation is not made <hi>through</hi> the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Fibres</hi> whereof the <hi>Vessels</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, but only <hi>betwixt</hi> them; therefore the transient <hi>Principles</hi> are not here distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so precisely as in all the aforesaid <hi>Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi> parts, but more promiscuously pass into the <hi>Concaves</hi> of the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> and are therein all immersed in a body of <hi>Air</hi>; the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105413:79"/>
               <hi>Fibres</hi> themselves in the mean time, as those of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> admitting and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more <hi>aery</hi> and <hi>aetherial Fluid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Contents</hi> are varied, not only by the <hi>Nature,</hi> but also the <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>situation</hi> of the <hi>Parts,</hi> whereby they are in different facility and quantity communicated to one another. Hence it is partly that a <hi>Vine,</hi> and that <hi>Corn</hi> hath so little <hi>Oyl; sc.</hi> because their <hi>Air-vessels</hi> in proportion with the other <hi>parts,</hi> are so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>numerous</hi>: in <hi>Corn</hi> the <hi>Stalk</hi> being also very hollow, and becoming as it were one great <hi>Air-vessel.</hi> For the <hi>oily</hi> parts of the <hi>Sap</hi> are so exceedingly <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated</hi> by the <hi>Aery ferment</hi> contained in these <hi>Vessels,</hi> that they are for the most part so far <hi>immersed</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or mixed therewith, as not, by being collected in any considerable Body, to be distinguishable from it. And the affinity that is betwixt <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Oyls,</hi> especially <hi>Essential,</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest; both are inflammable <hi>per se</hi>; and burn all away; the <hi>Odors,</hi> which we call the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Plants,</hi> are lodged in their <hi>essential Oyl</hi>; both being duly <hi>Rectified,</hi> will mix as easily together as <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> So that although <hi>Oyl,</hi> by the separation of its <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>saline</hi> parts, which give it its sensibly <hi>oleous</hi> Body, may not be so far <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated</hi> as to <hi>produce</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi>; yet that it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105413:80"/>
may so far, and so be mixed with it, as <hi>not to be discerned from it,</hi> will be granted.</p>
            <p>Hence also the <hi>Lactiferous Vessels,</hi> because they stand more remote from the <hi>Aerial,</hi> and the <hi>Succiferous</hi> interpose; the <hi>Liquor</hi> therefore contained in them, is not so much under the government of the <hi>Aerial ferment,</hi> and is thence partly more <hi>oily.</hi> For the same reason, all <hi>Roots</hi> which are <hi>milkie,</hi> so far as I have observed, have an under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> these being either fewer or smaller.</p>
            <p>From the Precedents we may receive some information likewise of the <hi>Odours, Colours,</hi> and <hi>Tastes</hi> of <hi>Plants.</hi> And for <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,</hi> I suppose that the chief matter of them is the <hi>Aerial ferment</hi> contained in the <hi>Air-vessels.</hi> Not but that the <hi>other</hi> parts do also yield their smell, but that these yield the strongest and the <hi>best,</hi> and immediately perceptible in <hi>fresh, undryed, and unbruised</hi> Plants. For the <hi>Air</hi> entring into, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through the <hi>Root,</hi> and carrying a <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> from the several <hi>Organical</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> Parts along with it, and at last en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring also the <hi>Concaves</hi> of the <hi>Air-vessels</hi>; it there exists the most <hi>compounded</hi> and <hi>volatile fluid,</hi> of all others in the <hi>Plant,</hi> and so the fittest matter of <hi>Odour</hi>; and such an <hi>Odour</hi> as answers to the smell of all the <hi>odorous</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:105413:80"/>
parts of the <hi>Plant.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> parts smell not at all, because the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> are, as hath been said, so far fixed and <hi>concentred</hi> together. Hence also the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> themselves, or any other Bodies, as their <hi>Principles</hi> are any way more <hi>fixed,</hi> they are less <hi>odorous</hi>: So is <hi>Rosin</hi> less than <hi>Turpentine,</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> than <hi>Tar,</hi> and many the self same Bodies when they are <hi>coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> than when they are <hi>melted:</hi> So also <hi>Musk,</hi> which is not so liquid as <hi>Civet,</hi> is not so strong; nor <hi>Ambergreece</hi> as <hi>Musk</hi>; for although it hath a more excellent smell than <hi>Musk,</hi> yet yieldeth it not so easily, since it is a more <hi>fixed</hi> Body, and requireth some <hi>Art</hi> to be opened. Hence also the <hi>Leaves</hi> of many Plants lose their <hi>Odour</hi> upon <hi>rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing</hi>; because the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> being thereby all broken, all their <hi>contained odorous fluid</hi> vanisheth at once, which before only strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gradually through the <hi>Skin.</hi> Yet the <hi>fixed</hi> Parts themselves, upon drying, are so far altered by the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come resoluble and odorous.</p>
            <p>So also of their <hi>Colours.</hi> As whence the <hi>Colours</hi> of the <hi>Skins</hi> are varied; for divers of the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> together with the <hi>parenchymous</hi> Parts successively falling off from the <hi>Bark</hi> therein; by their proximity to the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> their <hi>Principles</hi> are
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105413:81"/>
more or less <hi>resolved,</hi> and so produce divers <hi>Colours.</hi> So those <hi>Roots</hi> which turn <hi>purple</hi> any where within, have usually a <hi>blacker Skin</hi>; the one of those two <hi>Colours</hi> being by a resolution and corruption of parts easily convertible into the other, as in <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry, Thistle,</hi> &amp;c. So the <hi>Milk</hi> of <hi>Scorzonera,</hi> contained in the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Bark,</hi> upon drying turneth into a brown <hi>Colour</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Skin,</hi> in which there are dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of those <hi>Vessels,</hi> is of the <hi>same.</hi> So both the <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Skin</hi> of <hi>Lovage</hi> is of a brownish <hi>yellow.</hi> But <hi>Parsnep</hi> hath a clearer <hi>Sap</hi> in all its <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> and a whiter <hi>Skin.</hi> So <hi>Potato's</hi> being cut traverse after some time out of ground, have divers <hi>red</hi> specks up and down where the <hi>Vessels</hi> stand, and their <hi>Skin</hi> is accordingly <hi>red.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason, I say of these <hi>Colours,</hi> is the <hi>resolution</hi> or <hi>reseration</hi> of the <hi>Principles</hi> of the several Parts chiefly by the <hi>Air,</hi> and a <hi>lighter mixture</hi> of them consequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; whereby the <hi>sulphurious</hi> or <hi>oily</hi> parts which were before <hi>concentred,</hi> are now more or less <hi>rampant,</hi> discovering themselves in divers <hi>Colours,</hi> according as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly mixed with the other <hi>Principles.</hi> Hence these <hi>Colours</hi> are observable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the Parts <hi>wherein</hi> they are, or whereunto they are <hi>adjacent</hi>; so
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105413:81"/>
where the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> run, there <hi>red,</hi> or some other more <hi>saturate Colour</hi>; the <hi>oleous Principles</hi> being, as is said, more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in these <hi>Vessels</hi>; as in the <hi>Bark</hi> of <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the inward parts of <hi>Potato's,</hi> &amp;c. may be seen. But the <hi>parenchymous</hi> Parts, where more remote from the said <hi>Vessels,</hi> they are usually <hi>white</hi> or but <hi>yellow,</hi> the <hi>sulphurious Principle</hi> hereof being, as was said, but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The same is seen in those <hi>Roots</hi> which shew both <hi>red</hi> and <hi>yellow</hi>; those parts prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally where the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>red,</hi> and where the <hi>Aerial</hi> only mixed with the <hi>parenchymous</hi> being <hi>yellow,</hi> as in <hi>Patience.</hi> So the <hi>pithy</hi> part of a <hi>Carrot,</hi> where the <hi>Aerial</hi> have very few <hi>Succiferous</hi> mixed with them, is <hi>yellow,</hi> but the <hi>Bark</hi> where the <hi>Succiferous</hi> are very numerous, is <hi>red.</hi> For the same reason many <hi>Roots</hi> which are <hi>whiter</hi> in their upper parts, are <hi>purple</hi> or <hi>reddish</hi> in their inferiour, as <hi>Avens, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry,</hi> &amp;c. because those lower parts ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving layn longer underground (these being <hi>descending Roots)</hi> their <hi>Principles</hi> are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by somewhat nearer to corruption or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more <hi>resolved,</hi> and so the <hi>oleous ramp</hi> and spread all over the rest in that <hi>Colour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the <hi>resolution</hi> of the <hi>sulphurious</hi> and other <hi>Principles</hi> is partly effected by the <hi>Air,</hi> appears, in that where the <hi>Air</hi> hath
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105413:82"/>
a better access to the <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Colours</hi> are chiefly produced, or are more conspicuous. So in <hi>Potato's,</hi> where the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferous Vessels</hi> are either next to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Air,</hi> as in the <hi>Skin</hi>; or contiguous with the <hi>Air-vessels,</hi> as in the <hi>Ring</hi> within the <hi>Bark</hi>; there they produce a <hi>red</hi>: but where more remote from both, as in the middle of the <hi>Bark</hi> and Centre of the <hi>Root,</hi> there they produce none. Hence also it is, that the <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> of some <hi>Plants,</hi> as <hi>Bloodwort, Wood-Sorrel, Radish, Jacea,</hi> &amp;c. although <hi>green</hi> or <hi>white</hi> in the greatest por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>parenchymous</hi> Part, yet where the <hi>Succiferous</hi> and <hi>Aerial Vessels</hi> run, they are of <hi>red, blue,</hi> and other <hi>Colours</hi>; the <hi>ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> parts of the <hi>one</hi> being <hi>unlocked</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by the <hi>aery</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly of their <hi>Tastes.</hi> Where either the <hi>Succiferous Vessels</hi> are <hi>Lymphaeducts,</hi> or the <hi>diametral Portions</hi> in the <hi>Bark</hi> are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the <hi>Air-vessels</hi> numerous and large, the <hi>Root</hi> is of a weaker <hi>Taste</hi>; as that of <hi>Burnet, Melilot, Borage, Bugloss, Cumfry, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato,</hi> &amp;c. For in that they are less <hi>oleous,</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> more copiously mixed with the <hi>saline Principles,</hi> whereby these are either <hi>mollified</hi> or <hi>refracted</hi>; they are neither <hi>hot</hi> nor <hi>pungent,</hi> but become more <hi>mild.</hi> Whence also of the same kind of <hi>Roots,</hi> those which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105413:82"/>
have the smallest and sewest <hi>diametral por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as <hi>Skirrets,</hi> are the <hi>mildest</hi>; and those with the largest, the <hi>strongest,</hi> as <hi>Lovage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most <hi>Roots</hi> which are <hi>acres</hi> or <hi>biting,</hi> have a very copious <hi>Parenchyma</hi> in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>Succiferous Vessels,</hi> as of <hi>Arum, Dragon,</hi> and others; because the <hi>saline</hi> and other <hi>Principles</hi> are not so much <hi>hot</hi> by any sufficient quantity of <hi>sulphurious</hi> from those <hi>Vessels,</hi> but rendred rather <hi>pungent</hi> from some <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Air.</hi> But divers <hi>Vmbelliferous Roots,</hi> especially which abound with <hi>Lacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Vessels,</hi> are <hi>hot</hi>; as <hi>Fenil, Lovage, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> &amp;c. Yet is it not their <hi>Oyl</hi> alone that makes them <hi>hot,</hi> but the combination thereof with the <hi>saline</hi> Parts; as is manifest from the nature of the <hi>Seed</hi> of these <hi>Plants,</hi> wherein the <hi>Oyl</hi> is most copious; and which being held to a Candle till they burn, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly spit; which cometh to pass by the eruption of the <hi>saline</hi> Parts; being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same effect with that which followeth upon burning of <hi>Serum</hi> or <hi>Blood.</hi> And therefore as the <hi>Seeds</hi> are more <hi>hot,</hi> they also spit the more, as in <hi>Cumine,</hi> &amp;c. which though fulsom, yet not so <hi>hot,</hi> less; in <hi>Fenil</hi> and <hi>Dill</hi> more; <hi>scil.</hi> there being a greater quantity of <hi>volatile Salt</hi> contained therein. Hence all <hi>essential Oyls</hi> are <hi>hot,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>volatile Salt</hi> being incorporated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105413:83"/>
And some of them will <hi>shoot,</hi> and crystallize as <hi>Salts</hi> do, as that of <hi>Anise,</hi> which argues a mixture of a considerable quantity of <hi>volatile Salt.</hi> As also from the nature of these <hi>Oyls,</hi> in being amicable to the <hi>Stomach, Carminative,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Anodyne; scil.</hi> as they kill some <hi>fetid, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive,</hi> or <hi>fermenting A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id</hi>: and <hi>volatile Salts</hi> themselves will have the like operation in some cases as these <hi>Oyls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many <hi>Lactiferous Roots,</hi> as <hi>Taraxicum</hi> and others of that kind, are not so much <hi>hot</hi> as <hi>bitter.</hi> For although by the <hi>Lactiferous Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> they are very <hi>oily</hi>; yet those <hi>Vessels</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing posited in <hi>Rings</hi> and not in <hi>Rays,</hi> and having no <hi>Diametral portions</hi> running through their <hi>Bark</hi> to the <hi>Air-vessels</hi>; the <hi>Acido-Aerial</hi> parts do hereby, although not <hi>mortifie,</hi> yet so far <hi>refract</hi> the <hi>saline,</hi> lightly <hi>binding up</hi> the <hi>oleous</hi> therewith, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>bitter taste.</hi> Which bordereth upon <hi>astringent</hi>; wherein, I suppose, the <hi>saline</hi> and <hi>earthy</hi> are mean, the <hi>oleous</hi> least, and the <hi>acid</hi> most, and so more closely <hi>binding up</hi> the <hi>oleous</hi> and <hi>earthy</hi> with the <hi>saline.</hi> Hence many <hi>sweet</hi> Bodies upon burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>bitter</hi>; the <hi>acid</hi> Parts, which before were more <hi>concentred,</hi> now becoming <hi>ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant</hi> and more copiously mixed with the <hi>oleous.</hi>
