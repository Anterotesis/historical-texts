         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Propoſals by a well wiſher to His Highnes and the Parliament.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat care be taken for the advancement of the Goſpel, and that a way be found out for the maintenance of ſuch as are the faithfull Diſpencers thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As an expedient thereunto, that it be conſidered how many little Congregations there be, have maintenance, would ſerve three or foure; many large ones having ſcarcely any at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That, till certain Maintenance be ſetled, authority be given, to aſſeſſe Maintenance upon the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Church-Diſcipline be taken into conſideration, and that all ſuch Miniſters as are godly and Orthodox, care be taken for their reconciliation, in that difference of Diſcipline; they not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to introduce that late Lordly power, by Biſhops and Prelates.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the Statute, for the ſetting ſuch Poor on work as are able, and relieving the importent, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed and amended, if need be; and further incouragement given for Juſtices of Peace, Conſtables, and other in feriour Officers, to act vigorouſly in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the laſt Act for the Sabbath be peruſed, being defective, as is humbly conceived, there being no power to levy penalties, as in former Acts.</p>
            <p>As alſo, to that clauſe againſt Fulling-Mills, the penalty being but 10 ſhillings; and the mills ſometimes conſiſting of 10 or 11 Stocks, being every Stock will earn 5 ſhillings upon the Lords Day, it will therefore be neceſſary, as to the reforming of that vice, that every Stock within the reſpective Mills, pay 10 ſhillings from the Miller, and 10 ſhillings from the Owner of the Cloth, in the ſaid Stock; and ſo proceed in the penalty, as the parties goe on in offending.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Statute of <hi>James</hi> 1 ſt. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9 th. 4 th. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 th. be peruſed and amended, if need be, againſt tipling by Neighbours within their Townſhips; and further encouragement given, for the putting the ſame in execution.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That no perſon, being a Juſtice of Peace, in any City, Town-corporate, or elſe-where, and trading in Malt, by himſelf or his Agent, be authoriſed to grant Licenſe to ſell Ale or Beer.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That no Bayliff, Attorney, Coroner, Conſtable, &amp;c. be licenſed to ſell Ale or Beer, or keep a Tavern. And that alſo, not any perſon being a Tradeſman, and keeping many ſervants in his houſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That it be conſidered, whether Watch and Ward be not as neceſſary, if not more, in Winter, as in Summer.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That the great inconvenience by Certioraries, be alſo conſidered; by reaſon whereof, many groſſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Country paſſe unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That payment of mony, freely lent for the publick good, be taken into conſideration, and ſpeedy courſe taken therein.</p>
            <p>And as an expedient thereunto, let it be conſidered, that ſeeing there are great numbers of perſons, who have aided and aſſiſted the King's party; and ſince the beginning of theſe Wars, have thereby procured unto themſelves great Eſtates, by buying of plundred goods, and otherwiſe, in the late troubles, whether or no it were not reaſonable, a collection of the names of ſuch perſons were procured, and the ſaid mony aſſeſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they being the onely perſons that have gained by the late troubles, and never have been ſequeſtred, nor ſuffered by the times, being alwaies upon occaſion ready to ſide with both parties, for advantage-ſake. As alſo, any perſon or perſons, diſcovering any concealment, may not out of the ſame be relieved, for ſuch his, or their lent-mony.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That ſome proviſion be made, that upon any difference ariſing amongſt neighbours, unleſſe in caſe of Titles of Land, or great ſums of Mony, before any ſuit be commenced, the party complaining, have power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Defendant before the next Juſtice of Peace, or ſome others, authoriſed thereto, who ſhall have power to hear and end the difference, if he can; and that any Suit commenced, contrary to that rule, ſhall be void in Law.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That the Statutes for Clothing be peruſed, and proviſion made againſt the deceirs, now too frequent, in that particular.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That the ſaid complaints of Country-people, as to the hard uſage they meet with, from ſuch as collect the exciſe be conſidered, it being conceived, that the charges of collecting of it, which the Country bears, is as much as comes to the Common-wealth. And therefore it is propoſed, that what any Leaſer hath paid for three or four of the laſt years, may be charged upon the perſons, lyable to pay the ſame; and ſome way found out to collect the ſame, without ſuch exceſſive charges, as other publick mony is.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That ſuch as in the late Wars, have aided and aſſiſted the late King, and have forced perſons, by fineing them to ſerve as Conſtables, &amp;c. againſt their minds, may not now be ſuffered to make choice of ſuch like Officers; and in caſe they will not deſiſt, a way to proceed againſt them. And alſo that all proceedings by ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in other their reſpective places, either by themſelves, or joyntly with others, may be void in Law.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That unneceſſary and exceſſive feaſtings, in Cities and Towns corporate, be prevented; it having been very obſervable, how many perſons of good Eſtates have been weakened thereby; it alſo being a hinderance to other honeſt men, for taking upon them places of truſt.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Wants authority for the regulating of Pewes and Galleries, in ſeverall great Aſſemblies, they being poſſeſſed by the younger ſort, to the prejudice of the aged, and ſuch as hears the charge thereof; eſpecially in Cities and great Corporations.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That the diſcontinuance of the late Act of Parliament, for the repairing of high waies by Aſſeſſments, be taken into further conſideration, it having been found by experience to be very effectually, in ſeverall places of this Nation.</p>
