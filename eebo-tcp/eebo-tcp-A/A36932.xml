            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the so troublesome multitude of Books, and the no less troublesome scarcity of good ones, I have no reason to think this little Piece will much increase the number of the one, or not serve to balance the trouble of the other: but I rather hope it may be acceptable and usefull, if either the great Eminence of the Author, or the Argument it self, or else the small bulk, which are things that use to render works of this kind considerable, be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient either to recommend or excuse it. For the necessity of the argument may recommend it not to most Readers onely, but very many Writers too. And
<pb facs="tcp:41548:3"/>
without doubt many of those who have been ambitious to put themselves into the number of Authors by publishing their abortive labours will need the Rules and Offices of this Manual, when their Conscience shall cite them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to ask God forgiveness for nourishing Faction, and sowing the seeds of Discord, and venting their crude No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to others trouble and their own shame. For such men in the use of this little <hi>Enchiridion</hi> may finde more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and doe themselves and the Age more right, then in that small harvest of reputation their own voluminous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours could bring in, which are now very fitly preferred from the Closet to the more worthy ministeries of the Shop and Kitchin. But the most Reverend Author, to whose learned Piety thou owest these following assistences, who in the sweetness and mildness of these lines has expressed the features and linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own candid, serene Soul, did not address them for his own use in that kind. For that he was of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Order of our Church, he did not owe to his Interest, which advances some, nor
<pb facs="tcp:41548:3"/>
to his Money, which preferrs commonly too many, but wholly to his Vertues and his Learning, and those other eminent Graces, that made his Example as great in the Church as was his Dignity. And this little Book is a great instance of his Humility and Charity, which he does in some kinde still exercise, though he be now gone to receive his reward for them; and as he used to look into the necessities of indigent persons to relieve them with his hand, so in this Portuise he descends to converse with the weaknesses and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariness of humble Penitents, directing and improving their Devotions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigating their Repentance, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a constant store-house of relief for them by his Pen. And now if a Person so eminent in Grace, so innocent in Life, needed such Exercises as this, (for what thou receivest here, know, Courteous Reader, it comes from his Counsel and from his daily Experience and Practice too) consider whether thou thy self art not concerned to bring thy actions and life to as severe a scrutiny and a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as operative. If thou joynest with me in Opinion, here is a Directory ready
<pb facs="tcp:41548:4"/>
at hand: but if not, thou needest it so much the more. For our Sins, the less impression they make on our memory, the deeper they make on our Conscience; and he is in some cases the most guilty who presumes he is wholly innocent. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract therefore that conceit, and betake thy self to thy Closet and the practice of this Book, and God bless it to thy benefit and his own glory.</p>

                  <p>YOu are to consider the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Duty. For if we take care that the Rooms which we eat or sleep in should be kept clean, you cannot but think that the cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul is a Concernment infinitely beyond it: and for doing this there is no other way left but to search out every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, and to cast out every Sin with every unclean thought that hath defiled it.</p>

                  <p>You are to remember, that there is a great Measure of Discretion to be used in the Performance of this: so that you may neither omit it, when your own heart may tell you that there is something amiss in you, which must be look'd after; nor on the other side over-scrupulously pursue it when you are not conscious to your self of any notable Failings but such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to humane frailty: for if you do not wilfully pass over any of your greater Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but confess particularly, and repent seriously of them, God will more easily pass by your lesser Infirmities, being such as the Holy Prophet despaired of finding out, when he so sadly complained, <hi>Who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi>

                  <p>For the Manner of Ordering this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination several Methods have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed: some by dividing the subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it into Thoughts, Words and Deeds; others as sins are differenced by their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Objects, either as being immediately sins against God, or against your Neighbour, or against your own Soul: Others advise to set God's Holy Commandments before you, and to examine by that Rule what you have done amiss.

                  <p>THat besides this Examination of your Conscience, (which may be done inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret between God and your own Soul) there is great use of Holy Confession: which though it be not generally in all Cases and peremptorily commanded, as if without it no Salvation could possibly be had; yet you are advised by the Church under whose discipline you live, that before you are to receive the Holy Sacrament, or when you are visited with any dangerous sickness, if you find any one particular sin or more that lies, heavy upon you, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen your self of it into the Bosom of your Confessour, who not onely stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and you to pray for you, but hath the power of the Keys committed to him, upon your true Repentance to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve you in Christ's Name from those sins which you have confessed to him.</p>

Your Obedience is required to the former in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular as far as it is enjoyned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the want of Health or some other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents may unavoidably hinder you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not onely the Bishop may dispense with you, but he that hath the charge of your Soul, especially if the Necessity be evident.</p>

               <p>That I, the price of thy Bloud, have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against thee my <hi>Iesus,</hi> who hadst so much love for me as to be content to die for me.</p>
               <p>That I, the chosen Temple of thy Holy Spirit, have sinned against him who san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified me.</p>
               <p>For this I grieve, and mourn, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
               <p>And having done all this, yet I have not done; for still I am grieved: grieved that I can grieve no more, that my Head is not a continual Spring, and mine Eyes Fountains of Tears.</p>
               <p>Wo is me, wretch as I am, that I who have been so easie, so forward, so eager to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41548:19"/>
sin, should be now so untoward, so heavy, so unable to repent.</p>
               <p>Wo is me, that I should be still so drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, so dead asleep in sin, that I should not be yet awake, and sensible of the condition I am in.</p>
               <p>O that I had died before my unworthy Soul had given way to those first sins, which have drawn so foul a Train after them.</p>
               <p>But, O my God, though I cannot wait on thee among the Innocent, yet deny me not a room among the Penitent.</p>
               <p>Remember, O my God, that though <hi>Ahab</hi> had sold himself to work wickedness, yet because he Praied, and Fasted, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself before thee, thou hadst so much regard even of this outward Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his, as to promise not to bring the evil upon him in his daies.</p>
               <p>But, Lord, if my heart deceive me not, I do not only outwardly and seemingly, but really and cordially Repent.</p>
               <p>And therefore for the evil that I have deserved, O my God, rather let the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment light upon me in this world then in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41548:19"/>Rather let me perform the Penance of my Tears here, then reserve it for that sad time, when a whole Sea of Tears will doe no good.</p>
               <p>And having said all this, if my Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be yet imperfect, (as I know it cannot but want many grains, if weighed in this just balance) let the bitter Sufferings of thy dear Son <hi>Iesus</hi> be cast into the Scale, and then I shall not fear if thou enter into Judgment with me.</p>
               <p>But of my self, O God, I am utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and which way to satisfie thee I know not.</p>
               <p>I dare not say so much as the Servant in the Gospel did, <hi>Master, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</hi> But rather, Master, have patience with me, for I can pay thee nothing at all, unless thy bounty be so great as to give it me to pay thee.</p>
               <p>I can Fast from a meal sometimes, (though it be with much a doe) and I can Pray, though coldly enough; and if the fit and qualm of my Devotion holds out longer, I can strain for a Tear or two to sprinkle upon my dry Devotions.</p>
               <p>But should I fast my self into Air and Emptiness, and weep my self into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41548:20"/>
should I tear the skin from this sinfull Flesh of mine, I should never be able to satisfie for the least of those Millions of Millions of sins which, through the several moments of my life, either ignorantly or knowingly, weakly or wilfully, I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against thee.</p>
               <p>What I have transgressed against others, I am not onely sorry for, but ready, as far as my power will reach, to satisfie. But for my sins against thee, my God, I must lay my hand upon my mouth for ever, for I have nothing to return or answer.</p>
               <p>But the comfort is (and blessed shall be my Soul, if rightly I lay hold on it) that it is thou, O my blessed <hi>Iesu,</hi> who hast satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for me, one drop of whose bloud is enough to satisfie for the sins of a thousand worlds.</p>
               <p>And this being so, will thy offended Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be so rigorous as to require the same paiment again? Especially will he require it of me, a poor, a broken, and a bankrupt Sinner?</p>

               <p>O God the Holy Ghost, who to the same end didst sanctifie me in my Baptism, and haft so often since breathed holy thoughts and motions on me,</p>
               <p>Have mercy on me.</p>
               <p>O Holy and Blessed and Glorious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whom in three Persons I adore as my one and onely true God.</p>
               <p>Have mercy on me.</p>
               <l>Hear me, O Lord.</l>
               <l>Help me, O Lord.</l>
               <l>Save me, or else I perish.</l>
               <p>Lord, carest thou not that I perish? Thou that wouldest have all men saved? Thou who wouldest have none to perish?</p>
               <p>And wilt thou now shew thine anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41548:23"/>
a Worm, against a Leaf, against a Vapour that vanisheth before thee?</p>
               <p>O remember how short my time is, and deliver not my Soul into the Power of Hell.</p>
               <p>For, alas! what profit is there in my Bloud? or who shall ever give thee thanks in that bottomless pit?</p>
               <p>No, let me live in thy sight; let me live, O my God, that my Soul may praise thee.</p>
               <p>Forget me as I have been disobedient, provoking thee to anger; and regard me as I am distressed, crying out to thee for help.</p>
               <p>Look not upon me as I am a Sinner, but consider me as I am thy Creature.</p>
               <p>A Sinner I am, I confess, a Sinner of no ordinary strain; but let not this hinder thee, O my God, for upon such Sinners thou gettest the greatest glory.</p>
               <p>O remember for whose sake it was that thou camest from the bosome of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and didst let thy self down so low as to be content to be born of thine own humble handmaid.</p>
               <p>Remember for whom it was that thy tender Body was Torn, and Scourged, and Crucified, and thy precious Bloud shed.</p>
               <p>Was it not for the sins of the whole world? and shall I be so narrow-hearted to my own Soul, or so injurious to thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as to think that in all this crowd thou hast particularly excepted me?</p>
               <p>Or, which is as great a dishonour to thee, can I possibly imagine that thou diedst one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41548:23"/>
for Sinners of a lower kinde, and leftest such as I am without remedy?</p>
               <p>What had become then of him who fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with Bloud? What of the noted Woman who had lived in a trade of Sin? Nay, what had become of thine own Disciple who with Oaths and Curses thrice denied thee?</p>
               <p>O how easie is it for thee to forgive? for it is thy Nature.</p>
               <p>How proper is it for thee to save? for it is thy Name.</p>
               <p>How suitable is it to thy onely End of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the World? for it is thy Business.</p>
               <p>And when I consider that I am the chief of Sinners, may I not urge the Father, and say, Shall the very chief of thy business be left undone?</p>
               <p>Mercy, Mercy, good Lord.</p>
               <p>I ask not of thee any longer the things of this world; neither Power, nor Honours, nor Riches, nor Pleasures. No, my God, dispose of them to whom thou pleasest, so that thou givest me Mercy.</p>
               <p>O that I could hear thee once say, as thou didst to him in the Gospel, <hi>My Son, be of good chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How would my drooping Spirits revive at such a Sound? and my now wounded Soul break forth into Hymns and Praises and Hallelujahs for a Mercy so utterly undeserved of me, and which the Angels
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41548:24"/>
which fell could never hear of?</p>
               <p>But, O my weak Soul, what dost thou fear? or what dost thou scruple at? For thou art not yet in such a desperate condition, but thou maist expect that what was said to him may possibly be said to thee.</p>
               <p>Nay, be confident (though it be with a mixture of fear and trembling) that if thou dost not act the part of an Hypocrite all this while, thy Saviour stands ready at the very doors of thy Heart, to breath the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same words in a heavenly whisper to thee; <hi>Be of good chear, thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Return then unto thy rest, O my Soul, for thy Sins are forgiven thee.</p>
               <p>Onely take this Counsel along with thee, <hi>Sin no more, lest a worse thing fall unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O that I could never sin against thee more; never purposely, deliberately, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully sin against thee more.</p>
               <p>And for those sins of daily Incursion, those over-familiar corruptions of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which thou hast not yet given me strength enough to conquer; Lord, either subdue them to me by degrees, or lay them not to my charge.</p>
               <p>But wherein soever my Conscience most accuseth me, therein, O my God, be thou most mercifull unto me.</p>
               <p>Save me, O God, as a Brand snatched out of the Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41548:24"/>Receive me, O my <hi>Jesu,</hi> as a Sheep that hath wandred, but is now returned to the great Shepherd and Bishop of my Soul.</p>
