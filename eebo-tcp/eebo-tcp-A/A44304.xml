         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and increaſing ſad diſtractions amongſt
the people of God, to the hindrance of their

put all the Miniſters of Chriſt to moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

may, under the preſent diſpenſations of God, without ſin, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
in following unqueſtionable duties, with, and under, the
eſtabliſhed Government of the Church. And although, as to
a cordial allowance of the preſent change, they cannot yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
ſomething remaining, whether of ſcruple or affection, which
maketh it unpleaſing, and their concurrence with it, to ly heavy
upon their ſpirits; yet, if there be found no manifeſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in concurring under the ſame, in matters of unqueſtionable
duty, they would wiſely put difference between <hi>gravamen ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus</hi>
and <hi>ligamen conſcientiae,</hi> ſomething in the will that rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them averſe, and the prevailing clear light of a well-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conſcience, (to which, how uneaſie it is to attain in this
point of controverſie, they can tell who have truly tryed it)
binding them up from concurrence, as a thing in it ſelf unlawfull.
Men, who walk in the fear of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are zealous of His honour,
had need to be very jealous of their own zeal, that it carry them
not to the rejecting of a real duty, which (to their apprehenſion)
ſits too near a ſin: Miniſters, whom ſober-mindedneſs doth
greatly become, would look to it, that the cenſure of a grave Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
upon the ſpirits of our countrey-men (<hi>praefervidum Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
ingenium</hi>) do not too much touch them. It is their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99668:3"/>
duty to advert, leſt, at this time, too great animoſity contribute
to the laying of the foundation of a wofull diviſion, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
to the generations to come; the evil whereof will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponder
all the good that any one form of Church-government
can, of it ſelf, produce, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſhonour of God, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the cauſe of the true proteſtant Religion, againſt the
common adverſaries thereof; the deſtroying of true charity and
love amongſt the people of God, the hinderance of their profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the ſeveral Miniſtries they live under, and the creating
continual confuſions and diſtractions in the Common-wealth
(the ordinary fruit of ſchiſm in the Church) as too lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
experience (whereof we carry the ſad marks to this day)
hath taught us.</p>
            <p>1. That there may, and ought to be, a brotherly accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and concurrence in matters of practice, which are undoubted
duty, (albeit Brethren be of different judgments anent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Meetings, or capacity of perſons that act in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
grave and learned men have put it out of queſtion. It is
well known, that in the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>London,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
was mainly laboured for (and far carried on) between
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> that they might concur in
common Actings for regulating the Church, with a reſerve of
liberty of their own ſeveral principles. The <hi>Independents</hi>
thought the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had no judicial Authority in theſe
Meetings. The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> though accounting this an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
yet, were willing, in common unqueſtionable duties, to
concur with them. Alſo, ſeveral of the moſt eminent <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Viner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
of un-preaching Elders, as of an humane device (as
now the Office of a Biſhop is accounted of by many Brethren)
Yet, not being able to attain to the exerciſe of presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
without the intermixture of theſe; yea, of them,
double the number to preaching Presbyters in each Meeting,
(which gave them an overſwaying power in the Government)
notwithſtanding they did concur with them in matters of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
duty. Is it not alſo well known, that amongſt our
ſelves in this Church, Brethren did ordinarily concur in Synods
and Presbyteries, in doing their duties with theſe whom they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99668:3"/>
charged with a ſinfull ſchiſme? (a thing as much againſt the
Covenant, as that which is now pretended for withdrawing
from the Meetings of Synods and Presbyteries.) And when
Brethren, thus charged, did withdraw their concurrence in ſome
duties, by ſeveral paſſages in that Paper, entituled, <hi>A Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the riſe, progreſs and ſtate of the Diviſions in the
Church of</hi> Scotland, how that practice of theirs was conſtructed
of, pag. 21. it is affirmed that they homologate with the tenet
and practice of Separatiſme, denying the lawfulneſs of concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in a lawfull neceſſary duty, becauſe of the perſonal ſin of
fellow-actors in it. And, pag. 28. ſpeaking of their refuſing
to own the Judicatories as lawfull, becauſe the men whom they
judged to be in a courſe of defection (the Commiſſioners of the
Church they meant) were admitted to ſit there, it is ſaid by
the Repreſenter, that it is a principle that draweth very deep:
for, (ſaith he) by parity of reaſon, they muſt not joyn with
any inferiour Judicatories where they are, nor in any lawful
act of Religion or Worſhip, more then in an Aſſembly. May
not much of this be applyed to the preſent Withdrawers from
concurrence in neceſſary duties? <hi>Mutato nomine, de te,</hi> &amp;c. It
will be ſaid, there is a great diſparity between thoſe Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
and the Biſhops, who are looked on as new unwarranted
Officers in the Church; and therefore, albeit there may be now
reaſon for withdrawing from Meetings where they are, there
was no reaſon for withdrawing from Aſſemblies where theſe
Commiſſioners ſate. But, (not to divert to a diſpute here,
whether the Office of a Biſhop be new, or unwarrantable, or
leſſe warrantable then the Office of theſe Commiſſioners, which
wiſe men looked upon as very like epiſcopal) there is herein a
parity, that as theſe now are judged, ſo the other were judged
by the Excepters againſt them, to be in a courſe of defection,
and unlawfully officiating as members of the Aſſembly. And
yet, were theſe Quarrellers reproved for withdrawing from the
general Aſſembly upon that account? Should not that reproof
be taken home in the preſent caſe, by ſuch as withdraw from
Meetings of the Chruch? why ſhould there be divers weights,
and divers meaſures uſed in ſuch parity of caſes? Again, it is
aſſerted, (pag. 37.) to be a diviſive principle, that men will not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99668:4"/>
concur in lawfull duties, becauſe theſe, with whom they
joyn, will not come up to their judgment in all other things:
<hi>Ibid.</hi> They challenge them for refuſing to joyn in an uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
duty, becauſe the direction to it flowed from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of an Aſſembly, which they could not own: It were good
that theſe former principles, were better remembred and uſed
in the preſent caſe. Further, the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi>
in their Paper, printed, <hi>Octob.</hi> 5. 1659. (pag. 8. of that Paper)
ſpeak very ſoberly, diſclaiming it as none of their principles,
that no difference of opinion can be ſuffered by them. We are
(ſay they) clear, that in many things of common practice in a
Church, there may be agreement by accommodation, though
differences of judgment remain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, ſay they, we
readily yield, that, as we propheſie but in part, men in a Church
may compoſe debates by putting end to contentions, though
they be not all of one judgment; and therein we judge the
Apoſtle hath ſet the rule before us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. A Golden
Rule indeed, the practice whereof, in its juſt ſenſe, might bring
us much ſweet peace. But, not to inſiſt upon the judgments of
learned men concerning the Caſe of ſubmiſſion to, and acting in
duties, with Meetings, anent the conſtitution whereof, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
there may be ſome difference in judgment. If we will hearken
to a man, greatly learn'd, and known to be no great friend to
Biſhops, we ſhall hear him perſwading to obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to them in things lawful. <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to by ſome Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> who excepted againſt
ſome cuſtomes in the diſcipline and order of that Church (their
controverſie had not then riſen ſo high, as to ſtrike at the Office
of Biſhops; only ſome cuſtoms in diſcipline and ceremonies in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
order, were moſt ſtood upon.) He, (<hi>Beza</hi> Epiſt. 12.) though
diſliking theſe things; yet, plainly averres to them, that theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
are not <hi>tanti momenti,</hi> as that for theſe they ſhould leave
their miniſtry, and by deſerting their Churches, give advantage to
Sathan, who ſeeketh occaſion to bring in greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
evils: He wiſheth them there to bear what they cannot
amend, to beware of all bitterneſs: And albeit they could not
come to be of the ſame mind with others; yet, with a godly
concord to reſiſt Sathan, who ſeeketh all occaſions of tumults
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99668:4"/>
and infinit calamities. And he doth moſt gravely obteſt the
Miniſters (with tears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he ſaith) <hi>Vt Regiae Majeſtati<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
Praeſulibus ſuis ex animo obſequantur. Beza</hi> pleads for
hearty obedience (in things lawful) to the Biſhops, of whom
he ſpeaks honourably in that Epiſtle; not hinting at the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of their Office, nor offering to perſwade the Miniſters to
do againſt their Office: <hi>Sunt maximi viri</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>qui ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulari
Dei Opt. Max. beneficio papiſticis Epiſcopis ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi>
He accounts not them nor their Office popiſh; but ſaith,
<hi>By the ſingular mercy of the moſt great and good God,
they have ſucceeded the popiſh Biſhops, or come in their place;</hi>
even as, by the ſingular mercy of God, proteſtant Miniſters
have come in the place and room of popiſh Prieſts. And how
well he eſteems of the Office and of the men in the Office (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abating ſomewhat of his peremptorineſs in the heat of diſpute
with ſome, as he had cauſe) may appear not only by what he
ſaith in that Epiſtle, <hi>exhorreſcimus ut contra Regiae Majeſtatis
&amp; Epiſcoporum voluntatem, miniſtri ſuô miniſteriô fungantur:</hi>
But from his Epiſtles to <hi>Grindal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Epiſt. 23.
commending <hi>Grindals</hi> Chriſtians patience and lenity, addeth,
<hi>Majori poſthac paena digni erunt qui authoritatem iuam aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernabuntur,</hi>

he ſaith, <hi>Dominus te iſtic</hi> (at <hi>London</hi>) <hi>ſpeculatorem &amp; judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
conſtituit.</hi> By all which, it may appear, that it would
have been far from <hi>Beza</hi>'s mind, that Miniſters ſhould give no
obedience to Biſhops eſtabliſhed by the Laws of a Kingdom, not
ſo much as in things undoubtedly lawful, or that they ſhould
have refuſ'd concurrence with Biſhops in ordering the Church,
and acting in unqueſtionable duties.</p>
            <p>2. The preſent Queſtion, concerns the caſe and carriage of two
kind of Miniſters. 1. Some refuſe to come to Synods (although
called by the Kings Majeſties command, ſignified by His moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
privie Council) where Biſhops do preſide. They refuſe
alſo to come to Presbyteries, where a Moderator, pretending
no more power then any of themſelves, preſides, being
nominated by the Biſhop in the Synod, to continue till the next
Meeting of the Synod.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99668:5"/>
Such Meetings they withdraw from; albeit nothing be
required of them, but to act in unqueſtionable duties, for
regulating the Church, and ſuppreſſing, according to their
power, of ſinful diſorder; albeit there be no impoſition upon
their judgments, nor ſubſcription required, nor declaration
that they allow any thing they count amiſs in the conſtitution
of theſe Meetings, or any conſtituent members thereof; Yea,
where it might be permitted to them (if they intreated for this)
to caſe their conſcience by ſignifying their ſcruples (which they
cannot overcome) anent the conſtitution of theſe Meetings, or
anent the members thereof, ſo be they would do this with that
inoffenſive modeſty, humility and reſpect to the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the Laws of the Land, and to ſuch Meetings and
the members thereof, that becomes; and after that, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in their undoubted duties: Concerning ſuch Miniſters, the
queſtion is, whether they may and ought to concur with ſuch
Meetings of their Brethren, in carrying on their undoubted
duties? or, if it be unlawful ſo to do? 2. The other rank of
Miniſters are theſe, who, falling within the compaſſe of the
Act of Council at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and of Parliament whereto it
relates, do rather chooſe to part with their Miniſtry then to ſeek
a Preſentation from the Patron, and Collation thereupon from
the Biſhop; yea, who will quit their Miniſtry, rather then that
they will once come in terms of treating with a Biſhop, to try
upon what conditions they may have the liberty to enjoy their
Miniſtry, and to ſerve God therein for the good and ſalvation
of his people.</p>
            <p>3. As to the caſe of Brethren of the former ſort, ſeveral
things are worthy their moſt ſerious conſideration, which may
render them ſomewhat jealous of the unwarrantableneſs of their
preſent way. 1. Hath not the Supreme Magiſtrate (even accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their own principles) an undoubted power to convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Synods when he ſees it needfull? Never were there any
proteſtant Miniſters (no nor chriſtian Miniſters) before this
time, who, being convocated to a Synod or Church-meeting
by the Soveraign Chriſtian Magiſtrate, did refuſe to come at
his command; Nor is there any rank or degree of Subjects that
can, without the ſtain of ſinful diſobedience, refuſe to meet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99668:5"/>
upon His Majeſties command; and Miniſters cannot plead
exemption from the common duties of Subjects. 2. Brethren
would conſider, whether it would prove a ſufficient ground to
juſtifie their not-coming to the Synod upon His Majeſties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
by His Council, becauſe that command to come to the
Synod, is joyned with another, commanding to concur duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the command to come, is only in order to the
required concurrence, which they cannot give, as they ſay.
Is this rational, that where two commands of the Magiſtrate
are joyn'd, the one undoubtedly lawful to be obeyed, the other
doubted of, that Subjects ſhould diſobey the Magiſtrate in
that which is clearly lawfull, becauſe they have a doubt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clearneſs
anent obeying him in the other command? Doth it
not become Subjects to go as far on in obedience to lawfull
Authority, as they ſee they may without ſin againſt God?
Then it is time to ſtop when any thing is put to them by vertue
of the Kings Command, which they clearly ſee they cannot do
without ſin. Had they come to the place, it would, <hi>pro tanto,</hi>
have ſhewed their reſpect to Authority, albeit they had
humbly declared themſelves bound up from acting by their
doubts. And yet, it may be, they will in end find, that they
might lawfully have concurred in unqueſtionable duty, that
there was no ground to refuſe this; and that they might have
ſufficiently ſalved their Conſcience by a humble ſignification of
their ſcruple, as was ſaid, and yet not refuſed to concur in
undoubted duties, for the perſonal fault (as they apprehend)
of any member of the Aſſembly. 3. What ground could they
have for ſeparation from the Synod? Is it the want of liberty to
chooſe a Moderator? Or, Is it that he that preſides, is a Biſhop,
and claims more power then they can allow, more then they
think is due, as of a negative voice? Or, Is it the want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching
Elders in the Meeting? As to the, 1. Are they able
to ſhew that every eccleſiaſtical Meeting or Judicatory hath, by
a dvine ſcriptural Right, a priviledge to chooſe their own Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator?
Where is there any Precept for this? or any example of
ſuch election in Scripture? If all Meetings of eccleſiaſtical
Judicatories have this priviledge, then alſo their Seſſions
(where they take upon them to be conſtant Moderators) have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99668:6"/>
this alſo, which, belike, will not pleaſe them well, that any of
the Meeting but themſelves ſhould be choſen there to preſide;
or, can they ſay, that every eccleſiaſtical Meeting or Judicatory,
hath this priviledge by a divine natural right? If ſo, no civill
Society or Judicatory ſhould want it; but all claim power to
chooſe their own Preſidents, which were evil doctrine under a
Monarchy, where power is in the Prince to elect and name Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
for Council, Seſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, are they able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
that it is not lawful for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, upon
whom the external ordering of all the Judicatories in his His
Dominions depends, to nominate out of a Meeting of Miniſters,
conveen'd by him, one grave and godly Miniſter of the number,
to order the actions of the Meeting, and by his Authority to
controll the unruly? Can it be made evident, that the ancient
Chriſtian Councils, general or provincial, (though they had
eccleſiaſtick Preſidents) did alwayes formerly chooſe their own
Preſident? <hi>Preſides eccleſiaſtici in vetuſtis Conciliis, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunquam
nominati ab Imperatore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zepperus,</hi> Eccleſ.
Pol. p. 742,</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, The great exception is at the power of
the Preſidents of the Synods, they being Biſhops, claim in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
power as if Authority ſolely reſided in them, at leaſt they
claim a negative voice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Were it ſo, and were this a fault; yet, it were not
their fault who concur: the perſonal fault of another cannot be
any good ground for Brethrens withdrawing from their neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty, eſpecially it being conſidered what might be allowed
them, for eaſing the ſcruple of their Conſcience, as was above
ſaid. If I be only admitted to conſult in regulating the affairs
of the Church, in a Meeting where I think I ſhould have equal
authority with any that ſits there, Can it be ſin in me to go ſo
far in my duty, as I am permitted to do, to teſtifie againſt ſin,
to give my beſt counſel for ſuppreſſing thereof, and for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of holineſs? If I be abridged and reſtrain'd as to that
authority, which I think is due to me, it is the ſin (if there be
any) of theſe who do reſtrain me and not mine; ſhall I do no
part of my duty, becauſe I cannot do all that I think I ought to
do, being, as to ſome part of it, reſtrain'd by another?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99668:6"/>
But Secondly, Is it not granted by moſt judicious Divines,
that Presbyters (having a power in ſeveral caſes to ſuſpend the
exerciſe of their own juſt authority, when the ſuſpenſion of it
tenderh to a publick good) may for the peace of the Church,
reſolve to give to one perſon of their number a negative voice
in Government, ſo as to do nothing without him? <hi>Baxt.</hi>
Church gover. <hi>pag.</hi> 18. And excellent Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> (when at
the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> the King could not be brought off that, that
in Meetings of Presbyters there ſhould be one, under the name
of Biſhop, with a negative voice) did counſel both <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and <hi>Independents</hi> to accept of the conceſſion, as they would
not have all the blood, miſeries and confuſions that after might
enſue, laid at their door. See his conſiderations on the Kings
Conceſſions. Whatever may be ſaid of that <hi>negative voice;</hi>
the law of the land putting Biſhops into a ſtated preſidency, and
yet Presbyters being admitted to rule with Biſhops, judicious
and ſober men would not lay ſo great weight on it, as to refuſe
their concurrence in common and uncontroverted duties upon
that account. But yet, one thing would be remembred, that
Brethren are at a very clear diſadvantage in withdrawing from
presbyterial Meetings, where they know the Moderator doth
not, nor can claim more power then any of themſelves. All
the ground of their not concurring with theſe Meetings, muſt
be, that they do not chooſe the Moderator in their particular
Presbyteries: But he is nominate by the Biſhop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod;
and yet, in all reaſon, the authority and conſent of Biſhop
and Synod, ſhould conclude any particular Presbytery. Do
not Brethren remember, that in time of the Commiſſion of
the Kirks ruling, there were reſtraints laid upon Presbyteries
in matters far higher and weightier concernment then that, and
little dinn about the ſame?</p>
            <p>But thirdly, if the Brethren refuſe to concur with the Synods
for want of unpreaching Elders there, whoſe Office they account
of divine inſtitution, they would remember, that great Divines
of the presbyterian way, <hi>Blondel, Vines, Baxter,</hi> and many
others look upon theſe as an humane device (and their reaſons
moving them, are weighty.) But let them be as they are
imagin'd by the Brethren; yet, can the removal of theſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99668:7"/>
out their fault, render it unlawful for them to concur in a
Synod of Miniſters where theſe are not? Can the abſence, or
removal of theſe (ſuppoſed) Church-officers, render a Synod of
Miniſters, with their Preſident, unlawful and not to be joyned
with? becauſe other men are debarred from their duty (they
are ſuppoſed to have right to) ſhall we run from our duty,
eſpecially this being done without our fault?</p>
            <p>A fourth thing the Brethren would conſider anent their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
to concur in Synods and Presbyteries, before it was hinted
at, and it is this. They have, for many years, concurred in
doing common duties in Presbyteries and Synods, with theſe,
whom they looked upon as fixing a ſinful ſchiſme (as the other,
they charged them with apoſtaſic from former principles) yet,
with theſe they concurred in common duties, ſo far as they
could get their concurrence, and complained of their ſeparating
way when they refuſed. And were they not bound againſt
ſchiſm and the makers of it, by the Covenant and Word of
God too, as againſt any thing elſe that is now made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of ſeparation from the Judicatories?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Brethren would conſider, if in this their preſent
practice, they do not fall ſhort of the moderation and wiſdom
of their worthy Anceſtors, with whom they pretend to be of
of the ſame judgment, who chooſed rather to concur with ſuch
Meetings as theſe (though not ſatisfied with their conſtitution)
in governing the Church, and doing unqueſtionable duties,
then altogether to deſert them, or make a ſchime and ruin the
peace of the Church. Some ſay to this, they were but men,
and erred in ſo doing; but they are not angels that ſay ſo, nor
without danger of erring; they were men of conſcience and
learning, and more unlike to have erred in this their way, then
theſe who ſay they erred and prove it not. Some alledge a
diſparity between the caſe of Miniſters then and now, upon the
account of clearer engagements againſt Epiſcopacy by Miniſters
now, then by them who lived in theſe times, and upon the
account of the ſtanding of Synods at the time when Biſhops
were brought in upon them, in our Anceſtors dayes; whereas
now they were not ſtanding, when Biſhops are brought in but
raiſed, and ſit now as holding and depending upon Epiſcopacy.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99668:7"/>
It ſhall not be denyed there is ſome diſparity and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the caſe of Miniſters now and then, <hi>ſimile non eſt idem;</hi>
but any difference that is obſerved, is impertinent and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
to this purpoſe, to make the concurrence in theſe Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
now, to be unlawfull, which was to our Anceſtors lawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For, as to the former ground of diſparity, it is certain, Miniſters
then accounted themſelves as really bound againſt the allowance
of epiſcopal Government, both by the Covenant and by the
Word of God, as any do judge themſelves engaged againſt it by
late Bonds: whether they did miſtake in this or nor, we ſay
nothing; but, that they did ſo judge, it is out of queſtion; and
yet, they thought their practice, in concurring in all lawfull
matters in Synods and Presbyteries, conſiſtent enough with their
judgment, touching Epiſcopacy and their Bonds againſt it. And
as to the latter of theſe differences, it can be nothing material, as
the rendring concurrence with Synods and Presbyteries now,
unlawfull, which then might be lawfull: For, the Meetings now
and then are of the ſame conſtitution, nothing altered. Nor
is there any thing in theſe Meetings to affright from concurrence
in them now, more then at that time; nor any more holding of,
or dependency on Biſhops now, when the King's Majeſty hath
taken off the reſtraint which for a time He put on, then if He
had not at all reſtrained them, neither any more then was of
theſe Synods and Presbyteries, which of old did ſit when Biſhops
were brought in upon them. Neither is it likely, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
who now refuſe concurrence, would have given it, had their
Judicatories not been reſtrained from meeting. This ſeems a
very bare pretext.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Brethren would conſider well, if in refuſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with their Brethren in undoubted duties (where they may
ſalve their conſciences by humble, modeſt expreſſing what they
judge amiſs) they do not run themſelves either upon the rock
of eccleſiaſtical Independency, in their ſeveral Congregations, in
adminiſtration of Diſcipline, (if they mind to have any Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
at all) or, to combine in clandeſtine Presbyteries of their
own, which they may conſider how either it ſhall be taken by
the chriſtian Magiſtrate, or how it ſhall relliſh of that ſpirit of
unity and love that ſhould be amongſt Chriſt's Miniſters; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99668:8"/>
whereaway in end this principle of diviſion from their Brethren,
in unqueſtioned duties, may lead them; whether to divide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
from their Brethren in the worſhip of God, and to teach
people ſo to do, (ſomewhat of this is already ſeen) and to
endeavour the fixing of a perpetual ſchiſme, the ſeeds whereof
are ſown with too much animoſity.</p>
            <p>4. Now cometh to be conſidered, the caſe of ſuch Brethren
of the Miniſtry as chooſe rather to quit their Miniſtry then once
come in termes with theſe, upon whom the Law hath ſettled
a power, to order them in the exerciſe of the ſame. It would
be moſt ſeriouſly thought of, whether it be right, that any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of Chriſt ſhould ſet their Miniſtry, the ſervice of God,
the benefit which the Lord's people might have by their good
gifts, (to ſay nothing of the intereſt of their families) at ſo
low a rate, as not to have uſed all lawfull means (trying at leaſt
upon what termes they might enjoy their Miniſtry) before
they had fallen upon that extremity to deſert it. If any man
will ſay, it is no lawfull mean to ſpeak with a Biſhop in that
matter, though it might tend to his continuance in the Miniſtry
(and perhaps might be, in ſome meaſure, diſappointed in his
fears) he had need to examine well, whether conceit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ruleth moſt there; and to think of it, how he can juſtify
the deſerting of his Miniſtry, without the utmoſt eſſay to hold
it. It muſt be confeſſed, that it is a new and rare Caſe, that
men will rather embrace ſuffering then once ſpeak one word to
perſons intruſted with power, by the Law of the Land, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they be) to try at them, upon what termes they might
be permitted to preach the Goſpel. The comfort (it is to be
feared) of ſuffering, upon ſuch an account, will not run very
clear. But, it will be ſaid, the thing that is ſtuck at, is <hi>the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Oath,</hi> enjoyned by Law, and which the Biſhops will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
this, ſome ſay, they cannot take, conceiving it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the Covenant and to the Word of God. But, 1. Such
as have not ſo much as come in termes with the Biſhops, and
of whom that Oath, or Promiſe, hath not been particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
ſeem to leap too ſoon to ſuffering, before it come to them:
and before they had tryed, if poſſibly there might have been
relevant grounds for diſpenſing with the Law towards them.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99668:8"/>
Had they been perſonally put to take that Oath; and if ſo, there
could be no diſpenſing with them, nor they able to digeſt that
Oath, then they had more clearneſs in their undergoing ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
2. As to contradiction to the Covenant, if <hi>Timorcus</hi>
(pag. 37.) may be believed (and he ſeems tender in the matter
of others) there is no contradiction between the canonical Oath
and the Covenant; he maintains, that the Miniſters, who of
old took the canonical Oath, did not ſwear the contradictory
thereto when they took the Covenant: whence it will follow
neceſſarily, that they who have taken the Covenant do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
that Oath, if they ſhould take the Oath of canonical
Obedience: and indeed it will be hard to find out a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
either in termes, or by neceſſary conſequence. But, if
the obligation of the Covenant, as to that ſecond article, ſhall
be found to ceaſe, (whereof afterward) the lawfulneſs of the
other Oath will be clearer. 3. It would be conſidered, that
the Reverened Perſons, intruſted by Law to call for that Promiſe
from Miniſters, do not ſearch into mens apprehenſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the grounds of their power; all they ſeek, is obedience to
them in things lawfull and honeſt, as being preſently in power,
being, by Law, ordinary Overſeers of the Miniſtry in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and chief Ordainers of them who enter into the Miniſtry.
But, it is ſaid, where obedience is promiſed, there is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of the lawfulneſs of their Power, Office and Authority;
becauſe, obedience formally cannot be but to a lawfull Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
therefore, he that in his conſcience thinketh a Biſhops
Office unlawfull, cannot ſo much as promiſe obedience to him
in things lawfull and honeſt, leſt, by his taking ſuch an Oath,
he make himſelf guilty of eſtabliſhing that which he accounts
unlawfull. But, 1. it is not obedience under a reduplication,
and as formally obedience, they call for; if it be obedience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially,
Miniſters doing their duties in things really lawfull,
they are ſatisfied. 2. Suppoſe it were ſo, that obedience, as
formally obedience, were required; yet, it were hard to ſay, it
could not be promiſed, or that it could not be acknowledged,
that they have any lawfull Authority: for, waving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of any eccleſiaſtical Office, wherein they may pretend
to be ſuperiour to other Miniſters; and giving (but not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99668:9"/>
that as Church-miniſters, their Office and ſuperiority were
unlawful; yet, looking upon them as the Kings Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
in Cauſes eccleſiaſtical for regulating the external or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Church in their ſeveral bounds, and impowred by the
law of the land ſo to do (they being alſo Presbyters, and having
power with others in Ordination and Jurisdiction eccleſiaſtical)
it will be hard to ſay, that their power is not lawfull, and that
obedience is not due to them. The ſtricteſt <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> will
not find ground to diſown their Office in that conſideration.</p>
            <p>There are three things mainly, which bear off Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of both theſe ſorts and ranks, from ſubmitting to, and
concurring in their duties under the preſent Government,
1. Their fears of future evils. 2. Their preſent thoughts of the
unlawfulneſs of the Office of a Biſhop over Presbyters in the
Church. 3. Their former Engagements by the bond of the
Covenant, which they conceive ſtill binds them. As to the
firſt, their fears; there can be no ſufficient ground in theſe to
bear them off from that, which, for the preſent, is found to be
their duty: If evils feared, ſhould come, and Brethren, in
conſcience toward God, not able to comply with them, then
ſuffering might be the more comfortable; but the gracious
providence of God, watching over his Church, the goodneſs and
wiſdom of our Soveraign, and of Rulers under him (conſidering
the temper of this Nation) may make all theſe fears vain, and
diſappoint them; and it is not for us to be too thoughtful, or
to torment our ſelves with fears, before the time. In the
mean time, it would be well conſidered by Brethren, that bear
off from concurrence, if they do well in withdrawing their
counſels from their Brethren, and in doing that which tendeth
to the loſs of their entereſt in, and reſpect with perſons in preſent
Authority; in regard whereof, they might be exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
to prevent any thing that is feared. 2. As to their
thoughts of the unlawfulneſs of the Office of a Biſhop, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hath been ſaid of the lawfulneſs of their concurrence in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtion'd
duties (even upon that ſuppoſition) ſomething alſo
hath been ſaid of the acknowledgment of the lawfulneſs of their
Office, looking upon them as Presbyters, commiſſionated by
the King, for external ordering of Church-affairs in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99668:9"/>
bounds; and of the lawfulneſs of obedience to them, as in
that capacity. It is not the purpoſe of this Paper, to diſpute
much for their Church-capacity or Rule over Presbyters, or
anent the Office of Biſhops, as an order of Church-miniſters.
Only as to this, three things would be ſeriouſly pondred by
Brethren. 1. Where they are able to find in all Chriſts Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
any precept for meer Presbyters, preaching and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching,
in a full equality of power, to rule the Church of
Chriſt; to give Ordination to Miniſters, to judge in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
of Religion miniſterially, and do all acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church, or where they can find any example of
ſuch a Presbytery, doing theſe acts without ſome ſuperiour
Officer acting with them, or directing them in their actings, or
where there is any inhibition (either expreſſe, or by neceſſary
conſequence) that no Goſpel-miniſter ſhould in any caſe have
ſuperiority in power over others in Church-affairs. 2. Let it
be conſidered, if (deſcending from the Scripture times) it can
be found in any Writer, who lived in the firſt two or three ages
after Chriſt, or in any Hiſtory or Record relating to theſe times
(not to ſpeak of after-ages) it can be found, that there was
any ſuch Church-officer as an unpreaching Elder, joyned in
full equality of power with Preaching-elders in acts of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Miniſters (from which, if they be neceſſary parts and
members of the Presbytery, they cannot be excluded) and in
all other acts of Jurisdiction; or, if there be any mention of
the names, or power of any ſuch perſons. Or, if it can be
from theſe Writers found, that there was ever any Ordination
of Miniſters, or exerciſe of Jurisdiction eccleſiaſtical by Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<hi>i. e.</hi> by meer Preaching-presbyters, without ſome one,
ſtated Preſident over them, under the name of Biſhop, who was
to go before them in theſe actions; and without whom, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was to be done in theſe. Shall not the practice of that
primitive Church, which followed the Apoſtles, as it were, at
the heels, be moſt able to ſhew us which way they went, and
what was their practice? It is too horrid a thing to imagine,
and that which a modeſt Chriſtian can hardly down with, that
immediately, after the Apoſtles times, the whole Church of
Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t, ſhould agree to ſo ſubſtantial an alteration of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99668:10"/>
Government of the Church (ſuppoſ'd to be) inſtituted by
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as to exclude one ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t of Officers of his
appointment, and to take in another not appointed by him:
And that it ſhould be done ſo early, <hi>Statim poſt tempora Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolorum,
aut eorum etiam tempore,</hi> ſaith <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> Epiſt.
3. <hi>ad Epiſcop. Winton.</hi> Biſhops were ſet up in the time,
when ſome of them (eſpecially <hi>John</hi>) were living, <hi>viventibus,
videntibus, &amp; non contradicentibus;</hi> as is manifeſt by Hiſtory
in the ſucceſſors of <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and others. Can it
be imagin'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch a thing as the Office of a Biſhop, ſhould
have been ſet up ſo early in the times of the Apoſtles, and they
not contradicting it, had it been contrary to Chriſts mind?
How unlikely is it, that in thoſe times, when the piety and
zeal of Chriſtians was ſo great, and knowledge too, there
ſhould have been no oppoſition to the Office of Biſhops, had it
been judged a wronging of Chriſts Ordinance? How unlikely
is it, that in times of ſuch fiery perſecution, Chriſts Miniſters
ſhould be carryed with ambition, to ſeek the ſuperiority
over others in an Office againſt his mind? Or, that people
would have yielded to the ambitious courſes of Paſtors? How
can it be thought, that the whole Church in theſe times (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any known exception) ſhould have taken up that way of
Government by Biſhops, without any co-action to it by civil
Power; without any advice or direction from General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Councils, which then were not in being; If this way
had not been univerſally judged lawfull; yea, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd
deſcending from a higher warrant then voluntary agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men? We do never hear of any oppoſition to the
Office and dignity of a Biſhop over Presbyters, till it was
made by one <hi>Aerius</hi> in the fourth age, (whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
calleth a frantick man) he being enraged, that <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> whom
he undervalued in compariſon of himſelf, was preferred to him,
and got the Biſhoprick, which he ambitiouſly aimed at, began
to talk againſt the dignity and order of Biſhops, and is therefore
counted by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (no children in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
an heretick, (in whatever ſenſe they mean) and alſo he
is juſtly cenſured and condemned by <hi>Blondel, Gerſ. Bucer, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linaeus</hi>
to <hi>Andrews,</hi> as a diſturber of a lawful order in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99668:10"/>
Church, albeit they cannot come up to think, that Epiſcopacy
is a divine Inſtitution or apoſtolicall.</p>
            <p>Now, let Brethren in modeſty conſider, how unlike it is, that
the Office of a Biſhop ſhould be contrary to the inſtitution of
Chriſt in his Word, that began ſo early, even in the Apoſtles
times without their contradiction, that was ſo univerſally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to by the primitive Chriſtians in their moſt firy tryals, that
hath continued in the chriſtian Churches, (not only theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Roman apoſtaſie, but the eaſtern Church that
diſclaimeth the Popes ſupremacy) and that for 1500. years
after Chriſt, without any contradiction, ſave of one man, who
never had a marrow; no not <hi>Jerome</hi> (whatever be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him by ſome) that is ſtill owned by moſt of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, who have rejected the Pope, not only by theſe
of the Lutheran way, under the name of Superintendents (<hi>quid
eſt Epiſcopus niſi Superintendens?</hi> ſaith <hi>Jerom, epiſt, ad Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum</hi>)
but alſo by ſome of the Calvinean way, as may be ſeen
by <hi>Zepperus,</hi> Eccleſ. Pol. And formally, that is even owned as
lawfull (being well-moderated) by the ſtouteſt Diſputers againſt
the divine right of it. Albeit men, in their paſſionat ſtrains to
popular auditories, ſometimes cry out upon the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
as an anti-chriſtian and popiſh domination; yet, in the
proteſtant Epiſcopacy that is owned, there is no more of the
Pope then there is of a Maſs-prieſt in a Miniſter; or of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
of Cardinal-presbyters in a Commiſſion of the Church
or a Presbytery. The Epiſcopacy that is now, is the very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Epiſcopacy, which <hi>Timorcus</hi> deſcriving (<hi>Ep.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 25.)
affirmeth to be, that nothing in Ordination or Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
be done by Brethren under the Biſhop, without him,
and he alone doing nothing without them in theſe, and avowes
the ſame not to be contrary to the Covenant. The Epiſcopacy
that now is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that ſame Office for ſubſtance, which <hi>Ignatius</hi>
had at <hi>Antioch, Polycarp</hi> at <hi>Smyrna, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine</hi> and many others had after: and it
ſhould be our deſire to God, that our Biſhops (as they hold the
ſame Office and Place, for ſubſtance, theſe did) ſo they may imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99668:11"/>
their vertues and graces; and be notable Inſtruments for
advancing God's glory in their ſtations. But, 3. it would be
conſidered, that the holding of Epiſcopacy, as a Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
and contrary to the Word of God, will caſt too great an
imputation upon this Reformed Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> For, (lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſide the times of war and confuſion ſince the year, 1638.
wherein, in the midſt of the noiſe of Armes and Armies, there
hath been ſmall opportunity for a ſerious free diſquiſition anent
theſe matters) it will be found, that before that year, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
had been for a far longer time owned by this Reformed
Church then Presbytery had been: For, untill the year, 1580.
Epiſcopacy was not aboliſhed in <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Office of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
was really uſed in <hi>Scotland</hi> till the year, 1580. in which
the General Aſſembly at <hi>Dundee</hi> declared it unlawfull: and
yet, they could not get their Presbyteries ſet up by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Land, till twelve years after in the year, 1592. But,
evident it is, that at the time of making that Act at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
Biſhops were in the Land (for ſo the Act it ſelf, in the
body of it, imports) <hi>Foraſmuch</hi> (ſay they) <hi>as the Office of
Biſhop is now uſed in this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. And is clear alſo from
their Order they give to proceſs the ſeveral Biſhops, if they lay
not down their Office. Now, from the time of general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
from Popery to the time of that Act of <hi>Dundee,</hi>
there were full twenty years; (the Reformation being in the
year, 1560.) during all which time, the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>
was governed by ſome, <hi>ſingulares perſonae,</hi> particular perſons in
ſeveral circuits in the Land; ſome under the name of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents,
Commiſſioners or Viſitors of Countries; ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Biſhops; where popiſh Biſhops embraced the
Reformation, they had their power continued, and Commiſſion
given to them for ordaining Miniſters and uſing Juriſdiction:
and when the civil Magiſtrate preſented any Orthodox to vacant
Biſhopricks, they were accepted of by the Aſſembly, <hi>Edinburgh,
Aug.</hi> 6. 1573. where the Regent, promiſing to the Aſſembly
that qualified perſons ſhall be preſented to vacant Biſhopricks,
the Aſſembly concludes, that the juriſdiction of Biſhops in their
eccleſiaſtical Function, ſhall not exceed the juriſdiction of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents.
And the Superintendent of <hi>Lothian,</hi> is called
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99668:11"/>
by <hi>John Knox,</hi> at his inſtalling, <hi>anno,</hi> 1560. the <hi>Paſtor</hi> of the
Churches of <hi>Lothian;</hi> and theſe, who repreſent that Countrey,
promiſe to give obedience to him as becomes the ſheep to their
Paſtor. It is manifeſt then, that for twenty years after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
Biſhops, whether under that name, or other names,
continued in <hi>Scotland:</hi> and it is remarkable, that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
were wiſer men then to put a <hi>Presbytery</hi> in their Creed:
For, in the Confeſſion regiſtrated in Parliament, <hi>anno,</hi> 1567. (which
before had been preſented) though they had zeal enough againſt
all things that favoured of popery; yet, in their Confeſſion,
there is nothing againſt Biſhops, nor for a Presbytery. And,
Act 24. the former civil priviledges of the ſpiritual State of the
Realm are ratified; accordingly, Biſhops did ſit in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
alſo, in the ſame Confeſſion, they ſay, not one Policy
or Order can be for all Churches and all times. But, after the
year, 1580. wherein the Office of Biſhops was abrogated by
the Aſſembly, albeit ſome provincial Synods were ſet up in the
place of the outed Biſhops and Superintendents in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces;
yet, was there no Presbytery before the year, 1586. nor
any of theſe Judicatories legally eſtabliſhed before, 1592. and
within eighteen years after that, or twenty, Biſhops are ſet
up again by the Act of Aſſembly, 1610. and ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1612. and continued ſo the ſpace of twenty eight years,
till the Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 1638. So it may be eaſily ſeen,
the Office of a Biſhop is no great ſtranger to this Church, ſince
the Reformation of Religion; but hath been longer owned
then Presbytery in times of peace: and, modeſty would require,
we ſhould not be ready to condemn this Reformed Church, as
having in thoſe times owned a Government unlawfull and againſt
the Word of God, eſpecially when the different fruits of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by <hi>Presbytery</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> have been, to our coſt,
ſadly experienced.</p>
            <p>But now, we come to the third difficulty anent the Oath of
the Covenant: This is popularly pleaded by ſuch as do not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
into the controverſie anent the Office of a Biſhop, in
point of lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs. Indeed, the Bond of a
lawfull Covenant is ſo ſacred a tye, that, without contempt of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99668:12"/>
the holy majeſty of God, it cannot be violated, nor without
great ſin; no creature can abſolve us from it, nor diſpenſe with
it; nor are we to break it for any temporal advantage, terror
or trouble. Yet, (ſuppoſing the Covenant to be lawfull, which
is not proven) it is ſure, 1. That a lawfull Oath may ceaſe to bind
us, ſo that though we do not that which was under Oath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to be done; yet, there is no perjury: <hi>Semper perjurus eſt,
qui non intendit quod promittit; non ſemper perjurus eſt, qui
non perficit q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od promiſit ſub Juramento,</hi> ſay the Caſuiſts.
2. It is certain that a lawfull, although in the interpretation of
it, it be <hi>ſtricti juris,</hi> and is to be underſtood according to the
intention of the givers of it, and as the plain words bear; yet,
it bindeth not in the ſenſe which any ignorant mind or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrupulous
conſcience may put upon it, or that ſome perſons,
upon partial deſignes, may put upon it, <hi>Videndum eſt</hi> (ſay
Caſuiſts) <hi>ne ſtricta interpretatio abeat in nimis ſtrictam &amp;
rigidam.</hi> 3. It is certain, an unlawfull Oath did never, nor
doth bind any conſcience to do according to it, though it bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to repentance for making of it, and adhering to it.</p>
            <p>In conſidering and applying theſe things: as to the firſt, It
would be remembred, that an Oath, howſoever in it ſelf lawfull;
yet the caſe may be ſuch, that by ſomething following after it,
the Oath may ceaſe to bind us to the performing of what was
ſworn; yea, the caſe may be, that an Oath, lawfully made,
yet cannot be lawfully kept; it were ſin to keep it in ſome
caſes: then, and in that caſe, it is not we that looſe our ſelves,
but God looſeth us, when an Oath, lawfull at the making, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be kept without ſin againſt him. Amongſt other caſes,
wherein the ceaſing of an obligation of a lawfull Oath may be
ſeen, theſe three Caſes are worthy to be conſidered; and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
is it to be pondred whether they be applicable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Queſtion anent a diſcharge from the bond of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as to the ſecond Article of it, which is now under queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
1. If the matter of an Oath be ſuch, as a Superiour hath
it in his power to determine of it, the Oath of the inferiour or
ſubject perſon ceaſeth to oblige him, and is looſed when the
Superiour conſents not to what he hath ſworn: this is both
agreeable to reaſon; becauſe no deed of a perſon inferiour or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99668:12"/>
ſubject to others, ſhould prejudge the right of the Superiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor take from him any power allowed to him by God in any
thing: And alſo, all ſound Divines do acknowledge this upon
the common equity of that law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 4. If it be ſaid,
that the matter of the ſecond Article of the Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nant, being
not of indifferent nature, but determined by the Word of God,
and ſo not under the power of a Superiour on earth to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in it; it would be remembred, that in all this part of the
diſcourſe, where the ceaſing of the obligation of the Covenant
is ſpoken of (as to the ſecond Article) they are dealt with, who
plead the obligation of the Covenant only, and upon that
account do ſcruple. As for the conſideration of the lawfulneſs
or unlawfulneſs of Epiſcopacy in it ſelf, a little of it was ſpoken
to before; and the tryall of that, is matter for longer diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
and men would not be too peremptory in condemning
Epiſcopacy, if they ſeriouſly conſider, that the ableſt Pens that
ever engaged in this Controverſie, have found it a task too hard
for them to demonſtrate Epiſcopacy to be in it ſelf unlawfull:
and if we ask the judgments of the moſt eminent reformed
Divines, we ſhall find very few or none learned, ſober and
faithfull in the point, who do judge it to be forbidden by God.
But in this point, when theſe who alledge the bond of the
Covenant only for their ſcruple, there is a neceſſity to abſtract
from that queſtion, whether Presbytery be neceſſary by divine
law, and Epiſcopacy in it ſelf unlawfull? In this part of the
diſcourſe (ſuppoſing the lawfulneſs or indifferency of it) we
only enquire, whether meerly by vertue of the Covenant, we
are bound to ſtand againſt it? If by Gods Word it be found
to be unlawfull (which cannot be proved) then whether there
had been a Covenant made againſt it, or not, it cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?
If it be ſaid again, that the conſent of our Superiour hath
been obtained to that, to which we have determin'd our ſelves
by our Oath in the ſecond Article; and therefore our Oath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, is confirmed, and he hath not power to revoke his
conſent, according to that law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 14. It would be
be conſidered, whether it was the Lords mind in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aw, that
if children or wives, having vowed, ſhould by ſome means
drive their parents or husbands out of the houſe, deprived them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99668:13"/>
of all their worldly comforts; and then, when they had put
them thus undurifully under ſad tentations, bargain with
them either to ratifie their vows, or never to enjoy theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
they had deprived them of; whether it was the Lords
mind, that conſent, ſo obtain'd, ſhould be an irrevocable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of their vows, who had carryed themſelves ſo undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully?
There is no evidence for that. And the application is
eaſie, ſince it is known that the Covenant was contrived and
carryed on, as if the deſign had been laid to extirpate Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
whether the King would conſent or not, or whatever
courſe ſhould be taken to force his conſent, <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> or by
ſuſpending Him from the exerciſe of His royall Power; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd
way of uſage from ſubjects to their SOVERAIGN.
Again it would be conſidered, whether this be, <hi>De jure natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi>
that a conſent of a Superiour once given to the vow of an
inferiour, he hath no power to revoke his conſent upon reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
cauſes, and to make void the vow, albeit, if he do it raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unreaſonably, he ſinneth. Great Schollers are of the
mind, he may revoke his conſent: <hi>Leſſius,</hi> Tractat. <hi>de Voto,
dubio</hi> 13. It is thought by him and others, that the precept
<hi>eà<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enus</hi> is judicial, as it maketh an irrevocable confirmation of
the vow once conſented to. If it be further ſaid, if the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
under Oath, give his conſent to the inferiours Oath; or,
if He himſelf ſwear the ſame thing, then there is no power left
of revoking his conſent, or doing or putting his inferiours to do
contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to the Oath: This is granted, unleſſe upon ſome other
ground there be a clear looſing of the Superiours Oath, and a
ceaſing of the obligation of it. Leaving theſe things to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
let us look upon the ſecond Caſe, wherein the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and binding-power of an Oath ceaſeth, and the Oath is
looſ'd; it is this, When the matter concerning which the Oath
is, continueth not in the ſame ſtate it was in at the making of
the Oath, when ſomething in providence before the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of the Oath occurreth, that maketh the performance
of the Oath, either ſinfull, or importing ſome turpitude, and
ſomething againſt moral honeſty; or when the caſe comes to be
that, that the plain end and expectation of the Oath, upon which
it was founded, appeareth fruſtrate: according to the language
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99668:13"/>
of Divines, <hi>Res non permanet in eôdem ſtatu, ideò ceſſat Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenti
obligatio:</hi> For example, if a man ſwear, that at ſuch
a certain time, he ſhall deliver to ſuch a man his ſword, if in
the mean time that man turn mad, and, in probability, might
kill himſelf or others with the ſword, had he it in his hand,
there lyeth no obligation upon the ſwearer to deliver it to him;
Nay, it were a ſin, and againſt charity, to perform what he had
promiſed. Again, if a man ſwear to marry ſuch a woman at
ſuch a time, if before that time he is made certain ſhe is with
child to his own brother, it were a grievous ſin of inceſt to
to marry her (under pretence of keeping his promiſe;) Or, if
ſhe ſhould, before the marriage day, be found with child to
another man (not ſo related to him) yet, to marry her, as it
could not but have ſomething againſt moral common honeſty in
it; ſo the plain end and expectation of his Oath, on which it
was founded, being fruſtrate by the womans whoredome, (<hi>viz.</hi>
the having of a loyal honeſt and comfortable yoke-fellow) albeit
he had made twenty Oaths to her, they bind him not; God
hath looſ'd the man, <hi>Res non permanet in eodem ſtatu.</hi> Now,
as to the preſent Caſe of the Covenanters, let it be conſidered,
whether the matter abideth in that ſame ſtate, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether
there do not ſomething now occur, that putteth us in that
condition, that without ſin we cannot perform what we did
promiſe, in that ſecond Article of the Covenant. It will be
ſaid, What is the ſin? For anſwer, It muſt be ſtill ſuppoſ'd (as
before we admoniſhed) that in this part of the diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe who plead the bond of the Covenant meerly, that
the matter of the ſecond Article of the Covenant (about which
the debate is) is in it ſelf indifferent; and that Epiſcopacy in it
ſelf, or by any law of God, is not unlawfull, or prohibited.
If it were this way unlawfull there needed little queſtion be
made about the bond of the Covenant, (for, what is unlawfull,
muſt never be allowed, be it ſworn againſt or not) but, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the indifferency and lawfulneſs of Epiſcopacy in it ſelf,
I ſay the Covenant cannot now oblige againſt it, there being
ſo notable an alteration of the caſe and ſtate of matters, that
whoever now do think themſelves bound to ſtand to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
as to that ſecond Article (for there are other matters in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99668:14"/>
that Covenant, from which we can never be diſobliged or looſed,
they being neceſſary by divine and moral Law) do think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bound to a perpetual diſobedience to the Magiſtrate, in a
matter wherein he hath power to command them; and this is
a perpetual ſin. <hi>Perkins,</hi> of Oaths, ſaith well, <hi>No Oath can
bind againſt the wholſom Laws of the Common-wealth: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
every ſoul is ſubject to ſuperior powers,</hi> Rom. 13. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it material whether the Laws be made before or after
the Oath; both wayes the matter of the Oath becomes impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<hi>de jure,</hi> as Caſuiſts ſpeak: And now we are to think, the
matter remaineth not in the ſame ſtate, when the doing of
what we did ſwear, imports ſin.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>Timor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> (pag. 19.) ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>deth, that even upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that it is in the power of the Magiſtrate to ſet up the
epiſcopal form of Government, that yet we cannot own it, but
muſt ſuffer under it: becauſe (faith he) upon that ſuppoſition,
that the matter of the Oath, was <hi>res indifferens &amp; libera</hi> in it
ſelf; yet, it is no more free to us, <hi>Juramentum</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tell it
libertatem:</hi> But, by his favour, albeit in indifferent things of
private concernment, wherein private perſons bind themſelves,
and wherewith the Magiſtrate medleth not, an Oath may take
away our liberty; yet, a ſubjects Oath cannot take away the
power of the Magiſtrate, in commanding things which he ſeeth
for publick good, and the matters not being in themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull:
Neither can it take away or hinder the liberty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duty of ſubjects, in obeying what is lawfully commanded;
otherwiſe, ſubjects, by their Oaths, might find a way to plead
themſelves free from obedience to Magiſtrates in all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
which they ſhould command them; which is abſurd.
But, 3. It would be remembred, that when the keeping of an
Oath is certainly a hindrance of ſome greater good, (eſpecially
if other circumſtances concur, that render the Oath non-oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
the obligation of it, in ſome caſes, may ceaſe. This anent
the looſing of Oaths, becauſe of the obſtacle put to ſome greater
good, which might be attained by not doing what is ſworn, is
indeed a very tickliſh and tender queſtion, and all had need to
look to it, leſt, under pretence that the keeping of an Oath is an
obſtacle to a greater good attainable, by not keeping the Oath
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99668:14"/>
there be a wide gap opened to all perjury; and the popiſh
Caſuiſts are herein too lax for laying that ground, that it
is <hi>de jure naturali,</hi> that every one ſhould do that which is
beſt; they conclude, that where the performance of what is
ſworn is like to hinder a greater good that might be attained by
not keeping the Oath, that in that caſe an Oath bindeth not at
all. Proteſtant Caſuiſts, as Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> do deny this
principle without limitation thus expreſſed; yet do grant, that
it is true when there concurreth ſome other thing (as uſually
there doth) which may render the Oath void, or the keeping
of it unlawfull, or looſeth from it, the impeditiveneſs of greater
good there hath weight. But, we may ſay, albeit other things
did not concur to the nulling or voiding of an Oath; yet, if the
ſtanding to it be found impeditive of a greater good, to which
we are bound by a prior obligation, then the Oath, being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle
of ſuch a greater good, ceaſeth to bind the ſwearer. If a
man ſhould ſwear never to go near ſuch a river or water, having
once been in hazard there; yet, where he ſeeth at ſome diſtance
from it his brother like to periſh in the water, and it is probable
to him, that he could be able to ſave his life, the prior and greater
bond of char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, and of God's Law commanding, that bindeth
him to go help his brother, and looſeth him from his Oath. And
as to our caſe, beſides what hath been ſaid for the clearing, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other grounds, of the non-obligation of the Covenant in
that ſecond Article (the matter thereof ſtill ſuppoſed as indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and Epiſcopacy not forbidden by any divine Law) may
we not clearly ſee, that there is (by adhering to that Oath as
ſtill binding) an obſtacle put to the attainment of a greater
good and of greater neceſſity, and to the ſeeking after that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
good which we are pre-obliged, by former Bonds, to labour
after? Is not that great duty of preaching the Goſpel of
peace, lying upon Miniſters, (<hi>wo to us if we preach not</hi>) and
lying upon many Miniſters antecedently to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aking of this
Covenant; and upon adhering to that Covenant in the ſecond
Article, proveth a hindrance to that greater duty whereto we
are pre-obliged; ſhall it ſtill be thlought to bind ſo, that rather
then we will acknowledge God's looſing us by a former obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a greater duty, we will, by adhering to it, put our ſelves
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99668:15"/>
in incapacity (according to Law) to ſerve any longer in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry?
Do there not alſo ly upon us all pre-obligations to
obey the Magiſtrate in things not againſt God's Law, (ſuch as
now Epiſcopacy is ſuppoſed to be) to procure the publick
peace and good of Church and State, and prevent horrid confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which (as matters go) cannot be avoided by ſticking
at that Article in the Covenant? Shall not the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
that ſhall ariſe from tendring theſe great intereſts, be as
much, and more then any peace of conſcience pretended to be
in keeping the Oath, which (though we ſhould not be ready
to judge any) may perhaps, upon examination, be found rather
a piece of ſatisfaction to the will, then peace of the conſcience,
God having looſed and ſet free conſcience from that Bond, <hi>in
hoc rerum ſtatu?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to the ſecond thing which we obſerved anent Oaths, or
Covenants, it would be remembred, that a Covenant or Oath,
though lawfull and binding, even in the ſtrict interpretation of
it; yet, doth not bind in the rigid interpretation, which ſome,
either through weakneſs, or ſcruples or deſign, may put upon it.
Sometimes ſouls may make ſnares of Oaths to themſelves by
overſtretching them, and ſo do run themſelves into the perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they needed not. Concerning the Covenant, different inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
and ſenſes have been given of it, according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
intereſts of perſons of contrary judgments, combined in it. But,
as to the ſecond Article now in queſtion, it may be doubted, if it
be broken by ſubmiſſion to, or owning the preſent Epiſcopacy
eſtabliſhed by Law in <hi>Scotland;</hi> or, whether it be not an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigid
ſtraining of that Covenant, to bend it againſt the preſent
Epiſcopacy eſtabliſhed in <hi>Scotland.</hi> For clearing of which, it
would be conſidered, firſt, that at the time of the taking of that
<hi>ſolemn League and Covenant,</hi> there were no ſuch Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as are mentioned in that Article; there needed
not, as to <hi>Scotland,</hi> a ſwearing to extirpat Offices that were not
in it at that time; and ſome Offices there mentioned, never
were in it. 2. It would be remembred, that an Oath is to be
interpreted according to the ſenſe of the givers of it. <hi>Timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
(<hi>pag.</hi> 16.) giveth us aſſurance, that the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
intended nothing leſs in impoſing the Covenant, then the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99668:15"/>
extirpation of all kinds of Prelacy and Biſhops in the Church;
and that it was reſolved in Parliament, with conſent of the
Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it was only intended againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
as then eſtabliſhed in <hi>England:</hi> and (<hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f. p.</hi> 23.) we do
not (ſaith he) think the Covenant to be againſt the primitive
Epiſcopacy, which there he deſcrives to be a preſidency of one
Miniſter over others, ſo that without him nothing is to be done
in matters of Ordination and Jurisdiction: and when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
the ſecond Article of the Covenant, he ſaith, it is only
tyrannical Biſhops that are covenanted againſt: which <hi>Baxter</hi>
alſo calls the ſinfull <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Prelacy, in his Preface to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
of Church-government; which he ſayes was abjured
only, and not Epiſcopacy. And in that ſame diſpute (<hi>pag.</hi> 4.)
he declareth, that moſt of the godly Miniſters, ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
did judge Epiſcopacy, ſome of them, lawfull, and ſome
of them moſt fit; and addeth, that almoſt all of theſe that are
of the late <hi>Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and moſt throughout the Land,
did conform to Epiſcopal Government, as not contrary to the
Word of God; and that he believs, that many of them are yet
ſo far reconciliable to it, (moderated) that if it were only eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
they would ſubmit to it as they did: for, he heareth (as
he ſaith) but of few of them who have made recantation of
their former conformity; and contrarily, hath known divers of
them profeſſing a reconciliableneſs, as aforeſaid, as Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
doth, in one of his Books, profeſs his judgment. Thus Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Baxter,</hi> by whom we may ſee their error or folly, who think
there can be no godly Miniſters owning Epiſcopacy; and alſo
how reconciliable godly Divines in the <hi>Aſſ.</hi> were to a regulated
Epiſcopacy; So that it ſeemeth, the great grievance aim'd at
in the Covenant to be redreſſed, was, the Biſhops claim of a ſole
Ordination and Juriſdiction; and the multitudes of Courts of
lay Chancellors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet over Miniſters in matters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not the Office of Biſhops, concurring with Synods
of Miniſters and their preſiding and being Superiors in Church-meetings.
If it be ſaid, that every one of the particular Offices,
mentioned under the name of Prelacy in the Covenant, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured;
and therefore Biſhops are abjured: Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> in his
Conſiderations upon the Kings Conceſſions at the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:99668:16"/>
will (for looſing this) tell us of a ſenſe of the Covenant,
which he inclines to, <hi>viz.</hi> that, as to that Article, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is not to be underſtood <hi>in ſenſu diviſô,</hi> but <hi>compoſitô,</hi>
(which ſureth to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> complex frame) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
aſſerts, that continuing of Biſhops with a negative voice in
Ordination and miniſterial Meetings, might be permitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breach of Covenant. And if it be ſo, as this learned man
and others mention'd, concede, What reaſon is there to bend
the Covenant againſt the preſent Epiſcopacy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
is eſtabliſh'd to govern the Church (not excluding,) but with
conſent of Presbyters, with as great moderation as any was in
the primitive Epiſcopacy. But it will be ſaid, then we ſtand
bound againſt the Engliſh Prelacy, as it is explained in the
Covenant. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It will be time to diſpute that, when we
are called to live under that frame of Prelacy: In the mean time
let it be granted, that the Church eſtabliſhment amongſt us, is
not that which the Covenant deſcribeth to be renounced:
neither are we raſhly to judge the way of other Churches,
which we are not called to own; they are to give an account of
their own way to God and the King, and will allow us a diſcharge
from meddling in their affairs; and they are not like in haſt,
to give us any place or calling in modelling their Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to which all proteſtant Churches ought to pay reverence.</p>
            <p>But again, it will be ſaid, was not the form of Epiſcopacy
that was in <hi>Scotland</hi> before (from which the preſent is nothing
different) abjured in the National Covenant, before we had
any dealing with <hi>England</hi> anent change of their Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Anſ.</hi> If we will believe the Miniſters who reaſon'd with
the Doctors of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> (and they were the prime promoters of
the Covenant, and carried with them the ſenſe of the body of
the Covenanters) they who ſubſcribed that Covenant, might,
with great liberty, voice in an Aſſembly, concerning Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
without prejudice, notwithſtanding their Oath: And upon
this ground, would perſwade the Doctors to ſubſcribe the
Covenant, becauſe in ſo doing they ſhould not be taken as
abjuring Epiſcopacy (as the Doctors thought) But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their Oath and ſubſcription, had their liberty remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entire to voice for Epiſcopacy in an Aſſembly: See their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99668:16"/>
anſwer to the Doctors their fourth and tenth demands. And
the truth is, that as in the explication added, <hi>anno.</hi> 1638.
Epiſcopacy is not mentioned as abjured; ſo neither was it
abjured by the National Covenant as it was enjoyn'd to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
<hi>anno.</hi> 1580. It is alledged, that under the name of
the Popes wicked Hierarchy, the Office of Epiſcopacy was
abjured; But they who ſay ſo, would conſider, that the abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Popes wicked Hierarchy, imports not an abjuration
of the Office of a Biſhop, more then the Office of a Presbyter
or a Deacon, which are parts of that Hierarchy (ſo called by
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Canon. Seſſ. 7.) as well as the Office of a
Biſhop. If the Covenant do not under that expreſſion abjure
theſe Offices, neither doth it abjure the Office of a Biſhop,
ſeing theſe are parts of that which the Papiſts call Hierarchy,
as well as this. The intent of that Covenant, was not to
abjure the Office of Biſhops, more then of Presbyters or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
but to abjure the Hierarchy, ſo far as it was the Popes,
(his wicked Hierarchy) as it alſo abjureth his five baſtard ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſo far as he maketh them Sacraments, (for ſure, Orders
or Ordination of Miniſters and Marriage, which he maketh two
Sacraments, are not abjured in the Covenant as to the matter of
them, but only as to the relation of being Sacraments, which
the Pope puts on them) even ſo the Popes Hierarchy is abjured,
counted and called wicked, not as to the matter of theſe Offices
comprehended under the eccleſiaſtical word <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> (for
then the Office of Presbyters and Deacons, ſhould be alſo
counted wicked and abjured) but as to the dependance of all
theſe Offices on him, as the fountain and head of the Church
under Chriſt, and the corruption adhereing to theſe Offices,
and flowing from him, ſo far as they are his, depending on him,
corrupted by him, there is wickedneſs in them or joyn'd to
them, and ſo they are abjured (as in another word of that
Covenant, his blaſphemous Prieſt-hood is abjured, yet in that
the Office of Presbyter is not abjured.) But, mean time, the
Offices themſelves, which are ſaid to make up that Hierarchy, are
not abjured, nor are to be rejected, but purged from what is
his, or any dependance on him, or corruption flowing from
him. And ſo the Office of a Biſhop, amongſt Proteſtants
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99668:17"/>
(Biſhops now being looſed from that dependance from the Sea
of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Pope, who as head of the Church claimed
a plenitude of power over the whole Church, and made all
Chriſtian Biſhops and Miniſters but as his ſlaves and vaſſals,
portioning out to them ſuch meaſure of jurisdiction as he
thought fit; as their ſtiles in this Countrey imported of old;
<hi>Ego</hi> N. <hi>Dei apoſtolicae ſedis gratiâ Epiſcopus</hi>) I ſay the
Office of the proteſtant Biſhop is no more a part now of the
Popes wicked Hierarchy, then is the Office of a Miniſter or
Deacon.</p>
            <p>But further it may appear, that under the name of the
Popes wicked Hierarchy, the Office of Biſhops was not abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the National Covenant. 1. The enjoyner of that Covenant
to be taken by the ſubjects, was King <hi>James,</hi> of bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
He, having himſelf with His family ſubſcribed that Oath
and Covenant, gave charge to all Commiſſioners and Miniſters
within the Realm to crave the ſame Confeſſion from their
pariſhoners, and proceed againſt the refuſers, as the words of
the charge bear, <hi>March,</hi> 2. 1580. This was the firſt injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for taking the Covenant, which was mainly intended for
ſecuring the Religion, and the King who favoured it and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
it, from Papiſts, who were ſound practiſing with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners
againſt him and it, and for clearing the King and his
Court from aſperſions. But that the King by that Covenant
intended the abjuration of the Office of proteſtant Epiſcopacy,
it is moſt improbable, and by many things the contrary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
1. The inſtrument in penning that Covenant at the Kings
command, was Mr. <hi>John Craig,</hi> His Miniſter, a very learned
man, who but nine years before, (<hi>Jan,</hi> 12. <hi>anno.</hi> 1571.) had
given his conſent in the Aſſembly of the Church, which then
did meet at <hi>Leith,</hi> that Commiſſioners might be appointed to
joyn with theſe whom the Council ſhould appoint for ſettling
the policy of the Church: of theſe Commiſſioners he himſelf
was one, and with him <hi>Dun</hi> the Superintendent of <hi>Angus,
Winrame</hi> Superintendent of <hi>Fyfe</hi> and others: the reſolution
they came to, was that there ſhould be of the moſt qualified of
the Miniſtry ſome choſen by the Chapters of the cathedral
Churches, to whom vacant Arch-biſhopricks and Biſhopricks
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99668:17"/>
might be diſpon'd, and they to have power of Ordination, and
to exerce ſpiritual Jurisdiction in their ſeveral Dioceſſes;
and at the Ordination of Miniſters to exact an Oath of them for
acknowledging His Majeſties Authority, and for obedience to
their Ordinary in all things lawfull. And accordingly ſome
were provided to Biſhopricks at that time; neither did the
Church in the following Aſſembly at St. <hi>Andrews, (March,</hi>
1571.) take exception at theſe Articles of agreement. It is
true at <hi>Perth (Auguſt,</hi> 1572.) they received the ſame, but
with a proteſtation, it was only for an <hi>interim,</hi> &amp;c. But this
we may ſay, that the learned Penner of the National Covenant,
allowed of Biſhops a few years before this Covenant: Nor is
there any evidence that he changed his mind, or that he did in
that draught of the Confeſſion, mean proteſtant Biſhops
(which then he approved) by the Popes wicked Hierarchy
which is abjured. 2. As for the King himſelf, that He minded
no abjuration of the Office of a proteſtant Biſhop by that
Covenant, may be evident by this, that when He and His fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took that Covenant, and when he enjoyn'd it to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
there was no ſuch thing known in this Church as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
by Presbyteries (the whole Government conſiſting in
Ordination and Jurisdiction, exerced in the ſeveral parts of
the land, being in the hands of ſome under the name of Biſhops,
ſome under the name of Superintendents, or under the name of
Commiſſioners of Countreys, who exerciſ'd the ſame in their
ſeveral precincts) other Government there was not, but by ſome
ſingle perſons, having power in their ſeveral bounds. It is true,
the Aſſembly quarrel'd what they did amiſs, but yet they were
then really Biſhops: And it is not like the King did ſwear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or put others to ſwear againſt the Church-government
that was then in the Countrey, and was not rejected by the
Church, till <hi>July,</hi> 12, 1580. Yea, it is evident, that the King
and His Council, minded not to ſwear down proteſtant Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
by that Covenant: For, ſuppoſe the General Aſſembly in
that ſame year, 1580, <hi>July</hi> 12. did paſſe an Act againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
(the like whereof had not been done in this Church before)
yet, the very year following, 1581. though the King and
Council had preſented the Confeſſion to the Aſſembly, to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99668:18"/>
ſubſcribed by them and the people in ſeveral Pariſhes at their
order, or by their perſwaſion; yet, that very ſame year, an
Act of Council is made, confirming expreſly that agreement,
1571. at <hi>Leith</hi> concerning Archbiſhops and Biſhops: And this
was done ſix months after the ſending the Confeſſion to the
Aſſembly and the Councils Act for ſubſcribing; this being in
<hi>October,</hi> that in <hi>March,</hi> 1581. Now is it any way probable,
that the King and Council (had they intended to abjure Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
in the Confeſſion) ſhould within ſix moneths make an Act
for confirming a former agreement for eſtabliſhing Epiſcopacy?
And this Act of Council was no ſecret: For, the King openly
avowed it in the buſineſs concerning <hi>Montgomery,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Glaſgow,</hi> whom the King would not ſuffer to be proceſſed
upon the account of his accepting a Biſhoprick; becauſe, as he
ſaid, he had ſo lately ratified the agreement at <hi>Leith,</hi> 1571.
Neither did the Aſſembly or any Miniſters ſpeak of that deed of
the Kings and Councils, as contrary to the Covenant (albeit in
theſe dayes they had a way of uſing liberty enough, and more
then was ſitting.) And it being plain, that the Covenant (in
the intention of King and Council who injoyned it firſt, and
tranſmitted it to the Aſſembly and ſubjects) doth not abjure
Epiſcopacy; Why ſhould the ſubjects take themſelves bound as
ſwearing down Epiſcopacy by that Oath, ſeing every Oath is
to be taken in the declared ſenſe of the Impoſers, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the words of it? But it will be yet ſaid, that the
General Aſſembly at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 1638. have declared, that in
that National Covenant, Epiſcopacy was abjured in the year,
1580, and they enjoyned, that all ſhould ſubſcribe according
to the determination of that Aſſembly; and many have done
ſo. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It ſeemeth very ſtrange, that any Aſſembly, or
Company of men, ſhould take upon them to declare what was
the ſenſe of the Church in taking a Covenant, or Oath, when
few or none of the men were living, who took that Covenant;
or, if living, few or none of them were members of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 1638. As <hi>juramentum eſt vinculum perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale,</hi>
(ſo ſay the Caſuiſts) So no man, or company of men can
take upon them to define what was the ſenſe of dead men in
taking an Oath or Covenant while they were alive, unleſſe they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99668:18"/>
can produce ſome authentick expreſſe evidence, that ſuch was
their meaning in taking the Oath and Covenant in their life-time.
Now, all that the Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> hath produced in
their large Act, (<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 16.) declaring Epiſcopacy to be abjured,
<hi>anno,</hi> 1580. amounts to nothing more, but this, that before <hi>Jul.</hi>
1580. (at which time, ſome moneths after the Covenant was
enjoyn'd by the King to be taken by the ſubjects) the Church
was, and had been ſome years labouring againſt Biſhops (who
notwithſtanding continued, till after the Act at <hi>Dundee,</hi> 1580.)
And that after the year, 1580. there was much oppoſition to
that Office by the Aſſemblies: But all their citations of Acts,
come not to this point, to prove that Epiſcopacy was abjured
by the Covenant or any words in it; nor do theſe ancient Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
after, 1580. ever aſſert any ſuch thing (men being
then living who knew the ſenſe of the Covenant, that it was
againſt Covenant to admit of Epiſcopacy; but they go upon
other grounds in oppugning that Office. How ſtrange is it
that Aſſemblies of Miniſters, who had taken that Covenant,
are never heard to plead againſt Epiſcopacy (though they loved
it not) upon that ground? And that fifty eight years after,
when moſt, or all of theſe firſt takers of it, are worn out, a
generation riſeth, that will plead, that their Anceſtors took
that Covenant in that ſenſe (abjuring Epiſcopacy) whereas
there is in no Act of theſe ancient Aſſemblies (after the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was taken, or at the taking of it) any aſſertion, that it was
their mind in taking that Covenant, to abjure Epiſcopacy?
And that Epiſcopacy was not (in the intention of the takers of
the National Covenant of old) abjured by the Covenant; no,
nor unlawfull in it ſelf, even in the judgment of the Aſſembly
of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may appear, in that within ſix
years after that year, 1580. a General Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>
do declare, that the name of <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath a ſpecial charge and
function thereto annexed by the Word of God; and that it is
lawful for the General Aſſembly, to admit a Biſhop to a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
preferred by the Kings Majeſty, with power to admit, viſit
and deprive Miniſters, and to be Moderators of Presbyteries
where they are reſident and ſubject only to the ſentence of the
General Aſſemblies. It ſeems within ſix years, the General
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99668:19"/>
Aſſembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> retracted the Act of <hi>Dundee,</hi> 1581.
But, 3. Strange it was that the Company met at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> (an
Aſſembly againſt which as much is ſaid, and upon good grounds,
as againſt any other in our Church) had power to bind others
to their determination of the ſenſe of the Covenant. Certain
it is, no Aſſembly nor Company of men, can put an obligation
upon perſons who have taken an Oath perſonally to accept of
their ſenſe of the Oath which they put upon it. It is true, the
Aſſembly of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> could declare their own ſenſe of the Oath
taken by themſelves, but could not impoſe their ſenſe upon the
takers of the Oath before, that ſenſe not having been given to
the takers of the Oath by the impoſers of the ſame; and the
takers of the Oath not having impowered the Commiſſioners at
<hi>Glaſgow</hi> to declare their ſenſe of that Oath they had taken. So
then, whatever was done at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> after the Covenant was
taken by the body of the Land, could not oblige all the takers of it
to own their declaration of the ſenſe of the Covenant (which
was not at firſt impoſing the Oath, declared to them) And the
body of the people of this land, have not indeed abjured
Epiſcopacy by that National Covenant they entered in; neither
the Covenant, nor added interpretation importeth any ſuch
thing: Nor hath the body of the people of the land,
by any after deeds, owned that Aſſemblies ſenſing of the
Covenant; Nor was there any Act in that Aſſembly, that
all ſhould own their determination of the ſenſe thereof. It
is true, there is an Act (<hi>Seſſ.</hi> 26.) that theſe who had not
already ſubſcribed, ſhould ſubſcribe with an allowance of the
Aſſemblies determination concerning the ſenſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
But few did ſo. If any did ſo, they are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whether they have not been too raſhly carryed on in the
current of that time without a juſt examination of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</p>
            <p>But finally, Now (that we are got out of the noiſe of Armes
and Confuſions of the by-paſt times) it concerneth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Chriſt, to ponder if there was any thing unlawfull in
that Covenant (we ſpeak now of the ſolemn League and
Covenant, which ſeemeth moſt expreſſe againſt Prelacy,
and which almoſt ſwallowed up the memory of the other.)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99668:19"/>
That there are great duties engaged to in the ſame, relating to
true Religion and an holy life, from which no power on earth
can looſe, and to which we are indiſpenſably tyed, is not to be
doubted. Neither is it to be doubted, that many godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and people, were ingaged in that Covenant, who deſigned
no evil, nor minded any injury to the Soveraign; Yet, ſeveral
things, as to that Covenant, are worthy to be ſeriouſly
examined, that we may ſee how they can be juſtified before
God; Or, if they are to be confeſſed as faults, eſpecially
if any evil or unlawfull thing be found in the ſubſtance
or mater of the Covenant; it would be remembred, <hi>Malum
eſt ex ſingulis defectibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The warrantableneſs of entring into that publick Oath or
Bond, without the ſupreme Authority of the land, and
againſt the mind of the Soveraign. Can there be any example
ſhewed amongſt the people of God of old, either Jews or
Chriſtians, of carrying on a publick Oath or League and Bond
without their Soveraign Powers, that were over them, going
before them; or, they not conſenting or contradicting? Is
it not ſo ſpecial a Royalty of the King, to have power of
impoſing a publick Oath on all his ſubjects, eſpecially when
the Oath hath a direct aim for raiſing and taking Armes, for
invaſion of any in forreign Nations (ſuch was the aim of the
ſolemn League as to us in <hi>Scotland</hi>) that if this can be done
without the King, What is there that may not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him? Who can have a lawfull power to ſwear all the
Kings ſubjects to ſuch a purpoſe, without his conſent? Much
leſſe can any have power to ſwear them to a War againſt the

that when the Nationall Covenant was carryed on, that the
people might be moved to concur in it and to take it, it was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99668:20"/>
pretended, that it was not without Authority; and that the
warrand it had from King <hi>James</hi> his Authority, ſtill continued
(albeit neither He nor His Succeſſor gave any authoriy to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
explication and application) and, at that time, it was
ingenuoſly profeſſed by the Promoters of that Covenant, (as
may alſo be cleared by Writings they have left to the world)
that had it been a new Covenant or League, they would not,
they could not have entered in it without the King's Authority
warranding them; But, when the ſolemn League and Covenant
(which had no ſhaddow of the King's Authority) cometh upon
the ſtage, this Doctrine was forgotten utterly; for, it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on in <hi>England</hi> by a Meeting of Parliament, excluding one
of the Eſtates, and the King proclaiming againſt it in <hi>Scotland</hi>
by a Committee of Eſtates, which, if they had power to engage
the Land in a Forreign war, intended in that Covenant, may be
doubted. Now, although this could not nullifie the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Covenant, were the matter of it undoubtedly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and otherwiſe ſtill obliging; yet, it were well if unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in regard of this defect and want of a lawfull Authority
warranding it, were acknowledged; this were ſome piece of
ſelf-denyal: Caſuiſts ſay, that <hi>res jurata</hi> may be <hi>licita,</hi> when
<hi>Juramentum eſt illicitum.</hi> Let the matter of the Oath be
lawfull, and ſuppoſe it alſo to oblige; yet, they who appear ſo
afraid of ſin in breaking that Oath, would, for proof of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
give as publick teſtimony againſt the ſinfull way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into that Bond, as they do againſt that ſin (as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
in breaking it; if they ſay <hi>factum valet,</hi> let them conſider if
they have no better reaſon to ſay <hi>fieri non debuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is moſt ſeriouſly to be conſidered, if there be not in the
intrinſical frame of the Covenant that with which God was
not well-pleaſed. Such a ſolemn Oath and Covenant, being a
moſt ſolemn profeſſion before God of what men did own in
Religion, and profeſſedly intended for the greateſt mutual aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of men entring in it, (one to another) ſhould have been
fram'd in moſt ſtrict, plain and ſpecifical termes. But, this <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was purpoſely fram'd in general and homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
termes,</hi> ſuch as (by the expreſſions) leaveth room for
all the Sectaries in the Iſle (if they will but profeſs to own
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99668:20"/>
the Word of God) to lurk under the lap of the Covenant, to
own each one their own way, and yet plead their keeping of
the Covenant, ſuch is the generality of the termes of it; that
ſeveral ſorts of Sectaries may fight in their ſeveral factions one
againſt another, all pretending the Covenant, there being no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
ſpecifical termes in the Covenant, whereupon ſome could
implead others as guilty of breach; and did not the Sectarian
<hi>Armie,</hi> when they invaded <hi>Scotland,</hi> pretend the Covenant and
keeping of it, and thereupon there were high appeals made to
heaven? Will not all, or moſt of them, own the letter of the
Covenant, which only ſeems clear againſt Popery and Prelacy,
and for a violent extirpation of this? Then there was no
ſecurity in that Covenant for preſerving Presbytery in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
the Presbytery not being once named, only the matter is wrapped
up in a general, We ſhall preſerve the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> in
the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline and
Government againſt our common enemies; <hi>reformed Religion,</hi>
and <hi>againſt common enemies:</hi> No <hi>Independent</hi> or <hi>Separatiſt,</hi>
but might ſay, he would preſerve the Reformed Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> albeit he thought not Presbytery to be any part of
Reformed Religion or Government, and although he minded to
do againſt it himſelf; only, if he would preſerve it, it ſhould
be to hold off what he apprehended worſer, he would preſerve
it againſt <hi>the common enemies.</hi> Neither is there ſecurity in
that Covenant for reforming <hi>England,</hi> according to the pattern
as was deſired by us. Was there not more <hi>policy</hi> then <hi>piety</hi>
in this, to endeavour the ſoldering and holding faſt of ſo many
ſeveral parties united againſt Epiſcopacy? yet, ſorting amongſt
themſelves, like the iron and clay toe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

image, and ready to break one upon another (all under pretence
of the Covenant) as it clearly came to paſſe and is ſtill like to
be, ſuch is the vanity of humane policies, unſound wayes of
uniting, tending to the begetting, in end, of greater diſtractions.
And the Covenant being of purpoſe framed in general terms,
for the moſt part, that ſeveral parties might be faſt united
againſt Prelacy owned by the King; if it ſhould be ſtill owned,
would prove no better then a perpetual ſeminary of diverſe
Parties, all pleading their keeping of their Covenant, and yet no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99668:21"/>
party agreeing one with another in the ſpecifical ſenſe thereof
and ſome of the wayes of theſe ſeveral parties, might be found
much worſe (in the judgment of right diſcerners) then Prelacy
is, or may be thought to be by ſome. It would be ſeriouſly
pondred, whether this way of a ſtudied indiſtinctneſs, genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and homonymie in the terms of the Covenant, for ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a party againſt ſome one thing, was acceptable to God?
And whether the blood of our Countrey-men, ſhould have
been caſt away in ſuch uncertain terms? It will be ſaid,
The Covenant is clear enough againſt Epiſcopacy, let us keep
it in the clear and true ſenſe of it, whatever doubtfulneſs be
otherwayes. But to ſay nothing of this that we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above, how unclear it is againſt the Epiſcopacy eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now in <hi>Scotland</hi> (however clear it be as intended againſt
the Engliſh frame) were it not better to lay aſide (when now
it is diſclaimed by King and Parliament and all perſons of
truſt in the Land) an humane form, which, in reſpect of the
Compoſure of it, is apt to be, hath been, and is like to be
a ſeminary of varieties of parties (all pleading it) and worſe
evils then Prelacy is imagin'd to be, then ſtill to own it,
when as authentick exponers of the ſenſe of it, who might
reprove falſe pretenders to the keeping of it, cannot be had;
neither while they were in being, could agree amongſt
themſelves anent the ſenſe of it; as may be ſeen in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
of <hi>Englands</hi> ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Crofton</hi> indeed denyeth, that in that third Article of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
there is any limitation of our loyalty in defending

engage to defend the King's Perſon, to this ſenſe, <hi>we being

But, (to ſay nothing how ſtrain'd-like this looketh, the

no duty of that ſort) Belike, the General <hi>Aſſ.</hi> of the Church

               </gap>. our conditional duty to the King). They in their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
1649. declare, that the King was not to be admitted
to the exerciſe of His royal Power, before ſatisfaction, as to
the matter of Religion (they meant mainly that particular
mode of Church-government by Presbytery; for, that was
it that went under the name of Religion, the ſubſtance of
the proteſtant Religion being never under queſtion between
the King and them) they plead for a ground the Covenant,
where their duty, in defending the King's Perſon and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is ſaid to be ſubordinate to Religion; and therefore it
is concluded, that without manifeſt breach of Covenant, they
cannot admit Him to reign, till in that they be ſatisfied: It
is clear, they look'd on it as a limitation of their duty, and
that His owning of Presbytery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was <hi>conditio ſinè quà
non,</hi> of His reigning amongſt them, and of their paying duty
to Him; and ſo indeed the tranſactions in the Treaties at <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>

their mind. Now, was this right, that (where our Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There was no ſuch Offices in <hi>Scotland</hi>

be queſtion'd if the ſwearing the extirpation, or endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to extirpate the ſame, without and againſt the conſent
of the Soveraign Law giver of the land, was a lawfull Act.
The queſtion is not now, whether Epiſcopacy be lawfull or
not, But ſuppoſing Epiſcopacy to be unlawfull in it
ſelf, albeit in that caſe the Law-givers were indeed bound to
remove it, and to annull Laws favouring it; Yet, it were
unlawfull to people to bandy for forcing or frighting the
Law givers to an alteration of theſe Laws, and to tye
themſelves to a mutual defence, with lives and fortunes
for overturning what the Law alloweth (agree the Soveraign
or not) which is the clear meaning of the Covenant, <hi>Artic.</hi>
2, 3, 5. If once that Principle prevail, that ſubjects may
(when they apprehend Laws unlawfull) uſe forcible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to obtain alteration thereof, What ſecurity can there
be for the beſt Printes in maintaining the beſt Laws? or
what peace for people? When an evil ſpirit ruſheth upon
people, or ſome <hi>Sheba</hi> bloweth the trumper, they will be
ready to think it is their place and calling, being ſouldiers
and men at armes (however called thereto) to offer violence
to Magiſtrates and Laws, even the beſt: It is in vain,
ſome defenders of the Covenant ſay, forcible endeavours
are not meant; Compare ſecond Article and third, that
make mention of lives and eſtates, and relates to the former
and the fifth Article. It is clearly enough ſeen, violent
endeavours are meant, where leſſe will not do. And when
the cauſe of the Covenant was managed in the field, were
not people upon account of that Article, hunted out either
to kill or die, and terrified with the charge of Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
if they went not? Did not people conceive themſelves,
(or were taught ſo) that it was their place and calling
to take armes without and againſt the conſent of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99668:23"/>
Soveraign Law-giver? And in that calling, they were to
endeavour forcibly, conſent the King or not, to carry that
abolition of Prelacy. Let it be conſidered, whether engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſuch endeavours were lawfull, <hi>quoad nos;</hi> or whether
it can be a lawfull bond; that tyes to ſuch violent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
againſt the ſupreme Magiſtrate and Laws (be what
they will be) And let it be ſeriouſly pondred, that if they
who hold themſelves obliged in no way to yield unto,
acknowledge, obey nor act under the Government, which
the King and Law have ſet over them, and by thus with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
their ſubjection, encourage and lead others to do
the like after their example, thereby deſigning to weaken
the Government (which in the faireſt conſtruction, cannot
be judged to <hi>live peaceably</hi>) If, I ſay, theſe will ſpeak and
act conſequentially to former principles and practices, not
yet by them diſclaimed, they muſt alſo hold themſelves by
the ſame Covenant oblig'd to reſiſt and fight againſt the
Laws fencing Epiſcopacy, if occaſion were offered; and not
only to vent their animoſities and diſcontents in their prayers
and diſcourſes in private, but alſo to take all occaſions to
revile and curſe that Government and their Superiours,
commiſſionated by the King, in Prayers, Sermons and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
in publick; and, in effect, to do what in them lyeth, to
bring it and them under, the ſcandal and <hi>odium</hi> of the people,
and make them the Butt of their malice and revenge; let wiſe
men judge how far this is from the tenor of our lawfull Oaths
of Allegiance, Supremacy, yea and Chriſtianity, and what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
this will give to diſturb the peace and rekindle that fire
which had almoſt conſumed us to aſhes. To cloſe, 1. If
Epiſcopacy be of Apoſtolick Inſtitution (as many learned
godly men judge, and it is hard to ſay many ſwearers of the
Covenant had ground of clear perſwaſion to the contrary) it
would not be ſo banded againſt without grievous ſin and
ſcandal. 2. If Epiſcopacy be of indifferent nature, and only
by humane conſtitution, it would be conſidered, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
write againſt Papiſts, <hi>That vows of perpetual abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in all caſes from things in their nature indifferent, are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99668:23"/>
utterly unlawfull;</hi> and let it be thought, whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for any ſubjects to bind up themſelves by Oath, never to
be ſubject to the Magiſtrates laws in things God hath put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the determination of his power. 3. Let Epiſcopacy be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
(which is not proven by any) yet it ſhall be unlawfull
for-ſubjects to attempt the abrogation of the Laws favouring
it, by any force to be uſ'd on the Lawgiver, which is indeed
the intent of the Covenant, and the proceedings thereupon
were anſwerable.</p>
            <p>The Lord give us humble and peaceable ſpirits, to ſee at laſt,
and lay to heart the ſin and folly of thoſe Bonds and Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
againſt the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Government, and his

with that duty and loyalty, which Church-men, above other
ſubjects, ſhould pay to that <hi>Supremacy in all cauſes and over
all perſons,</hi> declared by the law to be an inherent right to the
Crown: It is high time for us in this day of our tranquillity
and calm which God hath wrought, to conſider what belongs
to our peace, and to diſcern the way of our duty, from which
we have been too long tranſported by the tempeſtuous Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and diverſe winds of Doctrines, Engagements and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the years paſt: Reaſon and Scripture, Divine and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

we ſhould hold, namely, that <hi>for publick ſecurity, order
and peace,</hi> Miniſters and people do acquieſce in the preſent
eſtabliſhment, and obey every Ordinance of man, whether
the King as Supream, or thoſe who are commiſſionated by
Him, and that not only for wrath but conſcience ſake. Let
it be far from Miniſters of the Goſpel of peace, to head and
lead the people into diviſions and offences, and by their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and way, to diſpoſe them into diſaffection and diſcontent
with the King and his Laws, as if in the account of ſome,
(whether of corrupt and weak minds) he were a Tyrant not
a Father to the Church, who maketh ſuch Laws, which His
conſcientious ſubjects cannot obey for fear of ſin againſt God;
if this way of diſobedience be perſiſted in, it is eaſie to ſee
what evils will follow, (ſince it muſt be expected, that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99668:24"/>
King and Parliament, will in honour and juſtice, maintain the
laws) And how the whole Nation may be expoſed to the
reproach of a troubleſome, diſquiet, factious people, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill in ſedition and turbulency; It becomes us rather to
cut off occaſions of ſtumbling in the way of Gods people, and
to be patterns of love to, and zeal for the Honour and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of our King and Countrey, of this Church and State,
and to ſhew ſo much tenderneſs for the intereſt of Religion,
Order and Unity, as to put forth our ſelves to the utmoſt in
our ſtations, to promote all theſe, which will prove the moſt
effectual way of cruſhing that ſpirit of Athelſm and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſo much complained of by thoſe who flee from the only
remedy thereof; Miniſters are not to imploy themſelves ſo
much in conſidering how to maintain and uphold the intereſt
of a party or cauſe they have eſpouſed, as how far they may
go, what they may without ſin do in the practice of what the
law injoyneth. The God of peace and truth direct and
