            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Shall not detain the Generous Reader with Flouriſhes upon the Grandeur, and Glory of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Crown, nor tell you that it may Vie Antiquity with the Ancientiſt Monarchy of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, that I leave to your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage, when you have compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the following ſheets with the Hiſtories of other Nations. Only thus far I will aſſure you that <hi>Scotland</hi> will be found to be a Country Pregnant of Wonderfull Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Revolutions, a Theatre whereon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence has I Exhibited divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtances, of it's Peculiar Care over Crowned Heads, and where all Treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:56522:4"/>
and Diſloyalty has been perſued with utter ruine and Deſtruction. It can ſhow a Race of Kings <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nparallel'd for their Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Gallantry in the Defence of their Country, and Protection of their Allies, and for their Heroiciſm in Aſſiſting and redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miſerable and Oppreſt. But I leave their own Acts, as repreſented in the following Mirrour to make good my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſertion, and ſhall proceed to offer ſomething in my own Vindication, for I am liable to ſome Reprehenſion for Cramming ſo Large, ſo Bulky a Hiſtory into ſo ſmall a Volum, but if it be conſidered that all the Curious have neither the leiſure to peruſe nor the means to provide a larger, I hope I ſhall need no farther Apology upon that point, nor need I advocate much for differing much from many Authors, as to the Origin of our Nation, ſince I have followed the most Authentick, and have only vary'd from thoſe whoſe writings are vaniſhed with Monckery, and ſavour more of the Legend than true History. Beſides the plain bome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpun manner wherein all theſe matters are deliver'd, will diſguſt ſeveral who only delight in what is Flaunting and Trick'd up with all the Ornaments and Gawdineſs of Rhetorick and Elocution; but be it known I fitted my ſtile for the Capacities of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgar

Readers, ſuch as becomes a Hiſtory, not a <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> and what ſquars beſt with the Tongue of both Kingdoms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was never yet any Chronicle pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd of the Realm of <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo as that thoſe who were unacquainted with the Latin, were excluded from the knowledge of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate of ſo Illuſtrious a Kingdom. After having fitted this account for the Common uſe by diveſting it of a Pompous Dreſs and a too Stately Dignity of ſtile, my Chief Care was to avoid Partiality, by a ſtedy and <hi>Cauterous</hi> ſtearing between <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Biſhop Leſley, Seylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> where vaſt Funds of Wit and Learning might eaſily have wrought the ſhipwrack of an unwary Pilot; ſo that tho' a great part hereof is a tranſlation of Eminent Authors, yet I left my Originalls when I found 'em bias'd, and avoiding their Extreams boul'd directly to the Block.</p>

         <div type="introduction">
            <pb facs="tcp:56522:5"/>
            <head>THE Introduction,</head>
            <p>HIſtory has been reckon'd, one of the moſt Generous amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the greateſt Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the loftier the Subject, the more agreeable the Entertainment. Now for the Advantages, and Dignity of a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Chronicle; I will not ſo much inſiſt upon it's Novelty, and the wonderful Viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes it contains, as the Preheminency of that Crown, over all Common-wealths, Empires and Monarchies, which, by ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſeveral Claims and Pretences, will ſufficiently be made appear. The Emperor Challenges the firſt Rank, as ſucceeding to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, who are ſuppoſed to have been univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs; the <hi>French</hi> King pretends alſo to it, upon the Account of his being Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> with other ſuch Pretences. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo pleads it, as his Right; being the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:56522:5"/>
Catholick King, and King of manyeſt Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>In this Debate of theirs, we are not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerned; our buſineſs therefore ſhall be to prove: Firſt, that the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> hath an unqueſtionable Right of Precedency to all the above named Princes: Secondly, that he hath it it as King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, he founds his Precedency to them all, 1. Upon his being a abſolute Monarch of the Iſle of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> which was firſt <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> 2. Upon his being one of the <hi>Quatuor nucti,</hi> which were before all other Kings, 3. That having Conquered <hi>France,</hi> he hath Right to all it's Titles, by which he carries it clear from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or any other Competitor, and Laſtly, that it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, even as King of <hi>England</hi> by the Popes themſelves, in the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; ſo that had they not relinquiſhed his Papacy, it is like his Holineſs, had not as yet queſtioned their Title to it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. His Majeſty as King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may juſtly claim the Precedency from all thoſe Princes; it being by Lawyers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the uncontroverted uſe of Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, <hi>That amongſt thoſe of equal Dignity, he who firſt attained to that Dignity, is to be
<pb facs="tcp:56522:6"/>
preferred,</hi> This being a Rule among others Dignities, we ſee no reaſon, but that it ſhould hold here.</p>
            <p>This being granted, I ſubſume that the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being equal in Dignity with the Kings of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> attained to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, before either of them, for the firſt King of <hi>Scotland</hi> Reigned about three hundred and thirty years before the birth of Chriſt: Whereas the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians Confeſs, that they cannot reckon higher than eight hundred years after Chriſt: Nor can either the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Spaniard</hi> come up to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> take the Origine from <hi>Hugh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,</hi> who Uſurped that Crown, <hi>Anno.</hi> 987. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from <hi>Rudolphus</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> Elected 1273.</p>
            <p>But here it is objected by ſome, that the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were Vaſſals to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and did them Homage for the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſo can Claim no Precedency amongſt any free Princes, far leſs amongſt ſuch as are of the firſt magnitude. This ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians do with great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence aver; but that their Ignorance, or Malice, or both may appear, we are Content to refer the matter, not only
<pb facs="tcp:56522:6"/>
to the Reſpect the General Councils gave to the Repreſentatives of the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was only due to free Princes, together with the Judgment of Forreign Princes, Lawyers, and Hiſtorians about it; but alſo to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> themſelves, (1.) King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> having intreated the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt <hi>Simeon</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> did by Letters under his hand, publickly declare, that he did not crave this Aſſiſtance, as Superior, to which Superiority, he had no pretence, but to which is very Conſiderable, the King and Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> have treated with the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; whereas no Superior can Treat with his own Vaſſal, as a Forreigner.</p>
            <p>We freely Grant that the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> did hold the Lands of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in Capite</hi> of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which yet was no Diſparagment to them; that being moſt ordinary amongſt Sovereign Princes, for thus <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral others of their Kings, did Homage to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> for the Provinces poſſeſt by them in <hi>France</hi>; as the King
<pb facs="tcp:56522:7"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> alſo doth, this day to the Pope, for <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi> And yet the Homage done for thoſe Countries have been the occaſion of an Ignorant miſtake in ſome, and a malicious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for others, to Miſ-repreſent it, as done for the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <head>AN EPITOME OF THE HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Scots</hi> by the moſt judicious Writers, and by thoſe who have moſt carefully ſtudied, not only their own Antiquities, but thoſe of other Nations are acknowleged (although they be not of the greateſt) to be undoubtedly among the moſt antient People in <hi>Europe.</hi> But to ſpeak more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of their antient Nation, we muſt know that the whole Iſland <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is a part, was at firſt called <hi>Albion,</hi> or <hi>Albium</hi>: As <hi>Theophraſtus, Ptolomy, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, which Name the true race of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56522:9"/>
ancient <hi>Scots</hi> retain to this day, calling the ancient Country <hi>Albin,</hi> and themſelves <hi>Albinich,</hi> always keeping their primitive Name notwithſtanding of the many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent People, that have ſince inhabited it.</p>
            <p>The Etymology of this Name is diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many, but it ſeems to be really derived from <hi>Alb,</hi> or <hi>Alp,</hi> ſignifying a <hi>Hill</hi> or high place. The antient Inhabitants of the Northern parts of this Iſland were called <hi>Scots,</hi> who were divided into two ſorts, the one who were the firſt Poſſeſſors, and this Poſterity doth inhabit it to this day, were called the <hi>Scoto-Brigantes.</hi> Some have taken upon them to be very accurat, in giving an Account of their deſcent, and the manner of their coming hither, even from the far ends of the Earth; but with ſo little appearance of Truth, that I will not put my Reader nor my ſelf to the trouble to refute it. The moſt probable Conjecture, and that which carrieth moſt Evidence with it is, that theſe firſt Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants came in Colonies from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Ireland</hi> (nor is it improbable, that theſe Colonies were Originally from <hi>France</hi>) who either for want of Accommodation to live at home, or being thruſt out by ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hands came over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they continued long, for either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their Children deſirous of new
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56522:9"/>
Habitations, tranſported themſelves to the north Iſlands, where they continued in an unſetled Courſe of Life for a long time; the time of their entring <hi>Albion,</hi> is ſaid to have been from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, about 3530 years.<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Pect. Boet. Ralph</hi> l. 306.</note> The firſt place they took Poſſeſſion of was <hi>Argyle,</hi> they being divided into ſundry Tribes, elected every Tribe their own Captain, to govern them in Peace and War, this very name they had in great Veneration.</p>
            <p>Then after, about 150 (as ſome write) a <hi>German,</hi> or as <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith, a <hi>Scythian</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy arrived upon the coaſt of <hi>Ireland</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as is probable, beat thither by a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, having neither Wives or Children with them; the men were in want of every thing, having by tedious Sailing conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their Proviſion. They ſent to the Inhabitants, deſiring they might have a reſidence among which they told them, they could not afford in regard of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of the place, and the multitude of Inhabitants that poſſeſs it already; but that there was a habitable Land called <hi>Albion,</hi> not far from them, whether they might go; it being for the moſt part, as yet un-inhabited, and ſuch as did inhabit it, like to ruin one another by civil Diſcords</p>
            <p>Thoſe men (afterward called <hi>Picts</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56522:10"/>
following their Advice, ſet Sail and came to that part of <hi>Albion</hi> that lyes toward <hi>Germany</hi>; and having Landed, ſoon beat out the Inhabitants, and made them draw themſelves within leſs bounds. Poſſeſſing themſelves of <hi>Caithneſs, Roſs, Murray, Merus, Angus, Fiffe</hi> and <hi>Lothian,</hi> together with <hi>Orkney,</hi> which ſome ſay was their firſt Habitation. They were a civil People, Ingenious and Crafty, both in Peace and War.</p>
            <p>Having fixed their reſidence, they ſent Meſſingers to the <hi>Scots,</hi> deſiring their Daughters in Marriage, alledging that if they condeſcended, it would highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Welfare of both of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby made ſtrong, for either an offenſive or defenſive War, with any of their Neigbours. This meſſage the <hi>Scots</hi> at firſt rejected, but upon mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration they condeſcended: So having agreed upon the Terms, which were that they ſhould concur with all their Forces, when they were invaded, and as often as the Crown of <hi>Picts</hi> came to want an Heir, the next of the Womans blood ſhould ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; the <hi>Scots</hi> gave their Daughters in Marriage to them: But the <hi>Brittons</hi> who inhabited the South parts of the Iſland, ſuſpecting that this affinity between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Picts,</hi> might tend to their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56522:10"/>
prejudice, ſent Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Picts,</hi> perſwading them to break with the <hi>Scots</hi>; by this means the <hi>Scots</hi> ſuffered extreamly, many of their People who dwelt among the <hi>Picts,</hi> being ſurprized and cut off, in Compenſation of which they cut off, as many of the <hi>Picts</hi> as they could catch; thus they for a long time waſted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Country with continual Incurſions, at laſt they reſolved to put it to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a General Battle. The <hi>Scots</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in <hi>Argyle,</hi> conſulted what was fit to be done, and conſidering that they had not only to do with the <hi>Picts,</hi> but with the <hi>Brittons</hi> alſo; therefore it was agreed to ſend Ambaſſadors to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to have the Advice and Aſſiſtance of their old Friends, and Progenitors in this Affair, and finding that by having many ſupreme Captains, Sedition and Diviſion increaſed amongſt them, they reſolve to elect one to have the ſupreem Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the reſt.</p>
            <p>Their Ambaſſadors arriving in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and repreſenting their condition to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> he was much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the wrongs done them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent his Son <hi>Fergus</hi> a wiſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Prince, accompanied with many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Soldiers; ſending with him alſo the fatal Marble Chair for his incouragement:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56522:11"/>
Upon his arrival he called a Councel in <hi>Argyle,</hi> where having made an elegant Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he was by Unanimous Conſent ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted King of the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Thus <hi>Fergus</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Scots,</hi> was Crowned in the fatal Marble Chair, which he brought with him from <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the year from the Creation 3641. before the coming of Chriſt 330. about the beginning of the fourth Monarchy, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great vanquiſhed <hi>Darius</hi> the laſt <hi>Perſian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. Soon after the <hi>Picts</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Brittons,</hi> invaded the Country againſt them, the King moſt valiantly took the Field with his fierce <hi>Scots</hi>; when the two Armies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached one another, the <hi>Brittons</hi> ſtood off in Battle Array, reſolving that when the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> had ſufficiently weakened one another in Battle, to break in upon them, and deſtroy them both; this by a Fugitive <hi>Britton</hi> was diſcovered to <hi>Fergus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſired an interview with the King of <hi>Picts</hi>; wherein, repreſenting the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hazard that both of them were in, by the Treachery of the <hi>Brittons,</hi> after mature Deliberation; it was determined that they both ſhould convert their Arms againſt the <hi>Brittons,</hi> this reſolution was moſt pleaſing no doubt to the <hi>Picts</hi> Wives, to ſee their Husbands and their Fathers agreed. The <hi>Brittons</hi> ſeeing this diſappointment of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56522:11"/>
hopes break upon the <hi>Picts,</hi> pillaging and ſpoiling at their Pleaſure, which when <hi>Fergus</hi> heard of, he went againſt them, and with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Picts,</hi> he totally routed them killing their King, his Name was <hi>Coil</hi> with many of his Nobles: Upon this Victory the Nobles and Subjects agreed, that <hi>Fergus</hi> and his Poſterity, ſhould inherit the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> for ever, whereupon Charters and Evidences were granted to them, ratifying the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>Fergus</hi> and his Succeſſors, he with Advice and Conſent of his Councel divided the whole Land, then inhabited by the <hi>Scots</hi> among his Nobles and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, making many Laws to repreſs Vice and Diſorders: Not long after he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Arbitrator, to determine ſome high Controverſies amongſt his Friends in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; whereupon he went thither, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many of his Nobles, and ſetled all their Debates. But returning home, he was by a tempeſtuous Storm driven upon a Rock in the Sea, where he and all the Nobles in his Company periſhed, this Rock is called after his Name <hi>Carrib-Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>: Thus dyed this brave and valiant Prince, in the five and twentieth Year of his Raign, to the unſpeakable Grief and loſs of his Subjects.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56522:12"/>2. <hi>Fergus</hi> being dead, left two Sons behind, him <hi>Ferlegus</hi> and <hi>Atainus,</hi> neither of which were capable preſently to manage the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe of their tender years: Whereupon a Convention was holden by the Nobles, for electing of a King, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome were for chooſing one of the late Kings Children; alledging, that they were bound by Oath to continue the Crown in <hi>Fergus</hi> his Succeſſion; others aggravated the Danger both at home and abroad, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of a Child. At length, after a long Debate it was enacted, that when it happened their King ſhould dye, (the Heirs begotten of his Body, being Children) the neareſt of the Royal Blood, being the beſt qualified for doing of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould ſucceed, and poſſeſs the Crown for his time; and after his Death, the former Kings Son to ſucceed without any impediment, if he is found fit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Law was in Force till the Reign of King <hi>Malcom</hi> the third. Thus by this Law <hi>Feritharis</hi> Brother to <hi>Fergus</hi> the late King was choſen, who begun his Reign in the Year of the World 3666. before the coming of Chriſt 305 Years, from the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Scotland</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feritharis</hi> Reigned fifteen years with ſuch Equity and Modeſty, that his Subjects found him an excellent King, and his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56522:12"/>
an excellent Tutor; but at length <hi>Ferlegus</hi> having an itching after the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and having got ſome looſe young Men upon his ſide, went to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and boldly demanded the Kingdom from him, alledging that he enjoyed it, only by way of truſt, during his Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Feritharis</hi> upon this called a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Nobles, where he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered to reſign the Kingdom, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his Nephew; but they being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how happy they had hitherto lived, under his Government, and knowing that the other was of a rude untractable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, by no means would hear of it; ſoon after there was a Conſpiracy diſcovered againſt the Kings Perſon, managed by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legus</hi> and ſome others: Whereupon he was preſently arraigned and found Guilty, but his Fathers memory, his Uncles deſire to the Parliament, prevailed to have him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and committed only to the keeping of ſome, who were commanded to take ſpecial notice of all his Actions, but he found a way to deceive his Keepers, and make his eſcape; he firſt fled to the <hi>Picts,</hi> then to the <hi>Brittons,</hi> where he ſpent the reſt of his days in great Miſery, within a Month after, <hi>Feritharis</hi> dyed, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Suſpicion of being poyſoned by ſome of his Nephews Accomplices, which ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged

the Nation againſt him, that his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Memory was hateful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Mainus Fergus</hi> his ſecond Son, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, in the Year of the World 3680. before Chriſt 291. After the beginning of the Reign forty one.

            <p n="4">4. His Son <hi>Dornadill</hi> ſucceeded him in the Government in the Year of the World 3079. before Chriſt 262. after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reign ſeventy, he followed his Fathers Foot-ſteps in Equity and Juſtice, but was more given to Paſtimes; eſpecially Hunting; he is ſaid to have made ſeveral Laws about Hunting, which the Ancient <hi>Scots</hi> obſerve to this day, he dyed peaceably the 28. year of his Reign.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Dornadilles</hi> eldeſt Son, being yet a Child and not fit to Govern, the People ſet <hi>Hothat</hi> his Brother upon the Throne in the year of the World 3738. before Chriſt 233 after the beginning of the Reign 98. He proved a monſtrous Tyrant, taking Pleaſure in nothing more than in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his Nobility, and deſtroying his People by all the means that he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, till at laſt one <hi>Dowall</hi> a <hi>Gallaway</hi> man, having gathered together a Company of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56522:13"/>
diſaffected Perſons came boldly to the King, telling him how grievous his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was to the People, becauſe of his Oppreſſion, and therefore deſired him to reſign the Crown (which he was unfit to wear) to ſuch as had a better Title to it; the King tho' ſurprized by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet no ways daunted, told him, that whatever was done by him during his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was done by Royal Authority, and if it was grievous to the Subjects, they had their own obſtinacy to blame for it, hereupon <hi>Dowall</hi> preſently fell upon, and killed him after he had Reigned twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>

And as for <hi>Hothat,</hi> tho' they knew that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the worſt kind of Death, yet they did not approve of this Fact, as being of bad Example; they knew alſo, that what <hi>Dowal</hi> did, was for his own ends, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward appeared. <hi>Hothat's</hi> Relations ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the advantage of the Peoples diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction ſtirred them up by all means, to make War upon <hi>Dowall</hi>; at length, they draw to Arms under the Command of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guhort, Hothat's</hi> Son-in-Law, and Captain

            <p>The conſequences of this unhappy day, were moſt fatal both to <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>; not having Men enough left alive to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the Realm, or to withſtand their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, upon which the <hi>Brittons</hi> took occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to invade them, but they no wiſe being in Caſe to reſiſt them, after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bloody Skirmiſhes, were forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to the Mountains; the King of <hi>Scots</hi> went into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the King of <hi>Picts</hi> to <hi>Orkney,</hi> whereafter twelve years Miſery, they reſolved once more to try their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and returning home, the one from <hi>Ireland,</hi> the other from <hi>Orkney</hi>; they joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battle with their old Enemies, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict was ſo terrible, that none of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties could boaſt much of the Victory.

But the Valiant Earl of <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> dyed in this Battel, being thrice run through the Body, and Mortally wounded in his Head, which was a greater loſs and Grief to his Nation, then the gain of this Victory could ballance.

The People Perceiving the Earl of <hi>Cravford</hi> to ſit ſo ſtifly, cryed, the <hi>Scotch</hi> man was lock'd in his Saddle; he hearing this, leapt out of the Saddle upon the Ground, and preſently mounted again, to the great wonder of the Beholders: The ſecond time they run without any hurt, but the third time the Lord <hi>Welles</hi> was beat out of his Saddle, and ſorely hurt with the fall. By this time the Queen dying, her Son <hi>David,</hi> who for his Extravagancies was by her means kept under reſtraint, broke out into his former diſorders, and committed all kind of Rapine, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; complaint being brought to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he committed him to his brother <hi>Robert</hi> (this Deſign was to root out all that Off-Spring) the buſineſs was ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as that the young man was ſhut up in <hi>Faulkland</hi> Caſtle to be ſtarved; which yet was for a while delayed, one

            <p>The South parts of the Kingdom, being brought under Obedience, the King reſolved to have the North follow their Example, for which end he went thither himſelf in Perſon, to keep his Courts: When he came there, he found things in a ſtrange Condition, all going by ſtrength of hand; the ſtronger over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the weaker.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56522:54"/>
to do, at laſt after many doubtful reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and conflicts in his thoughts, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſeige, diſbandeth the Army, and accompanied with ſome choſen bands of his moſt aſſured friends, Perplexed Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and Sad returned to <hi>Perth,</hi> ſtaied in the Convent of the Dominicans, indeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring ſo ſecretly as was poſſible to find out the Conſpiracy, but his cloſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing was not unknown to the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which made them haſten the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief before tryal, or remedy could be thought upon.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators were <hi>Robert Graham, Robert Stewart</hi> Nephew to <hi>Waller</hi> Earle of <hi>Athole,</hi> and one of the Kings ſworn Domeſticks, but he who gave motion to all was the Earle of <hi>Athole,</hi> he himſelf the Kings Fatthers Brother; this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel was no leſs then a pretended Title to the Crown, and being animated by the Oracle of a Southſayer, who aſſured him that he would be Crowned in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſſembly before his death, never doubted of ſucceſs. Theſe having aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated unto them the moſt audacious, whom hope of preferment might intice.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Stewart</hi> which were accomplices guided with reſolution, and guarded with the darkneſs of the Night, came to the <hi>Black-fryers</hi> of <hi>Perth,</hi> and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56522:55"/>
having the way made open to them, entred the Gallery before the Kings cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber door, where they attended ſome of their Confederates, who ſhould have ſtole away the bar by which means they might enter the chamber, but before their coming the occaſion was put in their hands, for <hi>Walter Streater</hi> one of the Kings Cup bearers came forth of the Chamber and finding armed men, ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rudely to force their entry, with a loud voice gave the alarum of Treaſon, while they were working his death a Maid of Honour got to the Door, and eſſayed to ſhut it, but the bar which ſhould have made it faſt was gone, ſhe thruſt in her Arm in the place of it but that eaſily broken, the conſpirators ruſh into the Chamber, and ſlaying all ſuch of the waiters as made defence, they at laſt ſtroke down the King, (whom while the Queen by interpoſing her body ſought to ſave, ſhe received two wounds) and he with twenty eight moſt toward the heart was left dead. The report of this Murther being ſpread abroad, wrought incredible Sorrow and Grief in the Hearts of his Subjects of all ſorts, the Nobles of their own accord and motion Aſſembled to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and directed Troops of Armed men through all the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56522:55"/>
quarters of the Kingdom, to aprehend the Murtherers; ſuch diligence was uſed that within forty days all were taken and put to Ignominious Deaths: the common ſort of the Conſpirators were hanged upon Gibbits, the puniſhment of <hi>Athol</hi> was continued for three days, the firſt day he was Stript naked to his ſhirt, and by a Crane fixed in a Cart often hoiſted aloft and thus dragged along the great ſtreet of the Town, on the ſecond day he was mounted upon a Pillar in the Market-place, and crowned with a Diadem of burning Iron with this Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>the King of all Traytors,</hi> thus was his Oracle accompliſhed, the third day he was laid naked upon a Scaffold, his belly ript, his Heart and Bowels taken out and thrown in a Fire before his eyes, laſtly his Head was cut of and fixed in the moſt Eminent place of the Town, his Body ſent in quarters, to the moſt populous Cities of the Kingdom, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Trophy of Juſtice. His Nephew was not altogether ſo vigorouſly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, being only hanged and quartered.</p>
            <p>But it being notorious, that <hi>Graham</hi> had imbrewed his hands in the Kings Blood, a Gallows being raiſed in a Cave, he had his Right hand nailed to it, and as he was dragged along the Streets,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56522:56"/>
Executioners with burning Pincers, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt Fleſhy part of his Carcaſs; being thus torn and flayed, his Heart and Intrals were thrown into a Fire, his Head ſet up, and his Quarters ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Towns, to ſatisfie the wrath and ſorrow of the injured People: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked during his Torture, how he durſt embrew his hand in his Princes blood, he made anſwer, that having Heaven and Hell before him, he dared leap from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into Hell; an anſwer worthy for ſuch a Villain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dueas Sylvius</hi> then Legat in <hi>Scoltand,</hi> from the Pope; having ſeen this ſudden and Terrible revenge, being a Witneſs of the Execution: Said he could not tell, whether he ſhould give them greater Commendations, that revenged the Kings Death, or brand them with a ſharper Condemnation, that diſtained themſelves with ſo Hainous a parricide. Thus dyed this Noble and Wiſe Prince, in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of his Reign: He was buried in the Charter-houſe of <hi>Perth,</hi> which he himſelf had founded.</p>
            <p n="103">103. The three Eſtates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſet the Crown upon the Head of <hi>James</hi> the ſecond at Holy-rood-houſe; while yet a Child in the ſixth year of his Age, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1437. The Government
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56522:56"/>
is intruſted to <hi>Alexander Levingſton</hi> of <hi>Calander,</hi> and the Cuſtody of the Kings Perſon, to Sir <hi>William Crichtoun:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe Honours had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Men far below himſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired home and gave Orders, that none of his Vaſſals ſhould acknowledge the preſent Government; alſo he uſed all means to weaken the hands of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and Governour, ſowing (by his Inſtruments) the Seeds of Diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which accordingly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Expectation, they begin to croſs and Counter-act one another, which made them at length that neither of them was obeyed, the Country, having u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped a Licencious Liberty, doing what he thought beſt.</p>
            <p>The Queen ſeeing things thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed betwixt them, and finding that the Chancellor was moſtly to blame, ſhe at laſt reſolves to change the Game of State. To effect her deſign, ſhe came to <hi>Edenburgh</hi>; and with fair Speeches prevailed with the Chancellor, to let her enter the Caſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and delight her ſelf ſome days in the Company of her Son; after ſome days ſtaying, where
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56522:57"/>
having fixed every thing for her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe puts the King into a Trunck, as if he had been ſome Fardel of her Apparel, and conveys him by water to <hi>Sterling,</hi> preſently after Proclamations are made againſt the Chancellor, and he Commanded to render the Caſtle, which he refuſing to do, he is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſieged. But the two Rulers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better adviſed, conſidering that <hi>Douglaſs</hi> waited to ſee them undo one another, come to an agreement.</p>
            <p>Much about this time, the Queen Dowager married <hi>James Stewart's</hi> Son, to the Lord of <hi>Lorn,</hi> the Governour fearing what might follow upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, committed them both to the Caſtle of <hi>Sterling,</hi> then the Queen began to repent her, of her former Courteſies to the Governour, reſolving once more to Face about; which the Chancellor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, lays hold upon the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſtrikes in with her preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they contrived how to take the Prince out of the Governours hands, which they after effected thus, the King being one Morning hunting in the Park (the Governour being at <hi>Perth</hi>) the Chancellor coming to him by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56522:57"/>
the Queens aſſiſtance, prevails with him to go to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and take the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon himſelf; which when the Governour hears of, he very calmly came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and he becometh Friends.</p>
            <p>The great Confuſions that were in the Country, did neceſſitate the the calling of a Parliament, where many grievous Complaints were brought againſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oppreſſors; and among the reſt <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> Son to <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi>; was repreſented as the Source, whence the Miſeries of the Country ſprang: The Parliament reſolve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him, by way of Rigour, but the Governor and the Chancellor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them rather to write a fair Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, and invite him by fair means to come in and ſubmit, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done, and wrought ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually upon him, that he reſolves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to obey; hoping thereby to get himſelf ſet up: He upon his arrival, was together with his Brother <hi>David,</hi> and Sir <hi>Malcolm Flyming</hi> of <hi>Cumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> with great Ceremony conducted by the Governour to the Caſtle of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh,</hi> where the King was; at this
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56522:58"/>
Table he was ſet to Dine, this ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated his Heart, that he Bleſſed himſelf with the Expectation of other Favours.</p>
            <p>But amidſt theſe Entertainments (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Inſtability of Fortune) near the end of the Banquet, the Head of a Bull (which was the ſign of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Death in thoſe days) is ſet down before him: At which ſudden Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, he leapt from the Table all agaſt, but he is preſently ſeized upon by arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, who led him to the outer Court of the Caſtle, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tears and Crys of the young King, that they might ſpare his Life, he together with his Brother and <hi>Flym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> had their Heads cut off: This Act left Grief and Terror in the Hearts of the People, who ever after hated the Actors of the Tragedy.</p>
            <p>The Kings Nonage being now near expired, he takes the Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and finding the two Rulers being ſo long ſettled in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not to be Ambitious and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, he reſolves to entertain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faction more powerful than they: So ſetting his thoughts upon <hi>William</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56522:58"/>
Earl of <hi>Douglaſs</hi> Son to the Baron of <hi>Abercon,</hi> him he received into Favour. This ſudden change of Court, moved the two Rulers to withdraw, after which they were both removed from their Offices; and at laſt ſummoned before the King, to anſwer ſuch things as they ſhould be Legally accuſed of. They finding that there was a deſign upon them, did not appear: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were both forfeited.</p>
            <p>This produced great Confuſion in the State, all being divided into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Parties: Whereupon followed much Effuſion of Blood; eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Layndſays,</hi> and the <hi>Ogletives. Douglaſs</hi> to keep himſelf high, did much abett theſe Broils, making his own uſe of them; yet not long after, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor notwithſtanding <hi>Douglaſs's</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Policy, is reſtored to his Fortune and Dignity.</p>
            <p>The King being ſetled upon the Throne, married <hi>Mary</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Gnilders,</hi> ſoon after, the Peace with <hi>England</hi> expired, and the Borders of both Kingdoms, break and mutually invade each other, which iſſued in a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56522:59"/>
Truce for ſeven yeers. But this Truce ſtood not long, both Nations being equally inclined to break it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon after ſeveral Incurſions on both ſides, at laſt they came to a Battel. The <hi>Scots</hi> were Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Magnus Red-beard</hi>; a man trained from his Youth in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> who is ſaid to have required no more for his Service to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> then that by his own Valour, he muſt Conquer of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Here it is valiantly fought for a long time, with doubtful Victory, till at length <hi>Magnus</hi> being killed, it inclined to the <hi>Scots,</hi> the loſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was great, many brave Men being killed and taken Priſoners, upon their ſide, but the <hi>Scots</hi> loſt few of any Note, except <hi>Cragy Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>: This Battel brought on a Truce for three years.</p>
            <p>This Victory no ſooner was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby Peace abroad, but preſently they fall out at home; this <hi>Douglaſs</hi> being always the firſt mover of ſtrife: But now finding himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by Adverſaries, both at Court and in the Country; he leaveth the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56522:59"/>
Kingdom and goeth to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was not long gone, but by the means of his Enemies, he is cited to appear before the Council upon ſeveral days together, with his Brother and Vaſſals, to anſwer ſuch things as ſhould be objected againſt them; and upon not appearing, are all denounced Rebels: the Earl of <hi>Douglaſs</hi> hearing of this unexpected News at <hi>Rome,</hi> takes a Journey, and comes to the Borders of <hi>Scotland</hi>; whence he ſent his Brother to Court to know the Kings mind towards him. The King promiſed upon his Submiſſion, to accept of him, which he performed, making him for his further Encouragement Lieutenant General of his Forces: But he ſtood not long privately in his Proſperity, for going to the Court of <hi>England</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome deſign, the King was highly diſſatisfied with him, yet upon his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Submiſſion he is pardoned, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of all publick imployment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus being degraded from his Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, he gives himſelf wholly to ſtudy revenge, and that he might the more ſucceſsfully effect his Deſign; he gets the Earls of <hi>Cranford, Roſs-Murray,</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:56522:60"/>
the Lord <hi>Balveny,</hi> with many other Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Gentlemen, to enter in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, both offenſive and defenſive with him, after they broke out in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Inſolences; ſpoiling and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Lands of ſuch as were not of their Faction, and killing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſuch as offered to oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>The King begins to be apprehenſive of their Deſign; therefore thinks it high time to look to himſelf and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Whereupon he ſent for <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> to come and ſpeak with him at <hi>Sterling,</hi> which he at firſt feared to do, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſecond Thoughts, he accompanied with many of the Confederates went to Court, where the King very Graciouſly received him; the day being far ſpent, the Gates of the Caſtle ſhut, all remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed except ſome of the Council, and the Guards, the King takes the Earls apart very friendly, and remembred him of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours received, and wrongs forgotten: Taxing him with the exorbitant abuſes of his followers, then he told him of a Covenant, which he heard was made betwixt him and ſome of the other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and deſired to know what he had to ſay. <hi>Douglaſs</hi> anſwered in plain terms,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56522:60"/>
it was ſo, but that the Covenant was made for his own ſafety, the King fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expoſtulated with him to break it, which he refuſing to do, the King with his Dagger ended the Quarrel, killing him in the place.</p>
            <p>About the end of this Tragedy, a pair of Spurs between two Platters, is directed to Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> as a part of the Kings Banquet: Whereupon he and the reſt takes the Allarum, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fire to divers places of the Town, they make their eſcape; the King to vindicate himſelf, emits Declarations, ſhewing all his good Subjects the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that moved him to take <hi>Douglaſs's</hi> Life, that it was not a fit of Paſſion, nor an Act of private revenge, but meerly to ſave the State from utter Ruin: Yet the <hi>Mobile</hi> were diverſly affected ſome juſtifying the Fact, as Noble and Juſt, but others (as the greater number) as boldly Condemned it, as Inhumane and Cruel; theſe of the League miſſing no Opportunity that was for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, made it their work to ſow Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Diſcord, and to encourage all Breaches and Contempt of the Laws, which encreaſed their number, ſo that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56522:61"/>
the King was reduced to a very low condition, till at laſt <hi>Cranford</hi> one of the Confederates being routed, by the Earl of <hi>Huntly,</hi> he recovered ſome ſtrength, and having called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> ſummoned the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Lords to appear before, which they ſcornfully refuſed to do: Whereupon the King levying an Army, forced them to retire; yet the Country ſuffered ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by their unbridled Fury. At length after much loſs on both ſides (the King daily prevailing, the Earl of <hi>Cranford</hi> ſubmitted himſelf to his mercy, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others did afterward. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Earl of <hi>Douglaſs</hi> fled to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there having gathered together ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral deſperate Men, he made ſeveral inroads upon the Border.</p>
            <p>The King having with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty recovered the Royal Authority of his Anceſtors, (<hi>England</hi> in the mean time being at the point of utter ruine by the conteſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>) was much ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by both of them, but he told the Ambaſſadors that he had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to look to his own concerns, then to aſſiſt either of them which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56522:61"/>
to do, thereupon raiſing a Powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my he paſſed the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and beſieged <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> where having applyed his battery to the Caſtle, he began to ſtorm it, but by the ſpace of an over-charged Piece the King's thigh bone being broken was ſtruck im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Dead, the twenty Fourth year of his Reign, having left three ſons <hi>James</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and was buried at <hi>Holy-Rood houſe.</hi> After his death the Queen with her Son came to the ſiege and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Nobles, who took and demoliſhed the Caſtle, and alſo the Caſtle of <hi>Warke.</hi>

            <p>What the Kings fate was, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hold, that he was kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Battel; the <hi>Scots,</hi> that many in like Arms, with the like Guards, were killed, every one of which was taken for the King: Among others, <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Elphingſton,</hi> one of his Favourites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not unlike the King in Face and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and repreſenting him in his Armour in the Field, with the Valianteſt, and moſt Couragious of the Army fought it out, and Acting heroically his part as a King, was killed, heaps of dead Bodies invironing his. In the ſearch, where the fight was, the number, Tallneſs, and the Furniture of the dead Bodies being obſerved, their Faces, and Wounds

            <p>Others have recorded, that the Fortune of the day inclining to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; four Tall men moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon luſty Horſes, wearing upon the tops of their Lances for Cognizance, Streamers of Straw, mounting the King upon a Sorrel Hackney, conveyed him far from the place of fight, and after that he was ſeen beyond the <hi>Tweed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Kelſo</hi> and <hi>Dunce,</hi> after which, what became of him was uncertain.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56522:72"/>
in hopes of great Fortunes, which would follow Innovations, and Confuſions in the State.

looking upon him, as one who could Protect her, and hers in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; but this Match inſtead of heightning, weakened her Intereſt; the Nobility dividing in two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the one pleading for the Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> and the other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him (thinking him too high already) made choice of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> but a third party ſteps in, of whom the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was Chief, who carried the choice from both; pitching upon <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi>: When King <hi>Henry</hi> heard, that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was like to carry the Day, he writes to <hi>Scotland,</hi> remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, how dangerous this choice might prove to their State: Yet notwithſtanding of all that could be ſaid, they adhered to their choice, and ſent to <hi>France</hi> to call home the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> who furniſhed with all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the <hi>French</hi> King, with eight well Rigg'd Ships, takes the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56522:73"/>
Seas, and in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> arrived upon the Weſt-coaſts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence with a great retinue of the Nobles and Barons of the Country, by eaſie Journies, the Queen meeting him, he came to the Town of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he is reſtored in Parliament, to his Fathers inheritance.</p>
            <p>At the Preſence of this new Governour, the Face of the State turned more beautiful; Oppreſſion is reſtrained, Juſtice ſincerely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; the Governour not willing to liſten to every mans Advice, gave himſelf to follow the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>John Hepburn</hi> Prior of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>; this man being of a ſubtle mind, Malicious and Crafty, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him things as he pleaſed, repreſenting the Factiouſneſs of the Nobility, naming ſeveral, whom he ſaid the Kingdom could not bear. Among others, he gave out, the Lord Chamberlain to be a man
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56522:74"/>
unpoliſh'd, Stubbornly Stout, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Riches, and Power, of a working Mind, and vehement Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſpoke againſt the Chamberlain, &amp;c. The Governour did preſently lay hold on this, and changed in his affection toward him, which the Chamberlain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, could not but reflect upon the Governours ingratitude; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſolved to Face about, and ſtriking in with the Queen and her Husband, became very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with them, he repreſented to them what hazard the Prince was in, the Governour being a man of ſuch an unſatiable Spirit, that nothing but the Crown could ſet bounds to his Ambition: Adviſing the Queen to think of a way to prevent it; they concluded at laſt, that their only ſafety would be, that the Queen would tranſport her Son to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as privately as the buſineſs
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56522:74"/>
was managed, it came to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours ears, who preſently ſent a Troop of Horſe, who ſurprized the Caſtle of <hi>Sterling,</hi> and in it the Queen with her two Sons. The Prince and his Brother are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from their Mother, and committed to the keeping of four Noblemen: Whereupon the Queen, her Husband, and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, with many others miſ-truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Governour, fly to <hi>England</hi>; their ſudden departure perplexed the Court exceedingly, which mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Governour to write to King <hi>Henry,</hi> repreſenting to him, how little reaſon they had from him to depart the Kingdom; earneſtly declaring his reſpects to the Queen; and that if ſhe, and all that were with her ſhould pleaſe to return, ſhe ſhould be very welcom; they hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were ſincere, at laſt were moved to yield to his deſires, but when once he had got them within the Country, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56522:75"/>
to be revenged upon them; this bred new Confuſions, for ſome of the Lords being impriſoned, their Friends break very looſe, the Country is daily peſtered and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, by Incurſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads, till at laſt after great loſs on both ſides, they come to an Agreement, which was followed with the renewing of the Truce with <hi>England</hi> for ſome Months.</p>
            <p>All things being thus ſeemingly calmed, both at home and abroad, the forementioned Prior of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> begins to perſwade the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, that all his indeavours to ſettle the Realm, would prove vain, ſo long as the Earl of <hi>Hume</hi> was alive, whom neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards could ſoften, nor Honours and preferments make conſtant, upon this the Governour begins to contrive how to get the Earl ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; wherefore he came to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and called a Convention of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56522:75"/>
the ſtates, having intreated the Earl of <hi>Humes</hi> Friends, that he would not fail to be there, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be determined, concerned him dearly.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Hume</hi> with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David</hi> came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the Night, before the Day appointed, who were received by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with great Ceremonies, and with more than ordinary Favours entertained, and ſhortly after, both impriſoned, and a day appointed for their Tryal: The firſt thing laid to their Charge, was the death of the late King, whom ſeveral Witneſſes proved to have been ſeen coming to the Caſtle of <hi>Hume,</hi> from <hi>Flondon</hi>; this not being proved by pregnant Evidences, he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſeveral other points of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of which he not being able to clear himſelf to their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Judges prepared and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Governour; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56522:76"/>
him and his Brother guilty, and Condemn them to have their Heads chopt off; which Sentence was the next day put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their Heads fixt upon the moſt Conſpicuous places of the City. This Calamity of the Family of the <hi>Humes,</hi> bred Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Aſtoniſhment in many of the Noblemen of the Kingdom, and greatly eſtranged their Hearts from the Governour.</p>
            <p>Ambaſſadors being ſent from <hi>France,</hi> to renew the Ancient League between the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: The Governour was choſen by the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to paſs into <hi>France</hi> for accompliſhing this ſolemn Action. He was no ſooner gone, but the Queen after ſhe had ſtayed a year in <hi>England,</hi> Honourably diſmiſſed by her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to <hi>Scotland</hi>: Sir <hi>Anthony Darcy,</hi> being by the Governour made Warden of the <hi>Mers,</hi> and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56522:76"/>
               <hi>Lothian,</hi> was ſlain by Sir <hi>David Hume</hi> of <hi>Wedderburn,</hi> coming to <hi>Dunce,</hi> to hold a Juſtice Court: Whereupon the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was declared Supream Warden, of the Marches, who ſoundly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged <hi>Darcies</hi> Death upon the <hi>Humes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdom now began to be ſenſible of the offence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; Factions increaſing daily, the Nobility and Gentry deciding their Rights by their Swords; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> who was Provoſt of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> having been with the Prince at <hi>Dalkeith</hi> upon his return had the Gates ſhut upon him; the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens pretending that, he intended to invade their Priviledges: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed a Tumult in the City, which continued all Night, where a Deacon of the <hi>Crafts</hi> was killed by one of the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> which did quite alienate the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56522:77"/>
Citizens affection, from the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>; and made them incline to the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>; this made the Earls of <hi>Arran,</hi> and <hi>Angus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to croſs each other: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed much Confuſion in the Country, and much Blood-ſhed between the <hi>Douglaſſes</hi> and the <hi>Hamiltons</hi>; at laſt having encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred one another with their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> they fight moſt deſperately in the Street, till at length the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire, having left above fourſcore of their number dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Street. Theſe broils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Governours ears in <hi>France,</hi> he made all the haſte he could home; coming to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he ſet himſelf to amend the Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, committed in his abſence: a Parliament is called, to which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Noblemen and Gentlemen are cited to appear and anſwer, but ſome fearing the Event appeared not: Whereupon their Eſtates are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56522:77"/>
forfeited; ſeveral fled into <hi>England,</hi> among which were the <hi>Humes,</hi> and the <hi>Cockburns,</hi> who were the Authors of <hi>Darcies</hi> death, others ſubmitted and were pardoned.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> being informed of the Condition of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſent thither an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor requiring the Duke to avoid the Country, according to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles agreed upon, between him, and the King of <hi>France</hi> in their laſt Truce. To which he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that what the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> agreed upon in their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace, was to him uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but of this he was moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that neither the King of <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>France,</hi> had Power to Baniſh him (a Foraigner over them where Authority did not reach,) his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, like over like hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Whereupon King <hi>Henry</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56522:78"/>
a great Army to Invade <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Now they draw to Arms on both ſides, the Governour marches with his Army to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi> where he pitched his Camp upon the River <hi>Esk,</hi> this ſtruck great Terror to the Citizens of <hi>Carlile,</hi> who offered him divers preſents for their ſafety of the Town, which were rejected, but the Nobility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to go upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground (ſuſpecting that the Governour only played the Game of the <hi>French</hi>) he was forced to come to a Truce. However the Governour reſolving to be revenged upon <hi>England,</hi> went to <hi>France</hi> where he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the King, Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pikes, and One Thouſand Lances, with which he returned home, and having raiſed an Army with them he Marches to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Beſieges <hi>Wark,</hi> but is Repulſed; whereupon much againſt his will, a Truce for ſome Months is concluded on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:56522:78"/>Soon after, the Adminiſtration of the Government was put upon the Prince himſelf, the Thirteenth Year of his age; the Governour returning to <hi>France,</hi> after which he never returned to <hi>Scotland.</hi> A Parliament is called, wherein a Peace is concluded with <hi>England,</hi> and eight Lords appointed to have the Cuſtody of the Kings Perſon quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Embaſſadors were ſent to <hi>England,</hi> to treat for a Marriage between the King, and the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Daughter, which came to nothing. The State began of New to be toſſed with the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom factions of the Queen, and the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>; the Queens Faction accuſed <hi>Angus</hi> of High Treaſon, for detaining the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will: to which the Earl moved the King to give an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſhewing that he was not kept againſt his will. But with all ſent another Letter ſecretly, deſiring by any means he might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:56522:79"/>
from the Earl; upon this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſment, the Queen, and they of her Faction Aſſemble what Forces they could raiſe, and with great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition marched from <hi>Sterling</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> with the Citizens of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and the King (though againſt his will) Marched out againſt them, when the Leaders of the Queens Forces underſtood, that the King himſelf was in Perſon in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Army they would advance no farther, but retired back again to <hi>Sterling,</hi> where they Disbanded, and returned every man to his own dwelling place; preſently after the Queen ſues for a Divorce from the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> which the Archbiſhop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> granted with the Earls own conſent.</p>
            <p>The King wearied of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> his cuſtody, conſults with the Lord of <hi>Buccleugh,</hi> and ſome Borderers, how
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56522:79"/>
he might be ſet at Liberty; they Eſſayed it by Arms at <hi>Melroſs,</hi> but were put to the worſt, then the Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> undertook it, and raiſed ſome Forces for that end, but the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> having gotten the aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> with ſeveral others, quite routed him near <hi>Coſterphin</hi> where he was killed in cold Blood.</p>
            <p>Now, the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> thinks himſelf ſecure enough, having put all things in (as he thought) to rights, he takes a progreſs to <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> leaving the King at <hi>Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Now the King amidſt his Solitary walks in his Park, bethinks himſelf what a fair oportunity he had, reſolved to eſſay by ſtratagem what the Factions of his Nobles could not perform by Force, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he directeth the Foreſter of the Park to advertiſe ſuch Gentlemen about as kept Hounds, to attend
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56522:80"/>
him next Morning, for he would have his Sport early; he Suppeth ſooner then he uſed, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to their reſt; the waiters all ſhifted, and the Court huſh'd, ſhutting his Camber door, in the Apparel of one of his Grooms, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived, he paſſed the Guards to the ſtable, where with two who attended him with ready Horſes, he poſted to <hi>Sterline,</hi> where many of the Nobility and Gentry flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, he diſcharged the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> from all Publick Offices, whereat he was ſo exaſperated, that he and his Friends, followed very extravagant Courſes, but the King purſued them ſo, that after much miſery at home, they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fly into <hi>England,</hi> where they were Charitably received, and Honourably entertained by King <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:56522:80"/>The next year the King viſited the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, holding Juſtice Courts, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Juſtice upon all Oppreſſors, Thieves, and Out-Laws there in <hi>Ewſdale</hi>; He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eight and twenty famous Robbers to be Hanged, others he brought with him to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> for more publick Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Example; yet the Borders were nothing the more Peaceable, for by the means of the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> make daily Incurſions, and Spoiles the Country; the <hi>Scots</hi> likewiſe ſerving the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with the ſame Sauce, till at laſt, by the Mediation of the <hi>French</hi> King, a Peace is concluded on, during the Princes Lives, and one Year after the Deceaſe of him who ſhould Dye firſt.</p>
            <p>About this time the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Power began to Totter in <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> having renounced all Subjection to him, becauſe he would not Grant him a Divorce from his Queen <hi>Katharine,</hi> who had been before Married to his Brother, Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and then (by a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>Pope</hi>) to him. The <hi>Pope</hi> finding King <hi>Henry</hi> peremptory in his purpoſe, did, together with the Emperor, deal with King <hi>James</hi> to make War with <hi>England,</hi> and to this end ſent an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador privately to <hi>Scotland:</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> went on with his Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56522:81"/>
Executed <hi>John Fiſher,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> for aſſerting the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Supremacy in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Upon this, the whole Conclave ſtirr'd up the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> wherefore he ſent another Ambaſſador to <hi>Scotland,</hi> moſt invectively Exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Cruelty, and humbly deſiring King <hi>James</hi>'s aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> (to try his Uncle's Mind) ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>England,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> Embaſſage. King <hi>Henry</hi> preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> who made ſuch haſty Journeys, that he prevented the News of his coming; he found the King at <hi>Sterline,</hi> a part of his Ambaſſage was, That the two Kings muſt have an interview at <hi>York</hi>; this ſo ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church-men, fearing, that his Uncle might infect the King with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the new Reformers, that they oppoſed it with all their might: Yet the King and his Council propoſed, that the Meeting might be at <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> which the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> would, in no wiſe, hear of, but departed in a chafe.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> having ſo many great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in his offer, now reſolves to accept of ſome one or other; wherefore Sailing from <hi>Kirkaldie</hi> in ten days, he arrived at
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56522:81"/>
               <hi>Diep</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme,</hi> where the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burbon</hi> was; but upon ſome conſiderations he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not his Affections upon her, though a great Beauty, but went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he fell in Love with <hi>Magdalen,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Francis,</hi> with her he was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Church of <hi>Noſtradam,</hi> with great Solemnity; and ſoon after Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but to his great Grief; ſhe Dyed within a few Months after, and was Buried at <hi>Holyrood-Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, the King (deſirous of Succeſſion) ſendeth <hi>David Beaton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> to propoſe Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in his Name, to <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> In the mean time, two Plots againſt his Life are diſcovered at Court, one by <hi>John,</hi> Eldeſt Son to the Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> who thereupon was put to Death; yet the King was much Grieved afterward, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great probability, that he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through Malice: The other was <hi>Jane Doughlaſs,</hi> with her Husband <hi>Archbald Campbel</hi> of <hi>Keepneeth,</hi> who, in the thoughts of many, were as groundleſly Accuſed as the firſt, yet both were found Guilty, and Dyed for it.</p>
            <p>The King's <hi>Marriage</hi> with the foreſaid Lady, being Concluded, they are Married by Proxie, and ſhe Arrived in <hi>Scotland,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56522:82"/>
A. D.</hi> 1538. Soon after the Queen <hi>Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> Dyed at <hi>Methwen,</hi> and was Buried in the <hi>Charter-Houſe</hi> of <hi>Perth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now began the Kingdom to be divided in Matters of Religion, the Reformation breaking in upon them, which perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King exceedingly, not knowing what courſe to take: His Council was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt violent Courſes to be followed, but the Prelates, who had moſt his Ear, gave him a quite contrary Advice; after which, moſt vigorous Inquiſitions are eſtabliſhed, and Puniſhments denounced againſt all ſuch as departed from <hi>Popery</hi>; whereupon ſome are Burnt alive, others Baniſhed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Impriſoned; amongſt which, was that famous Poet and Hiſtorian, Maſter <hi>George Buchanan,</hi> who whilſt his Keepers Slept, eſcaped by a Window of the Priſon, the Muſes holding the Rope.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> having by this time, ſo Irritated the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he was Excommunicated, ſendeth again to his Nephew King <hi>James,</hi> deſiring an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view at <hi>York</hi>; the Nobility were clearly for it, but the Church-men fearing their Bacon, was as much againſt it, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the hazard that his Perſon and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would be lyable to. After long rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon both ſides, it was agreed, That the King ſhould not altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56522:82"/>
to meet his Uncle, but adhere to the firſt offer propoſed to his Ambaſſador, concerning this Interview; which the King of <hi>England,</hi> rather than his Sute ſhould take no effect, accepts: But an Incurſion, which hapened upon the Borders, made him that he loſt all heart to the Interview; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſendeth many Letters, excuſing his ſtay, alſo repreſenting his many Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Wrongs; thus were the Seeds of Diſcord again ſown amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The reformed Religion, by this time, begins to be profeſſed by many; for the curbing of which, the Prelates preſents Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> natural Son to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> to be Supream Judge of the Inquiſition, which turned to his own Ruine; for while he is vigorouſly Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting all ſuch as were ſuſpected of the reformed Religion, having many in Jayles, and multitudes in Scrolls, to bring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Labyrinth of a Proceſs, the Supream Providence Arreſteth himſelf: For having a Proceſs againſt <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff of <hi>Lithgow,</hi> his own Couzen; the ſaid <hi>James</hi> Accuſes him of High Treaſon, for which (notwithſtanding all that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates could do in his Favour) he was Tryed, Condemned, and put to Death.</p>
            <p>Not long after, divers of the Nobility became to Favor the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56522:83"/>
which ſo perplexed the King, that he knew not what to do; he became very ſullen and retired, that he would ſcarce ſuffer his own Domeſticks to come near, to add to his perplexity, (as he lay in the Palace of <hi>Lithgow</hi>) in the midſt of the Night he leaped out of his Bed, and called for Lights, commandeth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſearch for <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> his Juſtice Clerk, who (he ſaid) ſtood by his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide loaden with great Weights, curſing the time that ever he Served him; for by too much Obedience to him, he was by the Juſtice of God condemned to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments. Soon after, News came, That the ſaid <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> Dyed at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> much about the ſame Hour of the Night. Another Inſtance of the ſame nature was, Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> a little after his Death, ſeemed to the King, to have appeared to him in a gaſtly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with a Sword in his hand, with which he thought he cut off both his Arms, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſing him, he would come again ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and be more fully revenged. The next day after the Viſion, word came, that both his Sons were departed this Life almoſt in one hour.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> finding himſelf diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by his Nephew, of their Meeting, and underſtanding the Church-men to have

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56522:84"/>
his Offer, appointeth a Rendezvous upon the <hi>Weſt</hi> Marches: No Proclamations are divulged for the levies of Men, but cloſe Letters ſent. The Cardinal, and the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> March towards <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Borders; and ſeveral Earls, Lords, and Barons, accompanied with the King's Domeſtick Servants, ride to the <hi>Weſt</hi> Borders: The Night before they rode, the King himſelf came to <hi>Lochmab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> to attend the Event.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Wharton,</hi> Warden of the Marches, much troubled at ſuch a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Aſſembly of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Riders; raiſing the Power of the Country, placeth them by a Hill, where he might take a view of the Forces. The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords beholding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> putting themſelves in a Fighting poſture, deſire to know the King's Lieutenant-General; whereupon <hi>Oliver Sinclave</hi> is mounted upon croſſed Pikes, and the Commiſſion read, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is deſigned to be Lieutenant, and all Commanded, in the King's Name, to follow him. No ſooner began the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be read, but ſuch a Tumult, and confuſed Clamour aroſe in the Army, that there was no Order kept; every thing running in Confuſion. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> taking advantage of the Diſorder, brake in among them; while they ſtand in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56522:85"/>
Amaze, doubting whether to Fly or Stand. Here is a general Surprize, moſt part willingly rendering themſelves to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> without any ſhew of Defence; many of the Nobility and Gentry were taken and carried Priſoners to <hi>London,</hi> where they remained till after the King's Death.</p>
            <p>The certainty of this voluntary Defeat coming to the King at <hi>Lockmabban,</hi> ſo Stupified and Aſtoniſhed him, that he had neither Council nor Reſolution what to follow; apprehending by this and their former Actions, that the Nobility had Conſpired his overthrow. After which he came to <hi>Faulkland,</hi> where he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over to Sorrow: Now are his Thoughts buſied with Revenge, as alſo with rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Nobility. Long <hi>Watchings,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>Cares and Paſſions,</hi> abſtinence from <hi>Food and Recreation,</hi> had ſo extenuated his Body, that pierced with <hi>Grief, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, Impatience, Deſpair,</hi> he remained af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to his Bed. To Comfort him, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters came from <hi>Lithgow</hi> to him, That his Queen was delivered of a Daughter; when he heard it was a Daughter, he turned his Face from them that read the Letter, and Sighing a Farewel to the World: <hi>It will end as it began</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Crown came by a Woman, and it will go with one.</hi> The Cardinal put ſome blank Papers in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56522:85"/>
his hand, of which they Compoſed a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Will, which, whether he Subſcribed or not, is uncertain: After which he ſpoke not many Words that could be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; he Dyed the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Anno Dom.</hi> 1542. in the <hi>Thirty-Third</hi> Year of his Age, and <hi>Thirty-Second</hi> of his Reign; not without Suſpition of having got an <hi>Italian</hi> Poſſet by the Cardinal's means.</p>
            <p>The King was no ſooner Dead (lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his young Daughter, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called <hi>Mary,</hi> to Succeed) then the Cardinal proclaimed his Laſt Will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were expreſſed <hi>four</hi> Protectors or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, of whom himſelf was the Firſt and Principal, and with him were joyned the Earls of <hi>Huntly, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Murry.</hi> But within a Week after, the Chaſe was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: For the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> being advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Lord of <hi>Grange,</hi> who was Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and Maſter <hi>Henry Balneaves,</hi> with ſome others, cauſed to Aſſemble the Peers of the Realm, repreſenting to them his undoubted Title to the Government of the Kingdom, during the Minority of her, to whom, by Line, he ſhould Succeed, if ſhe want Succeſſion of her own body. The Cardinal oppoſed himſelf, and all his Intereſt againſt <hi>Arran,</hi> but it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by many Voices; whereupon <hi>Arran</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:56522:86"/>
was declared Governor, and with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Proclamation inveſted in his Office.</p>
            <p>A Parliament ſoon followed, wherein the Clergy moſt violently preſſed, That ſevere Edicts might be Publiſhed againſt thoſe they called <hi>Hereticks:</hi> But others Propounding in Parliament, whether ſuch, of the People, as could not ſpeak Latine, might not have the Word of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Language they underſtood, as Lawfully as they that underſtood Latine, muſt have it in that Language; it was Voted <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and at laſt, after much debating, it paſſed into an Act, <hi>That it was free for all Men and Women to Read the Scripture in their own vulgar Tongue</hi>; and all Acts made to the contrary were reſcinded.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> (before the Parliament was ended) ſent an Ambaſſador to <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Embaſſage was to Contract a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual League and Amity between the Two Kingdoms; and that all Occaſions of Wars might be taken away, a Match was propoſed, by the Ambaſſador, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween young Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>; which was by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Parliament Accepted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent their Ambaſſadors to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where things came ſo far, that both Partyes declared their Agreement in all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56522:86"/>
Particulars, except the time when the young Queen ſhould be delivered to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> foreſeeing what would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably follow, if the Queen ſhould be put in their Enemy, the King of <hi>England</hi>'s hand; begin, with all their might, to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it: about this time the Governors baſe Brother, <hi>John Hamilton,</hi> came from <hi>France,</hi> who was very helpful to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in carrying on all their Affairs. At laſt, partly by few promiſes of great Things, and partly by Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to declare him an Enemy to <hi>Holy-Church,</hi> if he complied not, they make him Condeſcend to break with <hi>England</hi>; whereupon enſued great and bloody Wars between the Two Kingdoms; for King <hi>Henry</hi> immediately ſent a ſtrong Army to <hi>Scotland,</hi> who came as far as <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> committing great Hoſtilities. In compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of which, the <hi>Scots</hi> enter <hi>England:</hi> Burning and Deſtroying all before them, returning again with great Spoil.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Wiſhart,</hi> being by Cardinal <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> burnt Alive for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion; the ſaid <hi>Cardinal</hi> was ſurprized by <hi>Norman Loſlie</hi> Maſter of <hi>Rothes, William Kirkaldie</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi> and <hi>John Loſlie</hi> of <hi>Park-Hill,</hi> in his Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and put to Death; Poſſeſſing themſelves of the Caſtle
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56522:87"/>
for their Security, knowing that now they were to have many and powerful Enemies, which accordingly fell out; for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> procure an Army from <hi>France,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Monſieur Deoſel,</hi> who beſieged the Caſtle, and ſoon after took it.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> being now Dead, his Son King <hi>Edward</hi> ſent an Army of <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> Men to <hi>Scotland:</hi> The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party there procures the like number from <hi>France</hi>; theſe two Armies grievouſly infeſted the Country. The next Year the Queen was at Six years of Age Tranſported by the <hi>Weſt</hi> Seas into <hi>France</hi> (eſcaping the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, that watched for her about <hi>Calice</hi>) and ſoon after Married to the <hi>Daulphine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, the Reformation goes on, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Queen-Mother, who is now ſtiled <hi>Queen-Regent</hi> her oppoſition. She was Aſſiſted in her Deſigns by the <hi>French</hi> (as the Reformers were alſo by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) but her Death put a ſtop to the Perſecution; which gave the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> opportunity of putting things in order, relating to the <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi> Great Preparations were making in <hi>France,</hi> for invading of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and root out the <hi>Reformed Religion:</hi> This terrified the Reformers mightily; but while they were in a Conſternation, not knowing what to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56522:87"/>
do, the King of <hi>France</hi> Dyed, and their Queen remained a Widdow; this was a great Deliverance to them, for by his Death the intended Invaſion came to nothing.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Queen comes Home, and ſets up <hi>Maſs</hi> in her Chappel, which the Reformers oppoſed. This bred much confuſion in the State; but the Queen fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Body of the People, with moſt part of the Nobility were againſt her Way, ſhe became a little more calm, condeſcending that ſome Maintenance might be ſettled upon the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>About this time, the Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi> breaks out in a Rebellion in the <hi>North</hi>; to oppoſe which, the Queen went her ſelf in Perſon, and Routed him, near <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> his Sons, and many of his Friends being Slain, himſelf alſo Dying in the place without any Wound.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eaſter</hi> following, <hi>Maſs</hi> began to be very publick at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which ſo incenſed the Lords and others, That they Impriſoned ſeveral Prieſts: The Queen began to Storm at this, but they told her, That what they did was according to Law, and they would Juſtify it in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1564. The Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> with his Son <hi>Henry Stewart,</hi> Lord <hi>Darly,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56522:88"/>
from <hi>England,</hi> and were very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly received by the Queen, who took ſuch Affection to <hi>Darly,</hi> that ſhe Poſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Lethington</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, That ſhe meant to Marry him: Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (pretending her diſliking of ſuch Contracts of Princes with Subjects) labours to diſwade her from it; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand promotes it for her own ends. The Queen (with ſome difficulty) gets her intended Marriage ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was afterward Proclaimed by name, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Mary, King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Solemnized the <hi>Twenty-Seventh</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1565.</p>
            <p>This procures great Alterations in the State; for ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen of the Reformation, being Summoned to Appear before the King and Queen; and upon Non-appearance, were declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels: Whereupon, the King and Queen preſently take Armes; the Lords, with their Intention, fled into <hi>England,</hi> where they ſtayed a while under Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Protection, who afterward diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, writing to the King and Queen in their Favours; at length they came to an Agreement, which yet continued not long.</p>
            <p>For the King beginning to be jealous of the daily reſort of <hi>French-men</hi> to Court,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56522:88"/>
and of their great Favor with the Queen, cauſed one of them, called <hi>Rizio,</hi> who from a Muſitian, was advanced to be the Queen's Secretary for <hi>French,</hi> to be ſeized in her Chamber, and preſently put to Death; and finding that this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brought him under the <hi>odium</hi> of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> he made a ſhew of turning <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> calling home ſeveral of the Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Lords and others: But however, from that day he began to be deſpiſed by the Queen, and <hi>Bothwel</hi> is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nineteenth</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1566. The Queen, at <hi>Edinburg,</hi> was Delivered of a Son, to the great Joy of all the Kingdom; he was Baptized at <hi>Sterlin, December</hi> the <hi>Seventeenth,</hi> and called <hi>James</hi>; the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were the Earl of <hi>Bedford</hi> for Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who in her Name preſented a Font of pure Gold, valued at <hi>Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Crowns; the Count <hi>de Briance</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> King, and an Ambaſſador for the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King finding himſelf daily ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Queen, repaired to his Father at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> where, by the way, he was taken very Ill with a Pain in his Stomack; when he came to <hi>Glaſgow</hi> his Body breaks out in blewiſh Bliſters, which when the Phyſitians ſaw, they knew him to have
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56522:89"/>
been Poiſoned; but with their Antidotes, and his own vigorous Youth, he Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Not long after, the Queen Viſited him at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and prevailed with him to come to <hi>Edinburg</hi>; he Lodged in the <hi>Kirk-Field</hi> for his Health (as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended): But many ſuſpected that the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> had a Deſign upon him, but few durſt adventure to tell him of it: Yet the Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> told him, <hi>That if he retired not haſtily out of that Place, it would coſt him his Life</hi>; this Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moved the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> to haſten forward his Enterprize, laying a Train of Powder under the Houſe where the King lay, which in the Night time did Blow it up; but it was ſaid, <hi>That the King was taken forth, and brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alive to a Stable, where a Napkin was ſtopped in his Mouth, and he therewith Suffocated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently after, <hi>Bothwel</hi> obtains a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from the <hi>Pope,</hi> to free him of his Wife, and was Married to the Queen, <hi>May</hi> the <hi>Fifteenth,</hi> 1567. Whereupon the Lords take Armes (the Queen and <hi>Bothwel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Dumbar</hi>) reſolving to call him to an Account for what was paſt: the Queen alſo, and he, ſent to their Friends to come to their Defence; the two Armies Faces each other at <hi>Seaton:</hi> Then <hi>Bothwel</hi> ſteps out upon Horſe-back, between the Armies,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56522:89"/>
offering to Fight with any that durſt Charge him with that foul Aſperſion of Murdering the King: <hi>James Murray</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Combat, but he is refuſed, as not equal in Honour; then his Brother, the <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Tully-Bardine,</hi> Accepts the Challenge; him he refuſeth, becauſe he was not a Noble-man; then the Lord <hi>Lyndſay</hi> preſents himſelf, telling him, <hi>That he was his Equal every way:</hi> but the Queen recalled <hi>Bothwel,</hi> and would not ſuffer them to Fight. In fine, the Queen finding the Confederates reſolute, and their Number exceeding her own, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires <hi>Bothwel</hi> to ſhift for himſelf, for that ſhe would put her ſelf in their Hands; which accordingly ſhe did, and was by them conveyed to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and after to the Caſtle of <hi>Lochlevine.</hi> The Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſends her Ambaſſador to the Lords, deſiring, That the Queen might have her full Liberty; and that the Prince might be ſent to <hi>England</hi> to be Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: At length Matters were wrought to that point, that ſhe muſt of neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Crown to her Son</p>
            <p n="108">108. This young Prince was Crowned at <hi>Sterline,</hi> the <hi>Twenty-fourth</hi> of <hi>July, Anno Dom.</hi> 1567. at thirteen Months and eight days old. The Earls of <hi>Morteun</hi> and <hi>Hume,</hi> taking the Coronation Oath for

him: Maſter <hi>Knox</hi> alſo Preached the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Sermon. The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> is, within a Month after, created Regent; he preſently Summons a Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in divers are Executed, as having Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the late Kings Murder; which occaſioned many Factions in the State, and much hatred to the <hi>Regent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Queen was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed out of <hi>Lochlavin,</hi> by <hi>George Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> the Governours Brother, my Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> and divers of the Houſe of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> with their dependers waited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, and conveyed her to <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>: The Regent being at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> draws together what men he could ſo ſuddenly command, and with them Marches to <hi>Langſidemoor,</hi> where it was Fought moſt Briskly; but the Queen, though being more in number, was worſted; after which ſhe loſt all courage, never reſting till ſhe was in <hi>England</hi>: The Regent returned Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and deſtributed the Spoyl among his Friends and Dependants.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſends <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> to the Regent, deſiring him to ſend Commiſſioners to her, to give her a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their thus proceeding againſt their Queen, upon which he himſelf went to <hi>Berwick</hi> for that purpoſe: After long rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, they parted without concluding
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56522:90"/>
any thing. The Regent returning home, did not ſit long Idle; for the Earl of <hi>Hamilton</hi> pretending a right to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, conveins his friends at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> the Regent preſently went againſt him. He finding himſelf diſappointed of many that he expected to come to his Aſſiſtance, ſubmitted himſelf, and is made priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> being by the Queen of <hi>Englands</hi> order conveyed to <hi>Carliſle.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> in hopes to get her in Marriage, became mighty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to procure her liberation; which made <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> begin to grow jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him; whereupon he is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Tower, a Conſpiracy being diſcovered, which he managed for reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Regent having brought things to ſome order at home, the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible for them now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him, Killed him moſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly and Baſely, as he was paſſing through <hi>Lithgow,</hi> having ſhot him with a <hi>Hakbut,</hi> out at a Window, <hi>January</hi> the 22<hi>d.</hi> 1569. About three <hi>Months</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Kings Grandfather is choſen Regent. <hi>Hamilton</hi> being by all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, he marches with 5000 to <hi>Lithgow,</hi> to ſuppreſs the <hi>Queens</hi> Faction, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to call a Parliament; there great

Confuſion follows over all the Kingdom.</p>

            <p>He called his firſt Parliament at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> which Aſſembled the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of <hi>June</hi> following, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1624, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King declared his want of Money, and the great Charge he was like to be put to, upon ſeveral Accounts, both at Home and Abroad; eſpecially to maintain the Army which was liſted for recovering the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>

            <p>The Parliament having ſeveral Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were preſented to King <hi>James</hi> a little before his Death, un-anſwered; Petitioned his Majeſty to Redreſs thoſe Grievances which concerned Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Priviledge, without which they could come to no Concluſions for raiſing of Money; whereupon the King gave them full Aſſurance of all their Demands; ſo they immediately Granted two Subſidies from <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> four from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and three from the <hi>Clergy.</hi>

to defray the King's neceſſary Charges, he urges the Parliament for more; but they, inſtead of anſwering his Juſt Demands, fall foul upon his Servants, who managed his Revenues, eſpecially the great Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>: This came to ſuch a Height in the Houſes, that they came to the Canvaſing his <hi>Commings in,</hi> his great Revenues of Crown Demeans, which they would Revoke, and Reſume to ſupply the King's Wants; which made the King, in great Regret, reſolve to give an end to their Sitting; and accordingly the next day Diſſolved them.

            <p>Not long before his Majeſty went to <hi>Scotland,</hi> being deſirous (if poſſible) to have it prevented, he Writ to a <hi>Lord,</hi> who had the Truſt of the Crown, to bring it to <hi>England,</hi> that he might be Crowned there: But the Lord anſwered, <hi>That he durſt not for his Life do it; but if his Majeſty would be pleaſed to accept of it in its proper place, he ſhould find his People there ready to yield him the higheſt Honour; but if he ſhould put it off much longer, it might tend to his Majeſties and their great Loſs; neither could they be long without ſome to Govern them.</hi>

               <hi>December</hi> the <hi>Twenty-Eighth,</hi> 1635. the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was Born; and now great Differences aroſe about Church-matters, chiefly occaſioned by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s zealous injoyning of Ceremonies, as pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Communion-Table at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> end of the Church upon an Aſcent, with Rails Altar-wayes, with many other things not formerly inſiſted on by the Church, but now obſtinately oppoſed by many, which brought things into great confuſion.</p>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56522:104"/>
was agreed, That the King ſhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a <hi>Declaration,</hi> ratifying, what his Commiſſioners had promiſed in his name: That a general <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and a <hi>Parliament</hi> be held at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> within a ſhort time: And laſtly, That upon disbanding their Forces, and reſtoring the King to his Forts and Caſtles; the King was to recall his Fleet and Forces, and make Reſtitution of their Goods ſince the Breach.</p>
            <p>The King not finding the <hi>Scots</hi> punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to their Articles, returned to <hi>England,</hi> and Nullified the agreement reſolving now to try other courſes: Whereupon, the <hi>Scots</hi> apprehending their danger, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for their own defence.

their Paſſage; which they did, and put the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> to a diſorderly Retreat. Soon after, they took <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> and then <hi>Durham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt, His Majeſty condeſcends to Treat with them, and to that end, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Petition from them, containing their Grievances; for redreſſing of which, it was agreed, That ſixteen <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords ſhould meet with as many <hi>Scots. Rippon</hi> was a place appointed for the Treaty; here they appointed another Treaty to be held at <hi>London</hi> for compoſing all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>Much about this time <hi>Montroſs</hi> fell off from the Covenanters, having by ſeveral private Letters tendered his ſervice to the King, which came all to be diſcovered by the means of ſome that were about His Majeſty. However, the Treaty went on at <hi>London,</hi> and at laſt was concluded: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Scots,</hi> after five months abode in <hi>England,</hi> returned home.</p>
            <p>By this time a Parliament was called at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; wherein the breach was ſo far from being healed, that it was made wider. Divers of the Kings Favourites were impeached; amongſt which, Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was one, and ſoon after him the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi>

            <p>The King being returned from <hi>Scotland,</hi> (the Parliament then ſitting at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) the breach daily grew wider; wherefore the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Commiſſioners interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and Parliament, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their differences, which were now grown to ſuch a height, that the King not long after left <hi>London,</hi> and returned to <hi>York.</hi>

            <p>In the mean time matters are fitting in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by <hi>James</hi> Earl (afterward Marqueſs) of <hi>Montroſs</hi>; who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Kings Commiſſion by Sir <hi>Robert Spotſwood,</hi> to be General Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> paſſed into the heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; where he raiſed what men he could for the Kings Service, reſolving with them to divert the Covenanters. They upon the other ſide raiſed an Army to oppoſe him. Their firſt Rencounter was near <hi>Perth</hi>; where the Covenanters under the Command of the Lords <hi>Elcho, Tullibardine,</hi> and <hi>Drumond</hi> were quite routed; here the <hi>Atholmen</hi> and <hi>Iriſhmen,</hi> of which he had 1500. did him good ſervice. From thence he marcht Northward, to <hi>Aberdeen</hi>; where at the Bridge of <hi>Dee,</hi> he defeated another Body of the Covenanters, under the Lord <hi>Burleighs</hi> command.</p>
            <p>After this Victory, he went about moſt of the Northern Countries, and brought a great many of them under Subjection, though himſelf and his Army were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great ſtraits by reaſon of the coldneſs of the weather, and ſcarceneſs
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:56522:106"/>
of Victuals, yet he would not give over his enterpriſe. From thence he marched into <hi>Argileſhire,</hi> where he burnt &amp; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all before him, and returned back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Lochabor.</hi> He ſtayed not long there; when hearing that <hi>Argile</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him, and was already the length of <hi>Innerlochy,</hi> He reſolves (finding his men bent for't) to fight him, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did, and quite worſted him. Not long after, he had an abſolute Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over General Major <hi>Hurry</hi> at a place in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> called <hi>Aldearn,</hi> which did very much weaken the Covenanters. And <hi>Baily</hi> reſolving revenge, at <hi>Alford</hi> was ſerved with the ſame ſauce himſelf.</p>
            <p>The next Victory that this Valiant Champion obtained, was at <hi>Kilsyth</hi>; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal day it was to the Covenanters: for here they loſt a great many Gentlemen of Quality, beſides a vaſt number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers: yea, ſuch of their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as eſcaped this bout, finding (as they thought) their ſtrength quite gone, fled ſome to <hi>England,</hi> others to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſome alſo came in, and Submitted to <hi>Montroſs</hi> upon Mercy. Thus things being, in humane probability, brought to great order, <hi>Montroſs</hi> receives Orders from the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to march <hi>Southward</hi> with his Army: Where His Majeſty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed

Thus the wheele of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune turnes now upon this gallant Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was Conqueror hitherto, and forces him with a very few followers to ſhift for himſelf, leaving many of his Friends dead in this fatal place. <hi>Montroſs</hi> by this loſs, being brought very low, he marched toward the North with the few men he had; and after many endeavours to make up his Army again, he is ſurpriſed by a Meſſage from His Majeſty, Commanding him to lay down his Armes, and go into <hi>France,</hi> where he ſhould ſtay till further Orders; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did, though with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, in the Year 1646.</p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Scots</hi> Army in <hi>England:</hi> They after they had ſerved the Parliament upon ſeveral occaſions, and particularly at <hi>Marſton-Moor,</hi> where they helpt them to obtain a Victory againſt Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> retired to <hi>New-Caſtle.</hi> The King being brought ſo low, that he was hardly able to keep any thing of an Army in the Field, came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in diſguiſe, acquainting the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>-General,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:56522:107"/>
That he would now commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him; looking upon him as a man of Honour, that would do nothing but what is Juſt and Loyal, in a matter of ſuch weight; The General anſwered His Majeſty, <hi>He would with all his heart ſerve him, and that the moſt effectual ſervice that he thought he could do him, was to mediate a Peace between His Majeſty and His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament being Advertiſed, that the King was in the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Army; ſent their Meſſengers thither, to know upon what account they detained the King of <hi>England</hi> in their Camp; who were only called in to aſſiſt the Parliament, but not to Act by themſelves: Telling them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>That if the King were in</hi> Scotland, <hi>as he was then in</hi> England; <hi>they would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to keep him up from his Subjects there, as the</hi> Scots <hi>did in</hi> England; the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> of the Army anſwered, <hi>That they knew very well the People of</hi> Englands <hi>Right to the King to be as good as theirs; neither did they detain His Majeſty from them, but that he was with them as their King; in no wiſe under reſtraint, but at full Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as became his Majeſty to be. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it was their earneſt deſires to ſee a well-ſetled Peace between His Majeſty and his two Houſes.</hi> Preſently after, they had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:56522:107"/>
another meſſage, deſiring them to return home; for that the Parliament had no further ſervice for them; thanking them withal for the Service they had done. The <hi>Committee</hi> replyed, that they came not to <hi>England</hi> without the Parliaments call, and that the Terms upon which they were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither, were not fulfilled by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Army wanting almoſt 500000 <hi>l.</hi> of their Arrears: That upon payment of it, they would go home. At laſt it was agreed, that the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould have 200000 pound of their Arrears in hand, and the reſt ſhould afterward be ſent after them. So that within—weeks after, they would draw the Army out of <hi>England.</hi> As for the Kings Perſon, it was agreed, That he ſhould be kept by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Honour and Splendor ſuitable to his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Dignity, and that nothing ſhould be tranſacted in <hi>England</hi> concerning His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> without the Advice and Conſent of the <hi>Scots.</hi> Thus were they befooled by perfidious men, which brought a great reproach upon Them and their Poſterity. Though it be falſe that they Sold him, yet it is a ſad truth, that His <hi>Majeſty</hi> told them, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would no longer ſtand to their Agreement, than they thought it for their Intereſt.</p>

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:56522:108"/>His <hi>Majeſty</hi> being now in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>'s hands, they at firſt carried themſelves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſpectfully to him; but they began ſoon after to appear like themſelves; having purged the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> of all ſuch as they thought would oppoſe them, they began to keep His <hi>Majeſty</hi> almoſt a cloſe priſoner in the Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> hearing how the <hi>King</hi> was thus (contrary to the promiſe and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) abuſed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſent their Commiſſioners to <hi>London,</hi> to put the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in mind of the agreement at <hi>New-Caſtle</hi>; but before they came, the Game was altered (the <hi>Parliament</hi> being purged by the <hi>Army</hi>) the barbarous <hi>Juncto</hi> prove unexorable; wherefore the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, and acquainted the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty how matters ſtood: Whereupon an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> is preſently liſted under the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> with which he marches to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> but is unfortunately overthrown at <hi>Preſton</hi>; moſt of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and himſelf taken priſoner, and brought up to <hi>London</hi>; where, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he, together with the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> were Executed on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within a few days, his Majeſty is brought from the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> to <hi>Windſor</hi>; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abode there, the Officers of

the Army, and the Members they left in the Houſe, proceeded to that height of Inſolence, as to bring the King to a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Which, when it was Voted, and paſſed in the pretended Houſe of Commons, they proceeded to make an Act for the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of his Sacred Majeſty; which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>An Act of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>aſſembled in Parliament, for Erecting of an <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> for Trying and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Charles Stewart <hi>King of</hi> England.</p>

               <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gate, and the Gate lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gallery to St. <hi>Jameſes</hi>: The 24<hi>th</hi> year of his Reign he was Interr'd, in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Chappel at <hi>Windſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſacred Majeſty that now Reigns, being at this time in <hi>France,</hi> with the <hi>Queen</hi> Mother, is by Unanimous conſent of all his Subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> proclaimed at <hi>Edenburg, Charles</hi> the Second, by the Grace of God, King of <hi>Scotland, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. and preſently after, they ſent their Commiſſioners to treat with His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> who was then in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Jerzey:</hi> After much debating on both ſides, at laſt, <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> is agreed upon, as a fit place for a ſolemn Treaty.

During the Treaty, the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Montroſs</hi> was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Executed, which troubled his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſo much, that it went nigh to break the Treaty; but at length, through the urgency of Affairs, it was concluded.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:56522:109"/>
Wherefore they prepare an Army to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the command of their General <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi> However, the <hi>Scots</hi> no wiſe daunted at the Storms threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from <hi>England,</hi> reſolved to adhere to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> (though upon their own terms).</p>
            <p>The King arriving at the mouth of <hi>Spey,</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> ſeveral Lords were ſent to accompany him to <hi>Edenburgh</hi>; but in the mean time, <hi>Cromwell</hi> was advanced as far as <hi>Haddington</hi> againſt him.

            </p>
            <p>The firſt work that the <hi>Scots</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout after this diſaſter, was the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King, which was done at <hi>Scone</hi>; with as great Solemnity, as the ſtate of Affairs could allow: The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony being over, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> removed to <hi>Sterling,</hi> reſolving to debate his right to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> where people of all ranks flocked to him; inſomuch, as in a ſhort time, he had an Army of 22000 <hi>Men</hi>; but they dividing amongſt themſelves,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:56522:110"/>
gave <hi>Cromwel</hi> opportunity to paſs over; &amp; forthwith defeating a part of the Kings Army at <hi>Innerkething,</hi> poſſeſt himſelf of the whole <hi>Country</hi>: His <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſeeing (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the defeat) that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was like to Conquer all <hi>Scotland,</hi> makes choyce of his moſt faithful Friends, to venture with him into <hi>England</hi>; where he might with more ſafety and advantage hazard three Kingdoms, than in a Field; wherefore with 16000 men he privately marched to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the way of <hi>Carlyle</hi>; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable oppoſition, came to <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>; where at <hi>Warrington</hi> Bridge, ſome conſiderable Forces of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ready to cut down the Bridg, but the <hi>Scots</hi> were with them ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they prevented the breaking down of the Bridg, &amp; forced their way over the Planks. Hence his <hi>Majeſty</hi> marched to <hi>Worceſter</hi> in very good order. <hi>Cromwel</hi> hearing of his motions, ſends <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on,</hi> by a deſperate attempt, having cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome of his Troopers to ſwim the River on Horſeback, carrying their Houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56522:110"/>
and Piſtols in their hands, to ſave them from wet; whereby they put Major General <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and his men, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat: So that the Parliamentarians had a fair opportunity to make a Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River, over which <hi>Cromwel</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and joyned the reſt of the Army; which put the King upon a neceſſity of Fighting, (the City being attacked on all ſides): Whereupon his Majeſty march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the City with horſe and foot againſt them. Where followed a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate engagement; inſomuch that his Majeſties Horſe was twice ſhot under him; every man reſolving to dye in the Bed of Honour, rather than to have their Prince and Country thus trod upon by the baſe Uſurpers: But the Enemy ſtill advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with freſh ſupplies where there was need of them, ſo over powered the Kings Forces, that they were forced at laſt to give ground, after twice Rallying, to retreat to the City.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty ſeeing that all was loſt, was forced to Retreat to the City by the ſame Gate he came out at, having left the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Douglaſs,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Forbes,</hi> with many other Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Gentlemen behind him. His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was exceedingly troubled for the loſs of Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>; for that he did ſee
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:56522:111"/>
him behave himſelf ſo Valiantly, and Fighting ſo deſperately, even when he was incompaſſed with the Enemies Horſe and Foot. It being impoſſible for His Majeſty to keep the City long, the whole Nation almoſt being in Armes againſt him, he reſolves to retire: Accordingly, with ſome few Attendants, he marched out at twelve a Clock at Night; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Number might diſcover them, ordered every Man to ſhift for himſelf: Only with three or four in his Company, he came to a place called <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> where he diſrobed himſelf; and for want of Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, had his Hair cut off with a Knife; and ſo with the company of one <hi>Careleſs</hi> (who brought him Proviſion) he betook himſelf to a Wood, where he lodged in that Famous <hi>Royal-Oak</hi>: The Soldiers hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about for him, and a <hi>Thouſand Pounds</hi> promiſed to any that would take Him, either Dead or Alive.</p>
            <p>Soon after, His Majeſty rode from <hi>Bently</hi> to <hi>Briſtol</hi> before Miſtreſs <hi>Lane</hi> (ſhe having a Paſs for her ſelf and her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) whence He returned, and abſconded a while in <hi>Sommerſetſhire, Wiltſhire,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire</hi>; and at laſt came to <hi>Briggem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where He took Shipping, about the end of <hi>October,</hi> 1651. and was Safely wafted over to a Creek in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:56522:111"/>
whence he went to <hi>Diep,</hi> and there provided himſelf of ſuch Neceſſaries as ſerved him until He came to his Mother, who was at the <hi>French</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cromwel</hi> hearing of <hi>Iretons</hi> Succeſs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of Lieutenant General <hi>Monks</hi> Succeſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> makes a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That for the Security of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth</hi> (as it was then called) the Parliament ſhould be turned out, as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Drunkards, Whore-Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors</hi>; which was accordingly done, and then a new Convention is called, <hi>July,</hi> 1653. where the Government is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Shoulders, by an Inſtrument delivered to him, by their Speaker Mr. <hi>Rouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Year and the next, were Five Bloody Engagements at Sea, between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi>; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the moſt part having the Victory. In the Year 1656. <hi>Cromwel</hi> calls another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which he had ſo far ſecured for his Intereſt, that they invite him to take the Imperial Crown of this Realm; which he, as a cunning Fox (knowing that this ſtep of his Advancement would haſten his Ruine) with pretented modeſty declined, contenting himſelf with being Lord-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, which he was made three Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then they Petitioned him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:56522:112"/>
of <hi>Three-Hundred Thouſand</hi> Pounds a Year for his Support; to have a New Houſe of Lords; to name his own Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: All which (with much ado) he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of.</p>
            <p>But when Fortune had ſet him ſo High, that all the World that heard of it were Aſtoniſhed: Behold, in the midſt of his Triumph he is ſnatched away by Death, upon <hi>September</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> 1658. He lay in State, at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> about <hi>ſix</hi> Weeks, and then was, in great Splendor, Interred in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, among the Princes of the Royal Blood: His Son <hi>Richard</hi> was preſently Inſtalled in his Place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had hardly time to look about, when <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert,</hi> with the reſt of the Army thruſt him out, calling the <hi>Long-Parliament</hi> again; this Revolution was followed by another; for ſoon after, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Gentlemen in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> under the conduct of Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> roſe for the Defence of their Priviledges, but were defeated by <hi>Lambert</hi>; he immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter turned out the <hi>Long-Parliament,</hi> and erected a <hi>Committee of Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſties Friends looked on with ſome Hope all this while, ſeeing all theſe Metamorphoſing of Government, might tend to the opening a Door for His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſties</hi> entring General <hi>Monk</hi> hearing in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:56522:112"/>
how matters went in <hi>England,</hi> drew his Army towards the Borders: Againſt him <hi>Lambert</hi> marched as far as <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> reſolving to Fight him; but his men had no heart to the Work, which forced him to give way. In the mean time the remainder of the <hi>Long-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> had again Convened with ſome difficulty, and Diſſolved the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi>; inviting General <hi>Monk</hi> to march with his Army to <hi>London,</hi> which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did; and to requite their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gets them Diſſolved.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1660. Another Parliament was called at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where, by una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Conſent, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was invited Home; and accordingly, the <hi>Twenty-ninth</hi> of <hi>May</hi> following, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and attended with a Gallant Train of Lords and Gentlemen, Arrived at <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> whence He was conducted through <hi>London,</hi> in great State to <hi>White-Hall</hi>; where, by a Lineal Legal Succeſſion, He poſſeſſes the Imperial Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for almoſt <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> Years: So that, for Royal Extraction, and Long Line of Juſt Deſcent, His <hi>Majeſty</hi> may Reckon with any <hi>Monarch</hi> in the Chriſtian World.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Diviſion.</hi> The Country is divided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Inhabitants; into <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Low-land.</hi> The <hi>Highlanders</hi> live in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> Parts, or in ſome out Iſlands; being a bold and hardy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, much given to Warlike Exerciſes; being alwayes in readineſs, when ever Commanded by their <hi>Cheif:</hi> Their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons were commonly Bows and Arrows, but not ſo much uſed now as formerly; they are a People that can endure as much hardſhips of War, as any People in the World. The <hi>Lowlanders</hi> bordering upon the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> are as civil, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People; their Language much like the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> differing only in the Accent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Air.</hi> The Air is very wholſome; the cold in Winter towards the <hi>North</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp; but there being great plenty
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56522:114"/>
of Firing, the Inhabitants do not ſuffer by it. The heat is leſs ſcorching in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, than in ſome other parts of the Continent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Soil</hi> is pleaſant and healthful, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with Springs and Rivers; towards the North it is Mountainous, yet not wanting fruitful Valleys apt to bear any Grain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodities.</hi> The Country every where affordeth plenty of Sheep, Oxen, Coneys and fallow Deer; as alſo abundance of Geeſe, Ducks, Hens, Turkies, Pigeons, Partridges, Sea-Plover, Herons, Quailes and Larks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with great plenty of Fiſh, ſuch as Salmonds, Pikes, Carps and Trouts; alſo Herrings, Oyſters, Cockles, Muſſels, Turpots and Lobſters. <hi>Fruits.</hi> As Apples, Pears, Plums, Cherries, Peaches and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricocks. <hi>Corn,</hi> Barly, Rie, Beans, Peaſe and Oats. Alſo it produceth a great quantity of Tin, Lead, Copper, Allom, Salt, Hops; with ſeveral Silver-Mines. It is accounted Richer under ground, than above, by reaſon of their Mines, which when tryed, yeild much in their quantities of <hi>Ore.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THey are made of the Municipal and Civil Laws; the Municipal conſiſts either of Acts of Parliament, or of the Cuſtomes and Practices of the Colledge of Juſtice; and when neither of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, the Civil Law is of force.</p>
               <p>All the Rights and Evidences of the Subject, are committed to Regiſters; by which means men are ſure not to be cheated in buying, or conveying Eſtates. For firſt, no man can have a right to an Eſtate but by his being ſeiſed of it, which is done by delivering Earth and Stone; upon which an Inſtrument is made, called a <hi>Seiſing,</hi> and this within ſixty dayes after muſt be Regiſtred, elſe it is of no force; by which means all ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances are cut off. Next, all Bonds have a Clauſe in them for inſerting them in the publick Regiſters; and they being Regiſtred without any further Action upon a charge of ſix dayes, the Debtor muſt make payment. A Third Inſtance is, that any Creditor may ſerve a Writ on his Debtor, called <hi>Letters of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56522:115"/>
Inhibitione,</hi> by which he can make no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Goods or Eſtate, till the Party be ſatisfied; if theſe Letters be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Regiſtred, within twenty-one days after they are ſerved, otherwiſe they have no force. Many ſuch Inſtances may be produced, by which it appears how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely the Subject may enjoy that he hath, or may purchaſe.</p>

The preſent Juſtice <hi>Clerk</hi> is, <hi>Richard Maitland,</hi> Eſquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Par.</hi> The Parliament is made up of three Eſtates: The firſt is Eccleſiaſtical, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops: The ſecond Eſtate is, The Nobility and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons: The third is, The Burroughs.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt day of each Parliament, there are ſuch ſolemnities, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Shews, as is not obſerved in any Kingdom upon ſuch occaſions. For all
