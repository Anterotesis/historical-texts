            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
OF THE
TRANSLATOR.</head>
            <p>THE Artist would not take
pains to polish a Diamond, if
none besides himself were
quick-sighted enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the flaw; And Poets would grow
negligent, if the Criticks had not a strict
eye over their miscarriages. Yet it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
happens, that this eye is so distort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by envy or ill nature, that it sees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
aright. Some Criticks are like
Wasps, that rather annoy the Bees, than
terrisie the Drones.</p>
            <p>For this sort of Learning, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Nations have got far the start of
us; in the last <hi>Century, Italy</hi> swarm'd
with Criticks, where, amongst many of
less note, <hi>Castelvetro</hi> opposed all comers;
and the famous Academy <hi>LaCrusca</hi> was
alwayes impeaching some or other of
the best Authors. <hi>Spain,</hi> in those dayes,
bred great Wits, but, I think, was never
<pb facs="tcp:60843:3"/>
so crowded, that they needed to fall
out and quarrel amongst themselves.
But from <hi>Italy, France</hi> took the Cudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els;
and though some light strokes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the dayes of <hi>Marot, Baif,</hi> &amp;c. yet
they fell not to it in earnest, nor was any
noble Contest amongst them, till the
<hi>Royal Academy</hi> was founded, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Richlieu</hi> encouraged and rallied
all the scattered Wits under his Banner.
Then <hi>Malherb</hi> reform'd their ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
<hi>Poetry;</hi> and <hi>Corneille's Cid</hi> rais'd
many Factions amongst them. At this
time with us many great Wits flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but <hi>Ben Iohnson,</hi> I think, had all
the Critical learning to himself; and
till of late years <hi>England</hi> was as free
from Criticks, as it is from <hi>Wolves,</hi> that a
harmless well-meaning Book might pass
without any danger. But now this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
whatever extraordinary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
it requires, is usurped by the most
ignorant: and they who are least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the game, are aptest to
bark at every thing that comes in their
way. Our fortune is, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> on whom
our Author makes these <hi>Reflections,</hi> came
to this great work better accomplished.
He who Criticis'd on the ancient and
his contemporary Philosophers; on <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,
<pb facs="tcp:60843:3"/>
Democritus, Empedocles, Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Epicharmus, Parmenides, Xenophanes,
Melissus, Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Eudoxus,
Solon, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Plato,
Speusippus;</hi> who examin'd and censur'd
the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Polities</hi> of <hi>Minos, Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
Solon, Hippodamus, Phaleas,</hi> and all
the other Commonwealths; 'tis he, I
say, that undertakes this Province, to
pass a judgment on the <hi>Poets,</hi> and their
Works; and him Antiquity first ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with the name of <hi>Critick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed suspected that he dealt
not alwayes fairly with the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
misreciting sometimes, and misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
their opinions. But I find
him not tax'd of that injustice to the
<hi>Poets,</hi> in whose favour he is so ingenious,
that to the disadvantage of his own
profession, he declares, <hi>That Tragedy
more conduces to the instruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
than even Philosophy it self.</hi> And
however cryed down in the Schools,
and vilisied by some modern Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;
since Men have had a taste for
<hi>good sense,</hi> and could discern the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of correct writing, he is prefer'd in
the <hi>politest</hi> Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and by the
<hi>Poets</hi> held in great veneration. Not
that these can servilely yield to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb facs="tcp:60843:4"/>
who, of all men living, affect
liberty. The truth is, what <hi>Aristotle</hi>
writes on this Subject, are not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of his own magisterial will, or
dry deductions of his Metaphysicks:
But the Poets were his Masters, and
what was their practice, he reduced to
principles. Nor would the <hi>modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi>
blindly resign to this practice of the
<hi>Ancients,</hi> were not the Reasons convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and clear as any demonstration in
<hi>Mathematicks.</hi> 'Tis only needful that
we understand them, for our consent to
the truth of them. The <hi>Arabians,</hi> 'tis
confess'd, who glory in their <hi>Poets</hi> and
<hi>Poetry,</hi> more than all the world besides;
and who, I suppose, first brought the art
of <hi>Riming</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> observe but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
these Laws of <hi>Aristotle:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>On</hi> Arist. de Poet.</note>
yet <hi>Averois</hi> rather chooses
to blame the practice of his
Countreymen as vicious, than to allow
any imputation on the doctrine of this
<hi>Philosopher</hi> as imperfect. <hi>Fancy</hi> with
them is predominant, is wild, vast and
unbridled, o're which their <hi>judgment</hi> has
little command or authority: hence
their conceptions are monstrous, and
have nothing of exactue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, nothing of
resemblance or proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60843:4"/>The Author of these <hi>Reflections</hi> is as
well known amongst the <hi>Criticks,</hi> as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
to the <hi>Philosophers:</hi> never man gave
his judgment so generally, and never was
judgment more free and impartial. He
might be thought an enemy to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
were he not as sharpon the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians;</hi>
and he might be suspected to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
the <hi>Italians,</hi> were he not as severe on
his own Countreymen. These Nations
make it a Problem, whether a <hi>Dutchman</hi>
or <hi>German</hi> may be a <hi>Wit</hi> or no; and
our Author finds none worthy of his
Censure amongst them, except <hi>Heinsius</hi>
and <hi>Grotius.</hi> Amongst us he gives <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>
a particular Character: but for
such as writ in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, he
has not, I presume, understood the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
so well, to pass a judgment on
them: onely in general he confesses,
that we have a <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Tragedy</hi> above
all other people; one reason he gives
we cannot allow of, <hi>viz. The disposition
of our Nation, which,</hi> he saith <hi>is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with cruel things.</hi> 'Tis ordinary to
judge of Peoples manners and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
by their publick diversions; and
Travellers, who see some of our <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies,</hi>
may conclude us certainly the
cruellest minded people in <hi>Christendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60843:5"/>In another place this Author sayes of
us, <hi>That we are men in an I stand, divided
from the rest of the world, and that we
love blood in our sports.</hi> And, perhaps,
it may be true, that on our Stage are
more Murders than on all the Theatres
in <hi>Europe.</hi> And they who have not time
to learn our Language, or be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with our Conversation, may there in
three hours time behold so much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
as may affright them from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hospitable
shore, as from the Cyclops
Den. Let our Tragedy-makers consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this, and examine whether it be the
disposition of the People, or their own
<hi>Caprice</hi> that brings this Censure on the
best natur'd Nation under the Sun.</p>
            <p>His other Reason is our Language
<hi>which,</hi> he sayes, <hi>is proper for great expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
The <hi>Spanish</hi> is big and fastuous,

writ in their Language. Nor shall I
speak of <hi>Chaucer,</hi> in whose time our
Language, I presume, was not capable
of any Heroick Character. Nor indeed
was the most polite Wit of <hi>Europe</hi> in
that Age sufficient for a great <hi>design.</hi>
That was the Age of <hi>Tales, Ballads,</hi> and

<pb facs="tcp:60843:6"/>
is, he wanted a true <hi>Idea;</hi> and lost
himself, by following an unfaithful
guide. Though besides <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
he had read <hi>Tasso,</hi> yet he rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
himself to be misled by <hi>Ariosto;</hi>

without any foundation in truth; his

            <p>They who can love <hi>Ariosto,</hi> will be
ravish'd with <hi>Spencer;</hi> whilst men of
juster thoughts lament that such great
Wits have miscarried in their Travels
for want of direction to set them in the
right way. But the truth is, in <hi>Spencer</hi>'s
time, <hi>Italy</hi> it self was not well satisfied
with <hi>Tasso;</hi> and few amongst them would
then allow that he had excell'd their <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Ariosto.</hi> And it was the vice of those
Times to affect superstitiously the <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and nothing would then be currant
without a mystical meaning. We must
blame the <hi>Italians</hi> for debauching great

D'avenant,</hi> his Wit is well known;
and in the Preface to his <hi>Gondibert,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
some strokes of an extraordinary
judgment. He is for <hi>unbeaten tracks,</hi> and
<hi>new wayes of thinking;</hi> but certainly in
his <hi>untry'd Seas</hi> he is no great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer.</p>
            <p>One design of the <hi>Epick Poets</hi> before
him was to adorn their own Countrey,
there finding their <hi>Heroes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Et Pater Aeneas &amp; Avunculus excitet Hector.</note>
and patterns of Virtue;
whose example (as they
thought) would have greatest influence
and power over Posterity; but this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
steers a different course, his <hi>Heroes</hi>
are all Forreigners: He cultivates a
Countrey that is nothing akin to him,
'tis <hi>Lombardy</hi> that reaps the honour of
all.</p>
            <p>Other Poets chose some <hi>Action</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe</hi>
so illustrious, that the name of the
Poem prepared the Reader, and made
way for its reception: but in this Poem
none can divine, what <hi>great action</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to celebrate; nor is the Reader
obliged to know whether the <hi>Heroe</hi> be
<hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Christian.</hi> Nor do the first lines
give any light or prospect into his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi>
Methinks. though his Religion could
not dispense with an <hi>Invocation,</hi> he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:60843:8"/>
not have scrupled at the <hi>Proposition:</hi>
yet he rather chooses to enter in at the
top of an house, because the mortals of
<hi>mean</hi> and <hi>satisfied minds</hi> go in at the
door. And I believe the Reader is not
well pleas'd to find his Poem begin
with the praises of <hi>Aribert,</hi> when the
Title had promised a <hi>Gondibert.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he falls on any other business, he
presents the Reader with a description of
each particular <hi>Heroe,</hi> not trusting their
<hi>actions</hi> to speak for them; as former Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
had done. Their practice was fine and
artificial, his (he tells us) is a <hi>new way.</hi>
Many of his <hi>Characters</hi> have but little
of the <hi>Heroick</hi> in them; <hi>Dalga</hi> is a Jilt,
proper onely for <hi>Comedy; Birtha</hi> for a
<hi>Pastoral;</hi> and <hi>Astragon,</hi> in the manner
here described, yields no very great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
to an <hi>Heroick Poem;</hi> nor are his
Battels less liable to Censure, than those
of <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He dares not, as other <hi>Heroick Poets,</hi>
heighten the <hi>action</hi> by making Heaven
and Hell interess'd, for fear of offending
against <hi>probability;</hi> and yet he tells of
<q>
                  <l>—Threads by patient Parcae slowly spun.</l>
               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:60843:9"/>
And for being dead, his phrase is,
<q>
                  <l>Heaven call'd him, where peacefully he
rules a star.</l>
               </q>
And the <hi>Emerald</hi> he gives to <hi>Birtha,</hi> has
a stronger <hi>tang</hi> of the old Woman, and
is a greater <hi>improbability</hi> than all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
in <hi>Tasso.</hi> A just <hi>medium</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles
the farthest extremes, and due
preparation may give credit to the most
unlikely Fiction. In <hi>Marino, Adonis</hi> is
presented with a <hi>Diamond Ring,</hi> where,
indeed, the stone is much-what of the
same nature; but this Present is made
by <hi>Venus:</hi> and from a <hi>Goddess</hi> could not
be expected a gift of ordinary virtue.</p>
            <p>Although a Poet is oblig'd to know
all Arts and Sciences, yet he ought dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
to manage this knowledge. He
must have judgment to select what is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or beautiful, and proper for his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.
He must by a particular Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
extract the essence of things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
soiling his Wit with the gross and
trumpery. But some Poets labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
skilful with that wretched affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they dote on the very terms and
<hi>jargon:</hi> exposing themselves rather to be
<pb facs="tcp:60843:9"/>
laught at by the Apprentices, than to
be admir'd by Philosophers: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>D' Avenant</hi> be one of those, I leave
others to examine.</p>
            <p>The sort of Verse he makes choice of,
might, I suppose, contribute much to the
vitiating of his stile; for thereby he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
himself to stretch every period to the
end of four lines. Thus the sense is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
perpetually with <hi>parentheses,</hi> the
words jumbl'd in confusion, and a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
spread over all; that the sense is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not discern'd, or found not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for one just Verse, which is sprinkl'd
on the whole <hi>tetrastick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> where all
the <hi>Rimes</hi> are dissyllable, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
stronger, this kind of Verse may
be necessary; and yet to temper that
grave march, they repeat the same Rime
over again, and then they close the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi>
with a <hi>Couplet</hi> further to sweeten the
severity. But in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi>
where we rime generally with onely
one syllable, the <hi>Stanza</hi> is not allow'd,
much less the <hi>alternate</hi> Rime in long
Verse; for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound of the monosyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Rime is either lost ere we come
to its correspondent, or we are in pain
<pb facs="tcp:60843:10"/>
by the so long expectation and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense.</p>
            <p>This alternate Rime, and the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Morality throughout whole <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi>
together, shew him better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the <hi>quatrains of Pybrach,</hi> which
he speaks of, than with any true Models
of <hi>Epick Poes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, he is said to have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Talent for the <hi>Manners:</hi> his
thoughts are great, and there appears
something <hi>roughly Noble</hi> throughout
this fragment; which, had he been
pleased to finish it, would, doubtless,
not have been left so open to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
of Criticks.</p>
            <p>A more happy <hi>Genius</hi> for <hi>Heroick
Poes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> appears in <hi>Cowley.</hi> He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the <hi>purity,</hi> the <hi>perspicuity,</hi> the
<hi>majesty</hi> of stile, and the vertue of <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
He could discerne what was
beautiful and pleasant in Nature, and
could express his Thoughts without
the least difficulty or constraint. He
understood to dispose of the matters,
and to manage his Digressions. In short,
he understood <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and
as prudently made his advantage of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60843:10"/>Yet as it may be lamented, that he
carried not on the work so far as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
so it might be wish'd that he had
lived to revise what he did leave us: I
think the <hi>Troubles of David</hi> is neither
title nor matter proper for an <hi>Heroick</hi>
Poem; seeing it is rather the <hi>actions,</hi>
than his sufferings, that make an <hi>Heroe:</hi>
nor can it be defended by <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Odys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis,</hi>
since <hi>Vlysse</hi>'s sufferings conclude
with one <hi>great</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> action.</p>
            <p>After all the heavy Censures that
jointly from all Criticks have fall'n on
<hi>Lucan,</hi> I do a little wonder that this
Author should choose <hi>History</hi> for the
Subject of his Poem; and a History
where he is so strictly ty'd up to the
Truth. <hi>Aristotle</hi> tells us, <hi>That Poetry is
something more excellent, and more philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical,
than History,</hi> and does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us what has been done; but teaches
what may, and what ought to be done.
And since many particulars in Sacred
Story are neither <hi>Heroick,</hi> nor indeed
consistent with the common principles
of Morality, but of a singular, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and unaccountable dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and since in the principal actions
all is carried on by <hi>Machine;</hi> how can
<pb facs="tcp:60843:11"/>
these examples be propos'd for great
persons to imitate? or what foundation
for their hopes in <hi>impossibilities? Poetry</hi>
has no life, nor can have any operation
without <hi>probability:</hi> it may indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
the People, but moves
not the <hi>Wise,</hi>

(according to <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>)
it is ordain'd.</p>
            <p>Instead of one <hi>illustrious</hi> and <hi>perfect
action,</hi> which properly is the subject of
an <hi>Epick</hi> Poem; <hi>Cowley</hi> proposes to
adorn some several particulars of <hi>David</hi>'s
life: and these particulars have no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
relation to the end, nor in any
wise lead to the great revolution; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
is made King, but this is the work
of Heaven, not any atchievement of his
own. He neither did, nor ought to lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
a finger for gaining the Crown: he is
amongst the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> whilst his work
is done without him. This ill choice of
a Subject forces the Poet (how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
otherwise soever) perpetually on
digressions: and <hi>David</hi> is the least part
of the Poem.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may object, <hi>That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
not his Poem with all the art and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
as might be desired. Homer</hi> would
<pb facs="tcp:60843:11"/>
make us believe the drawing of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
adorn'd with all his glorious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
a design too vast and impossible:
and therefore only proposes his <hi>resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the affront given him by <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon;</hi>
as if any one particular of his
life were sufficient to employ the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
humane Wit with all its <hi>Muses</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
assistance. <hi>Achilles</hi> could not be
<hi>angry,</hi> but Heaven and Earth are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and just matter given for an <hi>Heroick</hi>
Poem. Thus whilst he <hi>proposes</hi> but one
passage, we conceive a greater <hi>Idea</hi> of
the rest than any words could express;
and whilst he promises so little, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances
are the more admirable and
surprising. But in the <hi>Davideis</hi> we have
all the <hi>Herve</hi> at the first: in the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he is the <hi>best Poet,</hi> and the <hi>best
King;</hi> now all the Author could do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
is onely to make good his
word, and make us conceive of his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe</hi>
the same <hi>Idea</hi> at the end of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,
which was given us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
whereas <hi>Homer</hi> calls the man he
designs to celebrate barely <hi>Achilles, son
of Peleus,</hi> and recording his actions,
leaves others to conclude from them
what a great <hi>Captain, Prince</hi> and <hi>Heroe</hi>
this <hi>Achilles</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60843:12"/>
               <hi>Tasso</hi> left the <hi>Episode</hi> of <hi>Sophonia</hi> out
of his Poem, because it was <hi>Troppo Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>co.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> is not content to mix
<hi>matters</hi> that are purely <hi>lyrical</hi> in this
<hi>Heroick</hi> Poem, but employs the <hi>measures</hi>
also.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithstanding what has been
said, we cannot now approve the reason
(which Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> gives) why
Poets are less esteem'd in <hi>England,</hi> than
in the other famous Nations, to be <hi>want
of merit:</hi> nor be of their opinion, who
say, that <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are not of the
growth of our Countrey. Valour they
allow us; but what we gain by our
Arms, we lose by the weakness of our
Heads: our good <hi>Ale,</hi> and English <hi>Beef,</hi>
they say, may make us <hi>Soldiers;</hi> but are
no very good Friends to <hi>Speculation.</hi>
Were it proper here to handle this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and to make comparisons with
our Neighbors, it might easily, by our
<hi>Poetry</hi> be evinced, that our <hi>Wit</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inferior to theirs, though, perhaps,
our <hi>honesty</hi> made us worse Polititians.
Wit and Valor have alwayes gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and <hi>Poetry</hi> been the companion
of Camps. The <hi>Heroe</hi> and <hi>Poet</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
with the same Enthusiasm, acted
<pb facs="tcp:60843:12"/>
with the same heat, and both were
crown'd with the same <hi>laurel.</hi> Had our
Tongue been as generally known, and
those who felt our blows, understood
our Language; they would confess that
our Poets had likewise done their part,
and that our Pens had been as successful
as our Swords. And certainly if Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
Sidney</hi> had seen the Poets who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him, he would not have judg'd
the <hi>English</hi> less deserving than their
Neighbors. In the <hi>Davideis</hi> (fragment
and imperfect as it is) there shines some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of a more fine, more free, more
new, and more noble <hi>air,</hi> than appears
in the <hi>Hierusalem</hi> of <hi>Tasso,</hi> which for all
his care, is scarce perfectly purg'd from
<hi>Pedantry.</hi> But in the <hi>Lyrick</hi> way how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Cowley</hi> far exceeds him, and all the
rest of the <hi>Italians:</hi> though <hi>Lyrick Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi>
is their principal glory, and Pope
<hi>Vrban</hi> VIII, had the honour a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him to enrich modern <hi>Poes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> with
the <hi>Pindarick</hi> strains. Many the greatest
Wits of <hi>France</hi> have attempted the
<hi>Fpick,</hi> but their performance answer'd
not expectation; our fragments are more
worth than their finish'd pieces. And
though, perhaps, want of encouragement
has hinder'd our labours in the <hi>Epic,</hi> yet
<pb facs="tcp:60843:13"/>
for the <hi>Drama,</hi> the World has nothing
to be compared with us. But a debate
of this importance is not the work of a
Preface: I shall only here on the behalf
of our <hi>English Poetry,</hi> give one single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and leave the Reader to judge of
<hi>Hercules</hi> by his <hi>foot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst the common places (by which
<hi>Scaliger,</hi> and before him <hi>Macrobius, Agel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>

the Poets, and examin'd their worth)
none has been more generally, and more
happily handled, and in none have the

more contended with each other for
victory, than in the <hi>description of the right.</hi>
Yet in this the <hi>English</hi> has the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

Here we have variety of matter, yet
rather <hi>many,</hi> than <hi>choice</hi> thoughts. He
<pb facs="tcp:60843:13"/>
gives us the face of things both by
Land and Sea, City and Countrey, the
Mariner, the Traveller, the Door-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Mistress of the Family, her Child
and Dog; but loses himself amongst his
particulars, and seems to forget for what
occasion he mentions them. He would
say that all the world is fast asleep but
onely <hi>Medea;</hi> and then his Mariners,
who are gazing from their ships on <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>
and <hi>Orion,</hi> can serve but little for his
purpose; unless they may be supposed
to sleep with their eyes open. Neither
dares he say that the <hi>Traveller</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
are yet taking a Nap, but onely that
they have a good mind to't. And after
all, we find none but the good Woman
who had lost her Child (and she indeed
is fast) asleep, unless the Dogs may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be supposed so, because they had
left off barking. And these, methinks,
were scarce worthy to be taken notice
of in an <hi>Heroick Poem,</hi> except we may
believe that in the <hi>old time,</hi> or that in
<hi>Greek</hi> they bark Heroically. <hi>Scaliger,</hi> as
his manner is, to prefer <hi>Virgil,</hi> calls this
description <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>vulgar. Virgil</hi> well
saw the levity and trifling of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and from him we may expect something
better digested.

            <p>Against this may be objected, That
sleep being of such a soft and gentle
nature, that 'tis said to steal upon our
senses, the word [<hi>carpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant</hi>] suits but
ill with it; this word seeming to imply
a force, and might rather express the
violence of Robbers, than the slieness
of a Thief. Nor can it be pretended
that [<hi>sopor</hi>] signifies a kind of violent
and snoring sleep, for here we have it
<hi>placidum soporem.</hi> Instead of <hi>Woods</hi> and
<hi>Seas, Tasso</hi> rather chooses to join <hi>Winds</hi>
and <hi>Seas,</hi> as of a nearer relation, and
going more naturally together; the
Commentators being certainly mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
who would have a <hi>Metonymie</hi> in
this place. The third Verse I can scarce
believe legitimate: the <hi>words</hi> speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but motion, and the <hi>numbers</hi> are
so ratling, that nothing can be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the general repose and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:60843:14"/>
which the Poet describes: or, if
any Copies might favour the conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
I should rather read
<q>
                  <l>—Cum medio librantur sydera cursu.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For nothing can be more Poetical,
than to suppose the Stars rest (as it were
poiz'd) in their Meridian; and this
would not only express it to be Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
but heighten the Poets design,
which by the common reading is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
destroy'd. The fifth line seems to
bear a doubtful face, and looks not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
something of equivocation: an
ordinary <hi>Grammarian</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould seek no
further than the <hi>antecedent</hi> [<hi>volucres</hi>]
to refer these <hi>relatives</hi> to; and might
construe Wild ducks, and Woodcocks,
what the Poet intended for <hi>Fish</hi> in the
Sea, and the <hi>wild Beasts</hi> of the Forest.</p>
            <p>Besides this, I find none amongst the
<hi>Latins</hi> that deserves to be brought into
comparison. In the <hi>Italian, Ariosto</hi> (whose
every description is said to be a <hi>master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece</hi>)
in this is not over-fortunate; he
is easie and smooth, but produces no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his own invention. He only
enlarges on a thought of <hi>Virgils;</hi> which
yet he leaves without that <hi>turn</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:60843:15"/>
might give it perfection. What I think
is more considerable, is this of <hi>Tasso.</hi>

               <hi>Tasso,</hi> when he reform'd his Poem,

            <p>But that we may have something
<hi>new</hi> from the <hi>Italians</hi> on this Subject,
<pb facs="tcp:60843:15"/>
               <hi>Marino</hi> has taken care in his <hi>Adonis,

            <p>In these we have more of the <hi>fancy,</hi>
than of the <hi>judgment;</hi> variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
rather than exquisite sense, <hi>Marino</hi>
is perfectly himself throughout; the
<hi>thoughts diurnal motion,</hi> I fear, will
scarce pass for a very pathetical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor will it satisfie, that he makes
<hi>Zephyrus</hi> and the <hi>South-wind silent;</hi> if he
particularize these, he should also name
the rest, otherwise the <hi>East-wind</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas</hi>
have leave to bluster. But, above
all, he tells us that the <hi>Clocks</hi> have got
the better of the <hi>Sun-dials.</hi> A thought
purely New, and strangely Heroick.
What could come more sudden or sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising?
in the latter part of the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi>
we have some strokes of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> but
far more lame and imperfect than the
original. Neither ought he in this place
<pb facs="tcp:60843:16"/>
to speak of any expecting the return of
the light; <hi>omnia noctis crant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I hasten to the <hi>French,</hi> amongst
whom none more eminent than <hi>Chape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi>
nor was ever a Poem of greater
expectation. His description is thus:
<q>
                  <l>Cependant la nuit vole, &amp; sous son aile obscure</l>
                  <l>Invite a sommeiller l' agissante Nature.</l>
                  <l>Dans les plains des airs tient les vents en repose,</l>
                  <l>Et sur les champs sales fait reposer les flots,</l>
                  <l>A tout ce qui se ment, a tout ce qui respire</l>
                  <l>Dans les pres, dans les hois le repos elle inspire,</l>
                  <l>Elle suspend par tout les travaux &amp; les bruits,</l>
                  <l>Et par tout dans les caeurs assoupit les ennuis.</l>
                  <l>Charles seul esveille—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This description is perfect <hi>French.</hi>
There is scarce any coming at a little
sense, 'tis so encompassed about with
words. What <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Tasso</hi> would
have dispatch'd in half a Verse, here
fills out the measures of two whole
<hi>Alexandrins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Caviller would object, That
since the <hi>Night flies,</hi> there is little sleep
to be got under <hi>her wing,</hi> unless for such
as can walk in their sleep. And that the
Night might have spared this <hi>invitation,</hi>
seeing those she <hi>invites</hi> are asleep alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
<hi>Charles alone is awake,</hi> and for that
<pb facs="tcp:60843:16"/>
reason, was the onely thing fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited;
and doubtless the <hi>Night</hi> was as
free of her <hi>invitation</hi> to him, as to any
others, 'twas his fault that he had no
stomack to't. And here is much power
given to the <hi>Night,</hi> which she has no
claim or title to: 'tis not the <hi>Night</hi> that
makes the <hi>Waves and Winds,</hi> and all the
things that <hi>move and breath in Meads
and Woods to repose.</hi> She onely invites
them to sleep, and it is sleep that makes
them rest. In the space of four lines,
we meet with <hi>repos, reposer, repos,</hi> which
argue the language very batren, or else
the Poet extremely negligent, and a
lover of repose. He tells us, that the
Night <hi>inspires repose.</hi> But certainly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a more likely thing to be inspired,
than rest, as more properly the effect of
breath.</p>
            <p>But without examining this further,
let us try if <hi>Le Moyne</hi> (whom our Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
prefers before all others of the
<hi>French Epick</hi> Poets) be more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

            <p>Here again are words in abundance.
He cannot tell us that 'tis Midnight, till
he first have informed us that <hi>the Sun is
gone to Bed,</hi> to a fine Bed of <hi>his own trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:</hi>
and this is matter enough for the
first two Verses. Then we are told, that
the <hi>Night of all Colours makes but one
great shade,</hi> and this suffices for the
second <hi>Couplet. Aussi triste que sombre,</hi> is
an expression the <hi>French</hi> are so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with, they can scarce name any thing
of Night without it. The third <hi>Couplet</hi>
is much-what as in a <hi>Bill</hi> of Fare:
<q>
                  <l>Item — Beef and Mustard,</l>

The second line in both being alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
            <p>Any further <hi>Reflections,</hi> or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
would be superfluous. What has
been noted, rather concerns the Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>Poetry,</hi> than any the little trifles
<pb facs="tcp:60843:17"/>
of <hi>Grammar.</hi> We have seen what the

            <p>In this description, four lines yield
greater variety of matter, and more
choice thoughts than twice the number
of any other Language. Here is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more <hi>fortunate</hi> than the boldest
fancy has yet reached, and something
more <hi>just,</hi> than the severest reason has
observed. Here are the <hi>flights</hi> of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Marino</hi> temper'd with a more
discerning judgment, and the <hi>judgment</hi>
of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Tasso</hi> animated with a more
sprightly Wit. Nothing has been said
so expressive and so home in any other
Language as the first Verse in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<pb facs="tcp:60843:18"/>
The second is <hi>Statius</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd.
<q>
                  <l>Et simulant fessos curvata cacumina somnos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Statius,</hi> where <hi>simulant</hi> is a bold
word in comparison of our <hi>English</hi> word
<hi>Seem,</hi> being of an active signification;
and <hi>cacumina</hi> may as well be taken for
the tops of Trees, as the tops of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which doubtful meaning does not
so well content the Reader, as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> Verse, 'tis not said that
the Birds sleep, but what is more new,
and more Poetical, their sleep is imply'd,
by their dreams. Somewhat like to the
<hi>Fourth</hi> we have in <hi>Marino.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Elanguidetti i fiori</l>
                  <l>Giaceano a l'herba genitrice in seno.</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a pretty image, but has not
so near a resemblance with truth, nor
can so generally be apply'd to all flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Our Author here dares not say
directly that the flowers sleep, which
might sound a little harsh, but slurs it
over in the <hi>participle,</hi> as taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:60843:18"/>
and affirms only that they <hi>sweat,</hi>
which the <hi>Night-d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w</hi> makes very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>
            <p>In the last Half-verse, we may see how
far our Author has out-done <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
'Twas no such strange thing in the
sorrowful Woman when she had spent
her tears, for sleep to close her eyes: but
here we have the most raging and
watchful passions <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Envy.</hi> And
these too instead of the lustful and the
envious, for the greater force and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis,
in the <hi>abstract.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may object, That the <hi>third</hi>
Verse does contradict the <hi>first.</hi> How can
<hi>all things be hush'd, if Birds in dreams
repeat their Songs?</hi> Is not this like the
indiscretion of <hi>Marino,</hi> who says, <hi>That the
Winds and all things are husht, and the Seas
so fast asleep, that they snore.</hi> [Canto 20.]</p>
            <p>It may be answer'd, That in this place
'tis not the Poet that speaks, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
person; and that the Poet here
truly represents the nature of man,
whose first thoughts break out in bold
and more general terms, which by the
second thoughts are more correct and
limited. As if one should say, all things
are silent, or asleep however; if there
<pb facs="tcp:60843:19"/>
is any noise, 'tis still but the effect of
sleep, as the dreams of Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
comparison might be much further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to our advantage, and more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
made, which are left to the
Readers ingenuity.</p>

            <p>SInce it is not so much to instruct, as to
exercise the <hi>Wits,</hi> that I make these
<hi>Reflections</hi> publick; I am not so vain to
think them <hi>necessary,</hi> nor yet humble enough
to believe them altogether <hi>unprofitable.</hi>
This <hi>Treatise</hi> is no <hi>New Model</hi> of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;</hi>
for that of <hi>Aristotle</hi> onely is to be
adhered to, as the exactest Rule for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the <hi>Wit.</hi> In effect this <hi>Treatise</hi> of
<hi>Poesie,</hi> to Speak properly, is nothing else,
but <hi>nature</hi> put in method, and <hi>good sense</hi>
reduc'd to principles. There is no arriving
at perfection but by these Rules, and they
certainly go astray that take a different
course. What faults have not most of the
<hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and other Poets fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
through their ignorance of these princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
And if a <hi>Poem</hi> made by these Rules
fails of success, the fault lies not in the Art,
but in the Artist; all who have writ of this
Art have followed no other <hi>Idea</hi> but that
of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace</hi> was the first who propos'd this
<hi>great Model</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And by this
all the <hi>great men</hi> in the Court of <hi>Augustus</hi>
form'd their Wits, who apply'd themselves
to make Verse. <hi>Petronius</hi> (whom no man
of modesty dares name, unless on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those directions be gave for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
<pb facs="tcp:60843:20"/>
amongst the Ordures of his <hi>Satyre,</hi>
gives certain precepts for <hi>Poetry</hi> that are
admirable. He is disgusted with the stile of
<hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> which to him seem'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and contrary to the principles of
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> 'Tis at them he levels with those
glances, that slip from him against the <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasters,</hi>
and false Declamators. Nothing
more judicious was writ in those dayes, yet
himself had not that easie and natural way,
which he requires so much in others. He
gives the best Rules in the World against <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation,</hi>
which he never observes himself.
For he commends even to the <hi>simplicity</hi> of
stile, whereas his own is not alwayes <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>
To say the truth, what is good on this
Subject, is all taken from <hi>Aristotle;</hi> who
is the onely <hi>source</hi> whence <hi>good sense</hi> is
to be drawn, when one goes about to write.</p>
            <p>We have had no Books of <hi>Poesie</hi> till this
last Age; when that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with his
other Works, were brought from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>
to <hi>Italy;</hi> where immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
a great number of <hi>Commentators,</hi>
who writ upon this Book of <hi>Poesie:</hi> the
chief whereof were <hi>Victorius, Robortel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
Madius,</hi> who <hi>literally</hi> enough interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Text of this Philosopher, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
much into his <hi>meaning.</hi> These were
followed by <hi>Castelvetro, Piccolomini,
<pb facs="tcp:60843:20"/>
Beni, Riccobon, Majoragius, Minturnus,
Vida, Patricius, Andre Gili, Vossius,</hi> and
many others. But <hi>Vossius</hi> has commented
on him meerly as a <hi>Scholiast, Gili</hi> as a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician,
<hi>Patricius</hi> as an <hi>Historian, Vida</hi>
as a <hi>Poet,</hi> who endeavours more to please,
than to instruct; <hi>Minturnus</hi> as an <hi>Orator,
Majoragius</hi> and <hi>Riccobon</hi> as <hi>Logicians,
Beni</hi> as a <hi>Doctor</hi> who has a sound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when the honour of his Country is
not concern'd. For he compares <hi>Ariosto</hi>
with <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Tasso</hi> with <hi>Virgil,</hi> in a
Treatise made expresly on that subject. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelvetro</hi>
and <hi>Piccolomini</hi> have acquitted
themselves as able Criticks, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the rest. <hi>Piccolomini</hi> deals with
<hi>Aristotle</hi> more <hi>fairly</hi> than <hi>Castelvetro:</hi>
who is naturally of a morose Wit, and out
of a cross humor makes it alwayes his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to <hi>contradict Aristotle,</hi> and, for the
most part, <hi>confounds</hi> the Text, instead of
explaining it. Notwithstanding all this, he
is the most subtle of all the Commentators,
and the Man from whom most may be
learned.</p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>Lope de Vega</hi> was the onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that undertook, on the good fortune of
his old reputation, to hazard a <hi>new</hi> method
of <hi>Poesie,</hi> which he calls <hi>El Arte Nuevo,</hi>
wholly different from this of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:60843:21"/>
justifie the fabrick of his <hi>Comedies,</hi> which
the <hi>Wits</hi> of his Countrey incessantly <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciz'd</hi>
upon; which Treatise succeeded so ill,
that it was not judg'd worthy of a place
amongst the rest, in the <hi>Collection</hi> of his
Works, because he followed not <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
Which I have precisely done in these <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:</hi>
where I bring onely <hi>examples</hi> to
confirm the <hi>Rules</hi> he gives us. And I take
occasion to tell what we ought to judge of all
those who have writ in Verse for more than
these Two thousand years. I dispense with my
self for speaking of those who are yet
living: for I am not in humour to mount
the Stage, and distribute Laurels; I had
rather relie on the Publick, for the opinion
we ought to have of their merit.</p>
            <p>For the rest, I choose rather to write by
way of <hi>Reflections,</hi> to avoid all those words
which are necessary for <hi>Connexion</hi> in a
continued Discourse. And since these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi>
may, peradventure, be offensive to
some persons of a different <hi>Genius,</hi> I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from them to hear of my mistakes, that
I may make my profit thereof.</p>

is ordinarily so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
known, that scarce
ever is made a true
judgment of it. 'Tis
the talent of wits on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that are above the
common rank to esteem of it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its merit: and one cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how <hi>Alexander, Scipio, Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
Augustus,</hi> and all the great men of
Antiquity have been affected therewith,
without conceiving a Noble Idea of it.
In effect, <hi>Poesie,</hi> of all Arts, is the most
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60843:22"/>
perfect: for the perfection of other
Arts is limited, but this of <hi>Poesie</hi> has no
bounds; to be excellent therein, one
must know all things: but this value will
best appear, by giving a particular of the
qualities necessary for a Poet.</p>
            </div>

               <head>II.</head>
               <p>HE must have a Genius extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
great Natural gifts; a Wit
just, fruitful, piercing, solid, universal;
an Understanding clean and distinct; an
Imagination neat and pleasant; an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Soul that depends not on art
nor study, and which is purely a gift of
Heaven, and must be sustain'd by a lively
sense and vivacity; a great Judgment to
consider wisely of things, and a vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to express them with that grace and
abundance which gives them beauty.
But as Judgment without Wit is cold
and heavy, so Wit without Judgment is
blind and extravagant. Hence it is that
<hi>Lucan</hi> often in his <hi>Pharsalia</hi> grows flat
for want of Wit. And <hi>Ovid</hi> in his
<hi>Metamorphosis</hi> sometimes loses himself
through his defect of judgment. <hi>Ariosto</hi>
has too much flame. <hi>Dante</hi> has none at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60843:22"/>
all. <hi>Boccace</hi>'s wit is just, but not copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
the Cavalier <hi>Marino</hi> is luxuriant,
but wants that justness; for in fine; to
accomplish a Poet, is required a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of wit and of fancy, of strength
and of sweetness, of penetration and of
delicacy: and above all things, he must
have a sovereign eloquence, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
capacity. These are the qualities
that must concur together to form the
Genius of a Poet, and sustain his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>III.</head>
               <p>BUt the first injustice that Poets suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is, that commonly what is meerly
the effect of Fancy, is mistaken for Wit.
Thus an ignorant person shall start up,
and be thought a Poet in the world, for
a lucky hit in a Song or Catch, where is
onely the empty flash of an imagination
heated perhaps by a debauch, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that celestial fire which only is
the portion of an extraordinary Genius.
<hi>One must be careful</hi> (saith <hi>Horace) of
profaning that Name, by bestowing it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction on all those who undertake
to versifie. For</hi> (saith he) <hi>there must be
a greatness of Soul, and something divine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60843:23"/>
in the spirit. There must be lofty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and noble thoughts, and an
air of majesty to deserve that name.</hi> A
Sonnet, Ode, Elegy, Epigram, and those
little kind of Verses that often make so
much noise in the world, are ordinarily
no more then the meer productions of
imagination, a superficial wit, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
conversation of the world is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of these things. True <hi>Poetry</hi> requires
other qualifications, a Genius for War,
or for Business, comes nothing near it;
a little flegm, with a competency of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
may fit a man for an important
Negotiation: and an opportunity well
manag'd, joyn'd with a little hazard,
may make the success of a Battel, and all
the good fortune of a Campagne; but
to excite these emotions of the Soul, and
transports of admiration that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from <hi>Poetry,</hi> all the wit that the
Soul of man is capable of, is scarce suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
For example.</p>

were form'd: from hence the Lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
took the first platform of the Laws

learn'd the art to govern, and Captains
to form a Battel to encamp an Army, to
besiege Towns, to fight and to gain Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.
From this great original <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Plato, Aristotle,</hi> came to be Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
<hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> took the

<hi>Homer</hi> has been (if I may so say) the
first Founder of all Arts and Sciences,
and the pattern of the wise men in all
Ages. And as he has been in some manner
the Author of <hi>Paganism,</hi> the Religion
whereof he establish'd by his Poems,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60843:24"/>
one may say that never Prophet had so

               <p>'TIs in no wise true, what most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That some little mixture
of Madness goes to make up the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Poet; for though his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
ought in some manner to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

serenity of spirit which makes the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is one of the most essential parts
of a Poets Genius, 'tis with this that he
must be possess'd. <hi>Aristotle</hi> allows that
there is something Divine in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
but nothing of Madness. These
the Vulgar alwayes confound, and 'tis
their ignorance joyn'd with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance
of some particular Poets that
made way for this opinion, to the disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the profession, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd

               <p>ONe may be an Orator without the
natural gift of Eloquence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Art may supply that defect; but
no man can be a Poet without a Genius:
the want of which, no art or industry is
capable to repair. This Genius is that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
fire intended by the Fable, which
enlarges and heightens the Soul, and
makes it express things with a lofty air.
Happy is he to whom Nature has made
this present, by this he is raised above
himself; whereas others are alwayes
low and creeping, and never speak but
what is mean and common. He that
hath a Genius, appears a Poet on the
smallest Subjects, by the turn he gives
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the noble manner in which he
expresses himself. This Character the

'tis the little Wits alwayes who think
they versifie the best; the greatest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
are the most modest. 'Twas with
trembling that <hi>Virgil</hi> under the covert
of the Night, went to fix on the gate of
the Emperours Palace, those two Verses
which caus'd so much admiration all
over <hi>Rome.</hi> This great man conceal'd
himself, when <hi>Augustus</hi> so earnestly made
search after the Author of that admirable
Distich, and he was the last that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the value of his own work: 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the great Wits never have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good opinion of what they compose,
by reason of the too great Idea of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
they propose to themselves in
their works. Happy Age, when Poets
were so modest, when shall we see those
days again! nothing is more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som

shewing his labours: and no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

the End to be Delight, and that 'tis on
this account it labours to move the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all whose motions are delightful,
because nothing is more sweet to the
Soul then agitation, it pleases it self in
changing the objects, to satisfie the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity
of its desires. 'Tis true, delight
is the end <hi>Poetry</hi> aims at, but not the
principal end, as others pretend. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<hi>Poetry</hi> being an Art, ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
by the quality of its own nature,
and by the essential subordination that
all Arts should have to Polity, whose end
in general is the publick good. This is
the judgment of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and of <hi>Horace,</hi>
his chief Interpreter.</p>

               <p>AFter all, since the design of <hi>Poetry</hi>
is to delight, it omits nothing that
may contribute thereto; 'tis to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that it makes use of Numbers and
Harmony, which are naturally delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and animates its Discourse with
more lively draughts, and more strong
expressions, than are allow'd in Prose;
and does affranchize it self from that
constraint and reservedness that is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
with Orators, and permits a great
liberty to imagination, and makes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
images of what is most agreeable
in nature; and never speaks but with
figures, to give a greater lustre to the
Discourse; and is noble in its Idea's,
sublime in the Expressions, bold in the
Words passionate in the Motions, and
takes pleasure in relating extraordinary
Adventures to give the most common
and natural things a fabulous gloss, to
render them more admirable, and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

the mind, to render it more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

the manners with wholsom instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which it professes to administer
to humane kind; for Virtue being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
austere, by the constraint it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
on the heart, in repressing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
Morality, which undertakes to
regulate the motions of the heart by its
precepts, ought to make it self delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that it may be listened to, which can
by no means be so happily effected as by
<hi>Poetry:</hi> 'Tis by this, that Morality in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the Maladies of men, makes use of
the same artifice that Physitians have
recourse to in the sickness of children,
they mingle Honey with the Medicine
to take off the bitterness. The principal
design therefore of this Art, is to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pleasant that which is wholsom; in
which 'tis more wise then other Arts,
which endeavour to profit without any
care to please. Eloquence it self, by its
most passionate Discourse, is not always
capable to persuade men to Virtue with
that success, as <hi>Poetry;</hi> because men are
more sensible and sooner impress'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by what is pleasant, than by reason.
For this cause, all <hi>Poetry</hi> that tends to
the corruption of Manners, is irregular
and vicious; and Poets are to be look'd
on as a publick Contagion, whose Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are not pure: and 'tis these dissolute
and debauch'd Poets that <hi>Plato</hi> banish'd
his Commonwealth. And true it is,
that the petty Wits onely are ordinarily
subject to say what is impious or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene.
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> were never
guilty in this kind, they were sweet and
virtuous as Philosophers; the Muses of
true Poets are as chaste as <hi>Vestals.</hi>

proposes the example of great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

the use of Passions, by moderating
our fear, and our pity, which are obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Virtue; it lets men see that
Vice never escapes unpunish'd, when it

punish'd after the Ten years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of his Crime. It teaches us,
that the favours of Fortune, and the
grandeurs of the World, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
true Goods, when it shews on the

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60843:28"/>
deploring with that pathetick ayre her

               <p>BUt because <hi>Poetry</hi> is only profitable
so far as it is delightful, 'tis of
greatest importance in this Art to
please; the onely certain way to please,
is by Rules: these therefore are to be
established, that a Poet may not be left
to confound all things, imitating those
Extravagances which <hi>Horace</hi> so much
blames; that is to say, by joining things
naturally incompatible, <hi>mixing Tygers
with Lambs, Birds with Serpents, to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60843:28"/>
make one body of different species, and
thereby authorize Fancies more indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
than the Dreams of sick men;</hi>
for unless a man adhere to Principles, he
is obnoxious to all Extravagances and
Absurdities imaginable: unless he go by
Rule, he slips at every step towards Wit,
and falls into Errors as often as he sets
out. Into what Enormities hath <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi>
run in his <hi>Africa; Ariosto</hi> in his
<hi>Orlando Furioso;</hi> Cavalier <hi>Marino</hi> in his
<hi>Adonis,</hi> and all the other <hi>Italians</hi> who
were ignorant of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rules; and
followed no other guides but their own
Genius and capricious Fancy: Truth
is, the Wits of <hi>Italy</hi> were so prepossess'd
in favour of the <hi>Romantick Poetry</hi> of
<hi>Pulci, Boyardo,</hi> and <hi>Ariosto,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
no other Rules than what the
heat of their Genius inspir'd. The first
<hi>Italian</hi> Poet who let the World see that
the Art was not altogether unknown to
him, was <hi>Giorgio Trissino</hi> in his Poem of
<hi>Italy</hi> delivered from the <hi>Goths,</hi> under
the Pontificats of <hi>Leo X.</hi> and <hi>Clement
VIII.</hi> in this Poem appear'd some kind
of imitation of <hi>Homers Ilias.</hi> This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
was followed with success by <hi>Tasso</hi> in
his <hi>Hierusalem delivered;</hi> though one
<hi>Oliviero</hi> had essay'd the same before
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60843:29"/>
him, but not so happily; in his Poem of
<hi>Germany, Victorius, Madius, Robertellus,</hi>
and after them <hi>Castelvetno,</hi> and <hi>Picolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>
were the first that made <hi>Europe</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Rules, which
were brought over by the <hi>Grecians</hi>
from <hi>Constantinople</hi> into <hi>Italy:</hi> and these
were followed by <hi>Beni, Minturno, Rico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
Vida, Gallutio,</hi> and many others.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ARistotle</hi> drew the platform of these
Rules from the Poems of <hi>Homer,</hi>
and other Poets of his time, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
he had a long time made on
their Works. I pretend not by a long
Discourse to justifie the necessity, the
justness, and the truth of these Rules;
nor to make an History of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s
Treatise of <hi>Poesie;</hi> or examine whether
it is complete, which many others have
done, all these things I suppose: onely
I affirm, That these Rules well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
one shall find them made onely to
reduce Nature into method, to trace it
step by step, and not suffer the least mark
of it to escape us. 'Tis onely by these
Rules that the verifimility in Fictions is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60843:29"/>
maintained, which is the soul of <hi>Poesie.</hi>
For unless there be the <hi>unity</hi> of <hi>place,</hi>
of <hi>time,</hi> and of the <hi>action</hi> in the great
Poems, there can be no <hi>verisimility.</hi> In
fine, 'tis by these Rules that all becomes
just, proportionate, and natural; for
they are founded upon <hi>good Sense,</hi> and
sound Reason, rather than on Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Example. <hi>Horace</hi>'s book of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
which is but an interpretation of
that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> discovers sufficiently
the necessity of being subject to Rules,
by the ridiculous Absurdities one is apt
to fall into, who follows only his fancy;
for though <hi>Poesie</hi> be the effect of fancy,
yet if this fancy be not regulated, 'tis a
meer <hi>Caprice,</hi> not capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
any thing reasonable.</p>

               <head>XIII.</head>
               <p>BUt if the Genius must indispensibly
be subjected to the servitude of
Rules, 'twill not easily be decided whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> contributes more to
<hi>Poetry;</hi> 'tis one of those questions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolv'd
which might be proper for a
declamation, and the decision is of small
importance: it suffices that we know
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60843:30"/>
both the one and the other are of that
moment, that none can attain to any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
perfection in <hi>Poetry,</hi> if he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in either: So that both (saith
<hi>Horace</hi>) must mutually assist each other,
and conspire to make a Poet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd.
But though Nature be of little
value without the help of Art, yet we
may approve of <hi>Quintilian</hi>'s opinion,
who believ'd that Art did less contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to that perfection, than Nature.
And by the comparison that <hi>Longinus</hi>
makes betwixt <hi>Apollonius</hi> and <hi>Homer,
Erastathenes</hi> and <hi>Archilochus, Bacchilides</hi>
and <hi>Pindar, Ion</hi> and <hi>Sophocles,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of all which never transgressed
against the Rules of Art, whereas these
other did; it appears that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Wit is always prefer'd before
that of Art.</p>

               <p>'TIs not enough to have a Genius:
one must know that he has it,

to have of it: and he must know well
of what it is most capable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of what
it is not, lest he <hi>force</hi> it contrary to the

on himself: and though Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is always ready to discover it self,

and there are others that are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> says, That

<hi>Homer</hi> was endu'd withall. <hi>Anacreon,</hi>

might have been capable of a <hi>great

Genius, and low Character. <hi>Ronsard</hi>
who had a Talent for Lyrick Verse in
<hi>Scaliger</hi>'s opinion, and who got Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by his Odes, fell short extremely in
his <hi>Franciad,</hi> which is dry and barren

               <p>BUt 'tis not so much to discover its
strength, that we must know our
Genius, as that we may be diligent to
form it by the help of Art, and not go
astray in the way we take to bring it to
perfection. 'Twas thus that <hi>Horace,</hi>
whose Genius was capable of all things,
chiefly applied himself to Satyre, by
the inclination of his Natural <hi>gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,</hi>
which made him <hi>Rallee</hi> so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
on all occasions. He had found
in his Nature the seeds of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
which he afterwards cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with so much success: And what
loftiness he found in his Nature, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to <hi>Lyrick Poesie,</hi> for which he had
an Inclination. For though he had a
Genius for greater things, yet by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
love of ease, which was natural to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60843:35"/>
him, he only applied himself to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
for that he was not of an humour to
strain, or give himself trouble. <hi>Ovid</hi>
finding in himself a capacity of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
things naturally, left Heroick Verse
to write Elegies, in which he was more
happy. <hi>Virgil,</hi> who perceiv'd himself
more strong, and had a greater elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Soul, took Trumpet in hand, and
raised himself by his Eglogues, and Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks,
as by so many steps to the most
sublime Character of Heroick Verse.
'Tis therefore by reflecting a long time
on a mans self, and by continual study
of his Nature, join'd with the care and
exercise of Composing, that he does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
his <hi>Genius,</hi> and arrives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

               <p>NOthing can more contribute to
this perfection, than a <hi>judgment</hi>
proportion'd to the <hi>Wit;</hi> for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
that the Wit is, and the more strength
and vigour that the imagination has to
form these Idea's that enrich <hi>Poesie;</hi> the
more wisdom and discretion is requisite
to moderate that heat, and govern its

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60843:36"/>
much stronger than the Fancy, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
how far the Transports may be
carried. 'Tis a great Talent to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
speaking all one thinks, and to
leave something for others to employ
their thoughts. 'Tis not ordinarily
known how far matters should be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
a man of an accomplish'd Genius
stops regularly where he ought to stop,
and retrenches boldly what ought to be
omitted. 'Tis a great fault not to <hi>leave

so much blam'd <hi>Protogenes.</hi> This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is the character of a great Wit,
the Vulgar understand it not; and (what

               <p>THis Natural discernment which is
necessary for a Poet to accomplish
him, ought it self to be improv'd, and
to attain to perfection by the ministry of
Art, without which, nothing exact or
regular can be produc'd. A Poet that
designs to write nothing but what is just
and accurate, above all things ought to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60843:36"/>
apply himself with great attention to
the precepts of <hi>Aristotle</hi> as the best
Master that ever writ of this Art; but
because his method is nothing exact,
though his matter be solid, I rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Rules, than the order in which
he has left them. <hi>Horace,</hi> who was the
first Interpreter of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Book
on this Subject, has observ'd as little
method, because peradventure it was
writ in an Epistle, whose Character
ought to be free, and without constraint.
This is what may be said in general of
subjecting the Wit to Rules of Art,
which the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Poets
scarce ever were acquainted withall:
hereafter follows what may be observ'd
in particular of this Art.</p>

               <p>THe Art of <hi>Poetry</hi> in general, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the matters of which a
Poet treats, and the manner in which
he handles them; the invention, the
contrivance, the design, the proportion
and symmetry of parts, the general dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of matters, and whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
the invention, belong to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60843:37"/>
of which this Art ought to treat.
The Fable, the Manners, the Sentiments,
the Words, the Figures, the Numbers,
the Harmony, the Versification regard
the <hi>manner</hi> in which the matters are to
be handled: So that the Art is (as it
were) the instrument of the Genius,
because it contains essentially all the
different parts which are employ'd in
the management. So that those who are
furnish'd with a naked Wit onely, and
who, to be great Poets, relie principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on their Fancy, as Cavalier <hi>Marino</hi>

them, than a design that is great, just,
and well conceiv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They pretend to
be more happy in the Talents of Wit
and Fancy, as likewise the <hi>Italians.</hi> The
most perfect design of all modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems,
is that of <hi>Tasso,</hi> nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60843:38"/>
has appear'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> though great
faults are in the conduct of it. And the
most judicious, the most admirable, the
most perfect design of all Antiquity, is
that of <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Aeneads;</hi> all there
is great and noble, all proportionable to
the <hi>Subject,</hi> which is the establishment of
the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the <hi>Heroe</hi> who

                     </gap>s,</hi> to the glory of <hi>Augustus</hi> and
the <hi>Romans,</hi> for whom it was compos'd.
Nothing is weak or defective in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,</hi>
all there is happy, all is just, all
is perfect. But the sovereign perfection
of a design, in the opinion of <hi>Horace,</hi>
is to be simple, and that all turn on the
same Centre. Which is so true, that
even in little things, that is to say, in an
Eglogue, Elegy, Song or Epigram, and
in the meanest Compositions there
ought to be a just cast, and that all of it
turn on the same point. <hi>Ovid</hi> did much
violence to himself to unite his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoses,</hi>
and close them in one design,
in which he was not altogether so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as afterwards in his Elegies, where
well nigh alwayes one may find a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>turn</hi> which binds the design, and
makes thereof a work that is just by
the dependance and relation of its
parts. In this the ancient Poets were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60843:38"/>
alwayes more exact than the modern;
for most of the modern express their
thoughts <hi>higgle piggle,</hi> without any
Order or Connexion. If there be
design, 'tis never with that scrupulous
unity, which is the principal virtue that
should be predominant, to make it just
and complete. I know there are a kind
of works which, by the quality of their
Character, ought to be writ with a free
ayre, without other design than that of
writing things naturally, and without
constraint, such are the Hymns of <hi>Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Homer, Callimachus;</hi> and such are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Odes of <hi>Pindar, Anacreon,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi>
that have no other Rule but En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm:
and such likewise are the
most part of the Elegies of <hi>Tibullus</hi> and
<hi>Propertius.</hi> But it must be granted, that
these are not the best and most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and who reflects on the Elegies of
<hi>Ovid,</hi> shall alwayes there perceive a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
turn which makes the design, and
this is ordinarily the principal beauty in
these little works of Verse, as may be
seen in most Epigrams of the Antholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
in those of <hi>Catullus,</hi> in the <hi>correct</hi>
Odes of <hi>Horace,</hi> and in the Phalensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks
of <hi>Bonefons,</hi> who within this last
Age, has writ in Latin Verse with all the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60843:39"/>
softness and delicacy possible. Thus
every sort of <hi>Poesie</hi> ought to have its
proportionable design; a great design,
in great Poems; and in little, a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
But of this, the ordinary Wits
know nothing; their Works, which
generally are meer productions of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
have scarce ever any design,
unless it be by chance. It must be the
work of an accomplish'd Genius, to
close his thoughts in a design, whence
results an agreement and proportion of
parts, that makes the harmony perfect.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>design</hi> of a Poem must consist of
two Parts, of Truth, and of Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Truth is the foundation, Fiction
makes the accomplishment. And <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
calls the mixture of these two, the
<hi>constitution of things:</hi> or the <hi>Fable,</hi>
which is no other than the subject of a
Poem, as the Design or Fable of the
<hi>Andria</hi> in <hi>Terence,</hi> are the Loves of
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Glycerium.</hi> The Fable
of <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> in <hi>Euripides,</hi> is the passion
of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Phaedra</hi> for her Son-in-law; this
passion causes the misfortunes of <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politus,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60843:39"/>
and the disorders of <hi>Theseus</hi>'s
house. The Fable of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliad</hi>
is the anger of <hi>Achilles,</hi> who by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or by his absence from the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Army, determines the good or ill
success of all his party; the anger of
this Prince, which proceeds of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
he received from <hi>Agamemnon,</hi>
is the truth of the History, which is
adorn'd with all the <hi>Episodes</hi> and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Adventures that enrich this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em:
and the Poet fills not his Poem
with that variety of extraordinary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
but to give delight; which he
could never perform, if he had nothing
to say but truth; and he would never
be regarded, if all were fabulous:
therefore <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Fiction</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
enter the composition of the
<hi>Subject.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ARistotle</hi> divides the Fable, which
serves for Argument to a Poem,
into simple and compound. The simple
is that which hath no change of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as is the <hi>Prometheus</hi> of <hi>Eschylus,</hi>
and the <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Seneca.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
Fable is that which hath a turn
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60843:40"/>
from bad Fortune to good, or from
good to bad, as the <hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
And the contrivance of each Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
must have two parts, the <hi>Intrigue,</hi>
and the <hi>Discovery.</hi> The Intrigue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyls
matters, casting troubles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
among the Affairs. The Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
remits all into a calm again. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
goes before the change of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
is call'd the Intrigue; all that
makes the change, or follows it, is the
Discovery. The Intrigue in the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromache</hi>
of <hi>Euripides,</hi> is, that this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
after she had lost <hi>Hector</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
had seen her Father <hi>Priam</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
the chief City of his Kingdom
burnt, became a slave to <hi>Neoptolemus.
Hermione</hi> the Wife of this Prince,
prick'd with jealousie against <hi>Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi>
was minded to kill her. <hi>Menelaus</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Hermione,</hi> causes her with her son
<hi>Astyanax</hi> to be drag'd to execution;
this is the <hi>Intrigue.</hi> Now she is rescu'd
from death by <hi>Tethys</hi> and <hi>Peleus,</hi> who
prefer the Son to be King of the <hi>Molos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
and the Mother to be Queen by a
Marriage with <hi>Helenus;</hi> this is the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</hi>
And every Fable must have
these two parts, to be the subject of a
just Poem. Thus <hi>Aeneas</hi> chac'd from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60843:40"/>
his Countrey, spoil'd of all that he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd,
beaten by Tempests, wandring
from Coast to Coast, destitute of all
Succours, persecuted by <hi>Iuno,</hi> and the
other Deities of her <hi>Cabal;</hi> After all
these disgraces, became the Founder of
the greatest Monarchy in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This is the Fable of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> with its
Intrigue, and its Discovery. And it is
to be observ'd, that only by this change
of Fortune the Fable pleases, and has its
effect, in which the simple Fable is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s opinion, because it
wants variety.</p>

                  <hi>FAble</hi> is so essential to <hi>Poetry,</hi> that
there is no <hi>Poetry</hi> without it; it is
the form and the distinction; for the

the two parts already mention'd

and it must be <hi>probable.</hi> By the first
of these qualities it becomes worthy of
admiration, and by the second it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
worthy of belief. However ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60843:41"/>
the Fable be, it can have no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
unless it be probable. The truth is,
it strikes the Soul, because it is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,

appears incredible, is strongly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd</hi>
by the couriosity of the people;
for the People, saith <hi>Synesius,</hi> despises
whatever seems common and ordinary;
they love nothing but what is prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but the <hi>Wise</hi> cannot endure what
is incredible; the publick being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

with what is admirable, so be,
it is credible; therefore it most imports

when a <hi>Deity,</hi> to whose power this
change was possible, is engag'd. <hi>Aeneas</hi>
in the Twelfth Book of the <hi>Aeneid, lifts,

by the assistance of the <hi>Gods</hi> that
took his part against <hi>Turnus.</hi> But most
part of those that make Verse, by too
great a passion they have to create <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi>
take not sufficient care to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
it with <hi>probability.</hi> Against this rock
most ordinarily fall the Poets, who are
too easily carried to say <hi>incredible</hi> things,
that they may be <hi>admirable.</hi> Thus <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
in the Fifteenth Book of his <hi>Iliad,</hi>
makes <hi>Stentors</hi> voice <hi>more loud than that
of Fifty men.</hi> And <hi>Virgil</hi> makes a <hi>bough
of Gold to grow on a Tree,</hi> in the Sixth of

the permission to destroy the ship of
the <hi>Argonaules,</hi> where his two Sons <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>

kills her children in <hi>Seneca,</hi> because

it were, the first <hi>springs</hi> of all humane

their <hi>Manners</hi> in all the Niceties

so strongly the <hi>sentiments</hi> of this

Speaker, being himself <hi>valiant,</hi> and a

only be conformable to the <hi>Persons</hi> to
whom they are given, but likewise to
the <hi>Subject</hi> treated of; that is to say,
on great <hi>Subjects</hi> are required great
<hi>Thoughts,</hi> as those of <hi>Evadne</hi> in the <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants

our <hi>Wit</hi> is too much limited, or
because we take not care to exercise on

on high <hi>Subjects.</hi> For example, how

The <hi>language</hi> must in the first place

be <hi>apt,</hi> and have nothing impure or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous:
for though one may speak

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irable,</hi> all is
despicable and odious, if the <hi>purity</hi> be
be wanting: the greatest <hi>thoughts</hi> in the
World have not any <hi>grace,</hi> if the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi>
be defective. This <hi>purity</hi> of
writing is of late so strongly establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among the <hi>French,</hi> that he must be
very <hi>hardy,</hi> that will make Verse in an
Age so <hi>delicate,</hi> unless he understand the
<hi>tongue</hi> perfectly. Secondly, the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
must be <hi>clear,</hi> that it may be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
for one of the greatest faults in
discourse is <hi>obscurity:</hi> in this <hi>Camoens,</hi>
whom the <hi>Portuguese</hi> call their <hi>Virgil,</hi> is
extremely blameable; for his Verse are
so <hi>obscure,</hi> that they may pass for <hi>myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi>
and the thoughts of <hi>Dante</hi> are so
<hi>profound,</hi> that much art is requir'd to
dive into them. <hi>Poetry</hi> demands a more
<hi>clear air,</hi> and what is less incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
The third <hi>quality,</hi> is that it be
<hi>natural,</hi> without affectation, according
to rules of <hi>decorum,</hi> and <hi>goodsense. Studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
phrases,</hi> a too <hi>florid stile, fine words,
terms strain'd and remote,</hi> and all <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
expressions are insupportable to
the <hi>true Poesie;</hi> onely <hi>simplicity</hi> pleases,
provided it be sustain'd with <hi>greatness</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60843:46"/>
and <hi>majesty:</hi> but this <hi>simplicity</hi> is not
known, except by great Souls, the little
<hi>Wits</hi> understand nothing of it; 'tis the
<hi>Master-piece</hi> of <hi>Poesie,</hi> and the <hi>Character</hi>
of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> The ignorant
hunt after <hi>Wit,</hi> and fine <hi>thoughts,</hi> because
they are ignorant. The <hi>language</hi> must
be <hi>lofty</hi> and <hi>splendid,</hi> which is the fourth
<hi>quality,</hi> for the <hi>common</hi> and ordinary
terms are not proper for a <hi>Poet,</hi> he must
use words that partake nothing of the
<hi>base</hi> and <hi>vulgar,</hi> they must be <hi>noble</hi> and
<hi>magnificent;</hi> the expressions <hi>strong,</hi> the
colours <hi>lively,</hi> the draughts <hi>bold:</hi> his
discourse must be such as may equal the
greatness of the <hi>Idea's</hi> of a <hi>Workman,</hi>
who is the <hi>Creator</hi> of his work. The
fifth quality, is that it be <hi>numerous,</hi> to
uphold that <hi>greatness</hi> and <hi>air of majesty</hi>
which <hi>reigns</hi> throughout in <hi>Poesie,</hi> and
to express all the force and dignity of
the <hi>great</hi> things it speaks: <hi>terms</hi> that
go off roundly from the mouth, and
that fill the ears, are sufficient to render
all <hi>admirable,</hi> as <hi>Poesie</hi> requires. But
this is not enough that the expressions
be <hi>stately</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> there must likewise

The same judgment is to be made of the

               <p>THis <hi>loftiness</hi> of expression is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant,
that for the attaining it,
'tis not enough to propose <hi>Homer</hi> and
<hi>Virgil,</hi> it must be search'd in <hi>Pindar,</hi> in
<hi>Sophocles,</hi> in <hi>Euripides;</hi> and it must be

of themselves, are capable to furnish
with <hi>great thoughts,</hi> as the great <hi>thoughts</hi>
are capable to furnish with <hi>noble</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
<hi>But the way to heighten Discourse,</hi>
saith <hi>Aristotle, is to make good use of</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,
<hi>and to understand perfectly their

                  <hi>this</hi> lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>which is aimed at by the</hi>

<hi>insomuch that it comes nigh to</hi> rashness,
<hi>Aristotle</hi> must be consulted on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to employ them with discretion, as

by this <hi>admirable</hi> Art, forms a <hi>noble</hi>
image of the <hi>lowest</hi> Subject; for after
all, they are still but <hi>Flies.</hi> Finally, the
Poet must above all things know what
<hi>Eloquence</hi> has of art and method for
the use of <hi>Figures:</hi> for it is onely by
the <hi>Figures</hi> that he gives <hi>force</hi> to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<hi>lustre</hi> to the discourses, <hi>weight</hi> to
the reasons, and makes <hi>delightful</hi> all he
speaks. 'Tis onely by the most lively
<hi>Figures</hi> of Eloquence that all the <hi>emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the Soul become fervent and
passionate: <hi>Nature</hi> must be the onely
guide that can be propos'd in the use of

               <p>BUt examining well, one shall find
that <hi>Heroick Poetry</hi> is not so much
in use among the <hi>French,</hi> as some would

reason they want a <hi>Genius</hi> for that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi>

               <p>THe most important and most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

of <hi>beautiful</hi> and pleasant in <hi>Nature,</hi> that
he may form thereof <hi>perpetual images:</hi>

should <hi>please.</hi> It is not enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
<hi>Nature,</hi> which in certain places is
<hi>rude</hi> and unpleasant; he must choose in
<hi>her</hi> what is <hi>beautiful,</hi> from what is <hi>not:
she</hi> has her <hi>secret graces</hi> in Subjects, which
<hi>he</hi> must discover. How <hi>clear-sighted</hi>
must a Poet be, to discern what to
choose, and what to refuse, without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking,
that he may avoid the object
that will not <hi>please,</hi> and retain what will?
<hi>Nicander, Aratus, Lucretius,</hi> in the <hi>descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>
they have made of <hi>natural</hi> things,
wanted this admirable <hi>secret,</hi> which <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>
afterwards found out: he had the
Art to give <hi>delight</hi> whilst he <hi>instructed</hi>
by the pleasant images, and most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
strokes of <hi>Poetry,</hi> which adorn his

               <p>THere is a particular <hi>Rhetorick</hi> for

               <p>NExt to <hi>Order,</hi> the greatest delight of

and from the <hi>Passions,</hi> when they are

saith <hi>Horace</hi> to the Poets, <hi>learn
well to distinguish the Manners of every
Age, and the Characters proper to them in
general and in particular.</hi> It was by this
great secret that <hi>Menander</hi> got that high
reputation at <hi>Athens,</hi> as appears by the
testimony of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and that <hi>Terence</hi>
so exceedingly pleased the <hi>Romans;</hi>
never Poet better understood the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
than these two. <hi>Plato</hi> affirms, in
the Ninth Book of his <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
that <hi>Homer</hi> had particularly signaliz'd
himself by the <hi>Manners</hi> of men which
he had describ'd in his Poems to the
life. But that I may not repeat what
hath been said in the <hi>Twenty fifth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi>
I proceed to the <hi>Passions</hi> which
give no less grace to <hi>Poetry,</hi> than the
<hi>Manners:</hi> when the Poet has found the
Art to make them move by their <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60843:54"/>
springs. Without the Passio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and life of it; but the secret is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
them according to the several
estates and different degrees from their
birth: and in this distinction consists all
the <hi>delicacy,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Passions</hi> ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Soul. Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi> falls into a
<hi>Swound</hi> on the Stage, the better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all the <hi>weight</hi> of her sorrow that
could not be represented by words. But
<hi>Achilles</hi> appears with too much <hi>calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and tranquility at the sacrifice of
<hi>Iphigenia,</hi> design'd for him in marriage
by <hi>Agamemnon:</hi> his grief has expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the tenderness of a <hi>Father,</hi> to take, as he
ought, the <hi>sentiments</hi> of a <hi>King;</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
his own interest, to provide for
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60843:55"/>
the <hi>publick. Seneca,</hi> so little <hi>natural</hi> as
he is, omits not to have of these strokes
that distinguish the passion, as that of
<hi>Phaeara</hi> in the second Act of his <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus;</hi>
for the affects a negligence of her
person, and considered it as not very
proper to please a <hi>Hunter,</hi> who hated <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi>
and neatness. 'Tis finally this
exact distinction of the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of <hi>passion,</hi> that is of most effect in
<hi>Poetry:</hi> for this gives the draught of
Nature, and is the most infallible <hi>spring</hi>
for moving the Soul; but it is good to
observe that the most ardent and lively
<hi>passions</hi> become <hi>cold</hi> and dead, if they
be not well managed, or be not in
their place. The Poet must judge when
there must be a <hi>calm,</hi> and when there
must be <hi>trouble;</hi> for nothing is more
ridiculous, than <hi>passion</hi> out of season.
But it is not enough to move a <hi>passion</hi> by
a <hi>notable</hi> incident, there must be Art to
<hi>conduct</hi> it, so far as it should go; for
by a <hi>passion</hi> that is imperfect and <hi>abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
the Soul of the <hi>Spectator</hi> may be

generally all the Poets by this
Art; whether the <hi>nature</hi> of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was favourable to him, by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
in the numbers, and by the noble
sound of the words: or that the <hi>delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of his ear made him perceive this
<hi>grace,</hi> whereof the other Poets of his
time were not sensible; for his Verse
sound the most <hi>harmoniously</hi> that can be
imagin'd. <hi>Atheneus</hi> pretends that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more proper to be sung than
the verses of <hi>Homer,</hi> so <hi>natural</hi> is the
<hi>harmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Poet, or hear him read, but I feel,
what is found in a Battel, when the
<hi>Trumpets</hi> are heard. <hi>Virgil,</hi> who had a
<hi>nice ear,</hi> did not imitate <hi>Homer</hi> in this,
further than the <hi>harshness,</hi> or rather the
heaviness of the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> permitted
him. <hi>Ennius</hi> had not then in his dayes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60843:56"/>
discover'd this <hi>grace,</hi> which is in the
<hi>numbers,</hi> whereof appears no footstep
in his verse. <hi>Lucretius</hi> perceived it first,
but gave only the imperfect strokes of
this beauty in <hi>versification,</hi> which <hi>Virgil</hi>
finish'd so far as the language was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
The other Poets, as <hi>Ovid</hi> in his

that have writ in <hi>Latin</hi> of late dayes,
those who could attain to the <hi>numbers</hi>

where the <hi>decorum</hi> is strictly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd

which are too <hi>polite:</hi> in like

who gives his <hi>wit</hi> too much <hi>swinge,</hi>
and is ever <hi>foisting</hi> in his own Fancies

               <p>ANd to close, in a last <hi>Reflection,</hi> all

well, and to <hi>execute</hi> happily what he

a <hi>Painter,</hi> which serve to give <hi>lustre</hi> to
the other parts of his work. 'Tis the
fault of the mean <hi>wits,</hi> to express things
more <hi>high</hi> than they ought to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
So, the Poet must take heed that
he run not with the young <hi>Writers</hi> into
the <hi>florid</hi> stile, by his excessive orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and far-fetch't beauties; that he
retrench boldly what is too luxuriant,

it ought to be; for all he <hi>speaks</hi> is worth
nothing, if he will be speaking <hi>too fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
The course he must take to come at
<hi>good sense,</hi> is to have yet a greater care
in his expression of <hi>things,</hi> than in his

matter to impose, seeing what <hi>glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</hi>
was more respected than what was

it is the greatest work that humane wit

               <p>BUt another hinderance to this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,

for such will make nothing <hi>exact</hi> in

is ordinary with Poets that have <hi>wit,</hi>
and little judgment: they endeavour to
hide what is irregular in their Works
by <hi>glittering faults,</hi> and false beauties;
but they must have a great judgment
and wisdom to sustain a great <hi>design</hi> in

                  <hi>POesie</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> is a picture or <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of an <hi>action;</hi> and <hi>Heroick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esie</hi>
is the <hi>imitation</hi> or picture of an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
action,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> informs us. The
qualifications he gives to this <hi>action,</hi> are,
that it be <hi>one</hi> and <hi>simple, true,</hi> or that
passes for true, and that it ought to be
<hi>happy, commendable,</hi> and <hi>entire.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that it must be one and <hi>simple,</hi> to
avoid confusion; that it must be <hi>true,</hi> to
deserve credit; happy and <hi>commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
to serve for a pattern and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the <hi>Grandees,</hi> and to be a <hi>publick</hi>
example of virtue. Finally, it must be
<hi>entire,</hi> that there may be nothing in it
imperfect. These conditions are so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to the <hi>action,</hi> which is to serve
for the <hi>Subject</hi> of an <hi>Heroick Poem,</hi> that
it is altogether defective, if any one of
them be wanting; but to the end the
<hi>action</hi> may be entirely perfect in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,
all must go in a direct line to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the merit of the <hi>Heroc,</hi> and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
him from all others: as the
figures in a Table ought to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so <hi>shining</hi> either by the colours,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60843:63"/>
or by the lights that may divert the eyes
from the <hi>principal</hi> figure. 'Tis in this
that <hi>Tasso</hi> was mistaken, who in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
of the <hi>Conquest of Hierusalem,</hi> makes
<hi>Rinaldo</hi> do all that is <hi>shining</hi> and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
it is <hi>Rinaldo</hi> that slays <hi>Adra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,
Tysapharnes, Solyman,</hi> and all the
principal Leaders of the Enemy: 'Tis
<hi>he</hi> that breaks the <hi>Charm</hi> of the <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Forest;</hi> the most important <hi>Episodes</hi>
are reserv'd for him; nothing is done
in his absence: he alone is call'd out to
all the great actions. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> who is
the <hi>Heroe,</hi> has nothing to do; and it is
in vain that <hi>Tasso</hi> would excuse this fault
by the <hi>Allegory,</hi> in a long Treatise made
to that end; that is to justifie one <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi>
with another. <hi>Homer,</hi> whose sense
was more right, by a spirit altogether
contrary, makes <hi>Achilles,</hi> who is his
<hi>Heroe,</hi> do all; though it is true, he
strayes sometimes too far from him, and
forgets him. <hi>Virgil</hi> never falls into this
fault: one shall never lose the sight of
<hi>Aeneas</hi> in the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> as they do of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
in the <hi>Iliad.</hi>

               <p>THe <hi>action</hi> must neither be too <hi>vast,</hi>
nor too much <hi>limited,</hi> it must have
a just greatness within the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of an <hi>heroick action,</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The War of <hi>Troy</hi> that lasted ten
years, had been a matter disproportion'd
for a Poem; so great an object had
tyr'd the <hi>wit,</hi> and a natural <hi>action</hi> of the
same man cannot regularly be of that
continuance; but neither ought it to be
too much <hi>limited,</hi> lest it become despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
by the littleness. Hence it is that
the Poem of <hi>Gabriel Chiabrera</hi> on the
the <hi>Conquest</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> by <hi>Amedee</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
is in some measures defective in the
<hi>action,</hi> which lasts but four days. For
great atchievments, to be extraordinary,
are not perform'd but by slow means,
and <hi>intrigues</hi> wrought and woven with
a long thread: with persons often ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and remote: more time is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Besides in the precipitation of so short

               <p>THe <hi>unity</hi> of the action, however

               <p>IT is particularly by the Art of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodes,</hi>
that this great variey of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which adorn a Poem, is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the principal <hi>action;</hi> but though the
<hi>Episodes</hi> are a kind of digression from
the subject, being an adventure wholly
forreign, that is added to the principal
<hi>action</hi> to adorn it; yet, however, it
ought to have a natural relation to the
principal action, to make thereof a work
that hath <hi>order</hi> and proportion: and
therefore must the <hi>decorum</hi> of <hi>persons,</hi>
of <hi>time,</hi> and of <hi>place,</hi> be preserv'd.
without this condition the <hi>Episode</hi> is no
longer <hi>probable,</hi> and there appears an <hi>air</hi>
of affectation, which becomes ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Which <hi>Horace</hi> reproaches to the
witless Poets, who would be <hi>gay</hi> on
grave subjects, and search forreign orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
where only the natural were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
The <hi>Episodes</hi> of <hi>Lucan,</hi> who makes
long Scholastick dissertations and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
meerly speculative, on things that
fall in his way, shew much of constraint
and affectation. But besides, that the
<hi>Episode</hi> must be natural, and never far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch't;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60843:65"/>
it is to be handled with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
management and dexterity, that it
may not lie in the way to make confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor burthen the subject with too
much action. 'Tis for this cause <hi>Aristotle</hi>
so greatly blames the <hi>Episodical Fables;</hi>
and it is also in this that the art of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
principally appears, who never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
any thing in the throng of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
he represents: never was Poem
more charg'd with matter than the <hi>Iliad,</hi>
yet never any thing appear'd more sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or more natural; for every thing
there is in due order. Any too licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Paracronism</hi> may render an <hi>Episode</hi>
defective and imperfect, though that of
<hi>Dido</hi> in the <hi>fourth</hi> of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,
by the admirable effect it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth;
and in so great an <hi>elongation</hi> of
times as those of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido,</hi> the
Poet need not be a slave to <hi>Chronology.</hi>
The most natural <hi>Episodes</hi> are most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to circumstantiate the principal
action best, that are the <hi>causes,</hi> the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi>
the <hi>beginning,</hi> and the <hi>consequences</hi>
of it; but we find not alwayes these
qualifications in <hi>Tasso,</hi> who seeks to
please often by passages that are too

whose <hi>Episodes</hi> are too affected, never

one would fall into the same fault with
the impertinent <hi>scribler,</hi> whom <hi>Horace</hi>
makes ridiculous, who begun his Poem

<hi>and</hi> Leda, and <hi>with the birth of</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
who was the cause of the War. For
to render the <hi>Narration</hi> more insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
delightful, and surprising, the Poet
must confound the <hi>natural</hi> order of times
and things, to make thereof one purely
<hi>artificial.</hi> 'Tis by this Maxim, that the
Poem of <hi>Nonnus</hi> upon <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baid</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60843:66"/>
of <hi>Statius,</hi> and the Poems of the

               <p>THe principal Character of an <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi>
Poem, consists in the <hi>Narration;</hi>
'tis in this that it is oppos'd to the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,</hi>
which consists altogether in
the <hi>action:</hi> but as nothing is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
than to relate things, as one ought,
the Poet must employ all his art to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
herein. The qualities a <hi>Narration</hi>
must have, to be perfect, are these; it
must be <hi>short</hi> and succinct, that nothing
may be idle, flat, or tedious; it must be
<hi>lively,</hi> quick, and delightful, that it may
have nothing but what is attractive: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
it must be <hi>simple</hi> and natural; but
it is a great art, to know to relate things
simply and yet the <hi>simplicity</hi> not appear.
The most ordinary graces of a <hi>Narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
must come from the <hi>figures,</hi> the <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi>
and from all those delicate <hi>turns,</hi>
that carry the Reader from one thing to
another, without his regarding it; and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60843:67"/>
in this chiefly consists all the artifice of
the <hi>Narration.</hi> It must never pour out
all the matter, that some place may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be left for the natural Reflections
of the Reader; it must likewise avoid
the particulars and the length of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
description. <hi>Homer, great speaker as
he is, amuses not himself,</hi> sayes <hi>Lucian, to
discourse of the torments of the unhappy
in Hell, when</hi> Ulysses <hi>descended thither;
though this was a fair occasion for him.</hi>
But the Poet, when he is judicious,
makes no <hi>descriptions</hi> but to clear the
matters, and never to shew his Wit. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
the Narration must be <hi>delightsom,</hi>
not only by the variety of <hi>things</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
but likewise by the variety of the
<hi>numbers.</hi> 'Tis this variety that makes
the Greek <hi>versification</hi> more harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and more proper for <hi>Narration,</hi> than
the Latin; and though <hi>Tasso</hi> has been
successful enough in the <hi>Narrations</hi> of
his Poem, and likewise <hi>Ariosto,</hi> who, to
me, seems more natural than he; yet
the <hi>pauses</hi> and interruptions to which
the <hi>Italian Poesie</hi> is subjected, by the
<hi>Stanza's,</hi> do weaken, methinks, and
enervate that force and vigour, which
makes one part of the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Verse.</hi> That <hi>Monotomie</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrin</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60843:67"/>
Verse which can suffer no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
nor any variety of numbers,
seems, to me, likewise a great weakness
in the <hi>French Poetry:</hi> and though the
vigour of the Verse might be sustain'd
either by the great Subjects, or by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> above the
common rate, yet this sort of Verse will
grow tedious and irksom in a <hi>long</hi> Poem.
For the rest, one shall scarce ever meet
with <hi>Narrations</hi> that are continued with
the same force and the same spirit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi> It is true,
the <hi>Narration</hi> of the death of <hi>Polyxena</hi>
in the <hi>Hecuba</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> is the most
lively and most moving in the world;
and that of <hi>Tecmessa</hi> in the <hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles,</hi>
is the most tender and most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
that can be imagin'd. 'Tis by
these great Models that a Poet must
learn to be <hi>pathetical</hi> in what he relates,
without amusing himself to make subtle
and witty <hi>Narrations,</hi> by ridiculous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations.
In the other Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Poets, are found onely some imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
essayes of <hi>Narrations.</hi> He, among
the Moderns, who has the best <hi>Genius</hi> to
sustain all the Nobleness of a Narration
in Heroick Verse, is <hi>Hierom Vida</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Alba,</hi> in his Poem <hi>on the death of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60843:68"/>
Christ;</hi> and if sometimes he fell not
into low expressions, and harshnesses
like those of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> his stile had been
incomparable. <hi>Scaliger</hi> objects against
the long Narrations, which <hi>Homer</hi> makes
his <hi>Heroes</hi> speak in <hi>the heat and fury of a
Battel,</hi> in effect this is neither <hi>natural</hi> nor
<hi>probable;</hi> neither can I approve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
of <hi>Alcina</hi>'s Palace in <hi>Ariosto,</hi>
nor of <hi>Armida</hi>'s in <hi>Tasso,</hi> no more than
the <hi>particulars</hi> of the pleasant things
which both of them mix in their <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi>
hereby they degenerate from
their <hi>Character,</hi> and shew a kind of <hi>pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,</hi>
that is in no wise conformable to
the <hi>gravity</hi> of an Heroick Poem, where
all ought to be <hi>majestick.</hi>

               <p>NOthing is more essential to an <hi>Epick</hi>
Poem than <hi>Fiction,</hi> which ought
to <hi>reign</hi> throughout, <hi>Fiction</hi> being it's
soul. 'Tis by this that the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
things take a Character of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sublimity, which renders them
extraordinary and <hi>admirable. Aristotle</hi>
gave but the shadow of this precept,
which <hi>Petronius</hi> has drawn more fully, by
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60843:68"/>
these words, <hi>per ambages deorumque mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteria
praecipitandus est liber spiritus.</hi>
'Tis thus that meanest things become
Noble; that <hi>Thetis</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> throws
herself at the feet of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that the
Gods assemble in Council, where arise
great debates, their spirits grow warm,
and all heaven is divided into parties;
for what? because, indeed, <hi>Achilles</hi>'s
<hi>Mistress</hi> was taken from him, which at

                  </hi> is
of his <hi>Retinue,</hi> and of his <hi>Council;</hi> and
all became remarkable, by the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they receiv'd from the conduct of a
Deity, that presides over wisdom. 'Tis
finally by this that <hi>Virgil</hi> gives greatness
and lustre to the meanest things he
speaks. If <hi>Aeneas</hi> break a <hi>bough,</hi> in the
<hi>third</hi> of his <hi>Aeneid,</hi> to pay a pious duty
to a <hi>Tomb</hi> that he finds accidentally in
his way, the <hi>ghost</hi> of <hi>Polydorus</hi> speaks to
him from the bottom of the Tomb, and
this makes an <hi>Episode.</hi> If <hi>Aruns</hi> draw
an Arrow in the <hi>eleventh</hi> Book, it is by

himself therein to kill <hi>Camilla.</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60843:69"/>
Finally, all has relation to the <hi>Gods</hi> and
their <hi>Ministry,</hi> even to the least actions
that are describ'd in this Poem, to
heighten the lustre of all that is there
done, in that <hi>marvellous</hi> way, whereof

               <p>BUt the importance is, as I before
have observed, that this <hi>admirable</hi>
be <hi>probable,</hi> by a just mixture, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of the one and the other. For
the Heroick action which the Poet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to imitate, must be render'd not
only worthy of <hi>admiration,</hi> but also of
<hi>credit,</hi> to attain its end. The Poets or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
are carried without considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to speak incredible things, whilst
they aim too much at the <hi>marvellous;</hi>
they thrust imprudently into the <hi>Fable,</hi>
without managing the <hi>truth,</hi> because
they would <hi>please,</hi> without taking care
to <hi>persuade;</hi> and they scarce ever think
of the preparations, and all the <hi>colours</hi>
of <hi>decency</hi> that must be employ'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ground the <hi>verisimility.</hi> And 'tis
thus that by a false <hi>Idea</hi> they have of
<hi>Poesie,</hi> they place its beauty in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

                  <hi>surprises</hi> of something extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>wonderful:</hi> whereas in truth it is not
regularly to be found, but in what is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and <hi>probable.</hi> For the sure way to
the heart, is not by surprizing the spirit;
and all becomes <hi>incredible</hi> in Poetry,
that appears <hi>incomprehensible.</hi> Scarce any
of the Poets but <hi>Virgil,</hi> had the Art, by
the preparation of <hi>incidents,</hi> to manage
the <hi>probability</hi> in all the circumstances
of an <hi>heroick</hi> action. <hi>Homer</hi> is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
so scrupulous and regular in his
contrivances; his <hi>Machins</hi> are less just,
and all the measures he takes, to save
the <hi>probability,</hi> are, less exact; I shall

Reflections may be made in the works
of both the ancient and modern Poets,
on the subject of this observation; for
the necessity of <hi>probability</hi> is a great
check to the Poets; who think to make
the <hi>incidents</hi> the more heroick, by how

               <p>THis <hi>proportion of parts</hi> is so essential
to <hi>heroick,</hi> that it ought likewise
to be (if I may so say) the soul of all
<hi>little</hi> Poems; as are <hi>Epithalumiums, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks,</hi>
and others that are made on
the <hi>birth;</hi> and <hi>brave actions of great men;</hi>
and these Poems are so far perfect, as
they have that unity and proportion of
parts, requisite for a complete work, In
this ordinarily are faulty the <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrists,</hi>
and all those pretended Poets,
that seek to make their fortune, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their <hi>Court</hi> to great persons. For
besides that there is nothing more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
than to <hi>praise,</hi> and that by so bold
an enterprize, one ordinarily exposes
himself to be render'd ridiculous, as
well as those he commends, because he
does it ill; the common undertakers, in
this kind, who have not force to <hi>form</hi>
handsomly a design, loose the reins to
their fancy; and after they have pil'd
a heap of gross and deform'd praises
without order or connexion one upon
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60843:71"/>
another, this, forsooth, must be call'd a
<hi>Panegyrick.</hi> 'Tis thus that <hi>Claudian</hi> has
<hi>prais'd</hi> the Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> and the
Consuls, <hi>Probinus, Olybrius, Stilicon,</hi> and
the other illustrious persons of his time.
Throughout all his <hi>Panegyricks</hi> reigns an
<hi>air</hi> of youthfulness, that has nothing of
what is <hi>solid,</hi> though there appear some
<hi>wit.</hi> I speak not of <hi>Ausonius,</hi> nor <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi>
and the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, who have
writ <hi>Panegyricks;</hi> because all of them
have writ after this manner, and yet
more <hi>feebly,</hi> according to the <hi>decline</hi> of
the Ages in which they writ. <hi>Tibullus</hi>
himself, otherwise so exact and polite in
his Elegies, falls short in his <hi>Panegyrick</hi>
of <hi>Messala;</hi> so hard is it to <hi>praise</hi> well.
And nothing perhaps has contributed
more to render the Character of a Poet
a little ridiculous, than the vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
flatteries whereby most part of
those that profess'd <hi>Poetry</hi> have debas'd
themselves. For a man alwayes praises
ill, when he <hi>praises</hi> for interest; and
there is nothing but these sottish praises
that bring a disparagement on Poets.
What art, what springs, what turns,
what wit must be employ'd, to praise
well, and how few are capable to do it?
for praise has alwayes something gross
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60843:72"/>
in it, if it lie too open, and go in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
line. <hi>Voiture,</hi> one of the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Wits of these latter Ages, never
scarce, commended any but in <hi>drollery,</hi>
and it may be said that of a long time
none has done it with more success. The
true Models, that ought to be taken, to
<hi>praise</hi> well, are the Poems of <hi>Homer</hi> and
<hi>Virgil; Homer</hi> praises not <hi>Achilles,</hi> but
by the simple and bare relation of his
actions; and never was man <hi>prais'd</hi> so
delicately as <hi>Augustus,</hi> by <hi>Virgil;</hi> it is
not but, as it were, by covert paths
that he conducts him to <hi>glory.</hi> There was
not a <hi>Roman</hi> that had any thing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
who knew not well that
<hi>Virgil</hi> commended not the <hi>piety</hi> of <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
but to honour that of <hi>Augustus,</hi>
whose portract he draws in his <hi>Heroe;</hi>
for whatever the Poet sayes of the one,
is only for the other. Whereby, one
may say, that never man knew better the
art of <hi>praising;</hi> for he saves all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
of the person he praiseth, even
whil'st he overwhelms him with praise.
Finally, the true art of praising, is to say
laudable things simply, but delicately;
for praises are not to be endur'd, unless
they be <hi>fine</hi> and hidden. The truth is,
'tis so hard a thing to praise as one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60843:72"/>
ought, that it is a Rock which they that
are wise should shun. And since the
Poets are ordinarily too lavish in this
kind, they may make advantage some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of this Reflection, to save their
Reputation, that whilst they pretend to
give honour to <hi>particulars,</hi> themselves
be not pitied by the <hi>publick.</hi> This is all
that can be observ'd most essential to an
<hi>Epick</hi> Poem; and now follows a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that may be made of those who
have writ in this kind of <hi>Poesie.</hi>

on the <hi>taking</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> is of a gross and
low character, as likewise the <hi>History</hi> of
<hi>Leander</hi> by <hi>Musaeus.</hi> The Poem of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius
Rhodius,</hi> on the <hi>expedition of

and has nothing of that nobleness of
expression of <hi>Homer;</hi> the <hi>Fable</hi> is ill
invented, and the <hi>list</hi> of the <hi>Argonauts</hi>
in the first Book is flat. <hi>Quintus Calaber</hi>

to the <hi>Iliad</hi> and <hi>Odysseis,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having the least sprinkling of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
easie and natural vein, has nothing
exact or regular. <hi>Nicander</hi> is hard, <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
dry; and the Poem of <hi>Nonnus,</hi> not
so much a Poem, as a <hi>Romance,</hi> or <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of the Birth, Adventures, Victories,
and <hi>Apotheosis</hi> of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> The <hi>design</hi>
is too vast, the <hi>Fable</hi> ill wrought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
art, without order, without proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
the stile is obscure and cumber'd.
For the <hi>Latins,</hi> never any possess'd all
the graces of <hi>Poesie</hi> in so eminent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as <hi>Virgil;</hi> he has an admirable
<hi>taste</hi> for what is natural, an exquisite

                  <hi>judgment</hi> for the contrivance, an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
<hi>delicacy</hi> for the numbers and
harmony of <hi>versification.</hi> The <hi>design</hi> of
his Poem, well consider'd in all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
is the most judicious and the
best devis'd that ever was, or ever will
be. <hi>Ovid</hi> has <hi>wit, art, design</hi> in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis;</hi>
but he has <hi>youthfulnesses</hi>
that could hardly be pardon'd, but for
the vivacity of his <hi>wit,</hi> and a certain
happiness of <hi>fancy. Lucan</hi> is great and
sublime, but has little judgment. <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi>
blames his continual Transports,
for, in effect, he is excessive in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
where he affects rather to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a Philosopher, than a Poet. <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
in his little Poem of the <hi>corruption</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> falls into all the faults that he
condemns; never man gave more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Rules for <hi>Poetry,</hi> and never man
observ'd them worse. <hi>Statius</hi> is as <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical</hi>
in his <hi>Idea's</hi> as in his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the greatness that appears in his
stile is more in the words, than in the
things: his two Poems have nothing in
them regular, all is <hi>vast</hi> and dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.
<hi>Silius Italicus</hi> is much more
regular; he owes more to his industry,
than to his nature, there seems some
judgment and conduct in his design,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60843:74"/>
but nothing of greatness and nobleness
in his expression; and if one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
on the younger <hi>Pliny</hi>'s judgment,
there is more art than wit in his Poem;
it is rather the <hi>History</hi> of the second
punick War, than a Poem. That of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius
Flaccus</hi> on the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
<hi>mean;</hi> the fable, the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
the conduct, all there are of a
very low character. <hi>Claudian</hi> hath wit
and fancy; but no taste for that delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the numbers, and that <hi>turn</hi> of the
Verse, that the skilful admire in <hi>Virgil;</hi>
he falls perpetually into the same <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi>
for that cause, one can hardly
read him without being wearied; and
he has no elevation in any manner. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonius</hi>
and <hi>Prudentius</hi> had not a <hi>Genius</hi>

of the Age they liv'd in.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="chapter">

               <p>FOr the <hi>modern,</hi> this judgment may be
given. In the Ages succeeding,
when Letters pass'd from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
the <hi>Arabians,</hi> though lovers of
<hi>Poetry,</hi> produc'd nothing of Heroick,
That barbarous <hi>air</hi> of the <hi>Goths</hi> which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60843:74"/>
then was spread in <hi>Europe</hi> over all Arts,
did also mingle with <hi>Poetry;</hi> as appears
by the works of <hi>Sidonius, Mamercus,
Nemesianus</hi> and others, who writ then
after a dry, jejune, and insipid manner.
Some Ages after these, <hi>Poesie</hi> began to
flourish again in <hi>Italy</hi> by the Poems of
<hi>Dante, Petrarch,</hi> and <hi>Boccace.</hi> The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em
of <hi>Dante,</hi> which the <hi>Italians</hi> of those
days, call'd a <hi>Comedy,</hi> passes for an <hi>Epick</hi>
Poem in the opinion of <hi>Castelvetro;</hi> but
it is of a sad and woful contrivance.
And speaking generally <hi>Dante</hi> has a
strain too profound, <hi>Petrarch</hi> too vast,
<hi>Boccace</hi> too trivial and familiar, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the name of <hi>Heroick</hi> Poets: though
they have writ with much purity in
their own Tongue, especially <hi>Petrarch</hi>
and <hi>Boccace.</hi> These were followed some
time after by the Comte of <hi>Scandian,
Matthieu Boyardo,</hi> who made the Poem
of the <hi>loves</hi> of <hi>Orlando</hi> and <hi>Angelica;</hi>
by <hi>Oliviero</hi> who writ a Poem on <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
by <hi>Pulci</hi> in his <hi>Morgante;</hi> by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osto</hi>
in his War of the <hi>Moors</hi> under their
King <hi>Agramante</hi> against <hi>Charlemagne;</hi>
who all suffer'd their wit to be squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
on the Books of <hi>Chevalry</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi>
of those times. <hi>Ariosto</hi> has I
know not what of an <hi>Epick</hi> Poem more
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60843:75"/>
than the others, because he had read
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil;</hi> he is pure, great, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
admirable in the expression; his
descriptions are master-pieces: but he
has no <hi>judgment</hi> at all; his wit is like
the fruitful ground that together pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
flowers and thistles; he speaks
well, but thinks ill; and though all the
pieces of his Poem are pretty, yet the
whole work together is nothing worth,
for an <hi>Epick</hi> Poem: he had not then
seen the Rules of <hi>Aristotle;</hi> as <hi>Tasso</hi> did
afterwards, who is better than <hi>Ariosto,</hi>
whatever the <hi>Academy</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> say
to the contrary. For <hi>Tasso</hi> is more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

I speak not of Cavalier <hi>Marino</hi> in his

he have as much, and perhaps more <hi>wit</hi>

after what is pleasant and glittering
throughout his whole work, that, it
seems, he has not any relish for solid

things. <hi>Sannazarius</hi> and <hi>Vida,</hi> who

that both became barbarous; but
besides, that the contrivance of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

the sort of Verse he took is not

I speak not of other Poems whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

on <hi>Dramatick Poeste,</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
into <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Comedy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>TRagedy,</hi> of all parts of <hi>Poesie,</hi> is that
which <hi>Aristotle</hi> has most discuss'd;
and where he appears most exact. He
alledges that <hi>Tragedy</hi> is a <hi>publick Lecture,</hi>
without comparison more <hi>instructive</hi>
than <hi>Philosophy;</hi> because it teaches the
<hi>mind</hi> by the sense, and rectifies the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
by the passions themselves, in
calming by their emotion the troubles
they excite in the heart. The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
had observ'd two important faults
in man to be regulated, <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart,</hi> and he found for both Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a cure in <hi>Tragedy.</hi> For it makes
man modest, by representing the great
<hi>masters of the earth humbled;</hi> and it
makes him tender and merciful, by
shewing him on the Theatre the strange
accidents of life, and the unforeseen
disgraces to which the most important
persons are subject. But because man
is naturally timorous, and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
he may fall into another extreme,
to be either too fearful, or too full of
pity; the too much fear may shake the
constancy of mind, and the too great
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60843:77"/>
compassion may enfeeble the equity.
'Tis the business of <hi>Tragedy</hi> to regulate
these too weaknesses; it prepares and
arms him against disgraces, by shewing
them so frequent in the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
persons; and he shallcease to fear
ordinary accidents, when he sees such
extraordinary happen to the <hi>highest part</hi>
of Mankind. But as the end of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy</hi>
is to teach men not to fear too
weakly the common misfortunes, and
manage their fear; it makes account
also to teach them to spare their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
for objects that deserve it. For
there is an injustice in being mov'd at
the afflictions of those who deserve to
be miserable. One may see without
pity <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> slain by her son <hi>Orestes</hi>
in <hi>Eschylus,</hi> because she had cut the
throat of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> her husband; and
one cannot see <hi>Hippolytus</hi> dye by the
plot of his stepmother <hi>Phedra</hi> in <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
without compassion; because he
dyed not but for being chaste and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.
This to me seems, in short, the
design of <hi>Tragedy,</hi> according to the <hi>system</hi>
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which to me appears admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but which has not been explain'd
as it ought by his Interpreters; they have
not, it may seem, sufficiently understood
the mystery, to unfold it well.</p>

               <p>BUt it is not enough that <hi>Tragedy</hi> be
furnish'd with all the most moving
and terrible Adventures, that <hi>History</hi> can
afford, to stir in the heart those motions
it pretends, to the end, it may cure the
mind of those <hi>vain fears</hi> that may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy
it, and of those <hi>childish compassions</hi>
that may soften it. 'Tis also necessary,
sayes the Philosopher, that every Poet
employ these great objects of terrour
and pity, as the two most powerful
springs, in art, to produce that pleasure
which <hi>Tragedy</hi> may yield. And this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
which is properly of the mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the agitation of the Soul mov'd
by the passions. <hi>Tragedy</hi> cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to the Spectator, unless he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
sensible to all that is represented, he
must <hi>enter</hi> into all the different thoughts
of the Actors, <hi>interest</hi> himself in their
Adventures, <hi>fear, hope, afflict</hi> himself, and
<hi>rejoyce</hi> with them. The Theatre is dull
and languid, when it ceases to produce
these motions in the Soul of those that
stand by. But as of all passions <hi>fear</hi> and
<hi>pity</hi> are those that make the strongest
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60843:78"/>
impressions on the heart of man, by the
natural disposition he has of being
afraid, and of being mollifi'd; <hi>Aristotle</hi>
has chosen these amongst the rest, to
move more powerfully the Soul, by the
tender <hi>sentiments</hi> they cause, when the
heart admits, and is pierced by them. In
effect, when the Soul is shaken, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
so natural and so humane, all the
impressions it feels, become delightful;
its trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le pleases, and the emotion it
finds, is a kind of charm to it, which does
cast it into a sweet and profound medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and which insensibly does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
it in all the interests that are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on the Theatre. 'Tis then that the
heart yields it self over to all the objects
that are propos'd, that all images strike
it, that it espouses the sentiments of all
those that speak, and becomes suscepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all the passions that are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because 'tis mov'd. And in this <hi>agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
consists all the pleasure that one
is capable to receive from <hi>Tragedy;</hi> for
the spirit of man does please it self with
the different <hi>situations,</hi> caus'd by the
different objects, and the various passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are represented.</p>

               <p>IT is by this admirable spring, that the
<hi>Oedipus</hi> of <hi>Sophocles</hi> (of which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
speaks continually, as of the most
perfect Model of a <hi>Tragedy</hi>) wrought
such great effects on the people of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
when it was represented. The
truth is, all is <hi>terrible</hi> in that piece, and
all there is <hi>moving.</hi> See the Subject. <hi>The
Plague destroying</hi> Thebes, Oedipus <hi>the
King concerned at the loss of his Subjects,
causes the Oracle to be consulted, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
The Oracle ordains him to revenge
the affassinat committed on the person of
his Predccessor King</hi> Laius. Oedipus <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in horrible imprecations against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the crime, without knowing him;
he himself makes a strict search to discover
him; he questions</hi> Creon, Tiresias, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casta,
<hi>and a man of</hi> Corinth <hi>for intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
and it appear'd by the account that
this Prince received, that he himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the murder, he would punish.</hi> The
minds of the Spectators are in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
suspense; all the words of <hi>Tire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ias,
Iocasta,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> as they give
light to the <hi>discovery,</hi> cause <hi>terrours</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60843:79"/>
surprises; and clear it by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
<hi>Oedipus</hi> finding it to be himself that
was Author of the <hi>assassinat,</hi> by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the testimonies, at the same
time understood that <hi>Laius</hi> whom he had
slain, was his Father; and that <hi>Iocasta,</hi>
whom he had married, is his Mother,
which he knew not till then; because
he had from his Infancy been brought
up in the Court of the King of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
This <hi>discovery</hi> is like a Thunderclap that
oblig'd him to abandon himself to all
the despair that his Conscience inspir'd;
he tears out both his eyes, to punish him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the more cruelly with his own
hands. But this <hi>Criminal</hi> whom all the
world <hi>abhors</hi> before he is known, by a
return of <hi>pity</hi> and tenderness, becomes
an object of <hi>compassion</hi> to all the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
now he is bemoan'd, who a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before pass'd for execrable; and
they melt at the misfortunes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they had in horror; and excuse the
most abominable of all Crimes, because
the Author is an <hi>Innocent unfortunate,</hi>
and fell into this crime, that was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
him, notwithstanding all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
he had taken to avoid it; and
what is most strange, is, that all the steps
he made to carry him from the murder,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60843:79"/>
brought him to commit it. Finally,
this flux and reflux of indignation, and
of pity, this revolution of horror and
of tenderness, has such a wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on the minds of the Audience; all
in this piece moves with an <hi>air</hi> so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and passionate, all is <hi>unravel'd</hi> with
so much art, the suspensions manag'd
with so much <hi>probability;</hi> there is made
such an universal <hi>emotion</hi> of the Soul,
by the <hi>surprises, astonishments, admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
the sole <hi>incident</hi> that is form'd in
all the piece, is so natural, and all tends
so in a direct line to the <hi>discovery</hi> and <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe;</hi>
that it may not only be said,
that never <hi>Subject</hi> has been better devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
than this, but that never can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
a better, for <hi>Tragedy.</hi> And thus
also it was that the <hi>Andromeda</hi> of <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi>
(so much boasted of in <hi>Atheneus,</hi>
and an <hi>Episode</hi> whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> sung
in the last Banquet of his life) wrought
those wonderful effects in the City <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera;</hi>
when it was acted there by <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
under the Reign of <hi>Lysimachus.</hi> The
two parts of <hi>Perseus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> the
misfortunes of this Princess expos'd to
the Sea-monster, and all that mov'd <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi>
and <hi>pity</hi> in this representation, made
so strong and violent impression on the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60843:80"/>
people, <hi>That they departed,</hi> saith <hi>Lucian,
from the Theatre, possess'd (as it were)
with the spectacle, and this became a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
malady, wherewith the imaginations of
the Spectators were seiz'd.</hi> Something of
a grosser stroke of this sort of impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made by <hi>Tragedy,</hi> has even happen'd
in our dayes. When <hi>Mondory</hi> acted the
<hi>Mariamne</hi> of <hi>Tristan,</hi> the people never
went away but sad and pensive, making
reflection on what they had seen, and
struck with great pleasure at the same
time. These are the two great <hi>springs</hi>
of the Greek <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and all that is
<hi>marvellous</hi> in <hi>Dramatick</hi> Poems, results
principally from what there is of <hi>pity</hi>
and <hi>terror</hi> in the objects represented.</p>

                  <hi>Modern Tragedy</hi> turns on other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
the <hi>Genius</hi> of our (the
<hi>French</hi>) Nation is not strong enough,
to sustain an action on the Theatre by
moving only <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>pity.</hi> These are
<hi>Machins</hi> that will not <hi>play</hi> as they ought,
but by great thoughts, and noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
of which we are not indeed
altogether so capable, as the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:60843:80"/>
Perhaps our Nation, which is naturally
<hi>gallant,</hi> has been oblig'd by the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of our Character to frame for our
selves a new <hi>system</hi> of <hi>Tragedy</hi> to suit
with our humour. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> who
were <hi>popular</hi> Estates, and who hated
<hi>Monarchy,</hi> took delight in their specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
to see Kings humbled, and high
Fortunes cast down, because the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
griev'd them. The <hi>English,</hi> our
Neighbours, love blood in their sports,
by the quality of their temperament:
these are <hi>Insulaires,</hi> separated from the
rest of men; we are more humane.
<hi>Gallantry</hi> moreover agrees with our
<hi>Manners;</hi> and our Poets believ'd that
they could not succeed well on the
Theatre, but by sweet and tender <hi>senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
in which, perhaps, they had
some reason: for, in effect, the passions
represented become deform'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid,
unless they are founded on <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi>
conformable to those of the
<hi>Spectator.</hi> 'Tis this that obliges our
Poets to stand up so strongly for the
priviledge of <hi>Gallantry</hi> on the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and to bend all their Subjects to
love and <hi>tenderness;</hi> the rather, to please
the <hi>Women,</hi> who have made themselves
Judges of these divertisements, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60843:81"/>
usurped the right to pass sentence. And
some besides have suffer'd themselves to
be prepossess'd, and led by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
who make all their <hi>Cavaliers</hi> amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
'Tis by them that <hi>Tragedy</hi> began to
degenerate; and we by little and little
accustom'd to see <hi>Heroes</hi> on the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
smitten with another love than that
of <hi>glory;</hi> and that by degrees all the
<hi>great men</hi> of Antiquity have lost their
characters in our hands. 'Tis likewise
perhaps by this <hi>gallantry</hi> that our Age
would devise a colour to excuse the
feebleness of our wit; not being able
to sustain always the same action by the
greatness of words and thoughts. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be; for I am not hardy enough,
to declare my self against the publick;
'tis to degrade <hi>Tragedy</hi> from that <hi>majesty</hi>
which is proper to it, to mingle in it
love, which is of a character alwayes
<hi>light,</hi> and little sutable to that <hi>gravity</hi> of
which <hi>Tragedy</hi> makes profession. Hence
it proceeds, that these <hi>Tragedies</hi> mixed
with <hi>gallantries,</hi> never make such admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
impressions on the spirit, as did
those of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides;</hi> for all
the bowels were moved by the great
objects of <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> which they
proposed. 'Tis likewise for this, that the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60843:81"/>
reputation of our modern <hi>Tragedies</hi> so
soon decays, and yield but small delight
at <hi>two years end;</hi> whereas the Greek
please yet to those that have a good
taste, after two thousand years; because
what is not grave and serious on the
Theatre, though it give delight at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
after a short time grows distasteful,
and unpleasant; and because, what is
not proper for great thoughts and great
figures in <hi>Tragedy</hi> cannot support it self.
The Ancients who perceiv'd this, did
not interweave their <hi>gallantry</hi> and love,
save in <hi>Comedy.</hi> For love is of a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
that always degenerates from that
<hi>Heroick air,</hi> of which <hi>Tragedy</hi> must nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

divest it self. And nothing to me shews
so mean and sensless, as for one to amuse
himself with whining about frivolous
kindnesses, when he may be admirable
by great and noble <hi>thoughts,</hi> and sublime
expressions. But I dare not presume so
far on my own capacity and credit, to
oppose my self of my own head against
a usage so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

modestly to propose my doubts; and
that may serve to exercise the <hi>Wits,</hi> in
an Age that onely wants <hi>matter.</hi> But to
end this <hi>Reflection</hi> with a touch of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism,</hi>
I am persuaded, that the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60843:82"/>

preserv'd according to the <hi>Idea</hi> of the

speak not enough to the heart of the

Nor finally, is it well understood
that it is not the admirable intrigue, the
surprising and wonderful events, the

beauty of a Tragedy, it is the <hi>discourses</hi>
when they are natural and passionate.
<hi>Sophocles</hi> was not more successful than
<hi>Euripides</hi> on the Theatre at <hi>Athens,</hi> but
by the <hi>discourse,</hi> though the Tragedies

of wonderful <hi>incidents,</hi> than those

                  </hi> those <hi>admirations</hi> that the

mov'd as when they went in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carry
their <hi>heart</hi> along with them, <hi>untoucht</hi> as
they brought it: so that the pleasure
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60843:83"/>
they receive there, is become as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
as that of <hi>Comedy,</hi> and our gravest

               <p>IT is not but that the <hi>Ancients</hi> had

scarce any principle for <hi>manners,</hi> and
for the <hi>decencies;</hi> his <hi>Falles</hi> are too

that the secret of the Theatre is
to speak <hi>pompously,</hi> he bestow'd all his art
on the words without any regard to the
<hi>thoughts. Quintilian</hi> sayes, that he is
sublime and lofty to extravagance: in
effect, he never speaks in <hi>cold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

he draws, the colours are too <hi>glaring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and
the strokes too gross. He, who writes
his life, relates that in one of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
of his Tragedy of the <hi>Eumenides,</hi>
he so horribly frighted the <hi>Audience,</hi> that
the spectacle made the children swound,

Finally, his <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> it seems, never
left him, he is so exalted, and so little
natural. <hi>Sophocles</hi> is too elaborate in his
discourse, his Art is not enough hidden,
in some of his pieces, it lies too open
and near the day; he sometimes becomes
obscure, by his too great affectation to
be sublime; and the nobleness of his
expression, is injurious to the perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
his <hi>plots</hi> are not all so happily <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel'd,</hi>
as that of the <hi>Oedipus.</hi> The <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi>
in the <hi>Ajax</hi> answers not to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue;</hi>
the Author ought not to have
ended a spectacle of that terrour and
pity with a dull and frivolous contest
about the <hi>Sepulture</hi> of <hi>Ajax,</hi> who then
had slain himself. And in the same
piece that <hi>Machin</hi> of <hi>Minerva</hi> is too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
who casts an ench<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

eyes of <hi>Ajax,</hi> to save <hi>Vlysses,</hi> whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jax</hi>
would have kill'd, if he had known
him. <hi>Oedipus</hi> ought not to have been
ignorant of the assassinat of the King
of <hi>Thebes;</hi> the ignorance he is in of the
murder, which makes all the beauty of
the <hi>intrigue,</hi> is not <hi>probable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Euripides</hi>
is not exact in the contrivance of his
Fables; his Characters want variety, he
falls often into the same thoughts, on the

same adventures; he is not enough a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
observer of <hi>decencies;</hi> and by a
too great affectation to be moral and
<hi>sententious,</hi> he is not so ardent and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
as he ought to be; for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he goes not to the heart, so much as
<hi>Sophocles;</hi> there are <hi>precipitations</hi> in
the preparation of his <hi>Incidents,</hi> as in the
<hi>Suppliants,</hi> where <hi>Theseus levies an Army,
marches from</hi> Athens <hi>to</hi> Thebes, <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
on the same day.</hi> The <hi>discoveries</hi>
of his Plots are nothing natural, these
are perpetual <hi>Machins; Diana</hi> makes
the <hi>discovery</hi> in the Tragedy of <hi>Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;

<hi>Taurica; Thetis</hi> that of <hi>Andromache;
Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> that of <hi>Helena,</hi> and
that of <hi>Electra;</hi> and so of others. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, as these three Authors are the first
Models of Tragedy, they are <hi>great</hi> in
their designs, <hi>judicious</hi> in their fables,

ought to be no other but the Copy
of the <hi>ridiculous</hi> that is found in Nature.
<hi>Comedy</hi> is as it should be, when the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
believes himself really in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of such persons as he has repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and takes himself to be in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
whilst he is at the Theatre; and that
he there sees nothing but what he sees in
the world. For <hi>Comedy</hi> is worth nothing
at all, unless he know, and can compare
the <hi>manners</hi> that are exhibited on the
Stage, with those of such persons as he
has conversation withall. 'Twas by this
that <hi>Menander</hi> had so great success
amongst the <hi>Grecians;</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi>
thought themselves in <hi>Conversation,</hi>
whilst they sat beholding the Comedies
of <hi>Terence;</hi> for they perceiv'd nothing
but what they had been accustom'd to
find in ordinary Companies. 'Tis the
great Art of <hi>Comedy,</hi> to keep close to
Nature, and never leave it; to have
common thoughts and expressions fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the capacity of all the world:
For it is most certainly true, that the
most gross strokes of <hi>Nature,</hi> whatever
they be, please alwayes more, than the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60843:88"/>
most delicate, that are not <hi>Natural:</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
base and vulgar terms are not
to be permitted on the Theatre, unless
supported by some kind of wit. The
<hi>proverbs</hi> and <hi>wise sayings</hi> of the People
ought not to be suffer'd, unless they
have some pleasant meaning, and unless
they are Natural. This is the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
principle of <hi>Comedy;</hi> by which,
whatever is represented, cannot fail to
please; but without it, nothing. 'Tis
only by adhering to Nature, that the
<hi>probability</hi> can be maintain'd, which is
the sole infallible guide, that may be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
on the Theatre. Without <hi>probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
all is lame and faulty, with it all
goes well: none can run astray who
follow it; and the most ordinary faults
of <hi>Comedy</hi> happen from thence, that
the <hi>decencies</hi> are not well observ'd, nor
the <hi>incidents</hi> enough prepar'd. 'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
necessary to take heed that the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours</hi>
employ'd to prepare the <hi>incidents,</hi>
be not too gross, to leave to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
the pleasure of finding out himself
what they signifie. But the most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
weakness of our <hi>Comedies</hi> is the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling;</hi>
scarce ever any succeed well
in that, by the difficulty there is in <hi>unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

'tis only the work of fancy; but the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling</hi>
is the pure and perfect work of
the judgment. 'Tis this that makes the
success difficult, and if one would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
make a little reflection, he might find
that the most universal fault of <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
is, that the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of it is not
<hi>Natural.</hi> It rests to examine, Whether
in <hi>Comedy</hi> the Images may be drawn
greater than the Natural, the more to
move the minds of the Spectators, by
more shining portracts, and by stronger
impressions? That is to say, Whether a

if one may ground a true judgment on
the fragments that remain of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
one may find that he made very
pleasant images of the civil life; that
he makes men speak according to their
character; that one may find himself in
the portracts he made of Manners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he keeps close to Nature, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

For the two <hi>Latin Comick Poets, Plautus</hi>

is ingenious in his designs, happy in his

a man is subject to, when he endeavours
to be too witty; he will make laughter
by extravagant expressions, and <hi>hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles,</hi>

the gravity of a Philosopher by the cold
blood of his temperament, and by all
the <hi>grimaces</hi> and severity of his Morals:
seems so much the more pleasant in this,
as he is more grave and more serious in
all his other Works. Most part of the

who makes sport with the most serious

We have two modern <hi>Satyrs</hi> writ in

some disgrace by the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>
chief <hi>Minister</hi> of State to <hi>Philip III,</hi>
who had no respect for Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
writ the Romance of <hi>Don Quixot,</hi>
which is a most fine and ingenious <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>
on his own Countrey; because the
Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> whom he renders ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous

This is a <hi>Tradition</hi> I have from
one of my friends, who learn'd this <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi>

The other <hi>Satyr</hi> is <hi>French,</hi> made in the
time of the <hi>League,</hi> where the Author

is stuff'd with so much <hi>Ribaldry,</hi>
and is so little conformable to the <hi>refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedness</hi>

have been more successful therein (by
what appears to us) than the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
For little remains to us of <hi>Philetas</hi> and
<hi>Tyrtues,</hi> who were famous in <hi>Greece</hi> for
this kind of Verse. They who have
writ <hi>Elegy</hi> best amongst the <hi>Latins,</hi> are
<hi>Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid. Tibullus</hi> is
elegant and polite, <hi>Propertius</hi> noble and
high; but <hi>Ovid</hi> is to be prefer'd to
both; because he is more natural, more

moving, and more passionate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he has better express'd the Character
of <hi>Elegy,</hi> than the others. Some <hi>Elegies</hi>
are left us of <hi>Catullus,</hi> of <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and
<hi>Cornelius Gallus,</hi> which are of a great
purity, and are exceedingly delicate;

are more round<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and support themselves

use is to sing the praises of the <hi>gods,</hi> and

<hi>majesty</hi> of its Character, an exalted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
a great wit, a daring fancy, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
noble and sparkling, yet pure,
and correct. All the briskness and life
which Art has by its <hi>Figures,</hi> is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to heighten <hi>Ode</hi> so far as its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
requires. But the reading alone
of <hi>Pindar,</hi> is more capable to inspire
this <hi>Genius,</hi> than all my <hi>Reflections.</hi> He is
great in his designs, vast in his thoughts,
bold in his imaginations, happy in his
expressions, eloquent in his discourse:
but his great vivacity hurries him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
past his iudgment, he gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
too much swing; his <hi>Panegyricks</hi>
are perpetual digressions, where ramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from his Subject, he carries the
Readers from Fables to Fables, from
Allusions to Allusions, from Chimera's
to Chimera's; for 'tis the most unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and irregular <hi>fancy</hi> in the world.
But this irregularity is one part of the
Character of the <hi>Ode,</hi> the Nature and
<hi>Genius</hi> of it requiring Transport. <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi>
likewise is the onely person amongst
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that acquired glory by this
sort of writing, for little is remaining
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60843:98"/>
of the other <hi>nine Lyrick Poets,</hi> whereof
<hi>Petronius</hi> speaks. Nevertheless it may
be avowed by that which is left us of
the <hi>fragments</hi> of <hi>Sappho,</hi> that <hi>Demetrius</hi>
and <hi>Longinus</hi> have great reason to boast
so highly in their Works of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Genius</hi> of this <hi>Woman;</hi> for there
are found some strokes of delicacy the
most <hi>fine,</hi> and the most passionate in the
world. None can judge with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the others, of whom we have
so little. <hi>Anacreon</hi> alone is capable to
comfort us for the loss of their Works.
For his <hi>Odes</hi> are flowers, beauties and
graces perpetual: it is so familiar to him
to write what is natural, and to the <hi>life;</hi>
and he has an <hi>air</hi> so delicate, so easie,
and so graceful; that there is nothing
comparable in all Antiquity in the way
he took, and in that kind of writing he
followed. <hi>Horace</hi> found the Art to join
all the force and high flights of <hi>Pindar,</hi>
to all the sweetness and delicacy of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacreon,</hi>
to make himself a new Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
by uniting the perfections of the
other two. For besides that he had a
Wit naturally pleasant, it was also great,
solid, and sublime; he had nobleness in
his conceits, and delicacy in his thoughts
and sentiments: the parts of his <hi>Odes</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:60843:98"/>
that he was willing to finish, are alwayes
<hi>Master-pieces;</hi> but it requires a very
clear apprehension to discern all his
Wit; for there are many <hi>secret graces,</hi>
and hidden beauties in his Verse, that
very few can discover; he also is the
onely <hi>Latin</hi> Author who writ well in
that Verse amongst the Ancients; and
none could ever follow him, his <hi>Genius</hi>
went so high. <hi>Boetius</hi> made some little
<hi>Odes,</hi> which he scatter'd in his Work of
<hi>the Consolation of Philosophy.</hi> But for all
the politeness of his Wit, he could not
surmount the <hi>bad air</hi> that was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant;
and what is most elegant in
him, is only a false beauty, sutable to the
<hi>Genius of the Age</hi> in which he writ. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

I find three, that distinguish themselves

of the decay of the pure <hi>Latinity,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to surprize the mind by some
<hi>nipping</hi> word, which is call'd a <hi>point.
Catullus</hi> writ after the former manner,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60843:100"/>
which is of a <hi>finer</hi> Character; for he
endeavours to close a natural thought
within a delicate <hi>turn</hi> of words, and
within the simplicity of a very soft ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
<hi>Martial</hi> was in some manner
the Author of this other way, that is to
say, to terminate an ordinary thought
by some word that is surprising. After
all, Men of a good taste, prefer'd the
way of <hi>Catullus,</hi> before that of <hi>Martial;</hi>
there being more of true delicacy in
that, than in this. And in these latter
Ages we have seen a noble <hi>Venetian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

<hi>antipathy</hi> against all that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>point,</hi> which he judg'd to be of an

a Volume of <hi>Martial</hi>'s Epigrams
to the <hi>Manes</hi> of <hi>Catullus,</hi> in honour to
his Character, which he judg'd was to
be prefer'd to that of <hi>Martial.</hi> I find
nothing to say considerable on the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramists</hi>
of latter Ages. 'Tis one of the
sorts of Verse, in which a man has little
success; for it is a meer <hi>luckie hit,</hi> if it
prove well. An <hi>Epigram</hi> is little worth,
unless it be admirable; and it is so rare
to make them <hi>admirable,</hi> that 'tis suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

               <p>IT remains to speak of the <hi>Madrigal,</hi>
the <hi>Rondelay,</hi> the <hi>Sonnet,</hi> the <hi>Ballad,</hi>
and all the other little Verse, that are
the invention of these latter Ages; but
as a little <hi>fancy</hi> may suffice, to be succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in these kind of Works, without
any <hi>Genius,</hi> I shall not amuse my self in
making <hi>Reflections</hi> on the method that
is to be observ'd in composing them:
not but that he who has a <hi>Genius,</hi> would
have a much different success, either by
a more <hi>happy turn</hi> he gives to what he
writes, or by a more <hi>lively air,</hi> or by
more <hi>natural beauties;</hi> or finally, by
more <hi>delicate</hi> fashions of speech; and
generally, the <hi>Genius</hi> makes the greatest
distinction in whatsoever work a man
undertakes. The <hi>Character</hi> of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Verse, and of all the little Works of
<hi>Poesie,</hi> requires that they be <hi>natural,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a delic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy; for seeing the
little Subjects afford no beauty of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the wit of the Poet must supply
that want out of its own stock. The
<hi>sonnet</hi> is of a Character that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more of <hi>greatness</hi> in its expression
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60843:101"/>
than the other little pieces; but nothing
is more essential to it, than the happy
and natural turn of the <hi>thought</hi> that
composes it. The <hi>Rondelay</hi> and <hi>Madri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>
are most wretched, if they be not
most elegant; and all their beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the <hi>turn</hi> that is given them. But
it suffices to know what this <hi>delicacy</hi> is,
that ought to be the Character of these
small pieces, to understand all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them. A <hi>word</hi> may be delicate
several wayes; either by a subtle <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
which contains a mystery in the
ambiguity; or by a <hi>hidden meaning,</hi>
which speaks all out, whilst it pretends
to say nothing; or by some fierce and
<hi>bold stroke</hi> under modest terms; or by
something <hi>brisk and pleasant,</hi> under a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ayre; or, lastly, by some <hi>fine
thought,</hi> under a simple and homely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
We find all these manners of
delicacy in some of the Ancients, as in
the <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> in <hi>Sapho,</hi> in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi>
in <hi>Anacreon,</hi> in <hi>Horace,</hi> in <hi>Catullus,</hi>
in <hi>Petronius,</hi> and in <hi>Martial,</hi> these are all
great Models of this Character; of
which the <hi>French</hi> have onely in their
Tongue <hi>Marot,</hi> Gentleman of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to <hi>Frances</hi> the first. He had an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>Genius</hi> for this way of writing;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60843:101"/>
and whoever have been successful in it
since, have only copied him. <hi>Voiture</hi> had
a nature for this Character; if he had
not a little corrupted his Wit by the
reading of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians.</hi>
If these <hi>words</hi> are <hi>affected,</hi> they lose
their grace, because they become cold
and flat, when they are far-fetch'd. But
the most general fault in these little pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Verse, is, when one would cram
them with too much Wit. This is the
ordinary Vice of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>
who labour alwayes to say <hi>things
finely.</hi> This is no very good Character;
for they cease to be <hi>natural,</hi> whilst they
take care to be <hi>witty.</hi> This is the fault
of <hi>Quevedo</hi> in his work of the <hi>nine Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
of <hi>Gongora</hi> in his <hi>Romances,</hi> of <hi>Preti</hi>
and <hi>Testi</hi> in their little Verse, of <hi>Marino</hi>
in his <hi>Idyllia,</hi> of <hi>Acquillini</hi> in his <hi>Madri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi>
and of all the other strangers, who
would <hi>refine</hi> by false <hi>Idea's</hi> of far-fetch'd
ornaments, and by affectations of Wit,
which have nothing of the solid Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
and the good sense of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</hi>
Every small <hi>Genius</hi> is apt to run
into this Vice, of which the late <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
of the <hi>French Poesies</hi> are full; where
the Poets force themselves to be <hi>witty</hi>
in spite of their <hi>Genius;</hi> for they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>WEre I of a humor to decide, I
might add to these <hi>Reflections</hi>
the solution of some difficulties in the
use of <hi>French Poesie,</hi> that to me seem
worthy to be clear'd. The first is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>transposition of words,</hi> which
some Poets seem to affect in the <hi>great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems,</hi>
as a kind of figure, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make use of to give more force
and nobleness to their discourse. But
<hi>Ronsard</hi> in the Preface of his Poem of
the <hi>Franciad,</hi> is not of that opinion. For
he believes not the <hi>French</hi> Tongue to
have a Character proper to bear in its
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60843:102"/>
expression, that sort of <hi>Transpositions.</hi>
In effect, it is too simple and too plain
to wind about the words, and give them
another order than that of the natural
sense, which they ought to have. I refer
to those who understand good speaking,
better than I do. The second difficulty,
is the use of <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee,</hi> which the
Poets employ when they speak to God,
or to the King. This use to me seems
neither founded on Authority, nor on
Reason. For besides that the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, on which they
build, is a false foundation; because
that Tongue equally uses <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>
in Prose and in Verse, for all sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
our Tongue is of it self of a
Character so <hi>respectful,</hi> that it cannot be
content with those terms, for persons to
whom it would give <hi>honour.</hi> But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to me appears more strong against
this use, than the <hi>manner</hi> which the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
themselves practise. For those who
say <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> to God, and to great
persons; never speak so to their <hi>Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
because they believe that would
want <hi>respect.</hi> 'Tis true, that <hi>Theophile</hi>
has said so to his; but this was said no
more, after the Language became <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd;</hi>
and <hi>Voiture</hi> never us'd it. This
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60843:103"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a scruple I have, and which I leave to
the <hi>Criticks</hi> to examine. The third dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
is the use of <hi>Metaphors;</hi> for the
<hi>French</hi> Tongue is essentially so scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that it allows nothing but what is
modest, and the least thing of boldness
offends its modesty. But this would be
too great a delicacy to forbid <hi>Metaphors</hi>
to Poets, with the same rigor as to <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
There are <hi>Metaphors</hi> authoriz'd
by use, which <hi>Poesie</hi> cannot pass by. It
behoves a Poet to use them discreetly,
without <hi>shocking</hi> the modesty of our
Language. It require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a great judgment
to distinguish what ought to be said in
proper therms, and what in <hi>metaphorical.</hi>
The same Censure may be pass'd on the
boldness of <hi>compounding,</hi> and <hi>coining
new words. Du-bartas</hi> has made himself
ridiculous, by attempting to imitate <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and <hi>Pindar</hi> in the invention of these
kind of words. The fourth difficulty,
is the <hi>constraint of Rime:</hi> but this can
only be a difficulty to the weaker sort
of <hi>Wits,</hi> who suffer themselves to be
master'd by this servitude, which a great
<hi>Genius</hi> employes, to give the more force
to his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and more greatness to
his <hi>sentiments:</hi> The last difficulty, and
the most important of all the rest, is to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60843:103"/>
know whether one may <hi>please in Poetry
against the Rules?</hi> I apply this to the
<hi>French Poetry</hi> particularly, though it be
common to <hi>Poetry</hi> in general; because
most part of our <hi>French</hi> make a false li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of this bad principle. 'Tis only
by this that <hi>Moliere</hi> would <hi>salve</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
irreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and that he has pleas'd in his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

'Tis only these strokes that are
<hi>taking</hi> in irregular pieces, where what

               <head>XXXIV.</head>
               <p>FInally, to conclude with a <hi>touch</hi> of
Morality. Since the reputation of
being modest, is more worth than that
of making Verses; were I to make any,
I wou'd never forsake honesty nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.

For if nothing renders Men
more ridiculous, than the kind opinion
they conceive of themselves, and of
their performances; the Poets are yet
more ridiculous than other Men, when
their vanity rises from the difficulty of
succeeding well in their <hi>Mystery.</hi> But if
I made Verse better tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ought of favour; and I wou'd impose

spoke further than my Conscience; to
