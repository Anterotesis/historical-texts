            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE,</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Wherein the Author of the Animadversions addresseth himself to the <hi>English-Dissenters,</hi> especially the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and shews the <hi>Jesuitical Tricks</hi> that have been used in the former Edition of these Speeches.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Writing the Animadversions upon these two treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and blasphemous Speeches, and the History of the Archbishops Murder, as a further Commentary upon them; I have had a double regard, to the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Reader, and have consequently said some things in both of them with respect to the one, which may seem superfluous to the other. The consideration I had to the former obliged me to cite, and exemplifie many <hi>Scottish Acts of Parliament, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Proclamations</hi> of the King by his Privy-Council; which had been needless, but that without them it was not possible for any, but a <hi>Scotsman,</hi> fully to understand the meaning of those passages in the Speeches, to illustrate which they are produced. And the consideration I had to the latter, hath made me insist much on the invalidity of the <hi>Kirk-Ministery,</hi> and <hi>the Divine Institution of Episcopacy,</hi> in doing of which I have cited the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers in the <hi>Original,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> because this Language in <hi>Scotland,</hi> among the men, is almost as common as their <hi>Mother-Tongue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides those things upon which I have largely insisted for the sake of the one, of which the other had not so much need, I have purposely insisted on other useful things upon the common account of both. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly I have been elaborat in explaining most of those Texs of Scripture which the <hi>two Malefactors</hi> misapplied to themselves, or their own Party, and in citing out of the <hi>Kirk-Writers</hi> their <hi>Papal, Jesuitical, Murderous, Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> and <hi>Rebellious Principles;</hi> in doing of which, I protest, I have not said the <hi>fourth-part</hi> of what I was able to produce. I have also here and there exemplified their Principles with their Practices, and all this I have done without any, at least without any material reflections upon the <hi>English</hi>-Dissenters, for whose sake especially I have undertaken this small, but tedious work.</p>
            <p>For the conforming part of both Churches generally know enough to make them detest the Principles and Practices of our <hi>Jesuitical Separatists,</hi> and so will read things of this nature, not so much for instruction, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: and for our <hi>Scottish</hi>-Nonconformists, especially those of the <hi>Field-Separation,</hi> it would be lost labour to write Books for them, who lye under as strong a prejudice against the <hi>Church-Writers,</hi> as the most <hi>bigoted</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66036:3"/>
               <hi>Papists</hi> do, and like them are also terrified and prohibited by their <hi>Jesuitical Preachers</hi> from reading of any thing, that is written by an <hi>Orthodox Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Pen.</p>
            <p>Therefore the principal design which I had in Publishing all this, was for your sakes, <hi>O ye Nonconformists from our Sister Church of England,</hi> who have more ingenuity, and who, I cannot but believe, are ignorant of the nature of our Separatists, and their Separation, because upon all occasions, you appear as much concerned for them, as if you thought, that their Cause and yours were the very same. Did you not take them for a more rational, and innocent Sect than they are, you would, I am confident, be ashamed to Correspond with them, who are the shame of the <hi>Presbyterian Name.</hi> You would not, if you rightly understood them, <hi>Defend their Separation; Apologize for their worst Actions;</hi>

            <p>If you will not believe me, read this little Book, nay, read but the <hi>Speeches,</hi> and the <hi>History,</hi> and if you please let the rest alone; and then, if you do not find that I Charge them truely, expose me in Print for a Calumniator, or Post me up for a Knave. But if you find that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Sect, of which these two Malefactors, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops Murderers were, profess a <hi>Papal Soveraignty</hi> over your Native Prince, and most of all the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> if not all, for which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> are Secluded both Kingdoms by Capital Laws; then I beseech you, nay, I conjure you, as you would be thought true, and impartial Protestants, or, men of common Ingenuity, not to favour, or approve in the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> what you abhor in the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests and People; nor to call the Execution of wholsom and necessary Laws, <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Persecution,</hi> with respect to the one, which you declare to be <hi>Laudable Justice</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How have both you, and the Conforming-Protestants, applauded the Zeal and Justice of your Magistrates, in Executing your Laws upon the former, and yet you revile and hate those, who Execute our Laws upon the latter, (though their Principles are as incompatible with the Government) and call the <hi>Church-Protestants, Papists;</hi> or say, they are <hi>Popishly</hi> affected, when you hear them like good Subjects rejoyce at the news of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats, or express their satisfaction, that they Suffered, as the nature of their Crimes deserved.</p>

            <p>In like manner, when the <hi>Highlanders</hi> about two years since were brought down under the Conduct of their <hi>Chiefs</hi> into those Shires, where at least five parts in six are of this <hi>Jesuitical Sect;</hi> What Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal outcries did you make at <hi>London?</hi> though if the <hi>Papists</hi> should have kept such frequent, and numerous Field-Conventicles in the <hi>Popish</hi> Shires of <hi>England,</hi> at a time when the Kings Standing Forces were not able to dissipate the tenth part of them; you would have thought it both lawful, expedient, and laudable to have sent Thousands of People from <hi>Protestant</hi> Shires, to Quarter among them for a little while, till other expedients could have been found. You know very well, that the first Discoverer of the <hi>Horrid Popish Plot</hi> hath declared to all the World, That <hi>Jesuits</hi> were sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> about the same time that they began to <hi>Field-Conventicle,</hi> to encourage them to Rebel, and disturb the Ministery of the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale;</hi> and yet you are so confident as to contradict him in this particular, reporting in favour of our <hi>Jesuited Presbyterians,</hi> That there was no need for such a Force to over-rule them, but that they were brought upon them purposely to provoke them to Rebel.</p>
            <p>I must also remind you, of the innumerable Lyes you dispersed (I cannot believe you rais'd them) of the <hi>Devastations, Murders, Robberies, Rapes, &amp;c.</hi> committed by the <hi>Highlanders</hi> among those <hi>Presbyterian Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi> though there were as few, and as small disorders committed by them, as ever was by the like number, not only of Soldiers, but Men. For they are not <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as you Styled them, unless it be in the same sence that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> called all other People <hi>Barbarous,</hi> that spoke not their Languages, and wore not the <hi>Pall,</hi> and <hi>Gown.</hi> No, I assure you, they are a very Civil, Generous, and Governable People, who committed not half so many, nor so great disorders in that expedition, as the Soldiers, who were levied about the same time in <hi>England,</hi> did about the places where they lay. Did any of them do such a Barbarous action (not to mention others) as that of Captain—upon Sir <hi>Robert Viners</hi> Daughter? if they did, let it be published, but if they did not, then I beseech you, be not accessory to such lying Stories again. But the Loyal <hi>Highlanders</hi> were from the beginning Malls to the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters,</hi> and this is the true ground, why our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the first place, and you by contagion from them in the second, hate, and defame them so much.</p>
            <p>For the very same reason you are directed by them, to Calumniate the great name of his <hi>Grace</hi> the <hi>Duke of Lauderdale.</hi> The Church is supported upon, and our Pestilent Sectarians crush'd under his <hi>Ministery,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Conspire to represent him as a Tyrant, Papist, and what not? Though some of the most Considerable among you, know him to be a man of great Moderation and Piety, and one who abominates <hi>Popery</hi> from his heart.</p>
            <p>I think fit also to mind you of the Misrepresentations which you made of the Archbishops Murder, endeavouring to lay it elsewhere than at the door of that Phanatical Party, who brought his <hi>Grace</hi> (as the <hi>Jesuits</hi> have done greater men) to <hi>Ehuds</hi> Dagger, and <hi>Gideons</hi> Sword. I have made
<pb facs="tcp:66036:4"/>
a True Narrative of it, and of the <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Principles upon which it was Committed; on purpose, that you seeing of what manner of Faith, and Spirit this direful Sect are, may Befriend them no longer; but shew your selves sincere <hi>Protestants,</hi> in abhorring the worst part of <hi>Popery</hi> in them, aswel as in <hi>Papists</hi> properly so called.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I cannot but tell you, that I am very much offended at the spiteful manner, after which you have Treated the Church and her Clergy, ever since the Discovery of the <hi>Popish-Plot.</hi> I have seen the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives of your <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Leicester-shire</hi> Elections, and have read the Books which your Rabbies have lately put out, and comparing them with other Phanatical, shall I call them, or <hi>Popish</hi> Libels; methinks I find little of the Ancient <hi>Puritan</hi> Spirit among you, but that you have devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ten times further from their Principles, than the Divines in <hi>Celeusma</hi> are falsly represented to have deviated from the Doctrines of the Church. Nay, to deal plainly with you, you seem to have much of the <hi>Covenanting</hi> Spirit among you, and if you stop not in time, I am afraid, that as many Acts of Parliament must be made in your Countrey for the protection of the Clergy, as have been made in ours. What? are you not ashamed to Assault the Church on one side, while the <hi>Papists</hi> Storm her on the other? A Church, of all the Reformed, most hated by the <hi>Papists,</hi> and whose Clergy alone hath done much more against <hi>Popery</hi> than the Divines of all Reformed Communions in the World. And yet you are not ashamed to misrepresent this very Clergy to the people for <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Papishly</hi> affected, a Clergy, whose Writings all Foreign Protestant Divines study <hi>English</hi> on purpose to understand, and which at this day, (praised be God for it) can produce more Great men, than the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, put together in the most flourishing Century, could ever shew at a time.</p>
            <p>But this is not to act like <hi>Protestants,</hi> but <hi>Papists,</hi> or whatsoever else you will call those, who endeavour to ruine the Fortress of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Cause. And truly while some of your leading Dissenters openly avow, that they are neither <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor Independents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor of any other known name, do they not prompt us to believe, that they may be <hi>Papists,</hi> or at least are so fond of their own Conceits, as to be of nothing but of themselves. So <hi>Arius,</hi> was an <hi>Arian, Novatus</hi> a <hi>Novatian,</hi> and <hi>Donatus</hi> a <hi>Donatist,</hi> and no part of Christendom ever yet wanted men, who had the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to affect singularity in Opinions of Religion, to Commence <hi>Heresiarchs,</hi> and become <hi>Chiefs</hi> of a Sect. Thus for example, I know not what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can be called, but a <hi>Papist,</hi> or <hi>Baxterian,</hi> he is not of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it is manifest folly, and injustice to call him <hi>Papist;</hi> He saith, He is no <hi>Presbyterian, &amp;c.</hi> he must therefore like the Founder of an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, be denominated from himself, unless he can reduce himself to any other denomination Catholick, or Heterodox, that now is, or ever was among Christians, and if he can, let him do us the favour to tell us what it is.</p>
            <p>I am likewise very much Scandalized at you, for giving the right hand of Fellowship to our <hi>Presbyterian Jesuits,</hi> whom, were you of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Ancient Puritans, you would thrust out of your Synagogues, as soon as you know what they are; should you favour, and Caress Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed <hi>Jesuits,</hi> and admit them to your Communions, would it not be reasonable to suspect, that you were <hi>Jesuits</hi> your selves? and therefore if after this you shall own our Covenanting <hi>Hildebrandists,</hi> who would set
<pb facs="tcp:66036:4"/>
their feet on the Necks of Christian Princes, you must excuse us, if we say, that you your selves are such. I am sure should the Bishops, and Clergy of either Church, do but half as much for the <hi>Papists</hi> as you have done for our <hi>Presbyterian Papalines,</hi> you would, and very justly too, proclaim them for <hi>Papists</hi> all over the <hi>Protestant</hi> world. Many of them this day are protected among you, and one of them among you; or which is worse, one of your selves lately <hi>Published these two Treasonable, and Blasphemous Speeches</hi> with so many Tricks, and Falsifications, as none but a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or <hi>Jesuited Nonconformist</hi> could do.</p>
            <p>For first, in the <hi>Title-page</hi> he calls them, <hi>The last Speeches of</hi> &amp;c. <hi>at the place of Execution,</hi> without mentioning the horrid Crimes for which they were Executed; which plainly shews, be he <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> that he is one of these <hi>Jesuited Presbyterians,</hi> that counted the late Insurrection no Rebellion, as these two Traytors did amply declare. Also by omitting to mention the Treasons and Rebellion for which they were Executed, he gives the people occasion to think, that they were put to death like Apostles, meerly <hi>for Preaching the Gospel,</hi> though before they engaged in the late Insurrection, they Preached Treason and Rebellion in the Feilds, to Thousands of Armed-men.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>6th.</hi> pag. where he saith, that Mr. <hi>King bore his Testimony against the Covenant,</hi> he hath left out these words in which he bore it.</p>

               <hi>And particularly, I bear my Testimony against that horrid Violation done to our Lord Jesus Christ, and that by Usurping upon his Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, and in Spoiling him of his Crown, Sword, Scepter and Royal Robe, by taking those Princely Ornaments to invest a man with, whose Breath is in his</hi>

            <p>For what is contained betwixt (<hi>eightly, as for,</hi> &amp;c.) after (<hi>Harlot Scotland</hi>) page 21. and (<hi>let the Land consider</hi>) after <hi>Principles and Practices,</hi> page 25. line 3. should have been Printed after all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from these words, and should have followed on the blank page, to (<hi>reflection upon any</hi>) page 27. line 19. as may be seen by consulting the Sixth and Eleventh Pages of this Edition, which is sufficiently proved by these words, (<hi>in the close as a dying person</hi>) at the bottom of the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Page of this Edition, which usher in his last words.</p>
            <p>The reason is plain, why he put the most poysonous part at the latter end, <hi>viz.</hi> That the common Reader, who might have spit it out again at first, might take it down without scruple, after his palate had been prepared with all he had unwarily swallowed before.</p>
            <p>But this had not been so great a fault, had he Printed it all; but he hath left out all that <hi>Treasonable, Papal, Rebellious, Jesuitical</hi> stuff from these words, (<hi>his Servants and People</hi>) page 7. line 17. in this Edition, to (<hi>and moreover</hi>) page 10. line 35. which I desire the Reader to consult.

            <p>The Jesuitical Publisher of these Jesuitical Speeches, must needs be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> because none of the other Sectaries would concern themselves so much for the <hi>Covenant, Kirk-Sessions,</hi> and <hi>Presbyteries;</hi> nay, it is most probable that he is a <hi>Covenanting Presbyterian of the Field-Sort,</hi> and therefore I cannot but exhort you, who are the more moderate, and better Principled Dissenters of that Denomination, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of such, and to endeavour to find out this particular Sophisticator, and when you have discovered him, to purge him out of your Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as a dangerous piece of Jesuitical Leven; or, as the Apostle speaks of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Fornicator, to put him away from among your selves, as you tender your Reputation, and would have us believe you are sound Protestants, and not of the stamp of our Jesuitical <hi>Whigs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot forbear to press this advice upon you with passion, for if you beware not betimes of these <hi>Dogs</hi> of our <hi>Concision,</hi> your Societies
<pb facs="tcp:66036:5"/>
will shortly be incurably leavened with their Rebellious and Murderous <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Doctrines, which in a little time will influence your practices, and <hi>impulse</hi> you like them to March into the Field. If you take not speedy care, they will put you upon <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Projects; set up a Cause, and Interest among you, which shall be dearer to you than that of the Publick, and bring you under another Government, besides that of your Prince. There was a Project of that <hi>Jesuitical</hi> nature, attempted by some of your Principals about four or five years ago, when some of your Ministers and others Caballed together about reducing the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (Whether over <hi>England</hi> only, or over all the three Nations, I do not well remember) into the same sort of Policy, by which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> are Governed over all the world. The Nation was to be divided into Districts, or <hi>Provinces;</hi> every District was to have its <hi>Provincial,</hi> and over all the Provinces was to be appointed one <hi>General</hi> to reside con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly (as I remember) in <hi>London;</hi> and the first, who was to have the Honour of that Office, (like the Founder of the <hi>Jesuits</hi>) had been a Soldier, and a great Malesactor, and is also sit to be General of an Army, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided in that Consult. He is a Gentleman whom you all know, and makes a great part of a late Narrative, wherein the impudent Narrator impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly calls you the <hi>most Sober and considerable Protestants of the Land.</hi> The Provincials in their several <hi>Districts,</hi> were to take an account of the growth or decay of the Party, to note their friends and enemies, to receive their Contributions, and give an account of all to the General, who was to supervise for the good of the whole. This account, with which I am confident I do not surprise some of you, was told me upon condition of Secrecy, by a very honest and peaceable, but Rigid <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Minister, our Countreyman, who having got notice of the Consult, broke it in the beginning, by telling the Projectors how he abhorred it, and threatning to discover it, if they did not desist. He told me also, that he believed the Project came first from the designed General, who intended by that means to raise his broken Fortunes, which if he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, he might easily have done.</p>
            <p>And to do his Memory Justice, he told me this Story with very great indignation; the substance of which, (as I shall answer for it to God at the day of Judgement) I have faithfully related (to the best of my memory) upon the Faith of a Christian Man. I have told you this, not to upbraid you, but with an honest design to make you take the greater care not to conform your selves to the <hi>Jesuitical</hi> example of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrator Field-Presbyterians,</hi> who also have such a secret policy (<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium in imperio</hi>) among themselves. And I hope you will hereafter detest them for the sake of their <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Principles and Practices, that so you may not by insensible degrees grow like them in either or both, but especially in Violence, Cruelty, and Inhumanity, and so make your Bishops and their Clergy like ours, dread you as much as they dread the worst of <hi>Papists,</hi> and think it indifferent whether they fall by the <hi>Popish,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> hands. There is no great difference in the choice between a <hi>Clement</hi> and a <hi>Melvil,</hi> a <hi>Ravillac,</hi> and a <hi>Mitchel,</hi> Hanging 50 Cubits high, or Burning, a Jail, and the Inquisition, or between being persecuted to any degree, or in any kind, as an <hi>Heretick</hi> by <hi>Papists,</hi> or as a <hi>Papist</hi> by <hi>Presbyterians, &amp;c.</hi> as an enemy to the <hi>Church</hi> by those, and as an enemy to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> by these.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66036:6"/>The following Speeches alone will sufficiently inform you, what great reason the Clergy and their Patrons have to fear the <hi>Jesuited Presbyterians;</hi> but if you please to Consult the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> and the History of the Archbishops Murder, you will have more abundant Evidence, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how friendly I have dealt with you in warning of you against that Execrable Sect.</p>
            <p>In consulting my Citations, I must intreat you to take notice, that it is the first Edition of <hi>Knoxes</hi> History in <hi>Octavo,</hi> out of which my Quotations of that Author are taken. It is a very scarse Book, but more of them are extant among our Phanaticks, than all <hi>Great Britain</hi> besides. If you have it not among your selves, you may find it among them; and though Archbishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> (whose incomparable Son was<note place="margin">Lib. 5. 267.</note> Murdered by the <hi>Covenanters</hi>) proves undeniably, that the <hi>Church History</hi> ascribed to him, is none of his; yet that is nothing to my purpose, since it is evident it was written by an <note n="*" place="margin">For <hi>Knox</hi> as <hi>Cambden</hi> in his Hist. of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> lib. 1. p. 95. of the third Edition i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When I began this Preface, I thought to have taken an occasion to lay down the <hi>common Principles,</hi> in which all <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (I mean <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of all sorts) do agree, and the <hi>Arguments</hi> by which they have combated <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Episcopal Ordination,</hi> and to have shewn you by direct, and undeniable deductions, how the Principles of the <hi>Independents</hi> and of all other Subdivisions of Sectaries, are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable consequents of the <hi>Former,</hi> and that the whole Fabrick of the Christian Religion will be mightily endangered if not destroyed by <hi>the latter:</hi> not only <hi>the Baptizing of Infants, the Observation of the Lords-day, the Admission of Women to the Holy-Communion,</hi> (who were not, as <hi>Cassand.</hi> observes, admitted to the Paschal Lamb, which it succeeded, nor can it be expresly proved out of the New Testament, that ever they received it) but <hi>the Order, and Authority of Presbyters to Administer it, nay, the use of both the Holy Sacraments,</hi> (which the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Quakers</hi> say was a Temporary Institution) and <hi>the Divine Authority of the Scriptures in general,</hi> upon which the Christian Religion depends. But I hear that one intends to do this in a particular Tract, wherein he also designs to shew, That scarce one particular of the Christian Religion, except the Authority of the Scriptures in general, hath been so little contested as <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Episcopal Ordination,</hi> wherein for above 1400. years, the Hereticks agreed with the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being so, it may easily be discerned to what cause we ought chiefly to ascribe that Deluge of <hi>Atheism,</hi> and utter contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which hath overflowed the Land. You have been the main occasion of it, the Atheists, as well as the whole Brood of Sects, are your (though I confess Equivocal) Offspring; and to give them their due, they have not been ingrateful, but always serviceable to you, and upon all occasions have joined with you in your main designs against the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and the Church. However it is the Churches unhappiness, yet it is not Her dishonour, that She and Her Clergy have you and them, your Allies, for their Common Enemies; you joyn hand in hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and endeavour to cover their Faces with shame, and fill their Souls with contempt. But I desire you seriously to consider, whether your
<pb facs="tcp:66036:6"/>
ingratitude to God for such a Church, and your contempt and forsaking of such a Clergy, who have always been such faithful, and invincible Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions against the <hi>Papists,</hi> be not one of those crying Sins, which have justly provoked God to threaten us with <hi>Popery,</hi> and which may at length urge him to bring you under the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> both for your Punishment and Cure.</p>

                        <hi>Othniel, Gideon, Jephtha, Samson,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>Samuel</hi> told, when he was to be made King, that <hi>the Spirit of the Lord should come upon him for a Sign, and that he should Prophesie, and be turned into another man.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 6, 9. And at King <hi>Davids</hi> inauguration 'tis expresly said, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 13. that Samuel <hi>took the horn of oyl, and anointed</hi> David <hi>in the midst of his Brethren, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward;</hi> this was the <hi>Spirit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which consisted in a mighty power and impulse to do brave Heroical actions, and carried along with it all the Royal qualifications, that a man ought to have, whom God was pleased to call to the <hi>Helm. Maimonides</hi> calls it the <hi>Spirit of Fortitude,</hi> but he might as well have called it the <hi>Spirit of Wisdom, and Counsell,</hi> for it fitted the persons upon whom it came in all points for the Royal Office, and the Collation of it in visible impressions upon them was a Sign to the people that they were Authorized, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned by God. And therefore King <hi>David</hi> after the matter of <hi>Uriah,</hi> for which he deserved to be rejected, like <hi>Saul,</hi> prays God in a most penitential manner, not to cast him away from his presence, nor take away the Spirit of Government from him, which he had instead of a standing Commission from God. Upon these, and such like Texts, which are to be understood in a Political sence, hath been founded the Doctrine of <hi>Spiritual desertion</hi> or <hi>the comings and goings of God from the Soul,</hi> which hath been as usefull an engine for the Ministers falsely so called, to take fast hold on the Souls, and Purses of their Melancholick Disciples, as the Doctrines of Transubstantiation, Purgatory, and Absolution hath been to the <hi>Romish Priests,</hi> of taking hold of the Souls and Purses of theirs. For when a man oppressed with Melancholy, or Melancholick Doctrines, shall in his fits of dejection think himself deserted by God, will he not admire and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the very Shadow of that holy man whose Prayers shall prevail with God to return unto him again? And then after the recess of the Melancholick fit, which he is taught to believe is the comfortable return of the Spirit, he cannot but be very liberal to him, by whose powerfull intercession he hath received such a Divine benefit, a blessing better than life it self. I deny not but that God may sometimes beget Supernatural joy in the soul of an holy man, by impressing upon him a secret sense of his love, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise kindle the flames of Hell in the Conscience of a sinner, by impressing on his soul a secret sense of his wrath: But these are extraordinary ways of dealing with men, of which the Scriptures are silent; but he can no more impress the sense of his wrath upon the spirit of a gracious, then the sense of his love upon the spirit of a graceless Christian, nor secretly contribute to enslave, and torment the Consciences of good men with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or unreasonable jealousies and fears. Indeed nothing is more plainly taught in the Holy Scriptures than this; that God gives his holy Spirit of <hi>assisting grace,</hi> or which is all one, the gracious assistance of his holy Spirit to men, and upon certain provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions takes it from them again: and this is the only Scriptural desertion, and the only sence in which that word ought to be used. Away then with those Canting Phrases of Gods Going, and Coming to the soul in fits of supernatural joys and fears, with which the Coiners of the Doctrine of desertion teach, that the souls of holy Men are now transported, and then pressed down as it were to Hell.</note>

In which sences he saith it is opposit to <hi>Tzedakah</hi> which both signifies justice, and the due, which justice gives to every man In this sence St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.

Accordingly the <hi>freedom</hi> of Gods grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the gratuitous redemption of the world through Jesus Christ, which was a meer favor, or such a benefit as mankind was altogether unworthy of, and which God in justice was not bound to do. I say it consists in the gratuitous redemption of all mankind, and not in the arbitrarious calling and election of this, and that particular man, as this Kirk-Preacher here suggests. So that when a man speaks of the free Grace of God, in reference to his own particular, if he speak Orthodoxly, he ought to be understood of his own share in the general free redemption, and not of the free Grace of God in saving of him, and reprobating or passing over others, which is the Kirk, and Kirkers usual sence of <hi>free grace,</hi> according to the Assemblies larger and shorter Catechisms, which they have <hi>Homologated</hi> for their own. But this is strange Divinity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Divine Nature, which Phancys God out of meer wilfulness and osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his <hi>Soveranity,</hi> to pluck one man out of the fire and leave another, as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his mercy, to burn eternally therein.

Further I am pressed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to make mention of all those great and glorious things that God hath done in <hi>Scotland</hi> since the year 1640. and 1641. the aboundant measure of his Spirit that was poured out upon his servants and people, and the renewing of that National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant twice in that year, and once in the year following, the Blessed efficacy that the Gospel had at that time in all the Corners of the Land, &amp; the great things that followed upon it, which while improven, made our Land most desirable. <note n="w" place="margin">The Solemn League and Covenant, is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the Kirk-Doctrines and Cause. Hence they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call it the <hi>Holy</hi> League and Covenant, as both the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> called its Prototype, the League of the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and as the <hi>Pope</hi> compared the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> to <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> and the <hi>Jesuits</hi> to <hi>Gideon.</hi> (Davila lib. 9.) So the Kirk-Preachers taught, that the Lords who began the Design of the Covenant, acted like the <hi>Jewish</hi> Worthys in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, and were moved and directed so to do by the secret motions of the Spirit of God. In the beginning of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they set up one Mrs. <hi>Mitchelson</hi> a <hi>Ministers</hi> Daughter for a Prophetess, who pretended to be Inspired with a Spirit of <hi>Divination,</hi> and she said, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to her by God, that their Covenant was approved by him, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in heaven, and Mr. <hi>Henry Rollock</hi> a Covenanting-Minister being desired to pray with her, answered he durst not, because it would not be good manners in him to speak, while his Master Christ was Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her, and yet at length she openly confessed, that she was an Impostor, and that the <hi>Ministers</hi> told her in private what she should speak. The Author of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> pag. 240. brings in Mr. <hi>Hugh Mackell</hi> a Rebel-Preacher saying, <hi>Whatever indignity is done to the Solemn League and Covenant, I esteem it no less than doing despite to the Spirit of Grace in his most eminent exerting of himself, and that it is a sin of the same nature with that of those men, who ascribed Christs casting out of Devils to</hi> Belzebub, <hi>but far greater.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Andrew Cant</hi> in a Sermon at <hi>Glascow</hi> 1638, pressing the people to take the Covenant, said, that he was sent to them with a Commission from Christ, to bid them Subscribe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is Christ'<hi>s</hi> Contract, and that he himself was come a woer to them from the Bride-Groom, and called unto them to come, and be <hi>hand-fasted unto Christ</hi> by Subscribing the Contract, and that he would not depart the Town till he had got the names of all that should refuse to Subscribe it, of whom he promised to complain to his Master Christ. But in effect he complained of them to the Committee of Estates and general Assembly, to get them Forfeited and Excommunicated. But the great Trick of the Kirk-Preachers, hath always been to Parallel the Solemn League and Covenant with the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Covenant, which was a Political aswell as a Religious Contract betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> by which he as it were Espoused himself to that people, and that people to himself. Hence they are wont to apply whatsoever is said of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> throughout the <hi>Old Test.</hi> to the Solemn League and Covenant, and the making, keeping, or breaking thereof. Were the <hi>Israelites</hi> Married to God by the one: so were the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Married to him by the other? Was the forsaking of the one, the cause of all the judgments which fell upon them: so the forsaking of the other (and not the Kings blood) is the cause of all the judgments that have fallen upon these? Were the King aswell as the people obliged to keep the former: so his <hi>Majesty</hi> aswell as his Subjects are obliged to keep the latter? Did that oblige the Children in the loyns of their Parents; so doth this oblige the people of both Nations, and their Posterity for ever more? Hence they Sacrilegiously Baptize their Children into it, and expresly renew it every time they receive the Communion, which was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as a Seal of the Covenant of Grace. Was the breaking of that a Revolting from God: so the rescission of this is an utter Apostacy, especially of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from God? So that the Whig-Apostles never speak of their Country since the Establishment of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, but as of an Harlot and Idolatress, that hath forsaken her first Love, and Married her self to another God. It would be endless to recite all their <hi>Blasphemies</hi> about it. They make the last great Plague, and the Burning of <hi>London,</hi> to have been judgments for burning this Covenant there by the hand of the Common-Hangman: (Poor mans Cup of cold water, Printed in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1678. pag. 19.) Nay they Teach that his Majesty, like the Revolting Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> hath no right to Govern, because he hath Revolted from it and Christ. Nay they damn all the Edicts and Acts of Parliament that are contrary to it, as the <hi>Act</hi> Statuting, that no Leagues, nor Bonds be made among the Subjects of any degree, upon whatsoever Pretence without his Majesties, and his Successors Privity and Consent.

                  <p>I Do not doubt but many, that are Spectators here, have some or other end, then to be edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what yee may see in the behaviour, or hear in the last words of one going to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: But if any of you have ears to hear, as I doubt not but some of this great gathering have, then I desire your ears and attention, if the Lord shall help and permit me to speak to a few things. First I bless the Lord (since by his wisdom and holy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he hath carved out my lot to die after this manner) that I die not <note n="a" place="margin">As unwillingly as other malefactors use to do, for in the interval betwixt his condemnation, and execution, he by his friends used all the means he could to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Majesties pardon.</note> 
                     <hi>unwillingly,</hi> nor by force. It is true, I could not do this of my self neither, allways having an inclination to put the evil day farr away; but <hi>through</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">There are two sorts of courage: one <hi>natural,</hi> and the other <hi>supernatural,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired, and the raising of the Animal <hi>Spirits</hi> by strong liquors (for Aristotle compares Enthusiasm to wine) will plausibly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit both. Hence we see that common Malefactors, party to rid their minds of the torment of fear, and partly out of a vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious desire to be mistaken by the rabble for men of great natural courage, who contemn Death, privatly fortify themselves before the time of execution by strong spirits, and cordials, by vertue of which they often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to die like gallant men. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner religious Malefactors (I mean such as pretend to suffer upon the account of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) that they may rid themselves of the terrours of an evil conscience, and appear to be assisted, like Martyrs, with supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courage, highten their spirits at the time of execution, by strong liquours, and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, which make them brisk, and bold, and insensible of Death, and Hell. But then as the former sometimes drink to much, and so discover the Cheat by dying Drunk: so the latter (who are so much the more execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hypocrites of the two, as it is a greater sin to counterfit <hi>Grace</hi> than nature) sometimes by taking too much of the creature discover their imposture by their Drunkenness, and by dying not like <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but sots. This was the deplorable case of <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> whose sad condition that good penitent Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> lamented at his execution. This likewise was the case of the <hi>Pentland-Rebels</hi> who were executed at Edinburgh, who were so stupified, and besotted with the Sack, and Brandy, which they drank on the day of their execution, and the day before, that they died like Beasts, without so much as making a prayer to God, or desiring others to pray for them; to the great scandal of all good Christian spectators, who saw them, and whereof many yet a live can witness, what I say. Lastly, this was the case, though not to that degree, of <hi>Gaven</hi> the Jesuit, elder brother to this deceiver, who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much, as he was permitted to speak, of this speech (which he had composed before) in such a broken confused manner, as Drunken men use to do, in somuch, that the orthodox spectators pityed the wretch, and his brotherhood were ashamed. See notes d, and f, on the first in Speech.</note> 
                     <hi>grace I have</hi> been helped, and by his grace yet hope to be, and though possibly I might have shunned such a hard sentence, if I had done things which (though I could) I durst not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66036:16"/>
do, no not for my Soul, yet I durst not (God knows) redeem my Life by the loss of my Integrity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. I bless the Lord, that since I have been apprehended and a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, God hath very wonderfully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden me, and made out that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable word, <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <p>I shewed before on note c, in the first speech, that this sort of Ministers falsly so called, have a <hi>Jesuitical</hi> trick of abusively applying the holy Scriptures to themselves.</p>
                        <p>Here we may see another notable instance of it, where the deceiver applys to himself this comfortable message, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet delivered in Gods name to the Jews, as they were his People in a civil sence, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them not to be afraid, or dismay'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would strengthen them, help them, and uphold them against their Enemies: so that those who were incensed against them should be ashamed, and confounded, and those that warred against them should be as a thing of naught. But here he blasphemous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asserts, that God miraculously upheld him, and <hi>made out these comfortable words to him, as if the Holy Ghost had whispered them in his conscience as expressly, as the Prophet spoke them unto the</hi> Jews. <hi>Or as if whatsoever was written in the holy Scriptures, were to be so exactly transcribed in the works of Providence, that even the Prophetical passages, and predictions were to be accomplished over and over in different Ages; or as if the latter works of Providence, not only in general, but as to particular Societies, and Persons did answer as exactly to some or other places of the Scripture, as Face answers to Face in a Glass.</hi> This Doctrine is taught in a Book called, <hi>The fulfilling of the Scriptures,</hi> Printed 1669. wherein are such Blasphemous applications of the Scripture-promises to the Condition of the Covenanters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as cannot be read without horrour, and indignation, by any Orthodox man. Ever since the Re-establishment of Episcopacy, the Conventicle-Preachers have assured their People, that God would destroy it again, and restore <hi>his own work;</hi> but then as often as they began to withdraw from them, seeing no probability of such a turn, then they Preached, and Wrote of the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which were made to Believing, as that <hi>Faith was the Evidence of things not seen,</hi> and that they ought to believe the naked Word, when there was no appearance of its <hi>out-making,</hi> according to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 20. <hi>Hear O</hi> Judah, <hi>and Inhabitants of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>believe in the Lord your God, so shall you be Established, believe his Prophets, so shall you Prosper.</hi> But then when things fell not out according to the prediction of these false Prophets, but quite contrary, then they had another Scripture to quiet their Disciples, <hi>viz. That the Righteous ought not to be afraid of evil tidings, but that their hearts should be established trusting in the Lord, and that they should not be afraid, untill they had seen their desires upon their Enemies,</hi> Psalm. 112. 7, 8. Therefore they ought to get their Spirits quiet in a recumbency on God, and to trust his Testimony more than their own Hearts, because there was then a most sensible outgate, when there was least of Sense<note place="margin">Fulfil. of Script. <hi>pag.</hi> 50.</note> and most of Faith; that when their Cause was lowest, then God called them to throw themselves on the promise, and that their most desperate venture of Life, Estate, and Credit upon the Promises of God, hath usually had the richest Incom, and that those who have been most Friends to Faith, have had Faith most a Friend to them. And then if through Faction of great men, or secret favour of Fanaticks in Power, any thing happened for their advantage, then there was another comfortable Triumphant Text to be applyed to them, to make them expect greater matters yet, <hi>viz. Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the Fig-Tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> Joh. 1. 50. Therefore is it good with <hi>Caleb,</hi> to take part with the promise against the discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reports about the <hi>Anakims;</hi> for believing doth always make way for sense, so that it is good to trust in God in a day of streights, seeing his returns have been not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Faith, but have often exceeded their belief. Then whatsoever happens for the Interest of the <hi>Cause,</hi> is not only the reward of their Faith, but the answer of their Prayers; for the People of the Lord can testifie by experience, that when they have oft with <hi>Hannah</hi> gon in before the Lord in the bitterness of their Spirit, they have been made to return with a sensible, and marvellous change in their case. For God is near unto his People, in what they call upon him according to his Word. Those who have a desire to see more of their Blasphemous applications of Scripture, may consult the foresaid Book, out of which I have taken these. See also Notes <hi>e. h. o.</hi>

But what is this to the case of this Deceiver, who was hanged for rebelling against his natural Prince? Yes, it was a brave Text to induce the People to believe, that he was a great Prophet, and the Familiar Friend of God, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, and that the Covenanters are <hi>Gods People,</hi> and the People of the Episcopal Churches, but as <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom it is Lawful and Meritorious to Rob, and Kill.</note> suffer <hi>affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of sin for a season.</hi> Therefore I am come hither to Suffer, and to lay down my Life.

                     <note n="r" place="margin">It hath always been the custom of Sectaries to miscall the Execution of the Laws, by the odious name of Persecution, which common People, who seldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the righteousness of the Cause, and not the sufferings of the Prosecuted make Persecution, are apt to think is really such, as often as men suffer upon a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">The true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution stated.</note> religious account. Therefore I will take an occasion from the abuse of the word by this Deceiver, to declare from the words of our Blessed Redeemer, That Persecution in the <hi>active sence</hi> is Inflicting, and in the <hi>passive,</hi> suffering of Evil for <hi>Righteousness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake.</hi> Whosoever then is truly Persecuted, must be prosecuted for matters of professed <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> or for matters of <hi>Practice.</hi> Upon the former account a man is Persecuted, when he is prosecuted either for professing (under which I comprehend Preaching and Teaching) a true Doctrine, which he is bound to profess, as the Apostles were persecuted by the <hi>Jews</hi> for professing Jesus to be the Christ, or for remonstrating against a false Doctrine, which he is bound to remonstrate against, as the same Apostles were persecuted for opposing this Doctrine, that <hi>Moses</hi> his Law was to be observed under-Christ. But whosoever is persecuted for matters of practise, is prosecuted either for matters of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> which concern the first Table, or for <hi>Matters of Morality,</hi> which belong to the Second, for there is no <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or Righteous cause, which is not reducable to one of these Two. With respect to matters of Divine Worship, a man is persecuted either upon a <hi>Negative account,</hi> for not Worshipping a false god, like the Three Children in <hi>Daniel,</hi> or else for not Worshipping the true God in a false way; as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apostles were persecuted by the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> for not Worshipping God according to the <hi>Jewish</hi> manner, after it was abrogated; and these are the two Sorts of Persecution, which most ordinarily occur in reading the Scriptures. Or <hi>2ly.</hi> Upon a positive account for Worshipping the true God in a true way, or to express it in the Sectaries own tearms, <hi>for Serving of God,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into the Lions Den for Praying to God against the Kings Decree. With respect to matters of <hi>Morality,</hi> a man is also Persecuted two ways; First, Upon a <hi>Negative account,</hi> when he is Prosecuted for not doing something, which is in its own nature, or by Gods positive Command Morrally Evil: as the good Midwives were in danger of being Prosecuted by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for not Murdering the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>-Infants. Or <hi>2ly.</hi> Upon a <hi>positive account,</hi> when he is Prosecuted for doing some good Deed, which in such and such circumstances ought to be done, as our blessed Lord was Prosecuted by the Pharisees for opening the Eyes of the Blind, and healing on the Sabbath-day.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">These distictions being premised, let us see, in which of these cases the Covenanters are<note place="margin">Covenantert not Persecuted.</note> Persecuted, or, which is all one, for what they are Martyrs: For no man is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, but as far as he is Persecuted he is a Martyr, and by his Suffeaings bears Witness to the righteous Cause, for which he Suffers.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">First Then, they are not Persecuted, when they are Prosecuted for professing the Principles of their Party; because they are False, Impious, or both.

But if all these, and their other Doctrines, which they profess in opposition to the Church and State, be False or Impious, or both, as most assuredly they are, then they are not Persecuted, but justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, when they are Prosecuted upon this account. <hi>Q. E. D.</hi> This made my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> truly say, That they are the men which propagate Religion by Wars, force Consciences, yet cry out, their Consciences are forced; that nurse Seditions, authorize Conspiracies and Rebellions, and put the Swords in the Peoples hand; that Sanctifie Tumults, Preach off the Heads of Kings, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Constitutions, and Government; that undermine Laws, and Settlement; that resist for Conscience-sake, and teach others so to die for their Salvation; that make Christ a raiser of Sedition, and his Religion a Firebrand; that despise Dominions, and speak evil of Dignities, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to fear God. And therefore the Magistrate is so far from Persecuting the men of such professed Principles, that he is bound by that Trust which God hath reposed in him, to Prosecute them with severe Punishments, as being pernitious, not only to his Government, but the Souls of his Subjects, who by virtue of these damnable Doctrines, will be in a constant disposition to Rebellion in this World, and in danger of Damnation in the World to come. Neither are they Persecuted for remonstrating against false Doctrines; For the Doctrines against which they remonstrate, are but contradictions of their own Principles, which I have already proved to be false. It remains then, That if they are Persecuted, it is in being Prosecuted for <hi>Matters of Practice,</hi> either upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> which belongs to the First Table; or for <hi>Matters of Morality,</hi> which belong to the Second. Upon this latter Score, they cry out of Persecution, first upon a positive account, when they are prosecuted for harbouring, hideing, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining declared and attainted Traitors, who act according to the foresaid Principles, contrary to express Law; <note n="†" place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">It remains then, That we require, whether they are Persecuted for matters of Divine Worship, either upon a negative or positive account. First Then, they pretend not to be Persecuted for <hi>not</hi> Worshipping a false God, because the Church-Congregations worship the same God, and Saviour, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do. But then they pretend, with mighty cragical Exaggerations, to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted for <hi>not</hi> Worshipping this true God in a false way; crying out, as often as they speak of the breach of the Covenant, <note n="†" place="margin">

                        <hi>Of Rebellion, Blasphemy, and perfidy against God, of Contempt of him, of overturning the Work of the Gospel, of promoting the Kingdom of darkness, and Antichrist; nay, as if the Church had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Idolatrous, of Apostatizing from God, of rejecting Christ, and overturning the Work of his Spirit, and Arm, &amp;c.</hi> and when all comes to all, they are so far from being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted for not Worshipping of God in any false, unfitting, or unscriptural way, (their own Consciences being Judge) that the way after which the Church-Congregations worship him, is the very same with their own, without Form in any Office, or Ceremony of any sort. But if the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> Worship'd God by one prescribed Form, and had appointed Ceremonies as her Sister-Church, according to the example of the Primitive-Churches, hath done; yet, this would not prove their Sufferings upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Separation to be Persecution, unless they could prove, that Forms, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the general are unlawful, which can never be proved; or that those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Forms, and Ceremonies which they were bound to observe, were unlawful; and then indeed their plea would be good. Nothing can be replied to this, but that, though the manner of Worship be the same in Churches, and Conventicles, yet the Ministery is not; but that the <hi>Church-Ministery</hi> by Bishops, and Presbyters Episcopally Ordained is unlawful: which Assertion supposeth, that if it be lawful, then they are justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and not Persecuted for not going to Church; and either it must be granted to be lawful, or else the Ministery of the Universal Church was unlawful for above 1500. years.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">There remains then nothing, but to assert, That they are punished upon a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive account, <hi>for serving of God, or for Worshipping of him in a true Way.</hi> That the way by which they publickly Worship God, is a true way; as to the substance of the Worship, were their Presbyterian, and Schismatical Ministery valid, I would not deny: but then because there are many true ways of publick Worship, Subjects, like the Children, and Servants of a Family, ought publickly to Worship God in that true way of Worship which the Supream Magistrate, the Father of the Nation, doth appoint. I will put this case to the <hi>Covenanters:</hi> There's none of them dare deny, but that the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches Worship God in a true way, and that the reformed Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> likewise worshipped him in a true way, when Mr. <hi>Knoxes</hi> Liturgy, which is almost the same with that of the <hi>French</hi> Church, was in Use. Now therefore, I desire they would tell me, That supposing the Presbyterian Government were legally Established in <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with that unprescribed Formless way of Worship, which they now use, Whether a Separating Party refusing to come to Church, because they would Worship God according to the <hi>French</hi> Liturgy, or that of Mr. <hi>Knoxes,</hi> would be guilty of Schism, or no? If they say, yes, as by their own Principles, and in common reason they are bound to do; then I desire to know, Whether the Supream Power may not forbid their Separate Meetings, and command them to come to Church under certain Pains, and Penalties, and might not most justly inflict them, if they disobeyed? They cannot say no, by their own Principles, and Practices, as well as out of common reason; and if they say yes, then they acknowledge in another case, that they are justly punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not Persecuted for meeting to worship God in Conventicles, against the penal Laws.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">But furthermore, It is not sufficient, that the substance of publick Worship be true, unless the Circumstances of it be also due. It would (for example) be a very pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable exorbitancy for any Party of conforming People in <hi>England</hi> to meet illegally in Fields, or Houses, or at Midnight in Churches, to Celebrate Divine Service by the Book of Common-Prayer, although they pretended for their Vindication, That it was against their Consciences to Pray or Communicate with Profane Persons, who come to the Churches, or to have their Christian liberty abridged by legal confinement to Time, and Place. This is the very case of the Field-Fanaticks, who though they worship God in the same way as the Church-Congregations do, as to the substance of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; Yet, notwithstanding their pretence, that they dare not own the Church-Ministery, they are justly punished, and not Persecuted for their Irregularities, and Transgressions in the legal circumstances thereof.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">But lastly, Though the way in which they meet to Worship God, were not only true, but as excellent as they imagine it to be; nay, were they the only true Christians in the World, and their Magistrates Idolaters, or Atheists, yet, they have no reason to say they are Persecuted, when they are punished on this account; because the Laws, which forbid them to meet in such a manner, allow every Family with a certain number of Strangers, to worship God in what manner they like best; and were they of the Principles, and Temper of the Primitive Christians, they would be so far from complaining of Persecution, that they would be thankful to God, and the Powers, for so much indulgence, and strive by their peaceable behaviour to procure more.</note>

Nay, as much as they could, they forced the Conscience of the late King, of blessed Memory, not suffering him to Serve God in his own Family according to his own way, which was by the <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> The general Assembly in <hi>August</hi> 1640. made an Act against <hi>Expectants,</hi> (or young Students in Divinity) who should refuse to subscribe the Covenant, by which they declared them uncapable of Preaching, Reading in a Church, or Teaching School, or Residing in any Colledge, or University; and if they continned obstinate, to be Excommunicated; and yet they now complain of the King, Parliament, and Council, for obliging Expectants, and Scholars, at their Laureation to take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which is their Duty to do. They were not only content to declare Episcopacy to be Popish, and Antichristian, but in an Act of Assembly 1638. they declared, That it was abjured in the <hi>National Covenant</hi> 1581. under these words, <hi>The Popes wicked Hierarchy,</hi> (a <hi>Bull,</hi> or contradiction <hi>in Adjecto</hi>) which as they cite it from the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> includes the Orders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons; so that if Bishops were abjured by them who took the National Covenant under the <hi>Popes Hierarchy,</hi> how came it to pass, that they did not abjure Priests and Deacons too?

And <hi>Mauritius</hi> a <hi>Primicerius</hi> of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, bespoke the Soldiers at the time of Execution, Thus: <hi>I was very much afraid,</hi> Fellow-Soldiers, <hi>lest any of you, as it is very natural, especially for Armed men to do, should have Resisted under the specious pretext of Self-Defence.

Duty of all Christians when they are Persecuted by Authority; and Thirdly, That it is so far from justifying Rebellion, as the Author of <hi>Behem.</hi> foolishly Asserts, That it is the only Doctrine which can keep Subjects who are really Persecuted and Oppressed, or phansie themselves to be so, from Rebelling against their Sovereign; and therefore the Popish, and Presbyterian Jesuits, who love to have it in their Power to trouble the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christian Monarchs, declare it to be as great a Sin, as active Obedience to their unlawful Commands. And now, when all Sects, whereof some are not Chistians, with great confidence call themselves <hi>Protestants,</hi> upon the account of their Opposition,<note place="margin">No Orthodon Protestants who deny the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Passive Obedience.</note> whether real or pretended, to Popery; I freely declare, That none of them are, or ought to be esteemed so in a strict, and Orthodox sence, but such as Profess the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> as strictly as it was both Professed and Practised in the Primitive Catholick Church. Nay, furthermore, seeing there are some common Maxims of Christian Divinity, which were always professed by the Church Universal for undoubted Truths, although they are not set down expressly, neither in the Scriptures, nor in the Apostles Creed, and the truth of which were never questioned but by some few Hereticks, who had no proportion to the rest; I also assert, That no Man nor Society of Men, how Antipapistical soever they may be, ought to be looked upon as Orthodox Protestants, unless they profess these common Notions of Christianity, without the Belief and Profession of which, none could be counted Orthodox Christians in the Primitive Catholick Church. These common Principles, wherein all Christian Churches agreed, are these: <hi>That the Scriptures are the Word of God; That there are Three distinct Persons in the holy Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and that these Three</hi>

                        <hi>are one God; That Christ is both God and Man in the same Person; That the Lords-Day, or First Day of every Week ought to be kept Holy; That a Solemn Yearly Commemoration of the Passion, Resurrection, and Ascention of our Lord, and of the Descent of the Holy Ghost, ought to be Observed; and that the Church Universal is to be Governed by Bishops above, and distinct from Presbyters.</hi> There never was any Church from the Apostles, and downwards for above Fourteen hundred Years, which did not consent to the Truth of These, and some other Doctrines, and look upon them as the common Notions of the Christian Religion, delivered down from its first Original, with the Articles of Christian Faith. And therefore, as no <hi>Arrian, Photinian, Sabbatarian,</hi> or <hi>Aerian,</hi> how Opposite soever they were to the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens, the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christianity, were admitted for truly Catholick or Orthodox Christians, in the Primitive times; but were Condemned, and Anathematized for Hereticks;<note place="margin">The true not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on of Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy.</note> so now, no Society of <hi>Antiscripturists, Antitrinitarians, Socinians, Antidomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans,</hi> (for I will not call them <hi>Antisabbatarians</hi>) <hi>Antipaedobaptists, Antiepiscopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> of what Denomination soever; and likewise no Society of men professing the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Apostolical Holy-days</hi> to be Superstitious and Idolatrous, how opposite soever they pretend to be to the common Enemie of the Reformed Churches, ought not to be considered as Orthodox Protestants, who by that name are understood to <hi>Protest</hi> against the Errors, Innovations, Corruptions, and Usurpations of the <hi>Romish,</hi> but not against the Common Doctrines of the <hi>Primitive Catholick</hi> Church.</note>

The Story of their Principal Saint, Major <hi>Thomas Weir,</hi> so Infamous for Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adultery, Incest, and Bestiality, for which he was Condemned, was lately Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in <hi>Ravillac Redivivus,</hi> to which I refer the Reader. Mr. <hi>James Symson</hi> Minister at <hi>Airthe,</hi> a little before his Majesties Restauration, took a Womans Oath before the Congregation, who had brought forth a Bastard, in these words: <hi>That she never knew a man, more than she knew him;</hi> which made the People suspect it to be his own, for almost every day she brought cases of Conscience to him in his Chamber, which made his Wife Jealous after she heard the words of the Oath. One <hi>James Foyer</hi> a Beggar, who passed for so great a Saint among them, that he was Registred for a known Seeker of God in the Presbytery Book of <hi>Glascow,</hi> was afterwards found guilty of above an hundred Adulteries, Incests, innumerable Fornications, and Witch-Craft; for which he should have been Hanged, had not the <hi>Glascow</hi>-Fanaticks made a Contribution, and bribed the <hi>English</hi>-Judges to save his Life, so that he was only Scourged through the Town. Afterwards he Dyed miserably by a Ditch; when he Tempted Women to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, he said he would give them an holy Kiss, and if he knew them not to be in the State of Grace, he would not meddle with them. Since his Majesties Restauration, <hi>Seven or Eight great Fanaticks</hi> have been Burnt for <hi>Bestiality,</hi> who always went to Conventicles, and refused to hear the Church-Ministers Preach; and in the Parish of <hi>Govean,</hi> in Two Years time, Eight Persons were found guilty of <hi>Incest,</hi> all Fanaticks, who acted their Abominations as they went to, and came from Conventicles, as they confessed before the Presbytery of <hi>Glascow.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hugh Archibald</hi> Minister at <hi>Evandale</hi> a Zealous Fanatick, was guilty of many Adulteries. And Mr. <hi>James Porter,</hi> a Famous Conventicler, Son of Mr. <hi>James Porter</hi> Synod-Clerk of <hi>Glascow,</hi> got a Child in Adultery, with <hi>Margaret Gilchrison</hi> in <hi>Gorbels,</hi> and thought to have Murdered it at his Birth, but that he was hindred by some Women living in the lower Story, who heard it cry. It was Baptized by Mr. <hi>Alex. Janison,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> himself fled into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Houston</hi> at <hi>Elskine,</hi> one of their Ministers, kept a Servant Maiden, with whom he lay nightly till she brought forth a Child, and then they both fled to <hi>Ireland.</hi> Mr. <hi>Sam. Rutherford</hi> their great Apostle, Mr. <hi>John Karstaires,</hi> Mr. <hi>Matthew Rumsey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John King, the Author of this Speech,</hi> got their Wives with Child before Marriage; and for this last, many doubt if he and his pretended Wife were ever Married at all. Mr. <hi>Peter Paterson,</hi> a certain Fanatical Lords Chaplain and Chamberlain, begot many Children in Adultery; and though it was their Custom to do all they could to Conceal the Infirmities and Failings of their Ministers and eminent Professors, to avoid Scandal, yet great is the number of such who were processed for Adultery, as their own Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery-Registers yet do shew.</note>

Afterwards he went to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he begot another Child in Adultery, and Murdered it and his own Wife, for which he was Hanged there. <hi>Charles Petticrue</hi> a Married man in <hi>Glascow,</hi> lay with a Woman in <hi>James Galts</hi> House in the Day, and was catched in the Act; yet he was one of those Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Zealots, who held it unlawful to come to Church. The Wife of <hi>James Wallace</hi> of <hi>Badrean</hi> a great Conventicler, was taken by her Husband in the Act of Adultery with his Man Servant. He brought them both tied together in their Shifts to <hi>Pascly-Cross;</hi> She had the Bible in her hand when she committed Adultery, and Tempted her man, who first refused her, to the Sin, by Blasphemously telling of him, <hi>There was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them who were in Christ.

And since his Majesties Restauration there have been above an hundred Adulteries, and many more Fornications committed by Conventiclers, within the single Presbytery of <hi>Glascow,</hi> whose names shall be produced out of the Registers, if they be denied. <hi>Ravillac Redivivus</hi> page 43. saith, That there are more Fornications and Adulteries committed in the <hi>West,</hi> where these Fanaticks so much abound, than in all the Nations besides; and particularly, That Seventeen of them of one Parish, within the Presbytery of <hi>Pasely,</hi> did publick Penance at one time.

The Tragical Story of the Lord <hi>Forrester</hi> is now the Talk of the whole Kingdom.

Most certain it is, That the Five Witches, which bewitched Sir <hi>George Maxwell</hi> of <hi>Nether-Pollock</hi> to Death, and the Four which bewitched <hi>Robert Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Barnes,</hi> were all Presbyterians, who dyed owning that Party, and disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bearing Testimony against the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Curates,</hi> and against the <hi>Belief,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> calling them <hi>Popish Trash</hi> at the Stake, when they were ready to be Burnt.

And it is Observable, That both Sir <hi>George,</hi> and the <hi>Laird of Barnes,</hi> both Zealous Covenanters, consulted with her for the recovery of their health. In the beginning of <hi>November</hi> last, a Discovery was made of a great number of Witches in <hi>Burrowstoness,</hi> a Port on the <hi>Forth,</hi> where the Fanaticks think themselves most Safe, and where they usually land the Arms which they buy in Foreign Countreys for the Service of the Cause. Five of them, all Conventiclers, have freely confessed; and the chief of them one—<hi>Vicar</hi> was a most Zealous, and Celebrate Professor, and the greatest Convener of the People to Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that was in all the Countrey.</note>

But among the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, there is nothing but pure Barbarity to be found towards those, who are known to favour the Church; especially towards the Bishops, and their Clergy, whom they treat upon all occasions with all imaginable rudeness; insomuch that I wonder, that this Gentleman should complain of the want of common Civility, which he could do upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but that from the time of his Apprehension, to the hour of his Execution, he was treated, as Traitors and Rebels usually are under all the Governments of the World. Certainly, he had forgot his own Party, when he made this Complaint; and therefore, though he be gone, I shall refresh the memory of his Brethren, that they upon the same occasion may not make the same groundless Complaint.</note>

So in the New Testament, when Christ sent out the Apostles, after his Resurrection, he solemnly made this Promise unto them: <hi>All power</hi> (saith he) <hi>is given unto you, both in Heaven and Earth, go ye therefore, and Teach all Nations Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, and lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the World.</hi> Accordingly we read in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> who were the Prophets of the New Testament, with what invincible courage and resolution those poor men appeared before the <hi>Jewish,</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> Tribunals; and with what astonishing Presence, both of body and mind, they bore the name of Jesus <hi>before the Kings and Princes, and People of the Earth.</hi> I have been the more full in the explication of this notion, because the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ministers have been so guilty of applying these Promises of Divine Presence, and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to themselves, and of talking and acting at such an arrogant rate; as if, like the Prophets, they had been sent, and employed by God. By this means, they have brought a great Scandal on the Ministerial Office, and made People loath the Pulpit, and the Church.

And as they treated him with a Counterfeit sort of Prophetical boldness, liberty and zeal, so their Successors who had, and have a double Portion of that rude and insolent Spirit, have treated his Son, <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and his Grandson, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; and so they will treat all the Kings that shall sit on this <hi>British</hi> Throne, as long as there can be found in the Bible any Prophetical Message, Promise, or Enterprize, which they can with any colour apply to themselves.</note>

                  <p>THere was a true Account of this Horrid Murder <hi>Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Authority</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July</hi> last 1679. it was Printed at <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Andrew Forrester,</hi> next door to the <hi>Miter Tavern</hi> in <hi>Kings-street Westminster,</hi> and was drawn up by a learned Gentleman, one of his Majesties most Honourable Privy-Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who concealed his name, as all men have reason to do, who write any thing that may offend, or provoke the <hi>Bloody Sects.</hi> He wrote it to correct a Scandalous and Lying Narrative, which according to the Reports that had been spread about <hi>London</hi> by the <note n="*" place="margin">In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar by Dr. <hi>J.</hi> and Dr. <hi>B.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and other Sectaries there, related, That the Archbishop was Killed by——<hi>Hackston,</hi> whom his <hi>Grace</hi> had cast in a Suit at Law, and some of his oppressed Tenants, who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired together out of private Revenge, to take away his Life.</p>
                  <p>But because many notable Particulars relating to this Murder are come to light since the <hi>True Account</hi> of it was Printed; I hope I shall do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice both to the Publick, and the Memory of that great Man, in giving a more full, and exact Narrative of the Assassination of his <hi>Sacred</hi> Person, which, excepting the Solemn <hi>Paricide</hi> committed on the most Sacred Person of our late <hi>most Gracious Sovereign,</hi> will perhaps appear to be as Barbarous a Murder, as ever was commited upon a meer Man.</p>
                  <p>My Narrative will consist of three Parts; whereof the first shall be a plain Relation of <hi>the Matter of Fact,</hi> without any Rhetorical Exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which serve for nothing but to render the Historian suspected, and misbecome the simplicity of the Historical Stile. Secondly, I will shew out of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers, the <hi>Bloody Principles</hi> upon which this Murder was committed: and in the Conclusion I shall shew by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66036:36"/>
what steps, and degrees of Cruelty and Sedition they arrived at such a desperate undertaking as this Murder was, and the Rebellion which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed thereupon.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin the first part with telling the Reader, That the Archbishop had been attending his Majesties Service in the Privy-Council at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> from whence he went over into <hi>Fife</hi> in the Afternoon, on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>May</hi> 1679. That Night he Lodged at Captain <hi>Seatons</hi> House in a Village called <hi>Kennoway,</hi> which is in the midway betwixt <hi>Bruntisland</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> About Midnight, as the People of the Town report, two Men well Mounted and Armed, came thither to enquire if the <hi>Archbishop of St. Andrews</hi> was Lodged at Captain <hi>Seatons;</hi> and as soon as they were informed that he was, they presently Rode out of the Town again. The next morning being the Third of <hi>May,</hi> several Parties of Horsemen were seen to traverse the Road betwixt <hi>Kennoway</hi> and <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less were the Assassins, who watched for an opportunity to effect the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they had long designed. But the <hi>Lord Primate,</hi> who was a Man of great Natural Courage, and whom so many Deliverances, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Twenty Years, from the hands of those Bloody Zealots, had now brought to an entire Confidence in Gods Protection, took Coach about Nine of the Clock, without any presage or apprehension of Danger. He had none but his Elder Daughter to Ride with him in the Coach, and only three Servants on Horseback to attend him; one of whom he had sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Assaulted, to pay his Respects to a Person of Honour, by whose House he passed on his Road. He advanced in his Journey in great security, till he came to a little Countrey-Village called <hi>Magus,</hi> two Miles distant from <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> betwixt an Eleven and Twelve of the Clock in the Forenoon. There he first perceived himself to be pursued by an Eleven or Twelve Men barefaced, well Mounted, with Pistols Cocked in their Hands, and drawn Swords hanging in Strings from their Arms. As soon as he spied them, he bid his Coachman Drive as fast, as his Horses could Gallop, but alas too late! for the Assassins furiously pursued him, and in their Pursuit Shot at him several times in the Coach, running as fast as Six good Horses could draw it. The Coachman (who discovered the Villains before his Lord, and had thereupon begged leave of him, but was not permitted to Gallop away) had certainly outdriven them, if one <hi>Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock,</hi> Mounted on a very fleet Bay Horse, had not overtaken them; who not daring to Attack the Coachman, because his Whip did fright his spritely Horse, rod up to the Postilion, whom he wounded with his Sword in the Face, Shot one of the foremost Coach-Horses, Ham-stringed the other, and so stopped the Coach. By that time this was done, the rest of the Murderers came up, and one of them Fired a Pistol, or a Blunderbuss so near his Breast, that his Daughter rubbed off the burning which stuck to his Gown. Then they called to him by the name <hi>of Dog, Villain, Apostat, Persecuter of the Godly, Betrayer of Jesus Christ and his Church, and bid him come out of the Coach to receive what he deserved for his wickedness against the Kirk of</hi> Scotland. Upon this his Daughter got out of the Coach, and fell on her knees, begging her Fathers Life; but they regarding neither her Prayers nor Tears, threw her down several times upon the ground, trampled upon her, and wounded her; which her tender-hearted Father seeing, after much reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful language and many threatnings, came meekly out of the Coach, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66036:36"/>
with calmness said unto them, <hi>Gentlemen, I know not that I ever injured any of you, or if I did, I am ready to make you reparation; and therefore I beseech you to spare my life, and I promise I will never pursue you for this Violence, and I pray you consider before you bring the guilt of Innocent Blood upon your selves.</hi> The reverence of his Presence, and his undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage in addressing himself so resolutely, and gravely unto them, surprised them, and made them stand a little while, as it were unresolved what to do; and one of them relenting, cryed to the rest, <hi>Spare these Grey Hairs:</hi> but their cruel Zeal overcoming their natural Pity and Justice, paused not long before they replyed, <hi>He must dye, he must dye;</hi> and then again calling him <hi>Traiterous Villain, Judas, Betrayer of the Interest of Christ, Enemy to God and his People,</hi> said unto him, <hi>Thou shalt now receive the reward of thy Apostacy, and Enmity to the People of God.</hi> Then seeing them determined to take away his Life, he begged a little while to Pray, telling them, <hi>He would pray for them;</hi> but they scornfully told him, <hi>That they cared not for his Prayers, being sure that God would not hear so base a dog, as he was.</hi> Then looking stedfastly upon one of the Assassins, whom he seemed to know, he kneeled down before him, and said unto him, <hi>Sir, You are a Gentleman, and I must beg my last favour from you, That since you are resolved that I must dye, you would have pity upon my poor Child here, and spare her Life, and for this, Sir, give me your hand.</hi> And thereupon stretching his hand towards the cruel man, he had for a return a very great blow with a Shable, which almost quite cut off his hand, and the Villain redoubling his Stroak, gave him another violent Wound upon the left Eye, which cut him two Inches above it, and one below. This Stroak knocked him down, but getting upon his knees again, he said, <hi>Gentlemen, it is now enough, you have done your Work,</hi> and holding up his hands (as well as he could) to Heaven, he fervently cryed out, <hi>Lord Jesus! have mercy on my Soul, and receive my Spirit.</hi> While he was in this posture of Devotion, they wounded him in his hands, which he held up to Heaven, and in other parts of his Body, till in a kind of composure he laid down his head upon his arm, saying, <hi>God forgive you, and I forgive you all.</hi> These were the last words which he uttered, like an excellent Christian; after which they gave him no less than sixteen Wounds on his Head, insomuch that it seemed to be all one Wound: and pieces of his shattered Scull, and Brains were some days after found on the ground, that unhallowed <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where he was Slain. Having thus hackt, and cleft his Head, some of them as they were going away thought they heard him groan, which made them go back, and to make sure work, stir about his Brains in the Scull with the points of their Swords. Having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their long desired Murder, they made his Servants solemnly Swear not to discover them, and then bad them in derision <hi>take up their Priest;</hi> and having said so, Rode back to <hi>Magus,</hi> where they first assaulted the Coach, and one of them, by name <hi>John Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock,</hi> as he passed by that Town, was heard to say very audibly, and distinctly, <hi>That now Judas was killed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have here written concerning the manner of this execrable Murder <hi>of the Primate,</hi> his devout behaviour towards God, and his meek carriage towards his Murderers, and the several mild Expressions in which he addressed himself unto them, and the most rude unchristian language in which they replyed, is taken from the Information of the young Lady,

who Rode with him in the Coach, and the Depositions of his Graces Servants, whose Examinations were taken upon Oath before the Privy-Council, in whose Registers they may be seen. And as for the savage manner in which they did wound him, I shall here set down, for the proof thereof, the Certificate of a Doctor of Physick, and three Chirurgeons, who by order from the Privy-Council did view, and embalm his Body.</p>

Next we found many Wounds upon the Posterior part of his Head, insomuch that the whole Occipital bone was shattered all in pieces, and a part of the Brain lost thereby upon the place, which certainly being so great, could not but occasion his present Death. There were only two Wounds to be seen upon the Body, the first two or three Inches below the right Clavicle, betwixt the second and third Rib, which was given by a Shot not reaching the capacity of the Breast. The next was a small Wound upon the Region of the Kidneys, given by a small Sword. Likewise we found three Wounds upon his left hand, which might have proved mortal, though he had escaped the former. Also another upon the right hand as dangerous as the former: as Witness our Hands, at <hi>St. Andrews</hi> the Fifth day of <hi>May</hi> 1679.</p>

                  <p>I desire the Reader here to observe, That the <hi>Archbishops</hi> Body was pierced by a Shot, betwixt the second and third Rib, which the Author of the <hi>False Narrative</hi> did industriously deny; and for the truth of his Assertion, impudently appealed to <hi>William Borthwick,</hi> one of the three Chirurgeons, who subscribed the Certificate above written.

By which also not only the Principles of Humane Society, but our Authority and Government (the Archbishop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> being one of Our Privy-Council) is highly violated, and Example and Incouragement given for Murthering all such as serve Us faithfully according to the Prescript of Our Laws and Royal Commands: Daily Instances whereof We are to expect whilst Field-Conventicles, those Rendezvouses of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and Forgers of all Bloody and Jesuitical Principles, are so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and followed, to the scandal of all Government and the Contempt of Our Laws; and which Murther is, as far as is possible, rendered yet more detestable by the unmasked Boldness of such as durst openly with bare Faces in the midst of Our Kingdom, at Mid-day assemble themselves together, to Kill in Our High-Way the Primate of Our Kingdom, and one of Our Privy-Council, by so many Stroakes and Shots, as left his Body as it were but one Wound, and many of which being given after they knew he was Dead, were remarkable Proofs they were acted by a Spirit of Hellish and Insatiable Cruelty:</p>
                              <p>Have therefore, with Advice of Our Privy-Council, thought fit hereby to Command and Charge all Sheriffs, Stewards, Bayliffs of Regalities and Bayliaries, and their Deputies, Magistrates of Burghs, and Officers of

Our Standing Forces, to Search, Seek, Take, and Apprehend the Persons Guilty of the said Horrid Murder, or any saspected by them, until they be brought to Justice; and all Our good and faithful Subjects to concur in the Taking and Securing (as far as is in their power) those Assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates. And in respect there is a Company of vagrant and skulking Ruffians, who, to the great Contempt of all Government, do Ride through this Our Kingdom, Killing Our Soldiers, Deforcing such as put Our Laws in Execution, and Committing such Horrible Murders, who might be easily Discovered, if all such, amongst whom they Converse, did, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Duty, endeavour to Apprehend them, or give Notice of their Residence: We have therefore thought fit, Conform to the 144 Act of Parliament 12, King <hi>James</hi> 6. to Command and Charge all Our Subjects, that whenever any unknown Men or Vagabonds happen to repair amongst them, That they with all possible speed Certifie any of Our Privy-Council, Officers of Our Forces, or any having Trust under Us, thereof; With Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to them, That if they omit the same, they shall be punished with all Rigor, Conform to the said Act. And since several of the said Assassinates are known to have been Tenants in the Shire of <hi>Fisse,</hi> whose Faces will be known to such of the Witnesses as were present; We hereby Require and Command all the Heritors and Masters of the said Shire of <hi>Fisse</hi> and <hi>Kinrosse,</hi> to bring their Tenants, Cottars and Servants, living in the respective Presbyteries, upon the several days, and to the places fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>St. Andrews, &amp;c.</hi> There to be seen by the said Witnesses, and to continue there until they be Examined; With Certification to such of the said Tenants, Cottars and Servants as shall be absent, they shall be reputed as accessory to the said Crime; And the Masters, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them not, or if hereafter they harbour any that shall not Compeer, they shall be reputed as Favourers of the said Assassination. And whereas there are several Persons under Caption and Intercommuning in the said Shire for several Causes, and lest Persons, who are innocent, may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by debarred from appearing, We have thought fit hereby to sist and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede all Execution upon any Letters of Caption or Intercommuning, or any other Warrant, for securing of Persons for the space of Forty eight hours, after the said Diets of appearance. And to the end the said cruel Murther may be the more easily discovered, We do hereby offer and give full assurance of Our Indempnity to any one of the said Assassinates, who shall discover his Complices, and such as hounded them out, and present pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Sum of Ten Thousand Merks to any who shall inform who were the said Assassinates, if upon his Information they, or any of them can be Apprehended, that they may be brought to condign Punishment.

                  <p>But though this Proclamation Printed at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by Authority, and Reprinted at <hi>London,</hi> was sufficient to convince the World of what Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Sect the <hi>Lord Primates</hi> Murtherers were, yet the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and Favourers of the <hi>Scottish-Presbyterians</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> had the Confidence to give this <hi>Publick Act</hi> the Lye, and say, (as indeed they dare take the Confidence to say any thing) That it was drawn up at <hi>Whitehall</hi> by the <hi>Duke of Lauderdale,</hi> and sent by him to the Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who will Publish any thing which he shall order, and in any Form which he shall prescribe.</p>
                  <p>After the issuing out of this Proclamation, the Privy-Council were very diligent in Examining the Inhabitants of <hi>Magus,</hi> and many others upon Oath, whose Depositions are extant in the Registers of the Privy-Council; and very many were Examined also in the <hi>Sheriff-Court</hi> of <hi>Fiffe,</hi> according to the tenure of this Proclamation, and their Examinations are kept in the Records of that Court: From whence it was made apparent, that the Bloody Assassins, and many others who were strongly presumed to have been Abetters, and Contrivers of the Murder, were notorious <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> Frequenters of Field-Conventicles, and Followers of Mr. <hi>Welsh</hi> and other Traiterous, Intercommuned, and Rebellious Preachers. <hi>Nine</hi> of the Actors in this Tragedy were discovered by their Names and Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, which, as it is fitting to set forth the horror of such a Murder, I shall here set down in Letters of Blood.</p>
                  <p>John Balfour of <hi>Kinloch,</hi> David Hackston of <hi>Rathillet</hi> George Balfour<note place="margin">The Names of the Murderers.</note> in <hi>Gilston,</hi> James Russel in <hi>Kings-kettle,</hi> Robert Dingwall a Farmers Son in <hi>Caddam,</hi> Andrew Guillan Weaver in <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> Alexander Henderson and Andrew Henderson, Sons to <hi>John Henderson</hi> in <hi>Kilbrachmont,</hi> George Fleming, Son to <hi>George Fleming</hi> in <hi>Balbuthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Depositions of the Witnesses, who upon Oath proved these Persons to have been Actors in the Archbishops Murder, ly upon Record as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, to satisfie any, who perhaps may doubt of the truth of what is here said; more particularly it was deposed by one <hi>James Anderson</hi> Farmer, at a Farm called <hi>Teuchits,</hi> That <hi>George Balfour</hi> abovementioned, came after the Murder to his Brothers House at <hi>Gilston,</hi> and told him it was done, and that the rest (<hi>of the Murderers</hi>) waited for him on <hi>Taces-Moor;</hi> and that he having returned to them, they went all Nine, and possessed themselves of the Barn at <hi>Teuchits</hi> about Three in the Afternoon, from whence they parted about Seven, when all of them spoke with the said <hi>James Anderson,</hi> who knew them all particularly, and named them, as they are above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the Discovery was made, when the late Rebellion broke out on the Twenty ninth of <hi>May,</hi> which forced the <hi>Privy-Council</hi> to desist from their vigorous pursuit of the Murderers, and apply themselves to the Suppression of that Insurrection, which carried with it the fate of the three Kingdoms, and would have certainly very much shaken the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Rebels had got the first Victory, or could but have maintained their ground. But they were no sooner Beaten, and the Kingdom Resetled, but the Privy-Council resumed their care in pursuing the Discovered Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the <hi>Lord Primate,</hi> (who also had all taken Arms in the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion) and issued out this following Proclamation the Twentieth of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> following, for the Apprehension of them.</p>

                                 <hi>CHARLES,</hi> by the Grace of GOD King of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the Faith; To Our Lovits Heraulds, Macers, Pursevants, or Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting: We taking to Our Consideration how much the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the Honour of this Our Ancient Kingdom are stained by that Barbarous and Horrid Assassination and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the late Archbishop of <hi>St. Andrews;</hi> whereof We have by several Proclamations expressed Our Abhorrency, and prohibited the reset of these Murtherers whom We have excepted from Our late Gracious Pardon and Indemnity: And albeit it was the Duty (not only of those in Authority under Us) but of all Our Subjects, to use their endeavours for discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bringing to Justice these execrable Persons, Enemies to all Humane Society; yet We understand, that these Murtherers, and likewise divers Heritors and Ministers who were engaged in the late Rebellion, and are excepted from Our Indemnity, have been harboured and reset in some places of this Kingdom, to the great Reproach of the Nation, and Contempt of Our Authority and Laws: Therefore, We with advice of Our Privy-Council, do Command and Charge all Sheriffs, Stewarts, Bayliffs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities, and Baylieries, and their Deputes, Magistrates of Burghs, and others in Authority under Us, to Search for, Seek, Take, and Apprehend the Persons afternamed, <hi>viz. John Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock, David Haxstoun</hi> of <hi>Rathillet, George Balfour</hi> in <hi>Gilstoun, James Russel</hi> in <hi>Kettle, Robert Dingwal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And We expect, That the Sheriffs and other Magistrates aforesaid, will use exact diligence in the Premises, as they will be answerable on their highest Peril. And seeing by the Fifth <hi>Act</hi> of the second <hi>Session,</hi> and the second <hi>Act</hi> of the third <hi>Session</hi> of Our first Parliament, The Magistrates and Councils of Burghs are Ordained

at and before their Admissions to the exercise of their Offices, to Sign the Declaration appointed to be Signed by all Persons in Publick Trust, under the Certifications therein exprest. Therefore, We with Advice aforesaid, do Command and Require the Magistrates and Councils of the respective Burghs of this Kingdom, who shall be chosen at the next ensuing Elections, to Sign the foresaid Declaration, as is prescribed in the said Acts, and to return the Declarations so Signed by them to the Clerks of Our Privy-Council, betwixt and the third <hi>Thursday</hi> of <hi>November</hi> next; certifying such as shall not give Obedience, that they shall be proceeded against, and censured conform to the said Acts of Parliament.

                  <p>But by this time the Murderers, and Rebels had fled the Kingdom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all imaginable care and diligence to prevent their Escape; and while the <hi>Covenanting-Army,</hi> as the Rebels Styled themselves, lay at <hi>Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> one of the <hi>Balfours,</hi> as a very creditable Gentleman, who was then in the Town, told me, openly boasted of the Murder as a glorious Fact, and said, holding up his Arm, <hi>This hand helped to kill the Fox.</hi> And it hath been already Published to the World, That five of their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, Complotters, and Abetters of the Murder, chose to Dye, and be hung up in Chains upon the place, rather than confess the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Action, by acknowledging it was <hi>Murder,</hi> or a <hi>Sin.</hi> The Fanatical Party foretold it in several places; and the Morning before it was committed, one of the Assassins, <hi>like a Jesuit Consecrated to an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Act,</hi> after a solemn Sacrilegious Form of Devotion, held up his hand, and Swore, <hi>That that hand should kill the Arch-Prelate,</hi> upon which the holy Sister, his Hostess, kissed him; and it is notoriously known in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he, who commanded the Foot for Mr. <hi>Welsh</hi> upon <hi>Reupar-Law,</hi> (that famous Field-Conventicle) owned that their Friends thanked God for the Archbishops <hi>Death,</hi> which neither they, nor their Abbettors in either Kingdom will call <hi>Murder,</hi> when they have occasion to speak thereof.</p>
                  <p>Having absolved my first part, I proceed to shew out of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writings, the Principles, upon which they ground this bloody Practice of Assassination; in performing of which, I must go up as high as the Murder of Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> Archbishop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> who was Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin'd
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:66036:40"/>
by private Gentlemen, as the late Lord Primate was, only with this difference, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was Murdered in his own Palace, the Castle of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and the Primate in the open Field. The names of his Murderers were Norma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Lesly, John Lesly, Peter Carmichael, and James Melvil, who with Sixteen or Seventeen more seized the Castle, and when they had entered the Cardinals Chamber, <hi>Lesly</hi> and <hi>Carmichael</hi> fell violently upon him, but <hi>James Melvil</hi> with-held them, and said, <hi>This Work and Judgment of God, although it be secret, ought to be done with great gravity.</hi> And upon these words, presenting unto him the point of his Sword, said, <hi>Repent thee of thy former wicked life, but especially of the shedding of the blood of that notable Instrument of God,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">The first Martyr of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> Mr. James Wiseheart, <hi>which albeit the flame of Fire consumed before men, yet cries it Vengeance against thee, and we from God are sent to revenge it: for here before my God I protest, That neither the hatred of thy Person, nor love of thy Riches, nor the fear of any trouble thou couldest have done to me in particular, moved, or moveth me to Strike thee, but only because thou hast been, and remainest an obstinate Enemy against Christ Jesus, and his holy Gospel.</hi> And the meek Man of God (as <hi>Knox</hi> calls him) having so spoken, Struck the Cardinal twice or thrice with a Stog-Sword, although he cried out pitifully for mercy, saying, <hi>I am a Priest, you will not Slay a Priest;</hi> and though he exhorted him to Repentance, yet he allowed him no more time for it than was spent in his Grave and Godly Harangue. I have taken this Relation out of <hi>Knoxes</hi> History, to which I refer the Reader, <hi>Pages</hi> 143, 144, 145. or to the <hi>28th. page</hi> of <hi>Presbytery Displayed,</hi> where it is also related in this manner: And from the whole it is apparent, that <hi>Melvil</hi> committed this Murder, <hi>Gravely, Deliberately, and in Cold Blood,</hi> declaring, That he was sent from God to do it, not for any private end, but to revenge the blood of Mr. <hi>Wiseheart,</hi> and because he was an Enemy to Jesus Christ and his Gospel. <hi>Knox</hi> commends this direful Action of Mr. <hi>James Melvil,</hi> for a Godly Fact; and so the bloody Field-<hi>Presbyterians</hi> have applauded the Nine Murderers of the late Lord Primate, and will doubtless Canonize them, as they did <hi>Mitchel,</hi> who attempted to Assassin him Eleven Years before.</p>

                     <hi>Goodman, Knoxes</hi> his Companion, whom I cited before, <hi>page</hi> 30. saith, <hi>That all men are bound to see the Laws of God kept, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and resist Idolatry by force: Nor is it sufficient for Subjects, not to obey the wicked Commands of Princes, but they must resist them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Children of God out of the hands of their Enemies, as we would deliver a Sheep that is in danger to be devoured by a Wolf. And if the Magistrate shall refuse to put Mass-mongers and False Preachers</hi> (and now all Bishops and Church-Ministers in their esteem are such) <hi>to Death, the People in seeing it performed, shew that Zeal of God which was commended in</hi> Phineas.</p>

                     <hi>John Knox</hi> in his debate with <hi>Lithington, Hist. of Reformation, pag.</hi> 390. Justifies the killing of Tyrannical Princes, and men in publick places by private persons, from the example of <hi>Phineas,</hi> whom he asserts to have been a private person, and tells us; <hi>He had not only a large Reward for his fact,</hi> Numb. 25. 12, 13. <hi>but an ample approbation for it,</hi> Psal. 106. 31. <hi>So that it was accounted to him for Righteousness,</hi> i. e. <hi>as a Righteous action;</hi> and affirms, <hi>That it is to he imitated by all those, who prefer the the true Honour of the true Worship and Glory of God, to the affection of fleshly and wicked Princes;</hi> nay he says, <hi>That his example approved by God, stands to us instead of a Commandment; for as God in his nature is constant and immutable, so can he not condemn in the ages subsequent, that which he hath approved in his servants before us.</hi>

                     <hi>Naphtali</hi> Justifies the Rebellion at <hi>Pentland-hills</hi> 1666. from the same example of <hi>Phineas,</hi> and Blasphemously ascribes it to the holy Spirit of God, asserting that the Rebels were no more to be condemned as Traytors, than <hi>Phineas</hi> ought to have been for a Murderer, seeing they were led by the same Spirit, and had as good warrant as he. See pag. 21. 22, 23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Doctrine, and both <hi>John Knox,</hi> and the Author of <hi>Naphtali</hi> the maintainers of it, are industriously defended, and vindicated by the Author of <hi>Jus populi vindicatum. cap.</hi> 20. from pag. 409. to pag. 426.

And though he failed in his Attempt, as the Rebels before him had done in theirs, (which never any person or persons did, or could do, that were moved by God to do an <hi>Heroical Act;</hi>) yet still he believed that the irresistable Diabolical impulse, which he felt in himself, came from God: exactly according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> who in the Apology for <hi>John Chastel</hi> assert, that an Act is nevertheless <hi>Heroical,</hi> although the undertaker fail in the Attempt.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have we found out the damnable principle upon which the <hi>Jesuited Presbyterians</hi> found their practices of <hi>Massacres,</hi> and <hi>Assassinations.</hi> When the Magistrate will not put to death the enemies of Christ, his Gospel, his People, or of the Kirk, private persons may do it, by the example of <hi>Phineas,</hi> nay, they ought to do it, without hesitation when they feel themselves moved thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But if the Magistrates themselves be such, then any other person not in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may, and ought to rise up to do Justice upon them <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the King not excepted)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66036:41"/>
after the example of <hi>Phineas,</hi> that the Wrath going out may be stayed, and the judgments of God averted from the Land. And notwithstanding this Doctrine (saith the Author of <hi>Jus populi</hi> pag. 412) <hi>All persons have sufficient security of their lives, except such as are guilty of dreadfull Apostacy</hi> (with which they charge all that have renounced the Covenant, or that took it and do not keep it; in particular the King, and the late Lord Primate) <hi>causing the Plague of God to break out upon the Land,</hi> and pag. 414. <hi>To prevent all these fears, let his Majesty, and other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Magistrates Reform their ways, and turn to the Lord, and execute judgment on him</hi> (the Bishop) <hi>and his accomplices, and all the rest who now pretend to honour the King, and to fear God; but in effect do Deifie a Creature, and renounce their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the King of Kings, and so provoke him to destroy both them, and their King by their Apostacy and wicked defection, and that openly before men, and Angels, as</hi> David <hi>hanged up the sons of</hi> Saul <hi>before the Sun, and then they need not fear either Dag, or Dagger, Pistol, or poisoned poinyard, a Spanish-fig, or any such secret applications.</hi> Again pag. 415. he infers, <hi>That the fact of</hi> Phineas <hi>was a laudable act of Justice, and a precedent for Judges, and Magistrates in all times coming, and that by his example any member of the Counsel</hi> (for <hi>Phineas</hi> rose from among the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>might lawfully rise up and execute judgment on this wicked wretch</hi> (the Archbishop) <hi>and his Cursed Fraternity, who have brought by their Apostacy and defection from the Covenant, and cause of God, the wrath, and curse of God upon the Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence all the Kirk-Writers since his Majesties return, such as <hi>Naphtali, Jus populi, The Apology, and Apologetical Narration, The Poor Mans Cup, The History of the Indulgence,</hi> &amp;c. call the Bishops <hi>Apostates, Perjured Prelates,</hi> A <hi>perjured Fraternity, Traytors to Christ, Enemies to his people, Idolaters, Backsliders, &amp;c.</hi> So that whosoever shall like <hi>Phineas</hi> rise up and do Justice upon them, shall do a laudable act, such as shall be accounted unto them for Righteousness, and have the approbation of God. Hence <hi>Mitchel</hi> in his answer to the <hi>Dean of Edingburgh,</hi> saith confidently, that <hi>he refers the Manifestation of his Fact to the day of Gods Righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Rav. Red. pag. 18. and in his shorter Speech pag. 19. he declared, That <hi>he laid down his life willingly in opposition to the perfidious Prelates, and in testimony of the Cause of Christ.</hi> And in his larger Speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declares, that the King and Estates, and every single man is bound to endeavour to extirpate the perjured Prelates, and abjured Prelacy by force of arms; and threatens them all, <hi>with the furbished Sword of the Lords indignation for not executing vengeance upon them;</hi> he saith most Blasphemously, <hi>That blessed are all they who take the proud Prelates and dash their brains against the stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is not the Bishops only, whom they think it laudable to Murder singly, or Massacre in Companies, if they could, but all that own their Authority, as the Church-Ministers, and all that any ways Protect and Support the Church and Clergy; from the King himself upon the Throne, to the meanest Officer Civil or Military, who faithfully executes his Laws and Commands. And yet as bloody as you see these Field-Sectaries are by their Principles, some Discontented Persons of great Quality, whom out of respect I shall not name, had so little Conscience, and sence of Honour, and so much Confidence, as to report, That they were a <hi>Poor, Innocent, and Peaceable sort of People, who only desired to serve</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:66036:41"/>
                     <hi>God according to their own Consciences,</hi> and were neither able, nor inclined to commit such Outrages, and make such Disturbances at their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as was here reported they did. And therefore, for a further illust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their bloody Principles and Practises, I proceed in the last place to shew by what Steps and Gradations of Sedition and Cruelty they arrived at length to Murder the Archbishop, and shortly after Rebel; for this damnable Doctrine of <note n="*" place="margin">The only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against Tyrants is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huds Dagger;</hi> to which, as the Supream Court of Justice, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> brought the <hi>Egyptians; Phineas, Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosby; Ehud, Eglon; Samson,</hi> the <hi>Philistmes; Saul, Agag;</hi> and <hi>Jehojadah, Athalia;</hi> Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan de jure regni.</note> 
                     <hi>Heroical impulse</hi> hath poisoned the whole Sect, and instigated them to many other Inhumane Butcheries and lesser Rebellions, before they imbrued their hands in the Primates sacred Blood.</p>
                  <p>For shortly after, they began to Conventicle in such formidable numbers, and in such an Hostile manner in the Fields, upon the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> going down in <hi>June</hi> 1677. they openly threatned the Archbishops and other Bishops, and such of the Kings Ministers, as they thought were most vigorous in putting the Laws in Execution against them. This gave occasion to the Privy-Council to order the Tryal of Mr. <hi>James Mitchel,</hi> that the rest by his Punishment might be deterred from Practising upon others <hi>Heroical Attempts.</hi> As soon as his Tryal was ordered, the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> threatned more than before; and knowing that Sir <hi>George Mackenzy</hi> his Majesties Advocate, was bound by his Office to Prosecute him, they sent him nameless Letters, to tell him, That if he pursued Mr. <hi>Jamees Mitchel,</hi> it should cost him his Life, which it undoubtedly will, if ever he fall into their hands.</p>
                  <p>While the Miscreants Tryal was depending, (for it lasted four days) there were Letters also sent to the Archbishop, (for attempting of whose Life he was tryed) threatning him, That if Mr. <hi>James</hi> were put to Death, it should certainly cost him his Life, which I believe might be one reason, why his <hi>Grace</hi> afterwards in Council endeavoured to procure his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve.</p>
                  <p>A little after his Execution it was, That to prevent the Rising of the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in the West, the <hi>Highlanders</hi> by the Advice of the Privy-Council, (<hi>as the Marquess of</hi> Athol <hi>had first proposed</hi>) and by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties express Authority, marched under the Conduct of their respective Lords, with the Standing Forces into that Countrey, after the <hi>Heritors</hi> in a meeting had sent word to the Council, That they could not under take for the Peace.

last 1679. a Company of them came upon a very small Party of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Quartered in or near <hi>Maclin</hi> about Midnight, or early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>the Lords day,</hi> and most barbarously Massacred them in their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Assassins when they came to the door knocked as Friends, and kindly asked for the poor Soldiers, as Camrades are wont to ask for one another. And they not thinking of any harm got up, and opened the Door, which was no sooner done, but without speaking one word, they Shot one of them dead through the belly, and wounded the rest so mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, that they left them for dead. Nevertheless, as it is credibly reported, these <hi>Heroical</hi> Butchers went straight away to a <hi>Field-Meeting,</hi> where they <hi>partook of the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper,</hi> if I may call that a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which such utter Usurpers of the Priests-Office Sacrilegiously Administer, and Schismatics, and Rebels take.</p>
                  <p>And about <hi>March</hi> last 1679. Twenty six or Twenty seven of these <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Pseudo-Zealots</hi> having met Armed in a private Lodging, at the further end of a remote Lane in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> sent a Messenger, who was of the Conspiracy, to tell the <hi>Town-Major,</hi> who was always diligent in his Office, and faithful to his Trust That there was a Conventicle in such a place. The Major with three or four men, whom he called to his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, went immediately upon the Information to the foresaid House, where the Inspired Heroes, after many Shots from both ends of the Room into which they had trapand the Major, fell upon the Major in particular, whom having wounded, as they thought beyond all possibility of recovery, they left for dead, and made their escape. One of the Assistants they Shot dead through the Reins, and bruised and wounded the rest. While they beat and wounded the Town-Major, they called him <hi>Enemy to Christ, Instrument of Satan, &amp;c.</hi> and urged him to Swear that he would never disturb their Meetings, or seize any Person at them again, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested withal unto him, That <hi>not any private Quarrel moved them to kill him, but because his Employment was to discover their Meetings, and execute the Tyrannical, and Antichristian Laws against them.</hi> The House wherein this Riot was committed, was kept by an holy Sister, a noted <hi>Fanatick,</hi> who frequently entertained the Rebellious intercommuned Preachers, and such like <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> Cut-throats as these. She is Sister in Law to one <hi>Andrew Turnball</hi> in <hi>Broomhall,</hi> one noted among a Club of Assassins, who combine to Murder his Majesties Officers; and, as many Witnesses exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon Oath before the <hi>Privy-Council May</hi> the Fifth 1677. declared, he and his Son were two of those, who rescued two Fanatical Criminals from a Serjeant, and four Militia Soldiers, in which rebellious action they discharged several Pistols at them, and wounded them with Swords as well as Shot, calling them Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and telling them, that those whom they served were Devils, and deserved to be worse used than they. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Story of the Major: The day of the Week, in which this Massacre was acted, was <hi>Tuesday,</hi> and the <hi>Sunday</hi> before, Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> that famous Field-Preacher, Preached twice in the same House, where were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent most of the Murderers, as, by Examination of several Witnesses before the Privy-Council, it afterwards appeared.</p>
                  <p>I have passed by many other Stories of this nature, as that of the bloody attempt which they made upon the Ensign and Soldiers of the <hi>Bass,</hi> at a Conventicle near <hi>Dumbar</hi> in Summer 1678. whereof some being afterwards Apprehended, were tryed, and one was put to death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:66036:42"/>But they were never moved with stronger impulses to kill any sort of men, than the Leviers and Collecters of the <hi>Cess,</hi> which the Convention had granted for erecting and maintaining the foresaid additional Forces. The Murderers of the Archbishop did also lay in wait for those who ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered this Tax, which they said, <hi>was given to drive Christ out of the Kingdom;</hi> and the Soldiers whose Murder I related above, were some of those, who were commanded out to Convoy the Gatherers of the <hi>Cess.</hi> At the same time, by way of preparation of what was to follow, they made almost daily Musters of their Forces at their Field-Meetings, as at <hi>Lesma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hago,</hi> and <hi>Munkland,</hi> in <hi>Clidsdale, Rubber-Law,</hi> in <hi>Tiveot-dale,</hi> and several parts of <hi>Sterling-shire,</hi> where they refused to dissolve their Meetings, when they were required to do it in the Kings name, and dared his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Forces to their faces, speaking in their hearing reproachfully and disdainfully of the King, the Privy-Council, and the Bishops, which made all considering men forebode the Rebellion at the same time, that some of our Countrey-men at <hi>London</hi> bore the World in hand, that the accounts of these disorders which were sent up from time to time, were all Fictions, or Hyperboles, and that there was no danger of Rebellion at all.</p>
                  <p>While they were in this evil Disposition, and committed these Cruelties, and Disorders, there was published a Libel said to have been spoken in the House of Lords, <hi>March</hi> 25. 1679. it hath been Printed twice already, once in a single sheet, shortly after it was said to have been spoken, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in a <hi>Collection of divers remarkable Proceedings in Parliament,</hi> and because it accidentally had such a mighty influence in stirring up this People to the <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> I think my self bound by my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to give it a third Edition in this place.</p>

                                 <hi>YOU are appointing of the consideration of the State of</hi> England <hi>to be taken up in a Committee of the whole House, some day next Week. I do not know how well what I have to say may be received, for I never study either to make my Court well, or to be Popular; I always speak what I am commanded</hi> by the Dictates of the Spirit within me.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>There are some other Considerations that concern</hi> England <hi>so nearly, that without them you will come far short of Safety and Quiet at home:</hi> We have a little Sister, and she hath no Breasts, what shall we do for our Sister in the day when she shall be spoken for? If she be a Wall, we will build on her a Palace of Silver, if she be a Door, we will inclose her with Boards of Cedar. <hi>We have several little Sisters without Breasts, the</hi> French <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches, the two Kingdoms of</hi> Ireland <hi>and</hi> Scotland; <hi>the Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are a Wall, the only Wall and Defence to</hi> England; <hi>upon it you may build Palaces of Silver, glorious Palaces. The Protection of the Protestants abroad, is the greatest Power and Security the Crown of</hi> England <hi>can attain to, and which can only help us to give check to the growing greatness of</hi> France. Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>are two Doors, either to let in Good or Mischief upon us; they are much weakened by the Artifice of our cunning Enemies, and we ought to inclose them with Boards of Cedar.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="72" facs="tcp:66036:43"/>Popery <hi>and</hi> Slavery, <hi>like two Sisters, go hand in hand, sometimes one goes first, sometimes the other, in a doors, but the other is always following close at hand.</hi>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>In</hi> England, Popery <hi>was to have brought in</hi> Slavery; <hi>in</hi> Scotland, Slavery <hi>went before, and</hi> Popery <hi>was to follow.</hi>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>I do not think your Lordships or the Parliament have Jurisdiction there. It is a Noble and Ancient Kingdom; they have an illustrious Nobility, a gallant Gentry, a learned Clergy, and an Understanding, Worthy People; but yet we cannot think of</hi> England <hi>as we ought, without reflecting on the Condition therein. They are under the same Prince, and the Influence of the same Favourites and Councils; when they are hardly dealt with, can we that are the Richer expect better usuage? for 'tis certain, that in all Absolute Governments, the poorest Countreys are always most favourably dealt with.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>When the Ancient Nobility and Gentry there cannot enjoy their Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their Shrievaldoms, and their Stewardaries, which they and their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors have possessed for several hundreds of years; but that now they are enjoyned by the Lords of the Council to make Deputations of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to such as are their known Enemies.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Can we expect to enjoy our</hi> Magna Charta <hi>long under the same Persons and Administration of Affairs? If the Council Table there can imprison any Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Gentleman for several years, without bringing him to Tryal, or giving the least reason for what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they do; can we expect the same men will preserve the Liberty of the Subject here?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>I will acknowledge, I am not well vers'd in the particular Laws of</hi> Scotland; <hi>but this I do know, that all the</hi> Northern <hi>Countreys have, by their Laws, an undoubted and inviolable Right to their Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet</hi> Scotland <hi>hath out-done all the</hi> Eastern <hi>and</hi> Southern <hi>Countreys, in having their Lives, Liberties and Estates subjected to the Arbitrary Will and Pleasure of those that Govern. They have lately plundered and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassed the richest and wealthiest Countries of that Kingdom, and brought down the barbarous</hi> High-Landers <hi>to devour them; and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out almost a colourable pretence to do it: Nor can there be found a reason of State for what they have done; but that those wicked Ministers designed to procure a Rebellion at any Rate; which as they managed, was only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the miraculous Hand of God, or otherwise all the</hi> Papists <hi>in</hi> England <hi>would have been Armed, and the fairest Opportunity given in the just time for the Execution of that wicked and Bloody Design the</hi> Papists <hi>had; and it is not possible for any man that duely considers it, to think other, but that those Ministers that acted that, were as guilty of the Plot, as any of the Lords that are in question for it.</hi>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords, I am forced to speak this the plainer, because, till the pressure be fully and clearly taken off from</hi> Scotland, <hi>'tis not possible for me, or any</hi> thinking man, <hi>to believe that good is meant us here.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>We must still be upon our guard, apprehending that the Principle is not changed at Court, and that these men that are still in place and Authority, have that Influence upon the mind of our Excellent Prince, that he is not, nor cannot be that to us, that his own Nature and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would incline him to.</hi>

                                 <hi>I know your Lordships can order nothing in this, but there are those that hear me, can put a perfect Cure to it; until that be done, the</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Weed <hi>is like Death in the Pot,</hi> Mors in olla; <hi>But there is something</hi>

                                 <hi>too, now I consider, that most immediately concerns us; their Act of Twenty two thousand Men to be ready to invade us upon all occasions. This, I hear, that the Lords of the Council there have treated, as they do all other Laws, and expounded it into a standing Army of Six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Men. I am sure we have reason and right to beseech the King that that Act may be better considered in the next Parliament there. I shall say no more for</hi> Scotland <hi>at this time, I am afraid your Lordships will think I have said too much, having no concern there; But if a</hi> French <hi>Noble man should come to dwell in my House and Family, I should think it concern'd me to ask what he did in</hi> France: <hi>for if he were there a Felon, a Rogue, a Plunderer, I should desire him to live elsewhere; and I hope your Lordships will do the same thing for the Nation, if you find the same cause.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords, Give me leave to speak two or three words concerning our other Sister</hi> Ireland: <hi>thither, I hear, is sent</hi> Douglas's <hi>Regiment, to secure us against the</hi> French. <hi>Besides, I am credibly informed, that the</hi> Papists <hi>have their Arms restored, and the</hi> Protestants <hi>are not many of them yet recovered from being the suspected Party; the Sea Towns as well as the In-land, are full of</hi> Papists: <hi>that Kingdom cannot long continue in the</hi> English <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is in your Power, and there is nothing there, but is under your Laws; therefore I beg that this Kingdom at least may be taken in consideration, together with the State of</hi> England: <hi>For I am sure there can be no safety here, if these Doors be not shut up and made sure.</hi>

                  <p>By the very next Post after this Speech was said to have been spoken, Forty written Copies of it were sent from <hi>London,</hi> by the Gentlemen of the <hi>Party</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> grew so insolent, and so daring upon it, that several Loyal Gentlemen wrote up Accounts, to what height of Insolences this Speech had blown up the Enemies of the Church, and the Monarchy; and that they had just reasons to fear, that very dangerous attempts, if not a down-right Rebellion, would speedily ensue thereupon. But these reports found not too much Credit at <hi>London,</hi> where the World was made believe by men, (whose Interest it was that they should not be Credited) That they were but the Inventions of <hi>the Duke of Lauderdale,</hi> for whose advantage in that conjuncture it was that they should be believed.</p>
                  <p>But what we would not then believe, we shortly after saw verified; and the event falling out so contrary to the expectation of men, who had been deluded by the <hi>Duke of Lauderdales</hi> ungrateful Enemies, made many of them who had spoken publickly and done much ill against him, declare since, That they were sorry for it, and for the time to come would do so no more. But to return to this pretended Speech, which emboldned the People to such wicked Attempts: I find it very difficult for my self to believe, that the Right Honourable and worthy Person under whose name it was Published, could be the Author of such an Harangue that reflected upon a Peer, whom he once esteemed so much, and owned for the greatest States-Man in the World. Nay one must needs think, that so Wise and generous a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who hath so great an Estate to lose, and who was so true to the Kings Service and Interest, while his Majesty was pleased to Employ him, should speak nothing in that <hi>August</hi> Assembly, which should fire the Disaffected of either Kingdom, and consequently endanger the Government, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us all in a common Confusion again.</p>
                  <p>But if he did speak it to discharge any private Resentments, which might over-rule the generosity of his Nature, yet I am confident he would not have done so, had he known the true state of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which few <hi>Englishmen</hi> do, or foreseen the evil effects, which it immediately had, in

encouraging the Covenanters to Assassinate, Massacre, and Rebel. For now they began to look, and speak big in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and many of them were heard and seen upon <hi>the Crown of the Causway,</hi> who had skulked about in darkness before. And as for the disaffected parts of the Countrey, they now Display'd <hi>the Banners of Jesus Christ</hi> (as they blasphemously called their Colours) at their Conventicles every where; and their Preachers now told them, That <hi>the time of their Deliverance, and of Gods taking Vengeance upon his Enemies, was now at hand,</hi> only <hi>they must repent, and be strong, and of a good Courage, and fight the Battles of the Lord.</hi> They also threatned in all places such as they thought were seriously active against them, talking of great Changes and Revolutions in <hi>England;</hi> and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places dropt Lists of the names of those men, whom they had a mind should fall by <hi>Heroical</hi> hands. Particularly at <hi>Cupar</hi> the Shire-Town in <hi>Fiffe,</hi> there was found in the Streets a threatning Declaration, while the <hi>Sheriff-Depute</hi> was there demanding the legal Fines from those, who had been convicted of frequenting Field-Conventicles, and entertaining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and attainted Traitors, and fugitives, and intercommuned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. The Declaration was thus directed.</p>

                  <p>The Archbishop is mentioned by name in this Declaration, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the way for his Murder; for according to the tenure of it, they very <hi>shortly</hi> after <hi>handled him severely</hi> in the bloody manner which you have read. Mr. <hi>Carmichael</hi> was neither Counselled nor Authorised by him to Levy the Fines, as they most invidiously asserted in their Declaration; but he was in their account an <hi>Apostat,</hi> and therefore was to be represented as the Author of all publick Proceedings against them, that the direful Vengeance of the whole Sect might fall upon his head. They Murdered him, as I have related, on the third of <hi>May</hi> 1679. and on the Twenty ninth following they began the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> because, as their <hi>first Declaration bears,</hi> it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day of Solemn Thanksgiving <hi>for setting up an Usurper to destroy the Interest of Christ, and assume the Power which is proper to him alone.</hi> I would here set down this treasonable and blasphemous Declaration at large, but having some thoughts hereafter to write the History of this Rebellion, I will not prevent my own design.</p>

                  <p>NOw then the <hi>Indulgence</hi> is embraced, and thanks to the givers are rendered by the takers.

                     </gap>d by such a Test? It were fit, sure, to think on this, and lay it to heart; for each receiver may lay his count with it, that soon or syne he shall be put to it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let me ask (though I put it out of doubt, they do, and far be it from me to think otherwise) whether they believe, that Christ, who purchased His Church, <hi>and bought his Crown with His precious Blood,</hi> lives also to make Intercession, and to plead his own Purchase, and Procure, by vertue of the Price He hath payed, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the written Vengeance upon all, <hi>who will strive with him for State and Supremacy in ordering the Affairs of his House, the Church of the living God;</hi> or who will, in their desperate dareing and rage, <hi>revost and exautorat Him by their Law,</hi> (which is a legal and explicit bursting of His Bonds, casting away His Cords from them, and, in contempt of, and Contradiction to the Christ of God, a formal taking of His house in Possession) <hi>as our Rulers have done; to the out-doing, in this affront to Jesus Christ, all that ever went before them; or as if they were resolved never to be out-done by any, who should come after them, in a copeing with the Mediator, and a down-right denial of Him to be King; (for now they have put</hi> Caesar <hi>in his Place</hi>) sure, the Indulged Brethren neither can nor will deny this. Then they must give me leave to assert and subsume (what hath been, as oft upon my Soul, as I thought upon their carriage at that appearance (yea, if they speak consequently to the supposed concession, they must agree with me in it; That with the same objective assurance, I believe the Right that Christ hath bought, <hi>to be Sole and Supream, in regulating all the Affairs of His own House, to have none to share with Him in the Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratorick, Architectonick and Magisterial Power of making Laws, to oblige the Conscience of His Subjects, nor to be in case to give a Ministerial Power besides himself;</hi> And as I believe the firmness of the stipulation betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and his Anointed, to secure unto him his <hi>Throne, and take Vengeance on all His Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries;</hi> and as I belives he lieve to make Intercession; so I must believe also that, at that very instant, when the Indulged stood before the Council, and by their mouth made such a Harangue; The Mediator, who is set down, at the right hand of God, was interceeding and pleading by His Blood, by His Wounds and Passion, <hi>for the Execution of the purchased and promised Vengeance upon such, who by the complex of this very deed, in a defiance to the everlasting Decree, whereby his Throne is Established, declared, they had taken unto themselves His House in Possession.</hi> Ah; <hi>my dear Brethren,</hi> can the thoughts of such a discord and discrepancy betwixt His Intercession in Heaven, and your Harangueing on Earth, enter into your Soul, (and I give you the defiance to enter into the serious thoughts of the matter, and hold them out or be reflected upon, without Terrour, Trembling, Confusion of face, Shame and Astonishment.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>my reverend</hi> and <hi>very dear Brethren,</hi> may I not, upon this occasion, make bold to fall upon you as prostrat, and with the tear in mine Eye, (for I have confidence to say it, I scarce see my Paper, while by my Pen I make this Address unto you,) humbly and earnestly beg of you, request, beseech and obtest you, for your blessed and glorious Masters sake, who is now Crucified again amongst us, <hi>from whose Head the Crown is taken;</hi> for His Churches sake, whereof he hath made you Ministers, and so magnified you amongst men, in sending you into the World, under the Character of his Ambassadors; for your poor broken hearted and bleeding Brethrens sake, as ever you would be amongst the restorers of our breaches; as ever you would again be as some of you were in times past, as the Chariots <hi>and Horsemen of Israel;</hi> as ever you would wish to be brought again to keep <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <head>A Jesuitical Letter sent to the Covenanters in the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who lately Rebelled.</head>
                  <p>I Have been much surprised to hear, that almost all the Suffering Ministers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of late (for formerly I never heard nor dreamed of such a thing) begin to speak in favour of this <hi>Indulgence;</hi> (which to me ever was, and yet is the bane of our Cause, and that which hath given the <hi>bleeding Interest of Christ</hi> in that Suffering Church, a more dreadful stroak than all that Prelacy hath done) some so far as they will not have it mentioned a Sin upon the Land, nor preached against; others so far as they will have none so much as hinting, what iniquity lieth wrapped in hearing and countenancing these <hi>Indulged Persons,</hi> yea, (I say the generality) for any thing I know, are come that length, to be ready to question and censure such as preach against it, or preach upon the ground where any <hi>Indulged Minister</hi> is. Oh where are we now! when it is come to that, and what will be the end of this prodigious fainting and change? are we so in love with the <hi>Supremacy, the like whereof was never heard of in any Christian Church, no not in the Church where Antichrist sits, nor was ever arrogate by any Magistrate, either Heathen, Turk, or Christian,</hi> which is our shame, and should be our sorrow, and will prove such a provocation in the sight of the Lord, that he cannot pardon till Vengeance be executed upon the Land, and Posterity, in a degree pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the unparallelled height of that Abomination and Desolation? are we (I say) so inamored with that Image of Jealousie, which provoketh to Jealousie, that we must plead so much for that woful Spirit, come out of that bitter root, after we have seen and felt the lamentable effects of it? wo is me, if this be all our Zeal for God, and his Christ this day, when his <hi>Prerogatives are incroached upon by men</hi> who have sold themselves to destroy (so far as they can) all the <hi>Interest of Jesus Christ,</hi> and to banish <hi>himself, his Kingdom, and all his Concerns out of the Land.</hi> Who I pray among these <hi>Indulged Men,</hi> (I say) as such (for otherways I honour such as are known to me, and shall entertain charitable thoughts of others) can be called the Ambassadors of Christ? who depend as to the <hi>actual exercise of the Ministerial Function,</hi> or such who never were immediately intrusted (even as to kind) with Church-power, receiving <hi>Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Limitations,</hi> and Authority, not Interpretatively, but expressly, and <hi>In terminis</hi> from them; and so acting under the Magistrate in a Subordination, as directly and formally as an Inferior Civil-Court, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates do, for any thing I can observe. And who dare say that this is consonant to our received, and <hi>avowed Reformation?</hi> How may, can, or dare any be silent, and not lift up their voice like a Trumpet, not only to exoner their own Consciences, and bear full witness against this Sin, when now by reason this universal condemnation of all publick appearance against the <hi>Indulgence, as becoming in a more plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable manner the Sin of the Suffering Church,</hi> whereas before it seemed to me to be only the Sin of the fainting People, who had contrary to their Oath and Vow departed from the Suffering Brethren, to the weakning the hands of the <hi>Suffering Remnant,</hi> and strengthening the oppressing Adversaries; but also, so far as in them lieth, are for the Peoples altogether lying by and compliance with this Evil, to the <hi>further provoking the Lord against the whole Land.</hi> Is it reasonable for us now in the day of the Lords contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be thus tender of a few men, (how worthy soever otherways) and untender of the <hi>grand Concerns of the Lord our Master?</hi> I'ts strange to me, that any should plead for it directly, or indirectly, and it were directly designed to countermind the Lords <hi>wonderful appearance in and by these Assemblies of the Lords People,</hi> now named Conventicles, and <hi>blasphemously,</hi>
