            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THO some of these <hi>Speeches</hi> were Printed some Years since, and generally received by all sorts of People with great Concern; but being in loose Sheets, they are not so well preserved, therefore I have thought fit to Collect them together, that so they may be often Reviewed, and that the Present and Future may with Abhorrency behold the Iniquity of the late Violent Times, when so many Excellent Persons were destroyed by <hi>Forms and Subtilties of Law;</hi> and <hi>Scribere est agere</hi> was brought in for an Evidence (as in the Case of Col. <hi>Sydney</hi>) when no other could be found.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Business of the <hi>Ry-House Plot</hi> has been received by some as an Article of Faith, and a smooth History of it has been imposed on the Nation, therefore I thought good to add Colonel <hi>Rumbald</hi>'s Speech to undeceive the World, by which it is evident (if we may believe the Dying words of a good Man) that was a meer Sham-Contrivance, to bring an Odium on <hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been always the Practice of the <hi>Papists</hi> to make <hi>Sham-Plots,</hi> to render <hi>Protestants</hi> odious, and to hide
<pb facs="tcp:49148:3"/>
the foulness of their own Real Plots, of which this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has had sufficient Experience; especially in their late Damnable Plot. For when it was clearly proved on them, that they Conspired against the Life of the late King, and our Government, they presently Contrived to cast that Wickedness on <hi>Protestants;</hi> and too many of our easie <hi>Church-men</hi> were impos'd on to believeit. But through the Goodness of God, and the Auspicious Arrival of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the Eyes of the Nation are opened, and now we hope we have an Opportunity to be Delivered (if our Sins prevent not) from the Plots and Tyranny of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> Which God in his Infinite Mercy grant.</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Colledge,</hi> it is desired for the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, because you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest your self a Protestant, that you would tell what Judgment you are of.</p>

                  <p>Dear People, dear Protestants, and dear Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I have been accused and convicted for Treason; the Laws adjudg me to this Death, and I come hither willingly to submit to it: I pray God forgive all those Persons that had any hand in it. I do declare to you, whatever hath been said of me, I was never a Papist, or ever that way inclinꝰd; they have done me wrong, I was ever a Protestant, I was born a Protestant, I have lived so, and so by the Grace of God I will die, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the best Reformation of the Church from all Idolatry, from all Superstition, or any thing that is contrary to the Gospel of our Blessed Lord and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>I do declare I was never in any Popish Service, Prayers or Devotions in my Life, save one time about some 17 or 18 Years ago, as near as I remember, I was, out of a Curiosity, one Afternoon at St. <hi>James</hi>'s Chappel, the Queen's Chappel at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; except that one time I never did hear any Popish Service, any thing of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Mass or Prayers, or any thing else private or publick. I know you expect that I should say something as to what I die for: It
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49148:4"/>
hath been charged upon me, when I was apprehended &amp; brought before the Council, some of the Council, the Secretary, and my Lord <hi>Killingworth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> they told me there was Treason sworn against me: truly, they surprized me when they said so. For of all things in the World, I thought my self as free from that as any Man. I asked them, if any Man living had the confidence to swear Treason against me? They said several, three or four, as I remember: Then they told me, It was sworn against me, That I had a Design to pull the King out of <hi>White-hall,</hi> and to serve him as his Father was served, or to that purpose, the Logger-head his Father, or that kind of Language: I did deny it then, and do now deny it upon my Death. I never was in any manner of Plot in my days, neither one way nor another, never knew any such Persons, nor ever had such Communication with any Man hitherto: I know of no Plot in the World but the Popish Plot, and that every Man may know as much as I: if I had had such a Design, as these Men have sworn against me, to have seized his Majesty, either at <hi>London,</hi> or this place at <hi>Oxford,</hi> I take God to Witness, as I am a dying Man, and upon the Terms of my Salvation, I know not any one Man upon the Face of the Earth that would have stood by me; and how likely it was that I should do such a thing my self, let the whole World judg.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dugdale</hi> swears, That I spoke Treason to him, Treasonable words in the Coffee-house, and in the Barbers-shop by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; He</hi> could not pretend to see me any where else; but it is false, and a very unlikely thing that I should speak Treason to him. I must confess I was in his company at the Coffee-house, and that Barbers-shop before I went out of Town: but there could be no communication between us, for he was writing at one end of the Room, and eating a piece of Bread, and I lighted a Pipe of Tobacco at the other end and took it, till Sir <hi>Tho. Player</hi> and Sir <hi>Rob. Clayton</hi> came to me, and we went to my Lord <hi>Lovelace</hi>'s out of Town that night: So when they came, we took Horse, and went out of Town with the rest: For my part, I can't sum up my Witnesses, I was under most strange Circumstances as ever any Man was; I was kept Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner so close in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that I could have no conversation with any, though I was certain the Popish Lords had it every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49148:4"/>
day there, but I could have none: I could not tell the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that were to swear against me: I could not tell what it was they swore against me, for I could have no Copy of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, nor no way possible to make any preparation to make my defence, as I ought to have done, and might have done by Law.</p>
                  <p>I had no liberty to do any thing, as I am as dying Man. And as to what <hi>Dugdale, Smith, Turbervill</hi> and <hi>Heins</hi> swore against me, they did swear such Treason, that nothing but a mad Man would ever have trusted any Body with: and least of all to Papists, every one of them that had been concerned with Plots and Treasons among their own Party: and under the greatest Ties and Obligations of Damnation; and to be Sainted if they kept it secret, and to be damned if they did reveal it. If these Men will not keep Things private for their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how could I trust them? I take God to Witness, and do freely acknowledg, I have sought my God with Tears several times to inform me, if so be I had with any Word transgrest at any time. I knew not of any part of what they swore against me, till such time as I heard it sworn against me at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>This is very hard, Gentlemen, but this is the Truth: and there be a great many other strange Reports that I have heard since I have been a Prisoner: That I should be a means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Countess of <hi>Rochester,</hi> by bringing one <hi>Thompson</hi> a Priest to her. Truly all that I was concerned in, was some 15 or 16 Years ago. I lodged at Colonel <hi>Vernon</hi>'s, that married the Lady <hi>Brooks,</hi> the Family were Papists: The <hi>Brookses</hi> were Papists, and there was this <hi>Thomson,</hi> and I did suppose him a Priest, in the House, though I never saw him at Popish Service or Worship, though I was there half a Year; but coming afterwards to My Lord <hi>Rochester's</hi> about some Business, I had to do for him, and several other Persons of Quality; he sent for me one Afternoon from the Parsonage in <hi>Adderbury</hi> to his House, and his Lady and he stood together: He sent to me, and asked me, if my Horse were at Home, said he, I would have you carry this Letter to Mr. <hi>Thompson,</hi> if you are at les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure this Afternoon: My Lord, I am at leisure to serve you; so I took a Letter from his Hand, and his Ladies too, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (he made an offer that way) sealed with his own Seal,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49148:5"/>
and I carried it to <hi>Thompson,</hi> and delivered it to him: and he old me, that he would wait upon my Lord, for it was for some Lands my Lord did offer to raise Mony for some Occasion: this is the Truth of that Scandal.</p>
                  <p>It is said, that I had a Priest several Years in my House, <hi>viz. Sergeant,</hi> that came over from <hi>Holland</hi> to discover. About some Ten years ago, that very same Man came to me, but was a stranger to me, and he came to me by the Name of Doctor <hi>Smith</hi> a Physician: and there was an Apothecary in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and a Linnen-Draper within <hi>Ludgate,</hi> that came with him, they brought him thither, and took a Chamber, and lay about half a Year, or three quarters at times, by the Name of Doctor <hi>Smith,</hi> and as a Physician: this is the Truth of that, and no otherwise. This is the entertainment of <hi>Sergeant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the occasion of my coming to <hi>Oxford</hi> I do say was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, the Parliament-Men, last Parliament at <hi>Westminester,</hi> and several Lords, dined together the day before they sat; the last Sessions of Parliament at <hi>Westminister</hi> they sent for me to the <hi>Sun</hi> Tavern behind the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and when I came, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and several Lords were together, and I believe above 100 Parliament-Men of the Commons: The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> called me to him, and told me, he had heard a good Report of me, and that I was an honest Man and one that may be trusted; and they did not know but their Enemies, the Papists, might have some Design to serve them as they did in King <hi>Jame</hi>'s time by Gun-powder, or any other way: And the Duke, with several Lords and Commons, did desire me to use my utmost skill in searching all places suspected by them, which I did perform: and from thence I had, as I think, the Popular name of <hi>the Protestant Joiner,</hi> because they had intrusted me before any Man in <hi>England</hi> to do that Office.</p>
                  <p>This same <hi>Heines,</hi> one of them that Swore against me, had discovered to me, and several others, as to <hi>Macknamarra</hi> and his brother, and this <hi>Ivey,</hi> who are now all of another stamp, that the Parliament was to be destroyed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and that there was a design to murder my L. <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> by <hi>Fitzgerald</hi> and his Party; and that they did endeavour to bring <hi>Macknamarra</hi> over to him, and said, then it would be well with him: and they would not be long before they had <hi>Shaftsbury's</hi> Life: and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49148:5"/>
he made Depositions of this to Sir <hi>George Treby,</hi> as I heard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, for I was not with him when it was Sworn. I wish the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> as well as I wish my own Heart; and I did not understand, but when I served the Parliament, I served his Majesty too, and let them be miserable that make the difference between them, for my part I never did. I came to <hi>Oxford</hi> with my Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> whom I look upon to be a very honest worthy Gentlemen, my L. <hi>Clare,</hi> my L. <hi>Paget,</hi> and my L. <hi>Huntington,</hi> and this Captain <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> were in my Company, and came along with us, as they were my Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Friends; <hi>Brown</hi> I have known I believe two or three Months; but <hi>Lewis</hi> I never saw before that day: They said, they came with my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi> I take God to Witness, I never had one 6 <hi>d.</hi> or any thing else, to carry on any Design; and if it were to save my Life now, I cannot charge any Man in the World with any Design against the Government, as God is my Witness, or against his Majesty, or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>As for what Arms I had, and what Arms others had, they were for our own Defence, in case the Papists should make any attempt upon us by way of Massacre, or any Invasion or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, that we should be ready to defend our selves; God is my Witness, this is all I know. If this be a Plot, this I was in, but in no other, but never knew of any Numbers or Times appointed for meeting: but we have said, one to another, that the Papists had a Design against the Protestants, when we did meet, as I was a Man of general Conversation; and in case they should rise, we were ready, but then they should begin the Attempt upon us: This was my Business, and is the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of every good Subject that loves the Laws of his Country and his King. For <hi>England</hi> can never hope to be happy under those Blood-thirsty Men, whose Religion is Blood and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which I do, with all my Soul, and did, ever since I knew what Religion was, abhor and detest, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as pernicious and destructive to humane Societies, and all Government.</p>
                  <p>I beseech God that every Man of you may unite together as Protestants against this common Foe. Gentlemen, it is my sense, and I do in that believe, I am as certainly murdered by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49148:6"/>
the Hands of the Papists, as Sir <hi>Edm. Bury Godfrey</hi> himself was, though the Thing is not seen. These Witnesses certainly are mercenary Men, and I beseech God Almighty to have Mercy upon their Souls, and forgive them; and either by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Mercies reclaim them, that they shed no more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood: There is not a Man of them that I know of, that ever heard me say or do any bit of Treason in my Life. This is (the first I may not say it is) but almost the Twentieth Sham-Plot that they have endeavoured to put upon the Nation, to delude the People, and put off their own Damnable Plot. This is not the first, but I think the sixteenth or seventeenth; I pray God that my Blood may be the last. I pray God defend every Man's Blood, and all Protestants in <hi>England,</hi> from the Hands of these bloody Papists, by whose means I die this Death: And if they shall go on in this Nature, I hope the Good God will open every Man's Eyes to see it before he feels it. And, I beseech you, if you have any love for your King, your Country, and the Protestants, unite together if you are Protestants. I pray God those that deserve the Name, let them be called how they will, either Dissenters or Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, that they may unite together like Men, like Christians, against the Common Foe, who will spare neither the one side nor the other, but beat you one against another like two Pitchers; the last that stands, they will certainly destroy if they can. This is my Sense, and God is my Witness, I speak my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; I do not know, Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> whether there be any thing else I have to say, or no; we have a good God, and I beseech every Man that hears me this day, (for we live in a sinful Age, good People, and it behoves every one of you, it cannot be long before all that look upon me in this Condition must lie down in the Dust, and, God knows, must come into an Eternal State, either for Mercy or for Judgment). I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, in the Name of God, he is a God of Mercy, and a God of Patience and Long-suffering, that you would break off your Sins by Repentance, and serve a good God, who must be your Friend at last, or else you are lost to Eternity.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, how ungrateful Wretches are we, that have a God of such infinite Mercy and Goodness, that affords us our Life, our Health, and a thousand Mercies every day; and we, like
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49148:6"/>
ungrateful People, not deserving the Name of Men or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, live riotous Lives, in Debauchery and Swearing, in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and the Lord knows how many Evils. I beseech God that I may be this day a Means in the Hand of God, to bring some of their Souls over to him: I beseech you remember what I say; indeed I do not know, I have been so strangely used since I have been a Prisoner, what to say, being brought from one Affliction to another, that my Body is worn out, and my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and Intellects have failed me much to what they were. I cannot remember what I have to say more, but that the Lord Jesus Christ would bless my Country, and preserve it from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and in mercy bless his Majesty: Good God be merciful to him, make him an Instrument in thy Hand to defend his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects; Lord in mercy defend him from his Enemies. Good God bless this People; good Lord continue the Gospel of Jesus Christ, thy Gospel in its purity to us and our Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as long as the Sun and Moon endure. O Lord save all that call upon thee; be merciful to all thy Servants, all thy People that put their trust in thee; good Lord deliver them from the Hand of their Enemies; good God, let their Lives, and Bodies, and Souls, be all precious in thy sight. O merci-God, put a stop to these most wicked Conspiracies of thy Enemies, and the Nation's Enemies, the Papists. Let no more Protestant Blood be shed but this of mine, I beseech thee, O my God. O Lord look upon me, O Lord bless me, O good God receive me into thy blessed Presence, by Jesus Christ my alone Saviour and Redeemer, in whom alone I put my trust for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: It is thee, O God, that I trust in, thou Righteous Judg of Heaven and Earth: All Popery, all Pardons, all Popes and Priests, all Dispensations I disown, and will not go out of the World with a Lie in my Mouth. From the sincerity of my Heart I declare again, that what I have said to you is the very Sentiments of my Soul, as God shall have Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon me, and to the best of my knowledg.</p>
                  <p>I desire the Prayers of you, good People, while I am here; and once more I beseech you to think upon Eternity, every one of you that hear me this day. The Lord turn your Hearts and Souls, if you have been wicked Livers; if you do live wicked Lives, the Lord in Mercy convert you, and shew you
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49148:7"/>
your Danger; for I as little thought to come to this as any Man that hears me this day; and, I bless God, I have no more deserved it from the Hands of Men, than the Child that sucks at his Mothers Breast: I bless my God for it, and do say, I have been a Sinner against my God, and he hath learn'd me Grace ever since I have been a Prisoner. I bless my God for a Prison, I bless my God for Afflictions, I bless my God that ever I was restrained, for I never knew my self till he had taken me out of the World. Therefore you that have your Liberties, and Time, and precious Opportunities, be up and be doing for God and for your Souls, every one of you.</p>

                  <p>Good Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> for your satisfaction: For twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years and above I was under the Presbyterian Ministry till his Majesty's Restauration; then I was conformable to the Church of <hi>England</hi> when that was restored, and so continued till such time as I saw persecution upon the Dissenting People, and very undue things done to their Meeting-places; then I went among them to know what kind of People those were: And I do take God to Witness, since that time I have used their Meetings, <hi>viz.</hi> the Presbyterians, others very seldom, and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I did hear Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> not above three weeks before I was taken. I heard the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as frequently as I heard the Dissenters, and never had any Prejudice, God is my Witness, against either, but always heartily desired that they might unite, and be Lovers and Friends, and had no prejudice against any Man; and truly I am afraid that it is not for the Nation's Good that there should be such Heart-burnings between them: That some of

the Church of <hi>England</hi> will preach that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are worse than the <hi>Papists.</hi> God doth know that what I say, I speak freely from my Heart, I have found many among them truly serving God, and so I have of all the rest that have come into my company; Men without any manner of design but to serve God, serve his Majesty, and keep their Liberties and Properties; Men that I am certain are not of vicious Lives; I found no Dammers, or those kind of People among them, or at least few of them.</p>

               <p>I Expected the Noise would be such, that I could not be very well heard: I was never fond of much Speaking, much less now; Therefore I have set down in this Paper, all that I think fit to leave behind me. God knows how far I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from Designs against the King's Person, or of altering the Government; and I still pray for the preservation of both, and of the Protestant Religion.</p>
               <p>I am told, that Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> has said some things concerning my knowledg of the Plot: I know not whether the Report is true, or not: I hope it is not: For to my knowledg, I never saw him, or spake with him in my whole Life; and in the Words of a dying Man, I profess I know of no Plot, either against the King's Life, or the Government. But I have now done with this World, and am going to a better. I forgive all the World, and I thank God I die in Charity with all Men; and I wish all sincere Protestants may love one another, and not make way for Popery by their Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities.</p>

                  <head>The PAPER deliver'd to the SHERIFFS.</head>
                  <p>I Thank God, I find my self so composed and prepared for Death, and my Thoughts so fixed on another World, that I hope in God, I am now quite weaned from setting my Heart on this. Yet I cannot forbear spending some time now, in setting down in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a fuller Account of my Condition, to be left behind me, than I'll venture to say at the place of Execution, in the Noise and Clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is like to be there. I bless God heartily for those many Blessings, which he in his infinite Mercy has bestowed upon me, through the whole Course of my Life: That I was born of worthy good Parents, and had the Advantages of a Religious Education, which I have often thank'd God very heartily for, and look'd upon as an invaluable Blessing: For even when I minded it least, it still hung about me, and gave me checks, and has now for many Years so influenced and possessed me, that I feel the happy Effects of it in this my Extremity, in which I have been so wonderfully (I thank God) supported, that neither my Imprisonmenr, nor the Fear of Death, have been able to discompose me to any degree; but on the contrary, I have found the Assurances of the Love and Mercy of God, in and through my blessed Redeemer, in whom only I trust; and I do not question, but that I am going to partake of that Fulness of Joy which is in his presence, the hopes whereof does so wonderfully delight me, that I reckon this as the happiest time of my Life, tho others may look upon it as the saddest.</p>
                  <p>I have lived, and now die of the Reformed Religion, a true and sincere Protestant, and in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> tho I could never yet comply with, or rise up to all the heights of many People. I wish with all my Soul, all our unhappy Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were removed, and that all sincere Protestants would so far consider the Danger of Popery, as to lay aside their Heats, and agree against the Common Enemy; and that the Churchmen would be less severe, and the Dissenters less scrupulous: For I think Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness and Persecution are at all times bad, but much more now.</p>
                  <p>For Popery, I look on it as an Idolatrous and Bloody Religion; and therefore thought my self bound, in my Station, to do all I could against it. And by that, I foresaw I should procure such great Enemies to my self, and so powerful Ones, that I have been now for some time expecting the worst. And blessed be God, I fall by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49148:9"/>
the Ax, and not by the Fiery Tryal. Yet, whatever Apprehensions I had of <hi>Popery,</hi> and of my own severe and heavy share I was like to have under it when it should prevail, I never had a Thought of doing any thing against it basely, or inhumanly, but what could well consist with the Christian Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom. And I thank God, I have examin'd all my actings in that Matter, with so great Care, that I can appeal to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who knows my Heart, that I went on Sincerely, without being moved, either by Passion, By-End, or Ill-Design. I have always loved my Country much more than my Life; and never had any Design of changing the Government, which I value, and look upon as one of the best Governments in the World, and would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have been ready to venture my Life for the preserving of it, and would have suffered any Extremity, rather than have consented to any Design to take away the King's Life: Neither ever-had Man the Impudence to propose so base and barbarous a thing to me. And I look upon it as a very unhappy, and uneasy part of my present Condition, That in my Indictment there should be so much as mention of so vile a Fact; tho nothing in the least was said to prove any such Matter; but the contrary, by the Lord <hi>Howard:</hi> Neither does any Body, I am consident, believe the least of it. So that I need not, I think, say more.</p>
                  <p>For the King, I do sincerely pray for Him, and wish well to Him, and to the Nation, That they may be happy in one another; that he may be indeed the Defender of the Faith; That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, and the Peace, and Safety of the Kingdom may be preserved, and flourish under His Government; and that He in His Person may be happy, both here and hereafter.</p>
                  <p>As for the share I had in the Prosecution of the Popish Plot, I take God to witness, That I proceeded in it in the Sincerity of my Heart; being then really convinced (as I am still) that there was a Conspiracy against the King, the Nation, and the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And I likewise profess, That I never knew any thing, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly, of any Practice with the Witnesses; which I look upon as so horrid a thing, that I could never have endured it. For, I thank God, Falshood and Cruelty were never in my Nature, but always the farthest from it imaginable. I did believe, and do still, That Popery is breaking in upon the Nation; and that those who advance it, will stop at nothing, to carry on their Design: I am heartily sorry that so many Protestants give their helping Hand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49148:9"/>
to it. But I hope God will preserve the Protestant Religion, and this Nation: though I am afraid it will fall under very great Tryals, and very sharp Sufferings. And indeed the Impiety and Profaneness that abounds, and appears so scandalously bare-fac'd every-where, gives to just reason to fear the worst things which can befall a People. I pray God prevent it, and give those who have shewn Concern for the Publick Good, and who have appear'd Hearty for the true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the Nation, and the Protestant Religion, Grace to live so, that they may not cast a Reproach on that which they endeavour to advance; which (God knows) has often given me many sad Thoughts. And I hope such of my Friends as may think they are touch'd by this, will not take what I say in ill part, but endeavour to amend their ways, and live suitable to the Rules of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion; which is the only thing can administer true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at the latter End, and revive a Man when he comes to Die.</p>
                  <p>As for my present Condition, I bless God I have no repining in my heart at it. I know for my Sins I have deserved much worse at the Hands of God; So that I chearfully submit to so small a Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the being taken off a few Years sooner, and the being made a Spectacle to the World. I do freely forgive all the World, particularly those concerned in taking away my Life; and I desire and conjure my Friends to think of no Revenge, but to submit to the Holy Will of God, into whose Hands I resign my self entirely.</p>
                  <p>But to look back a little, I cannot but give some touch about the Bill of Exclusion, and shew the Reasons of my appearing in that Business; which in short is this: That I thought the Nation was in such danger of Popery, and that the Expectation of a <hi>Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor</hi> (as I have said in Parliament) put the King's Life likewise in such danger, that I saw no way so effectual to secure both, as such a Bill. As to the Limitations which were proposed, if they were sincerely offered, and had pass'd into a Law, the Duke then would have been excluded from the power of a King, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quite altered, and little more than the Name of a King left. So I could not see either Sin or Fault in the one, when all People were willing to admit of the other; but thought it better to have a King with his Prerogative, and the Nation easie and safe under him, than a King without it, which must have bred perpetual Jealousies, and a continual Struggle. All this I say only to justifie my self, and not to enflame others: Though I cannot but think my Earnestness in that Matter has had no small Influence in my present Sufferings.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49148:10"/>
But I have now done with this World, and am going to a Kingdom which cannot be moved.</p>
                  <p>And as to the conspiring to seize the Guards, which is the Crime for which I am condemned, and which was made a constructive Treason for taking away the King's Life, to bring it within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> I shall give this true and clear Account. I never was at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s with that Company but once, and there was no undertaking then of securing, or seizing the Guards; nor none appointed to view or examine them: Some Discourse there was of the Feasibleness of it; and several times by accident, in general Discourse elsewhere, I have heard it mention'd, as a thing might easily be done, but never consented to as fit to be done. And I remember particularly at my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s there being some general Discourse of this kind, I immediately flew out and exclaim'd against it, and ask'd, If the thing succeeded, what must be done next but massacring the Guards, and killing them in cold blood? Which I lookt upon as so detestable a thing, and so like a Popish Practice, that I could not but abhor it. And at the same time the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> took me by the hand, and told me very kindly, My Lord, I see you and I are of a Temper; Did you ever hear so horrid a thing? And I must needs do him that Justice to declare, That I never observed in him but an Abhorrence to all base things.</p>
                  <p>As to my going to Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s, I went with an intent to taste <hi>Sherry;</hi> for he had promised to reserve for me the next very good Piece he met with, when I went out of Town; and if he recollects, he may remember I ask'd him about it, and he went and fetch'd a Bottle; but when I tasted it, I said 'twas hot in the Mouth; and desired that whenever he met with a choice Piece, he would keep it for me: which he promised. I enlarge the more upon this, because Sir <hi>George Gefferies</hi> insinuated to the Jury as if I had made a Story about going thither; but I never said that was the only Reason. And I will now truly and plainly add the rest.</p>
                  <p>I was the day before this Meeting, come to Town, for two or three days, as I had done once or twice before; having a very near and dear Relation lying in a very languishing and desperate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> came to me, and told me, He was extremely glad I was come to Town; for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and son e hot Men would undo us all: How so, my Lord, said I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why (answered he) they'll certainly do some disorderly thing o <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

other, if great Care be not taken, and therefore for God's sake use your Endeavours with your Friends to prevent any thing of this kind. He told me, there would be Company at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s that Night, and desired me to be at home in the Evening, and he would call me; which he did: And when I came into the Room, I saw Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> by the Chimney; though he swears he came in after; and there were things said by some with much more Heat than Judgment, which I did sufficiently disapprove, and yet for these things I stand condemned. But I thank God my part was sincere, and well meant. It is, I know, inferred from hence, and was pressed to me, that I was acquainted with these Heats and ill Designs, and did not discover them. But this is but Misprision of Treason at most. So I die innocent of the Crime I stand condemn'd for, and I hope no body will imagine that so mean a Thought could enter into me, as to go about to save my self, by accusing others. The part that some have acted lately of that kind, has not been such as to invite me to love Life at such a rate.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sentence of Death passed upon me, I cannot but think it a very hard one. For nothing was sworn against me (whether true or false I will not now examine) but some Discourses about making some Stirs. And this is not levying War against the King, which is Treason by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and not the Consulting and Discoursing about it, which was all that was witnessed against me. But, by a a strange Fetch, the Design of Seizing the Guards was construed a Design of Killing the King; and so I was in that cast.</p>
                  <p>And now I have truly and sincerely told what my part was in that, which cannot be more than a bare Misprison; and yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as guilty of a Design of killing the King. I pray God lay not this to the charge, neither of the King's Counsel, nor Judges, nor Sheriffs, nor Jury: And for the Witnesses, I pity them, and with them well. I shall not reckon up the Particulars wherein they did me wrong; I had rather their own Consciences should do that; to which, and the Mercies of God, I leave them. Only I still averr, That what I said of my not hearing Col. <hi>Rumsey</hi> deliver any Message from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> was true; for I always detested Lying, though never so much to my advantage. And I hope none will be so unjust and uncharitable, as to think I would venture on it in these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my last Words, for which I am so soon to give an Account to

                  <p>From the time of chusing Sheriffs, I concluded the Heat in that Matter would produce something of this kind; and I am not much surprized to find it fall upon me. And I wish what is done to me, may put a stop, and satiate some Peoples Revenge, and that no more innocent Blood be shed; for I must, and do still look upon mine as such, since I know I was guilty of no Treason; and therefore I would not betray my Innocence by Flight, of which I do not (I thank God) yet repent, (though much pressed to it) how fatal soever it may have seem'd to have proved to me; for I look upon my Death in this manner (I thank God) with other eyes than the World does. I know I said but little at the Trial, and I suppose it looks more like Innocence than Guilt. I was also advis'd not to confess Matter of Fact plainly, since that must certainly have brought me within the guilt of Misprision. And being thus restrained from dealing franky and openly, I chose rather to say little, than to depart from that Ingenuity, that (by the Grace of God) I had carried along with me in the former part of my Life, and so could easier be silent, and leave the whole Matter to the Conscience of the Jury, than to make the last and solemnest part of my Life so different from the Course of it, as the using little Tricks and Evasions must have been. Nor did I ever pretend to a great readiness in Speaking: I wish those Gentlemen of the Law, who have it, would make more Conscience in the use of it, and not run Men down, and by Strains and Fetches impose on easie and willing Juries, to the ruine of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Men: For to kill by Forms and Subtilties of Law, is the worst sort of Murther. But I wish the Rage of hot Men, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities of Juries, may be stopp'd with my Blood, which I would offer up with so much the more Joy, if I thought I should be the last were to suffer in such a way.</p>
                  <p>Since my Sentence, I have had but few Thoughts, but Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ones for Death: Yet the Importunity of my Friends, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Best and Dearest Wife in the World, prevailed with me to Sign Petitions, and make an Address for my Life: To which I was very averse. For (I thank God) though in all respects I have lived one of the happiest and contented'st Men of the World (for now very near fourteen years) yet I am so willing to leave all, that it was not without Difficulty that I did any thing for the saving of my Life, that was Begging. But I was willing to let my Friends see what Power they had over me, and that I was not Obstinate nor
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49148:11"/>
Sullen, but would do any thing that an honest Man could do, for their Satisfaction. Which was the only Motive that sway'd, or had any weight with me.</p>
                  <p>And now to sum up all: As I never had any Design against the King's Life, or the Life of any Man whatsoever; so I never was in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of altering the Government. What the Heats, Wickedness, Passions and Vanities of other Men have occasioned, I ought not to be answerable for; nor could I repress them, though I now suffer for them. But the Will of the Lord be done; into whose Hands I commend my Spirit; and trust that thou, O most Merciful Father, hast forgiven me all my Transgressions; the Sins of my Youth, and all the Errors of my Life; and that Thou wilt not lay my secret Sins and Ignorances to my Charges but wilt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously support me during that small part of my Time now before me, and assist me in my last Moments, and not leave me then to be disorder'd by Fear, or any other Temptation; but make the Light of thy Countenance to shine upon me, for Thou art my Sun and my Shield: And as Thou supportest me by thy Grace, so I hope thou wilt hereafter Crown me with Glory, and receive me into the Fellowship of Angels and Saints, in that blessed Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance purchased for me by my most merciful Redeemer; who is, I trust, at thy Right-hand, preparing a place for me, and is ready to receive me: into whose Hands I commend my Spirit.</p>

               <head>The very Copy of a Paper delivered to the Sheriffs, upon the Scaffold on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> on <hi>Friday December 7. 1683.</hi> By <hi>Algernon Sidney,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> before his Execution there.</head>
               <list>
                  <item>Men, Brethren, and Fathers; Friends, Countrymen, and Strangers;</item>
               </list>
               <p>IT may be expected that I should now say some Great Matters unto you, but the Rigour of the Season, and the Infirmities of my Age, encreased by a close Imprisonment of above Five Months, doth not permit me.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we live in an Age that maketh Truth pass for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: I dare not say any-thing contrary unto it, and the Ears of those that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it. My Tryal and Condemnation doth sufficiently evidence this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>West, Rumsey,</hi> and <hi>Keyling,</hi> who were brought to prove the Plot, said no more of me, than that they knew me not; and some others equally known unto me, had used my Name, and that of some others, to give a little Reputation unto their Designs. The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> is too infamous by his Life, and the many Perjuries not to be denied, or rather sworn by himself, to deserve mention; and being a single Witness would be of no value, though he had been of unblemished Credit, or had not seen and confessed that the Crimes committed by him would be pardoned only for committing more; and even the Pardon promised could not be obtained till the Drudgery of Swearing was over.</p>
               <p>This being laid aside, the whole Matter is reduced to the Papers said to be found in my Closet by the King's Officers, without any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49148:12"/>
other Proof of their being Written by me, than what is taken from the suppositions upon the similitude of an Hand that is easily Counterfeited, and which hath been lately declared in the Lady <hi>Car's</hi> Case to be no Lawful Evidence in Criminal Causes.</p>
               <p>But if I had been seen to write them, the matter would not be much altered. They plainly appear to relate unto a large Treatise written long since in answer to <hi>Filmer's</hi> Book, which by all Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Men is thought to be grounded upon wicked Principles, equally pernicious unto Magistrates and People.</p>
               <p>If he might publish unto the World his Opinion, That all Men are born under a necessity derived from the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to submit unto an Absolute Kingly Government, which could be restrained by no Law, or Oath; and that he that hath the Power, whether he came unto it by Creation, Election, Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, Usurpation, or any other way had the Right; and none must oppose his Will, but the Persons and Estates of his Subjects must be indispensably subject unto it. I know not why I might not have published my Opinion to the contrary, without the breach of any Law I have yet known.</p>
               <p>I might as freely as he, publickly have declared my Thoughts, and the Reasons upon which they were grounded, and I persuaded to believe, That God had left Nations unto the Liberty of setting up such Governments as best pleased themselves.</p>
               <p>That Magistrates were set up for the good of Nations, not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the honour or glory of Magistrates.</p>
               <p>That the Right and Power of Magistrates in every Country, was that which the Laws of that Country made it to be.</p>
               <p>That those Laws were to be observed, and the Oaths taken by them, having the force of a Contract between Magistrate and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, could not be Violated without danger of dissolving the whole Fabrick.</p>
               <p>That Usurpation could give no Right, and the most dangerous of all Enemies unto Kings were they, who raising their Power to an Exorbitant Height, allowed unto Usurpers all the Rights belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto it.</p>
               <p>That such Usurpations being seldom Compassed without the Slaughter of the Reigning Person, or Family, the worst of all Villanies was thereby rewarded with the most Glorious Privileges.</p>
               <p>That if such Doctrines were received, they would stir up Men to the Destruction of Princes with more Violence then all the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49148:13"/>
Passions that have hitherto raged in the Hearts of the most Unruly.</p>
               <p>That none could be Safe, if such a Reward were proposed unto any that could destroy them.</p>
               <p>That few would be so gentle as to spare even the Best, if by their destruction of a Wild Usurper could become God's Anointed; and by the most execrable Wickedness invest himself with that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Character.</p>
               <p>This is the Scope of the whole Treatise; the Writer gives such Reasons as at present did occur unto him to prove it. This seems to agree with the Doctrines of the most Reverenced Authors of all Times, Nations and Religions. The best and wisest Kings have ever acknowledged it. The present King of <hi>France</hi> hath declared that Kings have that happy want of Power, that they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary unto the Laws of their Country, and grounds his Quarrel with the King of <hi>Spain, Anno</hi> 1667, upon that Principle. King <hi>James</hi> in his Speech to the Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1603, doth in the highest degree assert it: The Scripture seems to declare it. If nevertheless the Writer was mistaken, he might have been refuted by Law, Reason and Scripture; and no Man for such matters was ever otherwise punished, than by being made to see his Errour; and it hath not (as I think) been ever known that they had been referred to the Judgment of a Jury, composed of Men utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to comprehend them.</p>
               <p>But there was little of this in my Case; the extravagance of my Prosecutors goes higher: The above-mentioned Treatise was never Finished, nor could be in many Years, and most probably would never have been. So much as is of it was written long since, never reviewed nor shewn unto any Man; and the fiftieth part of it was produced, and not the tenth of that afford to be read. That which was never known unto those who are said to have Conspired with me, was said to be intended to stir up the People in Prosecution of the Designs of those Conspirators.</p>
               <p>When nothing of particular Application unto Time, Place, or Person could be found in it, (as hath ever been done by those who endeavour'd to raise Insurrections) all was supplied by <hi>Innuendo's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatsoever is said of the Expulsion of <hi>Tarquin;</hi> the Insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against <hi>Nero;</hi> The Slaughter of <hi>Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Domitian;</hi> The Translation of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Merovins</hi> his Race unto <hi>Pepin;</hi> and from his Descendants unto <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> and the like applied by <hi>Innuendo</hi> unto the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49148:13"/>They have not considered, that if such Acts of State be not good, there is not a King in the World that has any Title to the Crown he bears; nor can have any, unless he could deduce his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree from the Eldest Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> and shew that the Succession had still continued in the Eldest of the Eldest Line, and been so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to him.</p>
               <p>Every one may see what advantage this would be to all the Kings of the World; and whether that failing, it were not better for them to acknowledg they had received their Crowns by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Willing Nations; or to have no better Title unto them than Usurpation and Violence, which by the same ways may be taken from them.</p>
               <p>But I was long since told that I must Die, or the Plot must Die.</p>
               <p>Lest the means of destroying the best Protestants in <hi>England</hi> should fail, the Bench must be filled with such as had been Blemishes to the Bar.</p>
               <p>None but such as these would have Advised with the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of the means of bringing a Man to Death; Suffered a Jury to be packed by the King's Solicitors, and the Under-Sheriff; Admit of Jury-men who are not Freeholders; Receive such Evidence as is above-mentioned; Refuse a Copy of an Indictment, or to Suffer the Statute of 46. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to be read, that doth expresly Enact, it should in no Case be denied unto any Man upon any occasion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; Over-rule the most important Points of Law without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And whereas the Stat. 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. upon which they said I should be Tried, doth Reserve unto the Parliament all Constructions to be made in Points of Treason. They could assume unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not only a Power to make Constructions, but such Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as neither agree with Law, Reason, or Common Sense.</p>
               <p>By these means I am brought to this Place. The Lord forgive these Practices, and avert the Evils that threaten the Nation from them. The Lord sanctify these my Sufferings unto me; and tho I fall as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto Idols, suffer not Idolatry to be Established in this Land. Bless thy People, and save them. Defend thy own Cause, and defend those that defend it. Stir up such as are Faint; Direct those that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; confirm those that Waver; Give Wisdom and Integrity unto all. Order all things so as may most redound unto thine own Glory. Grant that I may Die glorifying Thee for all thy Mercies; and that at the last Thou hast permitted me to be Singled out as a Witness
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49148:14"/>
of thy Truth; and even by the Confession of my Opposers, for that <hi>OLD CAUSE</hi> in which I was from my Youth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and for which thou hast Often and Wonderfully declared thy Self.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ABout Eleven of the Clock he was brought from the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> to the Justices Court, in a great Chair, on Mens Shoulders; where at first he was asked some Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, most of which he answer'd with Silence; at last said, <q>He humbly conceived, It was not necessary for him to add to his own Accusation, since he was not ignorant they had enough already to do his Business; and therefore he did not design to fret his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science at that time with Answering Questions.</q> After which, his <hi>Libel</hi> being read, the Court proceeded in usual manner; first asking him, <hi>If he had any thing to say for himself before the Jury closed?</hi> His Answer was, <q>He owned it all, saving that part, of having Designed the King's Death; and desired all present, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the words of a Dying Man; he never directly nor indirectly intended such a Villany; that he abhorred the very thoughts of it; and that he blessed God, he had that Reputation in the World, that he knew none that had the Impudence to ask him the Question; and he detested the thoughts of such an Action; and he hoped all good People would believe him, which was the only way he had to clear himself; and he was sure that this Truth should be one day made manifest to all Men.</q> He was again asked, <hi>If he had any Exception against the Jury?</hi> He answered <q>No; but wished them to do as God and their Consciences directed them.</q> Then they withdrew, and returned their Verdict in half an hour, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49148:14"/>
brought him in <hi>Guilty.</hi> The Sentence followed; <hi>For him to be taken from that Place to the next Room, and from thence to be Drawn on a Hurdle, betwixt Two and Four of the Clock, to the Cross of</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>the Place of Execution, and there to be Hang'd, Drawn and Quartered.</hi> He received his Sentenc with an undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Chearfulness. Afterwards he was delivered into the Town-Magistrates Hands; they brought to him two of their Divines, and offered him their Assistance upon the Scaffold; which he altogether refused, telling them, <q>That if they had any good Wishes for him, he desired they would spend them in their own Closets, and leave him now to seek God in his own Way.</q> He had several Offers of the same kind by others, which he put off in like manner. He was most serious and fervent in Prayers the few hours he lived (as the Sentinels observed, who were present all the while.) The Hour being come, he was brought to the Place of Execution, where he saluted the People on all sides of the Scaffold, and after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed himself with a Cordial out of his Pocket, he was supported by two Men, while he spoke to the People in these words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen and Brethren, It is for all Men that come into the World once to Die, and after Death to Judgment; and since Death is a Debt that all of us must pay, it is but a matter of small moment what way it be done; and seeing the Lord is pleased in this manner to take me to himself, I confess, something hard to Flesh and Blood, yet, blessed be his Name, who hath made me not only Willing, but Thankful for his honouring me to lay down the Life he gave, for his Name; in which, were every Hair in this Head and Beard of mine a Life, I should joyfully sacrifice them for it, as I do this: And Providence having brought me hither, I thick it most necessary to clear my self of some Aspersions laid on my Name; and</hi> first, <hi>That I should have had so horrid an Intention of Destroying the King and his Brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[Here he repeated what he had said before to the Justices on this Subject.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was also laid to my Charge, That I was Antimonarchical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was ever my Thoughts, That Kingly Government was the best of all, Justly Executed: I mean, such as by our ancient Laws; that is, a King, and a Legal Free Chosen Parliament. The King having, as I conceive, Power enough to make him Great, the People also as much Property as to make them Happy; they being as it were contracted to one another. And who will deny me, that this was not the Just Constituted Government of our Nation? How absurd is it then for</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49148:15"/>
                  <hi>Men of Sense to maintain, That though the one Party of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract breaketh all Conditions, the other should be obliged to perform their Part? No; this Error is contrary to the Law of God, the Law of Nations, and the Law of Reason. But as Pride hath been the Bait the Devil hath catched most by, ever since the Creation, so it continues to this day with us. Pride caused our first Parents to fall from the blessed Estate wherein they were created; they aiming to be Higher and Wiser than God allowed, which brought an everlasting Curse on them and their Posterity. It was Pride caused God to Drown the Old World. And it was</hi> Nimrod's <hi>Pride in building</hi> Babel, <hi>that caused that heavy Curse of Division of Tongues to be spread among us, as it is at this day. One of the greatest Afflictions the Church of God groaneth under, That there should be so many Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions during their Pilgrimage here; but this is their Comfort, that the Day draweth near, whereas there is but One Shepheard, there shall be but One Sheepfold. It was therefore in the Defence of this Party, in their Just Rights and Liberties, against Popery and Slavery</hi>—</p>
               <p>[At which words they Beat the Drums:] To which he said;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They need not trouble themselves; for he should say no more of his Mind on that Subject, since they were so disingenuous, as to interrupt a Dying Man, only to assure the People, he adhered to the True</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, <hi>detesting the erroneous Opinions of many that called themselves so; and I Die this day in the Defence of the ancient Laws and Liberties of these Nations: And though God, for Reasons best known to himself, hath not seen it sit to honour Us, as to make Us the Instruments for the Deliverance of his People; yet as I have Lived, so I Die in the Faith, that he will speedily arise for the Deliverance of his Church and People. And I desire all of you to prepare for this with speed. I may say, This is a deluded Generation, vail'd with Ignorance, that though</hi> Popery <hi>and</hi> Slavery <hi>be riding in upon them, do not perceive it; though I am sure there was no Man born marked of God above another; for none comes into the world with a Saddle on his Back, neither any Booted and Spurr'd to Ride to him; not but that I am well satisfied, that God hate wisely ordered different Stations for Men in the World, as I have already said: Kings having as much Power as to make them Great, and the People as much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty as to make them Happy. And to conclude; I shall only add my Wishes for the Salvation of all Men, who were created for that end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49148:15"/>After ending these words, he prayed most fervently near three quarters of an hour, freely forgiving all Men, even his greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, begging most earnestly for the Deliverance of <hi>Sion</hi> from all her Persecutors, particularly praying for <hi>London, Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, from which the Streams run that Rule God's People in these three Nations.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49148:16"/>The Crime was, my Entertaining a Non-Conformist Minister, which is since sworn to have been in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Army.

               <p>COming into the Press-yard, and seeing the Halter in the Officers Hand, he said, <hi>Is this for me?</hi> The Officer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>Yes;</hi> he replied, <hi>Blessed be God,</hi> and Kissed it; and after said, <q>O blessed be God for <hi>Newgate,</hi> I have enjoyed God ever since I came within these Walls, and blessed be God who hath made me fit to die. I am now going to that God that will not be mocked, to that God that will not be imposed upon, to that God that knows the Innocency of his poor Creature.</q> And a little after, he said, <q>Never did any poor Creature come unto God with greater Confidence in his Mercy, and Assurance of Acceptation with him, through Jesus Christ, than I do: but it is through Jesus Christ, for there is no other way of coming to God but by him, to find acceptance with him; there is no other Name given under Heaven whereby we can be saved, but the Name of Jesus. Then speaking to the Officers, he said, Labour every one of you to be fit to die: I was not fit to Die my self till I came in hither; but O blessed be God, he hath made me fit to die, and hath made we willing to die! In a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I shall have the Fruition of the Blessed Jesus, and that not for a day, but for ever: I am going to the Kingdom of God, where I shall enjoy the presence of God the Father, and of God the Son, and of God the Holy Spirit, and of all the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; I am going to the general Assembly of the First-born, and of the Spirits of just Men made perfect: O that God should ever do so much for me! O that God should concern himself so much for the good of poor Creatures, for their Salvation, blessed be his Name! For this was the design of God from all Eternity, to give his only Son to die for poor miserable Sinners.</q> Then the Officers going to tye his Hands, he said, <q>What, must I be tyed then? Well, a brown Thred might have served the turn; you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49148:17"/>
need not tye me at all, I shall not stir from you, for I thank God I am not afraid to die. As he was going out, he said, Farewel <hi>Newgate,</hi> Farewel all my Fellow-Prisoners here, the Lord comfort you, the Lord be with you all.</q>

                  <p>I Am come here this day, Condemned to die; but God is my Witness, the Crimes laid to my Charge were falsely and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously sworn against me by the Witnesses; for I never was at any Consult, nor any Meeting where Matters against the Government were discours'd of: I never heard nor read any Declaration, nor ever acted wilfully any thing against the Government. I confess, through the Justice of God, my private Sins have brought me to this Infamous End; yea, it were just with God, not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me eternally of his Presence, but to condemn me to Eternal Torments, but through Christ, I hope to be eternally Blessed: Yet as to the Crimes for which I suffer, on the Words of a dying Man, I am altogether Innocent. I bless God I was from my younger Years brought up in, and have for some Years continued a Protestant, in the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in which Communion I now die: I have often partaken in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the blessed Effects and Comfort thereof I now feel in this my Agony. I bless God I was born under a Government, in the Constitution of which I did ever acquiesce, and in which I was once a Member; at which time I did, according to the best of my Understanding,— [<hi>Here be was interrupted by the Sheriff.</hi>] —I bless God I was born in a Land of Light, where the Gospel hath been Preach'd in Power and Purity; He might have brought me forth in a Land of Darkness and Ignorance, but blessed be God for Jesus Christ.—<hi>Then he intreated the Sheriff to Intercede with his Majesty to be kind to his poor Wife and Children: The Sheriff promised him to wait on his Majesty the next day about it. He replied,</hi> Mr. Sheriff, I thank you, the Lord reward you a thousand-fold; the Lord put it into the Hearts of you to be kind to the Widdows and Fatherless, it is your Duty: The

               <head>The <hi>SPEECH</hi> of Captain <hi>WALCOT,</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>July, 1683.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS great Concourse of People do not only come here to see me Die, but also to hear what I shall say; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would not be Reproached, and thought to be an Atheist when I am gone, I have two or three words to speak for my Religion. I do believe in Three Persons, and one God, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and hope to be Saved by the Merits and Righteousness of his Son Christ Jesus, without the hope of an advantage by any Merits or Righteousness of my own. And I believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the Word of God; that <hi>They were not written according to the will of Man, but holy Men of God writ them as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I believe that these Scriptures ought to be the Rule of our Faith, and the method of our Worshipping of God: I believe that as Christ is the Head of his Church, so he is their Law-giver. That it is not in the power of any Council or Conclave of Cardinals, or any Power upon Earth whatsoever, to set up the Precepts and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Men, and to make them of equal validity with the Word of God. I believe it was not because the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected and Crucified Christ, that he rejected them, but because they rejected his Word; which appears by the Three thousand that God by one Sermon of <hi>Peter</hi>'s converted; they being <hi>prickt in their hearts, and touched in their Consciences,</hi> cried out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall we do?</hi> And they were <hi>that day added to the Church.</hi> It was certainly because the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected the Word and Gospel of Christ, that <hi>the things were hid from their Eyes which belonged to their peace.</hi> It is a dreadful thing to reject the Word of God; and it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to live in a sinful course of Life, till God withdraws his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49148:18"/>
                  <hi>Spirit</hi> from us; For it is said, <hi>It shall not always strive with Man. Death is the wages of Sin.</hi> I believe had not <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, he and we his Posterity had not died. Death is said to be the <hi>King of Terrours,</hi> but it is only so to those that are terrified with a Terrifying Conscience, that have the Arrows of the Almighty sticking in them, from convictions of great Guilt, and see no hopes of Mercy, have no assurance of Pardon; but those that are Christ's, he takes away the Terrour, and Horrour, and Sting of Death; he enables them to say with <hi>Paul, To me to live is Christ, and to die is Gain:</hi> He ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not only to get <hi>unto</hi> Christ, but <hi>into</hi> Christ; and so they have <hi>Communion and Fellowship with the Father and the Son.</hi> It is no hard matter to get the Notions of the Promises of the Gospel into our Heads; but unless the Lord is pleased to apply them to our Hearts, we cannot believe: Except we be <hi>in Christ as branches in the Vine,</hi> we are not Christians indeed. It was the Case of poor <hi>Francis Spira;</hi> he was certainly a knowing Man, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he had not Faith to apply the Promises. Christ hath said, that <hi>he that believes in him, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and he that lives and believes in him, shall never die.</hi> So if we be able to apply the Promises by the Spirit of God, we may have comfort through Faith: But then <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and <hi>Faith comes by hearing</hi> the Word of God, and receiving it in the love of God.</p>
               <p>I shall not be tedious, Mr. Sheriff, I shall be very short.</p>

                  <p>As to the present occasion of my Death, I do neither blame the Judges, nor the Jury, nor the King's Counsel: I only blame some Men that in reality and in truth were deeper concerned, and more engaged than I, that came in as Witnesses against me; who Swore me out of my Life to save their own, and who for fear they should not do it effectually, contrived that, That I will appeal to you all, whether there be a probability in it or not: For they said, I made it a scruple of Conscience to have a hand in killing the King, or to imbrue my hands in his Blood, but was so generous as to undertake the Charging his Guards, whilst others did it, and to the end another might do it. Truly I will appeal to all that know me, whether they believe me so much an Ideot, that I should not understand it was the same thing to engage the King's Guards, whilst another Killed him, as to Kill him with my own hands. But however, by their Swearing against me, they have secured their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49148:18"/>
own Lives and Estares, and made my Blood the price of theirs. I confess I was so unfortunate and unhappy, as to be invited by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Rumsey,</hi> (one of the Witnesses against me) to some Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where some things were discoursed of, in order to the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Liberties and Properties, which we looked upon to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and invaded. But it was he, and Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that are fled, who were the great promoters of those Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I was near a quarter of a Year ill of the Gout, and during that time Mr. <hi>W.</hi> often visited me, and still his discourse would be, concerning <hi>Lopping the Two Sparks;</hi> That was the word he used, meaning the King and the Duke; and proposed it might be done at a Play: This was his frequent discourse: For he said, <hi>Then they would die in their Calling:</hi> It was his very Expression. He bought Arms to do it with, without any direction of mine; I never saw the Arms, nor I never saw the Men that were to do it: though they said they had Fifty imployed to that end. I told several of them, That the Killing the King would carry such a blemish and stain with it, as would descend to Posterity; that I had Eight Children, that I was loth should be blemished with it: And withal, I was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would revenge his Fathers Blood, if it were but to vindicate himself from having any hand in it.</p>
                  <p>And now I desire to forgive all the World from the very bottom of my Heart; and I pray God of his Mercy from my Heart to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, even Mr. <hi>Shepherd,</hi> who delivered me up, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to carry me into <hi>Holland,</hi> but instead of that, he brought me into the condition wherein I now am. I do desire with all my Heart to forgive the Witnesses, and withal do earnestly beg that they may be observed, that some Remarks may be set upon them, whether <hi>their End be Peace,</hi> and that <hi>they die the common Death of all Men.</hi> Certainly, though it be the Law of the Land I ought to Die, and the King may justly and reasonably put me to Death for being in those Meetings where a War was debated; yet I think these Men are guilty of my Blood, that were as deep in as I, and have betrayed me, and taken it away. Then in the next place I beg leave, Mr. Sheriff, to speak one short word of Advice to my Friends, that hath been often given to me, though I was not so fortunate and so happy as to take it, and that is, That they would neither hear any Man speak, nor speak themselves, that which they would not have repeated: For there is no such thing as Faith in Man to Man, whatever there is in Man to God: Either the Tears of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49148:19"/>
Wife, or a Family of little helpless Children, something or other will tempt and provoke Men to betray one another. When God hath a Work to do, he will not want Instruments, for he can make them; nor will he want a way to do it, for he can contrive it and bring it to pass. And I do most heartily desire, and my earnest Prayer to the Almighty is, That this may be the last Blood spilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account. I know Acts of Indulgence and Mercy in the King would make him much easier in his Government, and would make his People sit much easier under it; and that the Lord may encline his Heart to mercy, ought to be the Prayer of every good Man. What hath happened, and what hath been the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Calamity, I suppose every man knows; what Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations have been on the one hand, Fears and Necessities, Jealousies and Sufferings of the other, I will not intermeddle with, resolving to use my utmost endeavour to make that Peace and Reconciliation with my God, which is impossible for me to make with Man; and to make it my hearty Prayer to the Great God before whom I am in a little time to appear, That he would stench this Issue of Blood, and find out some other way to preserve these Kingdoms in Unity and Peace; to the Honour and Glory of his Great Name, and the eternal Comfort of his People.</p>
                  <p>One word, Mr. Sheriff, I desire to speak as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King prest it hard upon me, and several People have been with me about <hi>Ireland,</hi> how far <hi>Ireland</hi> was concerned in this matter. I do aver here, as in the presence of God, before whom I am now going to appear, That I do not know an Englishman nor Protestant in <hi>Ireland</hi> engaged in it. What I did know, was only of one Scotish Gentleman in the North; and the King knows it, but he says he does not believe it. For they that were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I was never in any of their Councils: I never saw any of those Lords, but the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and that was I believe above six Months ago. I never saw nor spoke with one Lord, only my Lord <hi>Howard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not more to say, Mr. Sheriff: But truly you will do an act of a great deal of Charity, if you will Prevail with the King for an Act of Indulgence and Liberty to his People; I think so: And so the Lord have mercy upon me.</p>

                  <head>Captain <hi>Walcot</hi>'s Prayer.</head>
                  <p>O Lord, our God, Thou art a God of present help in time of Trouble, a God, that hast promised to be with thy People in the Fire and in the Water. O Lord, we pray Thee, that Thou wilt afford thy Presence to thy poor suffering Servants at this time, that Thou wilt enable us to pray with Faith, to trust in Thee, to be in expectation and hope of Mercy from Thee. O Lord, thy Servant that speaketh doth confess, that the Iniquities at his Heels have just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overtaken him, that Just and Righteous art thou in all thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that he hath reason to bear thy Indignation, because he hath sinned. O Lord, we beg, even for thy Son Christ Jesus's sake, that our Sins may not be brought to our remembrance in order to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency or discouragement, or our despairing in thy Mercy, but rather, O Lord, in order to an assurance that our great God hath pardoned and forgiven them in the Blood of his Son. O do thou bathe each of our Souls in that Fountain set open for Sin and for Uncleanness. Give us, O Lord, inward spiritual strength from thy Self, and give us cause to bless thy Name for inward supporting Graces, for inward assistances. O let us find an increase of spiritual strength, let us be assured that our Sins are done away, and let us also be assured that our Names are written in the Book of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let it be such an assurance as may be matter of joy and rejoycing to our Souls. O do thou enable every one of us, from the inward evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thy Spirit, to say with thy Servant <hi>Job,</hi> That we know and are assured that our Redeemer lives. O do thou give us such an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of an Interest in Thee, that we may be inabled in deed, in reality, and in truth, to say, that we have run our Race, and we have finished our Course with Joy: O let us now receive the fruit of those many Petitions that we have put up unto Thee. O let us now find the Spirit influencing our Hearts to a yielding patience, and a thorow subjection to the Will of God: Let us find thy Spirit assuring us that we are thine. O let us have stronger Evidences of thy Love, stronger Testimonies of thy Affection: O give us some inward Tastes of those Heavenly Joys that we hope through the Mercy of Jesus Christ, in a little time to have a more full Fruition of. O Lord, do thou speak Peace to every one of our Consciences; ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49148:20"/>
us to take hold of thy Strength that thou mayest make Peace with us, and let us not be discouraged, O Lord, since we have a High Priest that can be touched with our Infirmities: Let us with Boldness have Access to the Threne of Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and Grace to help in time of need. O take away the Sting and Terror that is in Death in any one of us, by assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us of our Interest in Thee, by assuring us that our Names are Recorded in the Book of Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we lie under a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death from Man, we beg that we may have a Sentence of Life Eternal from our God; and though we meet Thee, O Lord, in a Field of Blood, we beg that Thou wilt come to meet with us in a Field of Mercy. O Lord, extend thy Mercy, thou Lord, whose Compassions fail not, cause the Bowels of thy tender Pity to yearn with Compassion towards us: Enable every one of us, O Lord, to die believing in Jesus Christ, to die hoping in his Mercy, to die, relying upon him for Justification, for Sanctification, and for Adoption. O Lord, though we have been Prodigals, we desire to return unto our Fathrrs House where there is Bread enough. O enable us to come unto Thee as Children to their Parents. O let our Prayers be offered with so much Fervour in Christ Jesus, that Thou may'st think it reasonable to assure us of thy Love. O let the Intercession of Jesus Christ be accepted. O Lord, we beg that he may be our Advocate; if our Advocate be our Judg, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we cannot miscarry. O let Jesus Christ be the Hope of every one of our Souls; and, Lord, let not our Hope be like that of the Hypocrite, but let our Faith be built upon the Rock of Ages, and let us not fail from the apprehension of Affliction and Punishment from Men. Yet, O Lord, do thou so order our Hearts and our Spirits aright, that thou mayest be the Lot of our Inheritance, and our Portion for ever. O do thou interest us in thy Self; Lord, carry on thy own Work. We desire to come unto Thee that we may have Life. Lord help us, Lord put to thy helping Hand, Lord teach us truly to leave no Sin unrepented of in any one of our Hearts. And O Lord, we beg that with us thou wilt give us leave to recommend unto thy Care our poor Wives and Children: Thou hast promised to be the Father of the Fatherless, and the Husband of the Widdow; and thou hast commanded us to cast the Care of them upon Thee. O do thou make Provision for them, deal kindly with them, imprint thy own Image upon them, and enable them to bear this severe stroke with Patience. O Lord, stand by and support them; let their Ways be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49148:20"/>
found so pleasing and acceptable unto Thee, that thou may'st think it reasonable to make all their Enemies at Peace. Lord. interest them in thy Love, and do thou favour them with thy Mercies and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses. O Lord, we also beseech Thee in the behalf of these poor Kingdoms wherein we are, that Thou wilt he merciful to them, prevent Divisions among them, heal all their Breaches, compose their Differences, make all that are thine of one Heart and Mind in the things of thee our God. And, Lord, if it be thy Will, do thou rule in the Heart of the King, that he may Rule and Reign for Thee, and for the good of thy Church and People. Lord, favour us with thy Mercy, assure us of thy Love, stand by us in the difficult Hour, take us into thine own Care, cause thy Angels to attend us, to convey our Souls as soon as they are divided from our Bodies, into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, into the Paradise of our God. And, Lord, we beg that thou wilt be with us, with thy extraordinary Presence, helping us to trust in Thee, doing for us beyond what our narrow Hearts are able to ask or think. All which we beg for the sake of thy Son Jesus Christ, in whom, O Lord, this little time do thou give us Hearts to give thee all Glory, Honour, and Praise, now and for evermore, <hi>Amen. Sweet Jesus,</hi>
