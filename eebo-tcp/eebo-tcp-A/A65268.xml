            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ,

speeches deceive the hearts of the people.</q>

of the Primitive Church, because
there were many hereticks in their time,
writ themselves and advised others of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
ability to write against Heresie. We
have alike reason in these our dayes, and, if the mouthes of
our grave Ecclesiasticall Worthies could breath through
the iniquity of the times, might from them too assuredly
have alike encouragement to preach against Schisme. My
apprehension hereof first incited me to a rationall discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which at length concluded in this resolution, That
my silence (how inconsiderable soever) should not intitle
me to the least interest in betraying the Church to either
of her two homebred prevalent enemies, <hi>Blind Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
or <hi>Obstinate Malice.</hi> The successe which my
endeavours herein found by this Academicall performance
(if my friends tongues translated aright the language of
their hearts) being as beyond its desert, so, I truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
confesse, beyond likewise either my expectation
or hope, could be but a mean, if any incentive to this my
<pb facs="tcp:62399:3"/>
farther publication of it; whereby it may meet with a
different character from that which their charitable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
at first afforded it. For I'll not go about so to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivate
the judgements of my candid auditours, as to
chain them to their first conceiv'd opinion. I know the eye
is a lamp which often lights the understanding to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of some errours formerly lost in the labyrinth of
the eare. Things approv'd when heard may undergo a
contrary most just, because more deliberate, censure in
the reading. What motives soever I had (such, it may be,
as imposed rather a kind of necessity then gave me satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction)
I desire to conceal. The reason of my dedication
to your self (my many and great Collegiate obligations
engaging the choycest of my future endeavours in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
discharge) needs runne no hazard of your various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
being my desire to imploy it as a thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of your first Christian grace vouchsafed
me at the Font, seconded by your pious most carefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

accumulation of favours, which shall hereafter upon the

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ythagoras, that old Samian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
who (as Justine Martyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords)
was wont to veil and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
his opinions under dark
speeches and mysticall symbols,
having made Unitie the originall
of all things, and the cause of all good that is in
the world; the Father takes not his words for his
meaning, but under the allegoricall veil of that
Unitie discovers an undivided Deitie: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
saith he in his Cohor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to the Grecians. As if that and God were
so inseparably linked together, that the thought
of man, although suggested but by the dictate of
nature, could not possibly part them asunder. In
like manner, S. Paul in this chapter exhorting the
Ephesians to the endeavour of keeping the unitie
of the Spirit in the bond of peace, after he hath
told them, <hi>There is but one body,</hi> meaning of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church howsoever dispersed over the
whole earth; But <hi>one Spirit,</hi> of a God informing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62399:4"/>
and giving life to every member thereof; But <hi>one
hope of their Christian calling</hi> (as if all this Unitie
were but to usher in a single Deitie) he concludes
all with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>There is one God,</hi> vers. 6. Yet
before he gets up to this, he binds the Ephesians
in a bond of union with that triple cord, wherein
their whole Christianity was twisted, which
could admit of no separation at all, unlesse they
would seem to dissolve their profession: <hi>There is
one Lord,</hi> whom Christians obey, and therefore
no distraction by service, <hi>There is one faith,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they believe, and therefore no division by
Creeds; <hi>There is one baptisme,</hi> whereby they get
entrance into the Church, and therefore no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
by initiative grace. And these three are
more peculiarly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that Trinitie of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
wherein God, by the ministery of S. Paul, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to his Church, as it were in the shape of
three Angels, as once he did to Abraham and
Sarah, to put her in mind of that <hi>conjugale foedus,</hi>
that league of love between her and her husband,
whereby she may fructifie and bring forth an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,
a child of joy, peace, unity, and concord,
wherein may all the earth be blessed. Or, to speak
plainly, They are a triple motive to that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
duty enjoyned in my text, a serious endeavour
of preventing Schisme, of preserving Peace and
Unitie in the Church.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62399:4"/>
Now as we reade in the history of the Creation
of two great Luminaries ordained by God for
the ornament and benefit of that, so saith he, is
the like number appointed for the convenience
of this: <hi>Sol &amp; Luna, Regnum &amp; Sacerdotium;</hi>
There the Sunne and the Moon, here the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and the Priesthood. And as for preserving
the entire lustre of the Moon is required a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
influence of light from the Sunne; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to maintain the Sacerdotall Dignity, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
emanation from the Regall Authority: <hi>Nam
ubi semel tollebatur sceptrum Iudae, profanabatur &amp;
Levi sacerdotium,</hi> When once Juda's scepter's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
Levi's Priesthood's presently profaned.
And thus farre the parallel holdeth very well. In
one thing it faileth, or rather exceedeth, That
whereas the Moon repayeth no tribute, nor (for
ought we know) conferreth any thing to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
or benefit of the Sunne; here it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
where the Regal rayes transmitted to the
Priesthood reflect on themselves, and (beside
that in the end they double the lustre of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
body from whence they proceeded) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
such an influence in the reflection, as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
much (if not to the being precisely taken, at
least) to the happy and well being of the same.
Wherefore these two, like Eros and Anteros in
the Fables of the Poets, are sick or well both at
a time. There is a double cause of their distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
Rebellion in the one, and Schisme in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
which two too often engender, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to beget some strange monster, the seed of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62399:5"/>
which must needs be the subversion of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall
government in the State, Episcopall in the
Church. The later of the two, which is Schisme
in the Church, is chiefly aym'd at in this place by
S. Paul: the prevention of that, the duty in the
text, <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in
the bond of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There shall be some resemblance between my
manner of handling these words, and the thing it
self implied in the same. And therefore of them
I will make no ominous division, which intend a
happy and successefull union. Nor will I deal
much with them by themselves, but wind them
into my discourse on the former in the second
verse. Wherein I shall follow Aquinas his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
who, out of the connexion they have both
together, hath well observed foure vices which
concurre to the production of Schisme, and foure
opposite vertues, whereby it is easily crushed in
the wombe, and becomes abortive. The first is
<hi>Pride,</hi> and to that is oppos'd <hi>Humilitie,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>with all humblenesse of mind.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Anger,</hi> and to that is opposed <hi>Meeknesse,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with meeknesse.</hi> The third, <hi>Impatience,</hi>
to that <hi>Patience,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with long-suffering.</hi>
The fourth and last is <hi>Inordinate zeal,</hi> the opposite
vertue to which is not expressed, but implied, as
he thinketh, in the subsequent words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,

their judgements, and admit of none but their

the Doctrine. As for Discipline, since they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Church so strait laced, as to be restrained to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
precept or president (I mean not in her Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopall

we suppose, by Divine right, the whole Army of
their Presbyteriall arguments will scarce be ever

ceremonies, things indifferent in themselves,
and wholly left to her pious judgement in a legall
Synod to alter, increase, or diminish, according as
the different circumstances, incident to her state
and condition, may dictate convenient; they feign
to themselves a peculiar familiarity with God, as
Numa did with his goddesse Egeria, and think
the Church is bound to believe them, and, out of
a reverend esteem thereof, confine her practice to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62399:6"/>
their prescriptions; not one of which but they all
hugge as close as ere Ixion did his Juno in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

their depraved fancie and proud conceit.</p>
            <p>I have read of Socrates, That when the Oracle
of Apollo had pronounc'd him the wisest of men,
though his reverence was such to his god, that he
would not plainly give him the lye, yet was his
modestie likewise such, and mean conceit of his
own worth, that he would not take it <hi>in terminis</hi>
to himself: and therefore indifferently to preserve
both, he gave this reason of Apollo's Oracle,
<hi>Quòd hoc esset una omnis sapientia, non arbitrari se
scire quod nesciat,</hi> Because this was the onely wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(and to this he could lay a most just claim)
not to suppose he knew that, whereof he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.

It is such a Furie as frights a man out of himself,

up to his hand ever since, and imployed it as his

he first puts us out of possession of our souls (for
Patience is our tenure, saith he that gave them us.
<hi>In your patience possesse ye your souls,</hi> Luke 21.) and
then out of possession of the Church too, which is

saith Blessed Ignatius; <hi>Lest any of you be found
a desertour or run-away from the Church.</hi> Let Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme
be your armour, Faith your helmet, Love
your spear; but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Patience</hi> capape,
your whole armour of defence. He must not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
himself with Korah, and tell Moses and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
they take too much upon them, or make
themselves Princes over the people. He must not
murmure at Moses his stay in the Mount, and in
the mean time cast in his eare-ring to the making
up of a calf; that is, He must not envy the leaders
of the Church their free accesse to Kings and
Princes, those gods upon earth, <hi>Dixi enim, Dii
estis,</hi> and that in their mounts, their erected
Thrones and stately Palaces, and in the mean time
contribute any trifling principle (which it may be
some Presbyteriall Divine hung at his eare at the
last Exercise) towards the making up of a new
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62399:10"/>
imaginary Discipline in the Church. Nay, I'll go
farther with him: If the Church should set up a
calf of her own (as God forbid) that is, be so farre
corrupted, as to command the practice of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
worship, that's not sufficient to justifie
Schisme, or make good his desertion. Here's
room still to make use of his passive obedience,
though I advise not his active. He may, he must
here suffer the punishment, whatsoever it is, to be
inflicted for the omission, and be guilty of no
commission at all. (Not that I would hereby stop
the mouth of any reverend Prelate, Priest, or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
entrusted by God with the souls of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whose then unseasonable exemplary silence
may be interpreted by the ignorant at least conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,
if not encouragement to communicate in
the sinne. I think him bound to rebuke the same
by what authority soever countenanced.) But if
his conscience yet be so farre mistaken, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him, That his not renouncing of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
communion in things either indifferent or
commendable, implies a guilt of positive commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in those corruptions which are absolutely
sinfull, I pity his case, he is like a serpent between
the shadow of the ash and the fire: but let me tell
him, It is cooler being in one then the other, and
therefore he must be a little more subtil then
with her to skip into the heat of contention, the
fire of Schisme.<note place="margin">Veneric Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellens. ut pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur lib. De Unit. Eccles. conserv. p. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

path, and adde a third possible defect, and that's in
the qualification or condition of the persons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which he observeth zeal to admit of a

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62399:11"/>

an ignorant multitude (the arm of whose
discretion and judgement was not able to wield a
weapon of that size) when it is said of them, <hi>Zelus

            <p>But to take it a while in its pure naturals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
those severall circumstances and different li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations,
I reade it defin'd as abstracted in it self,
<hi>Desideriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vehemens, quo quis incitatur ea tollere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gerson, part. 3. De Consol. Theolog. l. 3.</note> 
               <hi>quae
rei sibi dilectae videntur adversa,</hi> An earnest desire
to take away such things as seem opposite to that
which he loveth. Now as there is nothing which
should so swell up our souls with joy and delight,
nor lodge in any corner of our hearts, as the love
of God; so can our zeal be imployed about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so well as the utter abolishing of that which
either gives him a direct affront, and that's Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
or stops the free current of our service and
due devotion, by intermixing the muddy inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of weak brains, and vain curiosities, and that's
Superstition.</p>
            <p>But this zeal, as good as it is, must be attended
by three handmaids, to bear up his train, which
according to Gerson are <hi>Benevolentia, Discretio, &amp;
Constantia;</hi> else, saith he, it is like a two-edged
sword in the hand of a mad-man, <hi>aut fulmini sine

which makes way through all, and will admit of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62399:12"/>
no opposition. Upon the first of the three our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
seemeth chiefly to reflect, the absence
thereof being that which chiefly causeth the
breach of union, the disturbance of the peace and
quiet of the Church.</p>
            <p>I should begin with this, but I must first give
you a brief character of such persons as are fittest
to be imployed in this businesse. S. Austine grants
them,<note place="margin">Expos. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. Ioan. Tractat. 10.</note> whosoever they are, a large commission, <hi>Fac
quicquid potes,</hi> Do what thou canst. But what?
presently set fire on the Church? No. <hi>Frigidum
fundit,</hi> he casts cold water to allay this heat. Do
it, but still <hi>pro persona, quam portas,</hi> onely accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that person which thou bearest. No me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
put his profane hand to the pulling down
of that most sacred and ever venerable Episcopall
function. <hi>Tractet fabrilia.</hi> No women vent their
impiety and ignorance in slandering it as an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Prelacie. Let them be silent as <hi>in,</hi> so <hi>of,</hi>
or <hi>concerning the Church</hi> too. It was S. Pauls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>Discant in silentio,</hi> not that they should teach
but learn in silence. Nay, <hi>non patiar,</hi> saith he; <hi>I
suffer not a woman to teach,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 12. And this
argues the irrationall licentious practice of our
times, wherein either sex and any profession
crowds in a finger to the moulding of the design'd
Reformation; and this, if not with publick tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
if not without some contradiction, I am
sure not with a due peremptory penall prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Nay, they must be Leaders in the case, and
teach the very Captains themselves of the Church
militant their severall postures, prescribe them a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62399:12"/>
form to muster their men. I have read of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
of the Sarmatae, That attending Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian
the Emperour of the West, and telling him,
being basely clad, that they were prime men of
that nation, he fell into such a passion for warring
with so base a people, that he dyed suddenly. In
like manner, I think, if Religion in these dayes
did but view the Grandees of Schisme in their
mechanick habits, and seriously consider with
what a ragged Regiment of ignorance and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
she hath had so long a continued encounter;
she would out of indignation desert us, and leave
her golden crown to be at all adventure usurped
either by insolent profanenesse, or blind A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme.
But to leave these Bedlams at length to
be well lashed by their own too impetuous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and to be as good as my word, I think we are
bound by the doctrine of our Church to surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the first place of composing differences, and
zealous reforming what abuses soever are crept
into it, to him whom we acknowledge her head,
and that's the King. And good reason too: For
that is true as well in Church as State, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lust
in Tacitus suggested to Livia,<note place="margin">Annil. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Eam conditionem

(We'll make it <hi>Ecclesiae) remedium esse, quàm ut ab

Lord, howsoever we acknowledge to have a more
then ordinary influence and speciall assistance of
the Spirit of God; yet being not bound (so farre
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62399:13"/>
as we know) to take away infallibility from the
Chair, and chain it to the Throne, nor to give it a
Crown instead of a Mitre; we find it most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to reason, and correspondent to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
practice of the Primitive times, as also to
that of all such Christian Churches, as still retein
the true ancient doctrine and discipline, that he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to him the counsel of his Bishops and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
who, if so qualified as their places require,
may be presumed the fittest men to moderate
zeal, to compose all different opinions, and to
pick truth out of partiality. Not to trouble you
with various quotations out of severall Fathers, I
will onely fetch you one from the head, and that's
Blessed Ignatius, who speaks to our purpose, in
asserting,<note place="margin">Ep. 2. Ad Trallian.</note> That whosoever doth any thing without
the Bishop and his Presbyterie, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>such an one hath his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
defiled, and is worse then an infidel.</hi> But lest you
should think the Prince in this case a priviledg'd
person, he otherwhere inverts our order, and hath
his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,<note place="margin">Fp. 6. Ad Philadelph.</note> 
               <hi>Let Caesar himself be
ruled by the perswasion of his Bishop.</hi> Now the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of these seems to be grounded upon S. Pauls
rule, who would have zeal to be regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to knowledge. For, to speak the truth, if the
Clergie be once excluded this businesse, and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(who by reason of their severall avocations
are for the most part forced to take up their The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall
principles I wish I could say but at the
second or third hand) must have the perpetuall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of this concurrent judiciall imployment; if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62399:13"/>
ignorance chance to incorporate with authority,
and both grow up strong and stout in time, it may
well be feared in the future age Divinity must be
fetched within the sphere of their apprehensions,
conjur'd within the circle of some politick law,
and the maintainers of what truth soever (if either
mistaken by them, or not taken at all, as being too
profound and out of their reach) may chance to
be dashed out of all their preferment by the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
force of some old decrepit statute, if not
blown away by the violent breath of some zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Patriot, and Lay ill-affected Arbiter.</p>
            <p>And thus much shall serve to have been spoken
of the persons, whom I conceive the fittest to
handle zeal, and to reform any exorbitancie of
the Church.</p>
            <p>As touching the three attendants thereof, which
I had out of Gerson; the first of them was <hi>Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia,</hi>
which I'll interpret good will or Christian
charity towards our brethren. And this should be
shewed either in preserving their credits, or bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with their perverse manners, <hi>Supportantes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicem,</hi>
supporting one another, <hi>ut alter alterius mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

a charitable judgement of their errours, though
untrue, as much more pleasing to Almighty God
then a true judgement, if it be uncharitable.
Whereof how farre short come the writing and
preaching zelots of these our dayes? whom I have
often observed (as in their pamphlets, so likewise
in their pulpit invectives) to gain ground on popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62399:14"/>
minds, and to give a little life to those deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
pictures they make of such men as to whose
doctrines they will not conform themselves, that
they obliquely draw a dark shadow of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
conversations; and no diversity of opinion
but must be attended by some notable irregularity
in manners. I confesse those men upon whom this
is justly charged (if any such there are) as they
cannot expect to be any where excused, so much
lesse to have an advocate in this sacred place. But
I pray God themselves be blamelesse that blame
others. Indeed those men at whom they glance,
have not got the trick to do it in the dark, but too
ingenuously think the world will be as charitably
affected to them, as they are to the world. This
I'll say, which I confidently presume, That were
they not so bated and worried for their opinions,
which they think in their conscience they may
well justifie, and thereby driven as to a desperate
neglect of their studies, so likewise to a lesse strict
guard of their lives, they would be somewhat
more regular in their actions, which upon serious
recollection and pious meditation it is likely in
their reasons they condemne and vilifie.</p>
            <p>Nor doth this their uncharitable zeal extend it
self onely to some few particular persons, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circleth
no lesse then the whole Church, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
exempted: upon which, instead of praising
God for the first happy conversion of this nation
to Christian Religion; for that, wherein they
think themselves have the onely interest, an after-Reformation
from blind superstition; they daily
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62399:14"/>
cast the foul-mouth'd calumny and undeserved
aspersion of Pelagianisme, and whatsoever other
wretched heresie they find condemned by the
Catholick Church in her sacred Records, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Antiquity, which they neither search nor
care for but when it may furnish them with a few
bare names, such as they may cast like dirt in the
face of those worthy men, who drop better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
in their daily discourse with every crumb
that falls from their tables, then these men do in
their large distributions of the bread of the
Word, as they too often emphatically causlesly
term it. So that what Palemon proudly professed
of learning, they arrogantly conceit of Religion.

               </gap> I desire the Criticks at their
leisure to inform us. No Discretion thus taken
disables those person or dealing with zeal,
whose weak capacities are overcast with such a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62399:16"/>
cloud of ignorance as intercepteth their view, and
blunteth the point of the brightest ray their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
sends forth to discover any errour of
the Church. As also those whose judgements,
howsoever mounted higher, and raised above this
misty region, are seated upon such a dangerous
precipice, that their first conception, their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
fixeth not there, but rowls down to
their mouthes, and breaks forth in a clamourous
storm of passion, if it fall not lower to their arms
and hands, and vent it self thence in a bloudy ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
persecution. For the first of which there
is none of us all but may find a shelter, <hi>Tulingua,
ego aurium sum Dominus.</hi> But if it once come to
the second, as if they were following the sent of
a fresh victory, <hi>Nec temperari facilè nec reprimi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
stricti ensis ira,</hi> the last step of their power is
the first of their mercy. S. Austine sets them a

he of a Bishop, to whom he had written an harsh
epistle, but received an answer in more bitter lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
So these men, who when time serves can
sufficiently complain of hard usage, and brand
the due Ecclesiasticall Censure of obstinate
Schisme (I may say Heresie) with that scandalous
undeserved name Persecution, should do well to
mete out their own words with the measure of
indifference, and when themselves come to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,

Therein following too near at the heels their

               </gap>etend) do in effect
thrust the Pope out of his Magisteriall Chair of
Infallibility, to the end that they may sit in it
themselves. But alas this pertinacious adherence
to ungrounded principles is but the feigned model
of constancy, the foundation whereof must be
right reason, no fond opinion, <hi>quae non aliud quàm

and the whole prospect towards the even

            <p>Now as obstinacy is to be declined on one
hand, so must likewise levity on the other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
howsoever they conceit themselves to have but

(I mean their pretence of Scriptures autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

find it otherwise, and that they at their pleasure
can fix on the same an unparallel'd non-presiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
interpretation to usher in any new devis'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.
Nor is this caution onely personall, but
best befits such synods or convents as assume to
themselves a power of Religion, of drawing up a
form of any Ecclesiasticall Reformation. For (not
to flatter our selves nor them) if they sometimes
will be enacting or articling, at others, without
due consideration, repealing and nullifying, every
man cannot make a weather-cock of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to be blown about through all the rumbes of
Religions card by the confused violent blasts of
such successive dissonant assemblies.</p>
            <p>And thus at length have I done with that last
productive of Schisme, Inordinate zeal, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site

            </p>
            <p>If I should now enter on the duty by it self, and
draw it off from the lees of my former discourse,
I might find matter sufficient to double the time

            <p>The first shall be from the first word thereof,

               </gap>, <hi>endeavouring.</hi> Which shews how one
unity is prerequired to the inducement or conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the other. First a conjunction of every

one individuall inclination; and then a concurring

with others to a generall union of wills and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
(For <hi>Pax hoc in loco est voluntatum unio,</hi> saith
Catharinus on the place.) And therefore S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
renders it well, <hi>satis agentes,</hi> as if it would
sufficiently busie, and take up no lesse then the

               </gap>, <hi>Endeavouring to keep.</hi>
For it is not sufficient to search it out with some

            <p>Thirdly, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the unity of the

said of injustice, That without justice it could not

is impossible for it to subsist without union. S. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie

The fruit whereof is love, joy, peace, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering,
gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith, meeknesse,
temperance, a goodly train of Christian vertues,
Gal. 5. 22. That Spirit which before it came down
to the Church upon earth had concurred to the
like good mysterious work above in heaven, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an exact Unity of the blessed Trinity. For as
S. Austine saith,<note place="margin">De Verb. Dom in Evang. Matt. Serm. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Societas est quodammodo Patris &amp;
Filii ipse Spiritus Sanctus.</hi> We have two other
presidents for this godly union from the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persons of the Blessed Trinity. From God

               </gap>, <hi>in the bond of

if he bestowed it on them with his own

our Christ deserveth surely as much at our hands
as to have his peace carefully kept by all such as

<hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</hi>
John 14. 27. He gave them peace, promis'd them
knowledge, but that was to be sent after his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my name, shall teach you all things. As if
peace and love were to have the precedence, the
first place in the heart of man. The onely order
observed in heaven, where the first place or degree
is given to the Angels of love, which are termed
Seraphin; the next to the Angels of light, which
are termed Cherubin. First love, and then illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
But our Enthusiasts invert the order. They
will have first light, and that of revelation; then
love, and that but to such as will come off to their
own faction.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">In loc.</note> In the bond of peace. S. Anselme
saith, This bond of peace is an externall profession
of peace and concord, which is <hi>quasi vinculum &amp;
nexus interioris unitatis Spiritûs.</hi> I like it well if he
means a united conformity and conjunction in the
outward service of God. You know when we go
about to bind up things close together, we usually
lay them in the same posture, not some doubled,
others at length, but all having a due correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
one to another. And thus it is <hi>in Ecclesia fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciculo.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62399:19"/>
If in our outward religious performance
and worship of God, some be kneeling, others
standing, a third sort, in a worse posture by farre,
uncivilly sitting; it will be a hard matter to bind
them so close together, but some will drop out
of the bundle of the Church. I will use another
familiar similitude with your leave: When we
bind up a bundle, we lay not the parcels at any
great distance, but as close and near one another as
may be. And therefore if we be at a distance one
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, come not to serve our God together,
but while there is a Congregation in the Church,
there's a Conventicle in a chamber, a Meeting in a
barn, and a Ring too it may be in the fields or
woods; it's a hard matter to bind al these together,
the bond I fear wil be somewhat too short, and we
had need have a little to spare to make a knot that
it may be the surer.<note place="margin">Prolog. ad Tract. 1. De Doctr. Chi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62399:20"/>
all these have conspir'd together to unty out knot
of Christian charity, produc'd an unhappy
Schisme in the Church. The case is clear. What
else mean those whispers of some grand plotting,
and a strange mysterious working to commit sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
to rob the Church of her poore patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
if not that which God himself hath given
her, at least that wherein many ages since his
Saints and Servants out of their ture working pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have enstated her? What else those loud aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
cries of <hi>Down with Episcopacy? Vp with a
Presbyteriall Superintendency?</hi> What lastly means
that truly mounting-Lecture-Language, and most
irreligious Pulpit imposture, whereby too many,
when they have once drawn the yielding hearts
of weak people into those open and unfenced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses
of their ears, there chain them to their own
motions. Thus leading captive to their own vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
(though but low-descended) spirits not
onely silly women, but men too laden with sinnes,
and led away with divers lusts?</p>
            <p>It is time for me now to have done with my
text, and ease you of your trouble. I will onely out
of charity adde a triple rule for those either mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
or mistaken souls, against whom my whole
discourse hath been intended, whereby they may
be happily reduced, and with them the Unity of
the Spirit restored. And that's, in brief, first by
Reason rightly weighed; Secondly, by Scripture
rightly interpreted; Thirdly, by the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Canons of the Church to that purpose
rightly assembled. To which three if they deny
