            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is the true God, and eternal Life. <hi>And it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately added:</hi> Little Children, keep your selves from Idols. <hi>And though there be many Idols in mans heart; yet this is one

of the greatest, and most dangerous, and hardest to be departed from; a mans own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, if it be, but as it were, by the works of the Law: And as we know that an Idol is nothing but the Image and Likeness of that which it is not: So verily; this, (mans own righteousness) is nothing; a meer Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mans own heart exalted against God: which is not, nor cannot be in Gods sight, and so it should be in thine: Abominable to thee, and abhorred by thee, as it is to him,</hi> Job 15.14, 15, 16.

<pb facs="tcp:35607:3"/>
To help thee so to do, as much as in me lieth, I declare unto thee three things, namely,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That I am not ingaged in Spirit, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interest or design with any party now enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, disputing and contending one against other about these matters; further than for the truths sake, and so far as the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel obligeth me to defend and bear witness to the same, as it may be found to lodge and dwell on the one side or on the other, in any part of it: And perhaps it will sufficiently appear that I am not of that party, that may boast much of this Doctrine which is most true in it self: and yet did not give proof and assurance of hope, that themselves are sincere and sound in the Faith of Christ. The Doctrine may be true in its self, and yet their Faith in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it be but a dead and a vain Faith; which will never save them, as</hi> James 2.17, 18, 19, 20. Even so Faith, if it hath not Works, is dead being alone, Yea, a man may say, Thou hast Faith, and I have Works; shew me thy Faith without thy Works, and I will shew thee my Faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou dost well: The Devils also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man that Faith without Works is
<pb facs="tcp:35607:4"/>
dead? <hi>And ungodly men still; though boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Grace of God in works, yet denying indeed the only Lord God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; by turning the grace of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lasciviousness,</hi> Jud. 4. For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And too many such Professors we have now, (who in Spirit and Practice, Course of Life and Conversation practically deny, what they verbally profess) as they had there,</hi> Tit. 1.15, 16. Unto the pure all things are pure: But unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and Consci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce is defiled. They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and unto every good work repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. <hi>But let not this offend thee, for truth is truth still, and will be for ever,</hi> Hebrews 13.7, 8. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose Faith follow, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the end of their conversation. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
<pb facs="tcp:35607:4"/>
Brethren be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so, as ye have us for an ensample. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ; whose end is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, whose God is their Belly: And whose glory is their shame, who mind earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things) For our conversation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whence also we look for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashon'd like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Here thou wilt find no carnal weapons, as Oratory, enticing words of mans wisdom, excellency of speech; fierie, if not perverse, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth. No reasonings after the Flesh and the Wisdom of the World, which cometh to naught: But evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit, with power,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.3, 4, 5. For though we walk in the Flesh, ((i. e. <hi>in the body</hi>;) we do not war after the Flesh: i. e. <hi>after the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, which is corrupt and weak.</hi>) For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

down of strong holds) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thought to the obedience of Christ. 1 Cor. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. And my speech, and my preaching was not with enticing words of mens wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: That your Faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. Howbeit we speak wisdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this World, or of the Princes of this World that come to nought.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That the great truth herein declared, opened, demonstrated and applyed; is not mine, nor of mine own; but is the truth of God in Christ Jesus, ministred by the Spirit to the holy Prophets of old, and witnessed by them, who spake not of themselves, but as they
<pb facs="tcp:35607:5"/>
were moved by the Holy Ghost,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. For the Prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man: but Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. <hi>And declared in the fulness of time by the Son of God, who came from the bosom of the Father,</hi> John 1.18. No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. <hi>And</hi> John 3.31, 32, 33, 34. He that cometh from above, is above all: he that is of the earth, is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and speaketh of the Earth: he that cometh from Heaven is above all. And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and no man receiveth his testimony. He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal, that God is true. For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. <hi>And also witnessed by the Holy Apostles chosen of God to that end. Upon which testimony of the holy Prophets and Apostles as the Foundation, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being the Chief or Head-corner stone, the whole Church of God is built,</hi> Ephes. 2.20. And are built upon the foudation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself be-the chief Corner-stone; <hi>so that he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth,
<pb facs="tcp:35607:6"/>
despiseth and rejecteth this truth in the ministry of us poor, weak, earthen vessels, despiseth not man but God, as</hi> Luke 10.16. He that heareth you, heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me. <hi>And</hi> 1 Thes. 4.8. He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. <hi>Therefore thou art obliged to pay all honour, reverence, obedience and subjection to truth, because it is Gods truth and not mans; and to receive the word, because it is Gods word and not ours; And to receive the Word as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the word of God and not as the word of Man, is the mystery of effectual or saving Faith: Whereby the Faith of Gods Elect is distinguished from the common and temporary Faith of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and temporary professors,</hi> 1 Thes. 2.13. For this cause also thank we God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceasing, because when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe. <hi>Therefore whatever infirmities thou seest or may see in us, and whatever temptations in our fles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of God be refused or despised: But receive it as if Christ himself was present on Earth in human shape to speak to thee, with his own mouth,</hi> Gal. 4.13, 14, 15, 16. Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. And my temptation which was in my Flesh ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised not, nor rejected; but received me as an Angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. Where is then the blessedness you speak of? for I bear you record, that if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? <hi>Therefore ask thy heart this question? is this the truth of God or no? If thy heart answereth, No: I do not like it, nor the persons that preach it: Then to the Law and to the testimony; to the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles and to Christ himself; Whose testimonies are all distinctly recorded: and then ask thy heart this question again: Darest thou with a stiff neck and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised heart always resist the Holy Ghost; as thy Fathers did, so dost thou dare to do</hi>; Acts 7.51, Ye stiff necked, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in heart and ears, ye do always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Holy Ghost: as your Fathers did, so do ye. <hi>If thou shouldest dare to refuse all
<pb facs="tcp:35607:7"/>
the Prophets and Apostles who spake on earth, yet there is one more, who speaketh from Heaven, even the Son of God himself, and darest thou refuse him also?</hi> Heb. 12.25. See that ye refuse not him that speaketh: for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven: <hi>Consider therefore in thy heart; that whatever we are or may be esteemed to be, who are the poor Ministers of Christ; yet though we be nothing, let the Holy Prophets and Apostles be esteemed as something: for they shall sit upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> Israel, Mat. 19.28. And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, when the Son of man shall sit in the Throne of his glory, ye also shall sit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel. And the true Church of the living Ged which is cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, doth wear them, as a Crown of twelve Stars upon her head: And wilt thou trample them under thy feet?</hi> Rev. 12.1. And there appeared a great wonder in Heaven, a Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a Crown of twelve Stars:
<pb facs="tcp:35607:7"/>
                     <hi>But however though we be nothing, yet let the Son of God, Jesus Christ himself be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! For verily God the Father thinks him to be something: When he hath given him a name that is above every name, that is in Heaven, and that is on the Earth: That every Knee shall bowe and every Tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to him; as</hi> Phil. 2.9, 10, 11, 12. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Knee shall bowe, of things in Heaven, or things in Earth, and things under the Earth; And that every Tongue shall confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Wherefore my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more in my absence; work out your own Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. <hi>And verily he shall appear to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the great day when he shall come to judge the World, and before him shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all Nations, as</hi> Matth. 25.31, 32, 33, 34. When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the Holy Angels with him, then shall he sit upon the Throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

his Sheep from the Goats: And he shall set the Sheep on his right hand, but the Goats on his left. Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you before the foundation of the World. <hi>And thou thy self also must appear before his judgment seat,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10, 11. For we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whither it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also, are made manifest in your Consciences. <hi>And</hi> Rev. 6.15, 16, 17. And the Kings of the Earth, and the Great men, and the Rich men, and the Chief Captains, and the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, and every Bond-man, and every Free-man hid themselves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains; And said to the Mountains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? <hi>And</hi> Rev. 20.12, 13, 14, 15. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before
<pb facs="tcp:35607:8"/>
God; and the books were opened: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother book was opened, which is the book of Life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the Sea gave up the dead which were in it; and Death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them: And they were judged every man according to their works. And Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of Fire: This is the second Death. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was not found written in the Book of Life, was cast into the Lake of Fire. <hi>And this day will come as a Thief in the night,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.10. But the day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the night; in the which the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the Earth also with the works that are therein shall be burnt up. <hi>And</hi> Rev. 22.11, 12. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: And he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: And he that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, let him be righteous still: And he that is holy, let him be be holy still. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. <hi>Well then Reader, whoever thou art; know that the word</hi> Kingdom <hi>is

He answered and said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, He that soweth the good seed, is the Son of man, <hi>We are but his under Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to minister from him this good seed, and our great Lord is able to bless the seed sown though we be nothing, as</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5, 6, 7, 8. Who then is <hi>Paul,</hi> and who is <hi>Apollos,</hi> but Ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I have planted, <hi>Apollos</hi> watered: but God gave the increase.

                  <p>MOST Dear and Pretious Friends; Pretious I say, for the late Pretious Faith obtained by you, with us, 2 Pet. 1.1. Simon Peter, <hi>a Servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like pretious Faith with us, through the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ</hi>: By which Faith, the very Faith of Gods Elect, Christ is pretious indeed to you, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.7. <hi>Unto you therefore which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is pretious: But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the same is made the head of the corner:</hi> when to others a stumbling stone; even to
<pb facs="tcp:35607:10"/>
them that stumble at the word being diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient: Your Names are too many to be prefixed to this short Epistle, and besides in the matter of truth I like not to go to the Poll, as if truth needed a Muster-roll of names to carry the voice against such as are the opposers of it. It is enough that Christ hath a few names in <hi>Sardis,</hi> who have not defiled their Garments, and which shall walk with him in white, for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: It matters not how many the names of others in <hi>Sardis</hi> were, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, that have not defiled their Garments: and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.</hi> It is enough that wisdom is justified of her Children: When true Wisdom neither in <hi>John Baptist</hi> the forerunner, who was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than all the Prophets; nor in Christ the Head and Lord of them all, could have a testimony from an evil and adulterous Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Or if they had any thing like it for a time, they quickly recanted and recalled it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16— 19. <hi>But whereunto shall I liken this Generation?

                  </p>
                  <p>I have been greatly refreshed and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you all, by the grace of God, bringing Salvation to you, and which ye have not received in vain: But as ye have heard him and been taught of him, as the truth is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; this grace hath taught you ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and live soberly, righteously and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this present World, looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity and purifie unto himself a peculiar People zealous of good works: And am still comforted in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof. And that these poor labours of mine in the Ministry of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath had any effect upon your Souls, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in drawing you to Christ, or confirming or comforting you in Christ at any time, is and will be my rejoycing above all the esteem I have in your hearts, and all the help I have received from your hands by your Free, Kind, Liberal ministring to my necessities from time to time; and that
<pb facs="tcp:35607:11"/>
my temptation which was in the Flesh through these necessities and wants and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for Christs sake ye despised not, but received me and embraced me, (I will not say) as an Angel of God, or even as Christ Jesus; But one far greater than I can own my self to be: I can truly say I have rejoyced much more because of the Grace of God given to you, than in all the gifts to me; though I had need of them all, and do acknowledge them to be more and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than I am worthy of: But Christ is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, for whose sake only ye have counted me so, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.4. <hi>And whosoever will offend one of those little ones that believe in me, It is better for him, that a milstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the Sea.</hi> And though I put not your names to this my Book, for reasons above mentioned, yet I hope they are all of them in the Book of Life.

it is much due to you who have been my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low helpers in the Gospel, some of you for m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny years. And two things I have to say to you all and leave here upon record as the greatest testimony of my thankfulness, love and care to and for you in the Lord. Namely,</p>
                  <p>First, That you beware and take heed of of a loose conversation, and that ye use not your liberty at any time, or in any thing for an occasion to the Flesh, or to the World; <hi>For we are not debtors to the Flesh, to live after the Flesh; for if ye live after the Flesh ye shall die, but if ye by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live,</hi> Rom. 8.12, 13. And <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ye Adulterours and Adulteresses, Know ye not that the Friendship of the World is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God? Whosoever therefore will be the friend of the World is the enemy of God,</hi> 1 John 2.15. <hi>Love not the World, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the things that are in the World. If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> 16. <hi>For all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, and the Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World.</hi> 17. <hi>And the World passeth away and the Lusts thereof: But he that doth the will of God, abideth tfor ever.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:35607:12"/>
The power of Christ's Death is within you, therefore let your Old Man be crucified with Christ: That henceforth ye may not serve Sin; and let the World be crucified to you and you unto it, otherwise you cannot glory tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the cross of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World. For in Christ Jesus neither cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision availeth any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, but a new creature.</hi> You cannot be alive with Christ through Union with him; but you must be dead, and die conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually both to Sin and to the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. <hi>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That you shine as lights in the World, and be as the Sons and Daughters of God; without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation holding forth the word of Life, that I may rejoyce in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. <hi>Do all things without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and disputings: That ye may be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and harmless, the Sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine,</hi> (or shine ye)
<pb facs="tcp:35607:13"/>
                     <hi>as lights in the World: Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoyce in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</hi> And our Lord hath said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light so shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they may see your good works and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> If the time will come when ye shall shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Math 13.43. <hi>Then shall the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear let him hear.</hi> Surely ye should shine as lights more in this State of imperfection, and whilst you are in this World; and thereby show you are not of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Blessed are they, that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life; and to enter in through the Gates of the the City.</hi> 15. <hi>For without ar Dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and Murderers, Idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:35607:14"/>
every one of you; I do rejoyce in three things, Namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your Election of God known of us, and manifestly appearing in you by the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the spirit unto Obedience and sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ, as 1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledg of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ,</hi> and 2 Thes. 2.13, 14. <hi>But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and belief of the truth: Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your abiding in the Truth, and the Truth abiding in you, and that you stand fast both in the Faith and love of the Truth that you may be saved: When so many have departed from the Faith, giving heed to seduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirits, and are, (as is to be feared,) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to strong delusion to believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the Truth, but had pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: as, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.11, 12. Which sheweth the unction of the holy one to be in you, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20.21. <hi>But ye
<pb facs="tcp:35607:14"/>
have an unction from the holy One, and ye know all things: I have not written unto you, because ye know not the truth: But because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth</hi>; and again, v. 26, 27. <hi>These things have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto you, concerning them that seduce you: But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you: But, as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie: and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him,</hi> 28. <hi>And now, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, abide in him; that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</hi> And in this I do rejoyce, and will rejoyce in and over you all, your stedfast, abiding and walking in the Truth, when there are so many deserters, as 2 John 1. <hi>Whom I love in the truth: and not I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also all they that have known the truth, for the truth sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</hi> And 3 John 4. <hi>I have no greater joy than to hear that my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren walk in truth</hi>; and again, John 8.31, 32. <hi>Then said Jesus to those Jews which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Disciples indeed: And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb facs="tcp:35607:15"/>3. Your order in the Faith and fellowship of the Gospel as a Church, which appeareth in your professed and declared subjection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which Christ hath set in his Church, and that because it is Christs appointment, that so it should be, and his Spirit works in you, that willing and ready subjection and obedience, as a fruit of your Faith, upon which dependeth and followeth, that blessed Peace that ye now have, both in your own Consciences, and among your selves; it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of Christ, Isa. 9.7. <hi>Of the encrease of his government and of his peace there shall be no end; upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever:</hi> This belongs to the Kingly Office of Christ, to whom only it appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give and appoint Laws for his Church, and they must not appoint Laws for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; nor can Man, or any sort of Men in the World, appoint or give Laws to the Church of Christ, 'tis Christ prerogative Royal, and he alone sits and rains as King in <hi>Zion,</hi> as Ps. 2.6. <hi>Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</hi> Now this Government which Christ hath set in his Church, is by a Faithful and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Ministry, as Pastors and Teachers, freely chosen by the whole Church according

                  <p>THIS Text is an Epiphonema or closing speech, wherein the holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> gives us the just and right conclusion or result of the whole matter, with respect to Mans justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God, and doth Peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in the negative, that by the deeds or works of the Law, no flesh can or shall be justified in his sight, and brings it in with the illative note <hi>therefore,</hi> as the undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence and true result of his whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the two foregoing Chapters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35607:19"/>
he hath fully proved, as he saith, <hi>v.</hi> 9. of this chap. that Jews and Gentiles are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Gentiles he clearly proves in the first Chapter to be under Sin, in that when they <hi>knew God,</hi> or might have known him by the light of Nature in his works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did not glorifie him as God, but contrary to the light of nature, debased and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, <hi>into the Image of corruptible Man,</hi> v. 23, 24, 25. Had they but used their poor dim light of nature aright, to have paid some suitable Veneration to the glory of the Godhead, in worshiping of him, they might have escaped many vile affections and actions amongst themselves: For which they could not so much as pretend light or nature, and of the wickedness or danger whereof they could not so much as pretend ignorance but as a punishment of their impiety towards God, <hi>God gave them up to vile affections and unseemly actions amongst themselves,</hi> as v. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, And these Sins they not only committed against the light of nature but delighted in, though convicted in their own Conscience that the issue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of could be no less than eternal Death and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35607:19"/>
Damnation, as v. 32. <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So severely, but justly doth God punish wilful Idolatry and false worship, a Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first Table, by giving such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or People up to all manner of Sins, and most horrible lusts, and abominable practices, even against Human Nature to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: Nothing being more righteous and just, than that they who will not give unto God the glory of his own worship, should be given up of God to work their own Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Destruction, see 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Jews he as clearly proves to be under Sin in the second Chapter; For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they rested in the law and made their boast of God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. v. 17, 18, 19, 20. yet they transgressed that law, which they so much boasted of, and through transgressing thereof, dishonoured God and caused his name to be blasphemed amongst the Gentiles, as v. 21, 22, 23. And therefore the Jews as well as the Gentiles are left without excuse, and the mouth of them both equally stopped, being become guilty before God. The Gentiles by Sinning without law, yet against the light and law of Nature, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.32. &amp;c. The Jews by Sinning under the law, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35607:20"/>
whilst they judged the poor Gentiles, became more obnoxious and inexcusable themselves, in that they did the same or worse things, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. v. 11, 12. And therefore both Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin and Condemnation, and that by the law: The Gentiles by the light and law of nature, and the work of it written in their Hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. And the Jews by the law written in tables of Stone by Gods own hand, and given unto them by <hi>Moses</hi> at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which law was added by reason of Sin, and Sin in the Jews taking occasion by the commandment, became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly more Sinful in them who were Jews by nature, than in the Gentiles, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against more clear light and greater Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, than the poor Gentiles were indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with. And thus is fulfilled the design of God by <hi>Moses</hi> in giving the law, which was not that any Man should be justified and obtain righteousness and life thereby; but that the offence against it might so much the more abound and be made to appear. And Man be instructed from the desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his case and the utter impossibility ever to get righteousness and life by works and the law, to seek it only by Grace and Faith in Jesus Christ, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. This
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35607:20"/>
position being already proved, that Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. the Apostle doth further confirm by a text out of the old Testament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.— 19. where he concludes that quotation. Now we know that whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that the Jews must needs be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this charge as well as the Gentiles: And that the Prophets of the old Testament, did plainly declare and confirm this truth, that by the works of the law, no flesh should be justified: For both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Esaias,</hi> whose words these are, (if they would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood them) in saying, <hi>there is none righteous, no not one, there is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God; they are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no, not one,</hi> &amp;c. do both testifie from God by whose Spirit they speak; that in the sight of God all Men are Sinners and transgressors, by the law, both Jews and Gentiles, and that there is not one righteous Man by the works of the law, in the whole World. (for Jew and Gentile comprehended the whole world.) And if so, and this be true, that Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin, and that there is not one righteous Man by the works of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35607:21"/>
law in Gods sight, then it follows as a ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessary consequence, that by the works of the law there shall no flesh be justified. Therefore we conclude, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have done with the context.</p>
                  <p>In the text it self we have a great founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truth or point of Doctrin ready prepared to our Hand, in words which the Holy Ghost teacheth, together with the reason of it; And therefore we shall take the point, as it lieth in the Text, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That by the works of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in the sight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of this doctrin is expresly testified also, Psal. 143.2. <hi>For in thy sight shall no Man living be justified,</hi> i. e. by his own works and righteousness, for otherwise there were then, and are now many Men justified in Gods sight by the free Grace of God through Faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Knowing &amp;c.</hi> For the opening this position or point of Doctrin we shall take it into parts, and Enquire</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35607:21"/>In answer whereunto, (<hi>Flesh,</hi>) is sometimes taken in Scripture, for the Human Nature separate from the sinfulness thereof, so John 1.14. <hi>And the word was made flesh,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Flesh is here put for the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seperate from Sin as <hi>Adam</hi> had it in the state of innocency. And Christ the second <hi>Adam</hi> took it in the Womb of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. Through the vail, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Flesh, put for the whole Human Nature, which was a vail to his Godhead, and which he offered upon the Cross, for our Sins and so consecrated a new and living way for us into the Holiest, <hi>i. e.</hi> Heaven it self.</p>
                  <p>And though in propriety of Speech, the Flesh or Body is but a part of the Human Nature; the Spirit or Soul being the other and more noble part, yet is by a figure Synechdoche, put for the whole, as 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.24. where Christ is said, <hi>to have born our sins in his own</hi> (body) <hi>on the tree: Body</hi> is there put for the whole Human Nature, and so the Soul or Spirit is also sometimes put, as Isa. 53.10. <hi>When thou shalt make his Soul an offering for Sin</hi>; yet 'tis manifest both Soul and Body were offered for Sin, and the Soul of Christ is there put for both; but in this sense of the Human Nature separate from Sin, the word

Flesh is not to be understood in this Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Flesh is also, and indeed most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put for the Human Nature as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and depraved by Sin since the fall of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and so <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. where the law is said to <hi>become weak through the (Flesh,) i. e.</hi> Mans Nature now corrupted by Sin; and so not able to rise up unto that true and perfect holiness, which the law doth require.

                     </gap>? Shall no Flesh, (be justified?)</p>
                  <p>In answer hereto, 1. To be justified in the proper significancy and notion thereof is to be made righteous, to become righteous or to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35607:22"/>
stand righteous before God, <hi>justificari is justum fieri,</hi> to be justified, is to be made or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come righteous; and so to stand a righteous Person in Gods sight: It is a foreinsick term, and here is an allusion to courts of Judicature amongst Men, wherein the person arraigned, is in the issue of the Plea, either Condemned, <hi>i. e.</hi> found Guilty, and then we say such a Man is cast, that is, in his Plea; or else is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited and discharged, and so justified in the sight of the Court as an Innocent and righteous person, and so he is said to stand, as <hi>Psam</hi> 130.3. And therefore it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>in his sight,</hi> to shew, that whatsoever Man may be in his own sight, or in the sight of other Men like himself, yet in Gods sight no flesh shall or can be justified by the works of the law. And as in Condemnation there are two things, First, a fixing of the Guilt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we say, when a person is found guilty, he is condemned, so Rom. 3.19. <hi>That every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. A binding or Obligation unto the punishment, which is Death, and therefore we say of a Criminal when he is brought in guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he is a dead Man, because the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation unto punishment, is now fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35607:23"/>
him, and he must inevitably suffer death, which is the punishment due to his offence.</p>
                  <p>So on the other hand, there are two things implyed in Justification; first a just discharge and acquitment from the guilt of Sin; he that is justified is not guilty in Gods sight, his Sin is not imputed to him, and <hi>Ps.</hi> 32, 1, 2. where <hi>David</hi> describeth the blessedness of a justified person; saying, <hi>Blessed is he whose Transgression is forgiven, whose Sin is covered, unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. There is also a dissolving and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void, and null the Obligation unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; so that a justified person is no more in danger of that death which is the wages of Sin, nor of the curse of the law and the infinite and eternal wrath of God, which is the punishment due to Sin, to every Sin, the least Sin as well as the greatest; therefore as Condemnation is called <hi>Death,</hi> because of the Obligation unto punishment, so justification is called <hi>Life,</hi> because of the dissolving and making void that Obligation: So <hi>John</hi> 5.24 where the believer is said <hi>to be passed from death to life,</hi> i. e. from a state of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which is Death, to a state of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which is Life; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. It is called <hi>justification of Life.</hi> And upon that account 'tis Written, <hi>the just shall live by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35607:23"/>
Faith, i. e.</hi> be justified by Faith, for justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is his life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. But there is yet somewhat more imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this word <hi>Justified,</hi> and that is a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive righteousness answering to the perfection of the holy law of God in the utmost extent and demand of it; for though <hi>non</hi> imputation and pardon of Sin makes a Man no more a Sinner nor guilty before God, yet to make him a righteous person in Gods sight, there must of necessity be a positive righteousness; for as it cannot consist with the perfect justice of God, to justifie a Man without righteousness, so it cannot consist with his veracity and justice to justifie any Man without a perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, such as is commensurate and adequate to the perfection of his law, for otherwise the law should be made void even by faith it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. And to speak with holy reverence, as it is impossible for God to lie, so it is as impossible for him to be unjust, which he should be, should he justifie any Man by an imperfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; it is therefore a foolish, vain and wicked imagination in any person to think or affirm that a Man may be justified in Gods sight without a perfect righteousness; and this I may be bold to say from the clear light of Gods holy word, that he which hath not a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35607:24"/>

the Ceremonial law, neither could they; there being nothing in the light or law of nature, directing them to any such law; nor were the Gentiles under any Obligation unto that law; otherwise than as any of them were proseylites to the Jewish Church, neither could their Consciences either accuse or excuse them in observing or not observing the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial law, they could have no Conscience of Sin in that respect, for where no law is there is no Transgression: But the Moral law, <hi>they having the work of it written in their Hearts,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. did bind the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the very Gentiles, and did leave them without excuse before God, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. to the end of the Chap. So that it is the Moral law only by which every mouth is stopped and all the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> both Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile are become guilty before God. And therefore it is not the Ceremonial law only, but the Moral law principally of which the Apostle speaks when he saith as in the Text; by the works of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Argu.</hi> It is also as plain from the latter part of this Text, that it is the same law by which is the knowledg of Sin: For so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35607:26"/>
brings it in immediately and in one and the same breath; <hi>For by the law is the knowledg of Sin</hi>; therefore whilst the Aposte saith, by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, and then addeth, that by the law is the knowledg of Sin, it is plain, what law he meaneth: Namely, the same law by which is the knowledg of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Now the knowledg of Sin is not by the Ceremonial law; for though in the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law, there is an acknowledgment of Sin; in that all the sacrifices, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and typical services, did take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every Man attending the services of that law did (<hi>ipso facto</hi>), acknowledg himself a Sinner, or else to what end was his Sacrifice if he had no Sin to be purged? Yet the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial law neither did nor could convince the Conscience, and show a Man wherein he had Sinned; for this is the peculiar work of the moral law, and the light thereof shining in the Conscience, and so the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Nay, I had not known sin but by the law: For I had not known lust except the law had said, thou shalt not Covet</hi>: Now the law which saith thou shalt not covet, is not the Ceremonial law, but the moral law, as <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 20.17. And therefore the Text must be interpreted and understood, not of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35607:26"/>
law only but also and more especially of the moral law, for as much as by this law, is the knowledg of Sin, and by this law every mouth is stopped, and all the World become guilty before God. So that Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the sight of God is denied to Man not only by the deeds of the Ceremonial law, but also by the deeds of the moral law: And a Man can no more be justified now by good works, either Internal, or External, or both, done in obedience and conformity to the moral law, than the Jews then were by their observances of the Ceremonial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as it became Sin in the Jews, to seek justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and righteousness by the works of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial law, and moral law both, and the <hi>stumbling stone to their perdition and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. So it doth as much now become Sin to any Man under Heaven, to seek righteousness and justification by the works of the Moral law, as they are or can be performed by him, and if persisted in will prove <hi>the stumbling stone to his perdition,</hi> Gala. 5.2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Having thus done with the opening of the Doctrine, we proceed to the reasons of it, namely, to shew why by the deeds of the law no flesh can be justified in God's sight; and they are these two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:35607:27"/>First Reason; Because by the law is the the knowledg of Sin, and this is one reason subjoyned in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">

light, and felt the terrifying Power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law of God in my Conscience, <hi>then Sin revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, i. e.</hi> lift up it self, and made me find and feel my guilt and the condemning power and strength that Sin had over me by the law: <hi>For the strength of Sin is the law,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. <hi>And I died, i. e.</hi> As to all my hopes and confidence of being justified by the law and the works thereof, so that I became as a dead Man without any life or hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justified by it: And the Argument lieth plain, that law, by which every Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he is a Sinner and condemned as a guilty Person before God; by that law and the deeds of it can no Man be justified in the sight of God; for condemnation and justification, are as directly contrary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent each with other as life and death are; therefore by the deeds of the law, can no flesh be justified, because by the law all flesh is Condemned and found guilty before God; upon this account the Ministration of the law is called <hi>the Ministration of death and of Condemnation,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. and 9. <hi>v.</hi> And therefore cannot be the Ministration of life and justification: Now if there were any Man found since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that were not a Sinner and guilty by the law, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom by the law there could be no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35607:28"/>
or conviction of Sin, then such a Man might be justified by the deeds of the law, but forasmuch as there is no such Man in the World since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> there can no Man be justified by the deeds of the law in Gods sight.</p>
                  <p>Second Reason. Because by the deeds or works of the law, there is no Man righteous in Gods sight, it hath already bin shewed that it cannot consist with the perfect justice and veracity of God to justifie any Man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out righteousness and without a perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, commensurate to the Perfection, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Holiness of his law; but no Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> ever had or can have such a righteousness by the deeds of the law, as they are or can be done and performed by Man; therefore by the deeds of the law, can no Flesh be justified in his sight, as Gala. 3.21. <hi>Is the law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against the promises of God? God forbid, for if there had bin a law given which could have given life, verily, righteousness should have bin by the law.</hi> The Argument is plain, namely, that the law is not against the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, i. e.</hi> the free promise of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Grace through Faith in Jesus Christ, therefore the law cannot justifie, because if it could justifie any Man it would <hi>be against,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35607:28"/>
i. e.</hi> frustrate and make void the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of justification by Faith; for if a Man could be justified by the works of the law, there could be no need of the free promise of righteousness and justification by Faith; so that the promise is made void if righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be, or could be, by the law: And then it is added, <hi>If there had been a law given that could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law: if the law could have given life</hi> i. e. Justification, <hi>verily, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness should have been by the law</hi>; supposing and taking it for granted that if there had been a law that could have given Life and Justification, the same law should have given righteousness also, for without righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, there can be no Justification and Life to any Man in Gods sight. But there is no Man righteous or can be righteous in Gods sight by the deeds of the law, therefore no Man can be justified or have life thereby.</p>
                  <p>Now that there is no Man righteous or can be by the works of the law, is plain from the context, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10 — 19. Where the words of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Isaias,</hi> are quoted out of the Old Testament, that <hi>there is none Righteous, no, not one; there is none that doeth good, no, not one</hi>: Now, as at the 19. <hi>v. Whatsoever the law saith, it saith
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35607:29"/>
to them that are under the law,</hi> i. e. to the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that there is not in the whole World, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> one righteous Man by the deeds of the law, <hi>no, not one, no, not one that doth good, no, not one,</hi> i. e. according to that which the law doth require.</p>
                  <p>And this will more clearly appear by a just consideration of the obedience which the law doth require, in these Four particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The law doth require personal Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Holy and just commands there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And every Man is under Obligation to fulfil the law in his own Person, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>The Man which doth them shall live by them,</hi> and here is one essential difference betwixt the law of Faith, and the Law of works; that the law of Faith accepteth the Obedience of another, but the law of works requireth thee to obey and fulfil in thine own Person, and if thou failest of Personal performing and fulfilling, the law doth curse thee Personally, as it is written <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. The Law doth require perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in all things: So that if a Man keep the whole law and fail but in one point, <hi>he is guilty of all,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 2.10. and the least Sinful thought, or idle word, cuts off and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35607:29"/>
all a Mans hope of righteousness by the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now, forasmuch as there is no Man that ever did, or (since the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi>) ever can come up unto perfect Obedience in all things, which the Law doth require, so as not to fail in any one point: (For if such a Man were found, there should be found a just Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, that doth good and sinneth not. Yea, there would a Man be found that might say, I have not Sinned; which would be to make God a liar, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.20. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 10.) It is plain that <hi>there is none righteous, by the works of the law, no, not one; there is none that doth good, no, not one; i. e.</hi> as the Law doth require.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. The Law doth require perpetual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Perseverance, Persisting and Continuance in all things that are written in the law, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the law to do them</hi>: So that if a Man could perfectly keep and fulfil the whole law, so as not to fail in one point to his very dying Day; and yet at last though in the Moment of Death, should commit one Sin, or once fail in his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he hath lost all his righteousness; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35607:30"/>
is become a Sinner and Transgressor of the law in Gods sight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. The law doth require a Sinless Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the law doth suppose and require every Man to be such as <hi>Adam</hi> was, in the estate of Innocency; to have the same rectitude, and perfect integrity of Nature, that <hi>Adam</hi> had, which we call Original Righteousness, and is directly contrary to Original Sin: And the want of Original Righteousness, as well as least the tincture of Original Sin, is a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful defect of conformity to the law, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a Man uncapable of fulfilling the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness which the law doth require; so that by the law it is impossible for him that is once a Sinner, ever to become righteous by all that he can do or suffer afterward.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the want of Original righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as well as Original Sin, is a Sinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of conformity to the law is plain, Rom. 8. <hi>To be carnally minded is Death,</hi> and the reason is added, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>For the Carnal Mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against God, and is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be</hi>: That which we render the Carnal mind is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the minde of the flesh, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Mans Nature now corrupted by sin, and destitute of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal righteousness; this mind of the flesh <hi>is enmity egainst God, and is not subject to the law
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35607:30"/>
of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> so that it is impossible to a man in the carnal mind or mind of the flesh to be Obedient or subject to the law sincerely, and much more impossible to fulfil or keep the law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: And thence it is further inferred, v. 9. <hi>so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God</hi>: The person being Sinful, all his deeds and works are Sinful also, and neither his person nor his deeds or works can be pleasing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God by the law; and therefore it is written also <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>But without Faith it is impossible to please God</hi>; which it would not be if a Man could be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the works of the law and without Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> Faith in Christ; he might then please God by the works of the law, and and without Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now let all these particular Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be brought together into one; namely, that the law requireth personal, perfect and perpetual obedience continually, and that in all points, and doth also require a sinless Person; and it will easily appear that it is become absolutely impossible to every Man since <hi>Adam,</hi> (as it was also to <hi>Adam</hi> himself after the fall,) ever to become righteous by the works or deeds of the law: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as impossible for any Man to be justified
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35607:31"/>
in the sight of God by the works of the law, seeing he cannot by the works of the law be righteous; for this were to suppose that a Man might be justified without righteousness, which to suppose is a contradiction and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity. And thus having done with the Reasons of the Doctrine; namely, that by the deeds of the law, no Flesh shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Gods sight: We proceed next and further to enquire,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Why the infinitely wise and holy God, who created Man such an excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creature after his own Image, and put him under such an excellent law, so holy, just and good, should suffer this excellent creature, and this excellent law of his, (by the interposition of Sin) to be so frustrate and disappointed; that it is now become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for Man to be justified by the law and the deeds of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This must be resolved ultimately into the Sovereign will and pleasure of God, as our Lord Christ upon another occasion; <hi>Father, I thank thee Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and from the prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; Even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight</hi>; Mat. 11.25. A stupendious Mystery it was; And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35607:31"/>
can be resolved ultimately into nothing less than the Sovereign will of the blessed God and Creatour, who may do what he pleases; his own will being the most perfect Rule, and his own glory the highest and ultimate end of all his works. Certain it is, that the holy God could easily have prevented Sin, and have preserved his Creature Man under the Conduct of the pure and holy Law of his unto Eternal Life and Glory; but it seemed not good in his sight so to do; Knowing how to over-rule so great an evil as Sin, and the Transgression of his holy Law, to the further manifestation of his own greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the greater good of his own Elect: And therefore we further find by inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into this matter by the Light of the Holy Scriptures; That this so stupendious and mysterious a work of his Providence with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to man was necessary in order to the manifestation of his own greater glory and mans greater good, in five or six things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Namely first; That thereby he might take occasion through Sin and the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his Law to bring to light and give forth the manifestation of his Eternal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace both amongst Angels and Men before the World was; which was a Mystery
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35607:32"/>
hid in God, till the discovery and manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof now began to apppear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Amongst the Angels of Heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom Sin entred, and so great a number of them leaving their first habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were cast down to Hell, for their transgression; whilst a remnant of them were preserved and were confirmed of God in Christ, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10. Gods Election of Grace toward some became manifest, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and his severity towards the rest that Sinned, <hi>whom he spared not, but cast them down to Hell</hi>; and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. So that here is a difference and a discrimination made betwixt Angels and Angels, some cast down to Hell, others preserved and confirmed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And that which made the difference was, not any natural goodness, and excellency of Endowments in the one more than the other; but the free Grace and Election of God in Christ, preseverd and confirmed some, that they did not, that they should not Sin, whilst the rest sinned and were cast down to Hell: Hence the elect Angels on the one part, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.21. and the Angels that Sinned, on the other, divide the whole World of Angels. And as vast a difference and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is put betwixt the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, as betwixt Heaven and Hell; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35607:32"/>
Light and Darkness: Hence of the same lump of the Angelical Nature, are made <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> as 2 Cor. 11.14. and <hi>Angels of Darkness,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Angels of Heaven</hi> as Mat. 24.36. and <hi>Angels of Hell,</hi> as Mat. 25.41, <hi>the Holy Angels,</hi> as Mat. 25.31. And <hi>the wicked or Apostate Angels,</hi> as <hi>Jud.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. Amongst Men in this World, God took occasion by Sin and the trangression of his Holy law, to manifest his Election of Grace, even amongst Men on Earth, as he had already amongst Angels in Heaven. And now a difference is put betwixt the seed of the Woman; (namely, Christ as the head of this Election, and all the Elect amongst Men; whom <hi>the Father had chosen in Christ before the foundation of the World,</hi> Ephes. 1.4.2 Tim. 1.9. and <hi>whom the Father had given</hi> to Christ <hi>out of the Wold, John</hi> 17.9. These all are one in Christ by virtue of this Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are to be brought unto actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him in Grace here, and Glory hereafter. Christ the first Born, and they all brethren to him, and one to another in him, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.) And the seed of the Serpent on the one hand, that is, all the Children of the Devil or wicked One, who are now distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and made manifest by the admission
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35607:33"/>
and entrance of Sin, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9, 10. And as <hi>Sin took occasion by the law, for if there had been no law, there had been no Sin or transgression</hi>; so the Grace of God took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion by Sin, and by the transgression of the law, to manifest it self both amongst Angels and Men, to Gods greater Glory, and the greater good and glorious advantage of his Elect. Oh the depth both of the Wisdom and knowledg of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, <hi>and his ways past finding out</hi>! How hath the Election of Grace taken occasion by the Sin and misery of Mankind, to shew and manifest it self in glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all Mans sinfulness and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as well as over all Mans works and righteousness by the law, in over ruling the one, and excluding of the other; that the purpose of God according to Election, might stand not of works, but of him that calleth; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. and again, Rom. 11.7. <hi>The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection hath obtained it, and the rest were blnded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. That so he might make way for the coming of his Son Jesus Christ into the World; for his coming forth into and in the Human Nature, and being made, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in Flesh both to Angels and Men; This Mystery of Godliness, as the Apostle hath it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. (God manifested in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35607:33"/>
the Flesh,) had never been exhibited in the sight of Angels and Men, had not the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the law, and the utter inability in the law to give Man life and righteousness in Gods sight; first prepared and opened a way for it: had there been no Sin, there had need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Sacrifice; no need of God manifested in Flesh; could righteousness have been by the works of the law, there had been no need of a Christ, to take away Sin, to make an end of Sins, and to bring in everlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. And as the Apostle hath it, Gala. 2 21. <hi>If righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain.</hi> Christ coming in the Flesh, his being made of a Woman, made under the law, his being made a curse for us; yea, all that he did &amp; suffered for us in his life &amp; death; yea, his resurrection from the dead, his Ascension into Heaven, and his intercession for us there hath been altogether in vain, if Sin could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated and righteousness obtained by the deeds or works of the law: But Christ is not dead in vain, his coming into the World is not in vain: Now consider what a glorious work, the work of redemption is above all the works of Gods Creation, and above all the other works of his mighty, wise and holy providence, and be filled with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35607:34"/>
and wonder at the infinite wisdom, power and Grace of God in Christ, who hath thus over-ruled, so great an evil as Sin is; and the frustration of the hope of righteousness by the law for the manifestation of the riches of his glory, and Grace in his Son Christ Jesus, and the greater advancement and good of his own Elect, who are no losers by their disappointment and loss of the hope of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by the deeds of the law; having now obtained a better hope of a better and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er righteousness by Faith in Christ, than could have been obtained by the law, if they had never Sinned, and if they had fulfilled the righteousness of the law in themselves: Glory be to the triumphant Grace of God in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That so also just occasion might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the promulgation and making known amongst Men the everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; Now consider what a great blessing the Covenant of Grace is, above the Law and Covenant of works; which the Apostle saith, <hi>Had no glory in comparison of the new Covenant of Grace</hi> which so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>verses.</hi> And consider how the manifestation and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this better Covenant hath filled Heaven and Earth with a greater light and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35607:34"/>
manifestation of the Divine glory than any the World knew before or could ever have known without it, and you will fall <hi>Down and worship before the throne of God, and of the Lamb; saying, Blessing, Glory, and Praise be unto the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ</hi>; who hath thus blessed us with the blessings of such a Covenant: all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blessings, all Heavenly blessings, all Spiritual blessinngs in heavenly places in Christ; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3. This Covenant of Grace is called the New Covenant; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with respect to the promulgation of it; forasmuch as it was not promulgated till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall of Man, and the frustration and making void the law or old Covenant, as a Covenant of works, and utter incapacity of that Covenant to give Man righteousness and life by the deeds or works of it, as the Apostle argueth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. v. 7, 8, 11, 13. But the Covenant of Grace is also called the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with respect to the institution and establishment of it betwixt the Father and the Son, not only because it is to <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> and endureth for ever, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is from <hi>everlasting,</hi> and before all time, and is therefore said to be <hi>given us in Christ before the World was,</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35607:35"/>
promised before the world began</hi>; that this is the Covenant of Grace is plain, because it is that, upon which the hope of eternal life is builded, and it is called the promise, as it is often called in Scripture, as Gala. 4.28. Now we Brethren, as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, are the children of the promise, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the new Covenant, for this is the new Covenant, which is compared to that <hi>Jerusalem which is above, and is the Mother of all</hi> the children of God, as Gala. 4.22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Upon this account they are called <hi>heirs of the promise, i. e.</hi> of the new Covenant or Covenant of Grace, and not of the old Covenat or Covenant of Works, as Gala. 4.31. <hi>So then brethren, we are not children of the Bond-woman, but of the Free, i. e.</hi> not of the old Covenant, but of the new. Now of this promise, <hi>viz.</hi> this promise of God that cannot lie, it is said to have been before the world began, <hi>i. e.</hi> given us in Christ the Mediator of this Covenant, and unto whom this promise was given for us, before all time, before the World began, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Eternity. And if any shall enquire why then was the law or Covenant of works at all added and promulgated; The Answer is ready, as the Apostle, Gala. 3.19. <hi>It was added, because of transgression; i. e.</hi> that by the occasion of Sin and transgression of that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35607:35"/>
Covenant, Men might be prepared to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and embrace the Promise and Covenant of Grace, and so look unto the free Promise and Covenant of Grace in Christ for Life and Salvation, and so Rom. 5.20, 21. <hi>The law entred that sin might abound,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now as it was for the further manifestion of Gods greater glory, and for Mans great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good, that this new Covenant, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace should be declared, so it was necessary that Sin should first enter, in the transgression and frustration of the law as a Covenant of works, that a fit occasion, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might be offered for the declaring and making known this blessed Covenant, this new and everlasting Covenant of Grace. And thus by the disannulling and making void the old or first Covenant as a Covenant of works, which could not have bin without the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Sin, is way made for bringing in the Covenant of Grace!</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. That God might cut off all occasion of boasting from Man, <hi>and that no flesh might glory in his sight</hi>; had Man been justified by the works of the law, and his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, he should have had whereof to boast, as the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>For if</hi> Abraham <hi>were justified by works, he hath whereof to Glory; but not before God</hi>; Now therefore God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35607:36"/>
in his infinite wisdom hath ordered and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled things unto this issue, that <hi>by the work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the law no flesh should be justified in his sight, that so no flesh might glory in his sight,</hi> no, not one amongst the many Sons which are and shall be brought unto glory; that as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the father of the faithful, so none of the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> might have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to glory before God: God is very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his glory and will not have any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Heaven or Earth, to come in as a shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with him in that glory, whcih is his own peculiar, and appertaineth unto himself alone. And therefore hath so wisely disposed things in the aeconomy of Salvation, that Man being raised from the lowest degree and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byss of Sin and misery to the highest pitch and height of Grace and glory, should have nothing to boast of, nothing to glory in before him; but to cry, Grace, Grace unto this spiritual Workmanship and building of God by Jesus Christ even from the first <hi>foundation stone to the topstone thereof,</hi> as Zech. 4.7. <hi>So that now boasting is here for ever excluded and, glorying cut off from all flesh,</hi> as Rom. 3.27. <hi>Where is boasting then? It is excluded, by what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of Faith.</hi> The law of works, had it carried the glory of giving life and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35607:36"/>
righteousness to Man, could not have exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boasting, but had admitted boasting even amongst the Sons of glory; every person amongst them would have had something of his own to boast of; his own free will against Gods free Grace; his own works and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness against Gods free promise and Grace in Christ Jesus: But now by the law of Faith boasting is utterly and for ever excluded. And that this was Gods design is plain, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29, 30, 31. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. And thus, as Gods own glory is his highest end, (as in all his other works, so also in this great work of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith, and not by the works of the law,) so his own most Holy and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign will is the most perfect Rule in order to that end, as Eph. 1.11, 12. <hi>Who work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things after the counsel of his will, That we should be to the praise of his Glory.</hi> There is nothing more hateful to God than Pride. The Angels for Pride were cast down to Hell; <hi>God resisteth the proud, but giveth Grace to the humble</hi>; a proud professor is most hateful to God; for a professor to make himself his end in his Religious works and duties, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5, 6. and to make his own will his rule, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. is to make himself a God to himself: And is the highest contradiction to the Divine will, which is the most perfect rule of his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35607:37"/>
obedience, and to the Divine glory, which is his highest end; now therefore God hath so provided, that amongst all those that are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, (not by the works of the law, or their own righteousness, but by Faith in Jesus Christ,) no flesh should glory in his sight ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ascribing to his own free will in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Gods free Grace or in his own works and righteousness in opposition to the free promise <hi>and the righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It hath seemed good to the most wise and holy God, by the interposition of sin in the transgression of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the frustration thereof as to any possibility of giving Righteousness and Life to any man under the Heavens (under which all are concluded, and shut up) to order things unto this issue, that so occasion might be given to glorifie his justice in the punishing of sin, and to <hi>Reveal his wrath from Heaven against all ungodliness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of Men</hi>; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. Had there been no sin, there had been no wrath; and so no manifestation of Gods righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no revelation of his wrath from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against all unrighteousness of men upon this Earth. Now it was absolutely n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35607:37"/>
with respect to Gods greater glory, that as his mercy, grace and Love should be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested towards some; as hath been already shewed; so his just wrath and the power of it should also be made manifest against others who upon that occount are called Vessels of wrath and fitted to destruction; as others are called Vessels of mercy, and aforehand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto glory; as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23, <hi>v.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35607:38"/>
with the infinite wrath of God, and that for ever: <hi>For their worm dyeth not, and their fire is not quenched</hi>; as <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. Now such was the will, the sovereign will of God, that this warth of his, and the Power of this wrath should be manifested and shewed forth in the glory of it towards these Vessels of warth, what if God willing, <gap reason="foreign">

the falshood of this boasting and confidence; for this light, as they call it, is either true or false; if false and not warranted by the Holy Scriptures, then it is not light, but darkness; and as our Lord saith, Mat. 6.23. <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness?</hi> But we will suppose that this light which they speak of and affirm to be in every Man be true light in its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and degree; and if it be so, then at best it can be but the light of Gods Holy law, as the works of it is written in the Conscience of a Man: It can pretend no higher; and then no Man that can pretend to the highest degree of that light, and of obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, can possibly become righteous and be justified in the sight of God thereby: For then a Man might be justified by works of the law contrary to the clear light of the Holy Scriptures: But forasmuch as no Man shall or can be righteous and justified before God by the law and the deeds or works thereof in whatsoever manner or degree they can be performed by him: It is most clear, certain and plain, that no Man can be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the sight of God by the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor by all his obedience thereunto.</p>

person to be distitute of inherent Grace and Sanctification, as it is for a man living in the body to be so, without the Soul, <hi>James</hi> 2.26. Nevertheless Justification and Sanctification, Righteousness imputed and inherent, are distinct and different things, and must fall under a distinct consideration; and must not, cannot, be confounded; They differ as the cause and effect, as the antecedent and consequent: and though inherent Grace and Sanctification doth always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the person justified; yet inherent Grace and Sanctification is not that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by, or upon which any person is or can be justified in the sight of God: For inherent Grace and Sanctification is no more, can rise no higher than the writing of the Law in a mans heart, and so it is described and set out by God himself, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. Quoted out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts</hi>: The work of grace inherent, is but the writing of the Law in the heart; and all Sanctification and Holiness is but the outward expression of this Law internally written in the Heart: Now if a man could be justified in Gods sight by inherent Grace and Sanctification, he might be justified by the Deeds and Works of the Law; and that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35607:42"/>
by imperfect Deeds and Works too; for such is sanctification, but the imperfect writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law in the Heart; and such are all even the highest attainments of inherent righteousness and acts of new and holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Saints, but imperfect, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22, 23, 24, 25. Now forasmuch as <hi>No flesh can be justified in his sight by the Deeds of the Law</hi>; it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and followeth, by necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nsequence that no man can be justified by inherent sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and obedience; seeing all inherent Sanctification and Obedience is but the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law in the Heart, and the Deeds of that Law so written. And that which some men have imagined and endeavoured to maintain (that a believer is justified in the sight of God by Evangelical righteousness, <hi>i. e.</hi> his sincere obedience, or obedience of Faith: And that having obtained remission of sins through Faith in Christs blood, his Sincere or Evangelical obedience is accepted of God as if it were perfect) will plainly appear to be a false, and unsound assertion, and most contrary to the truth of the Gospel; for although both parts of this assertion be true in <hi>sensu divisio, i. e.</hi> in their different sense, and with respect to the different mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to which they do relate; yet in <hi>sensu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncto,</hi>

as they are confounded and referred to one and the same matter, they are utterly false and corrupt; as namely, That a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is justified by Evangelical righteousness is a blessed truth, if referred to the right subject and matter of justifying righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which the Gospel doth reveal: But this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness then is no other than the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the personal and perfect obedience and righteousness, which Christ who is God Man hath performed for us, and in our stead as the Second <hi>Adam</hi> and Head of the whole Church of the Elect; And is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, <hi>The righteousness of God,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to all a mans own or inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. And that this is the only Evangelical righteousness, <hi>i. e.</hi> that only Righteousness which the Gospel doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal. For Justification is clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto Salvation to every one that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek: For therein is the righteousness of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Faith to Faith; as it is written, the just shall Live by Faith, i. e.</hi> not in his own, but in the righteousness or another; which is Jesus Christ: <hi>Who is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. But if you will understand Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical

righteousness of, and refer it to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace and sanctification, then it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly false; for then a man is justified by the Law and the Deeds of it; Seeing inherent Grace and Sanctification is no other as hath been already shewed, And again, as to the other part of this Assertion, namely, that God doth accept the sincere Obedience of a Believer as if it were perfect; is also a blessed truth, if you refer it to Sanctification only; but if you refer it to Justification, it is utterly false: for no Righteousness of Man is or can be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God as the matter of his Justification in his sight, as hath been already proved; for that were for a Man to be justified by the Works of the Law, or his own Righteousness, which is contrary to the Scriptures: Now therefore, the sum of the matter is; that no Righteousness can be mentioned or accepted of God in Justification, but the Righteousness of Christ only; and although Inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, namely, Sanctification of Heart, and Holiness of Life in a Believer is accepted of God through Christ, as if it were perfect; yet 'tis so accepted as the truth and matter of his Sanctification, but not as the matter of his Justification, wherein none but Christ and his Righteousness can or ought to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35607:58"/>
external obedience; no, no, this is abominable; this the Apostle abhors in himself, and deters all others from: But on the other hand, to trust alone unto Christ, and rely and depend upon the perfect Righteousness of Christ, which is the Righteousness of God, and is made ours by Faith, and not by Works; this is to rejoyce in Christ Jesus; but to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in our own Righteousness; this is to have confidence in the flesh: And there are two reasons why all a mans own Righteousness is called <hi>flesh</hi>; 1. Because it is weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear the weight of mans hope and confidence as touching his being righteous thereby, or justified before God; and thus the Horses of the Egyptians are said to be flesh, not spirit, because of their weakness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to answer the sinful trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which the Jews had in them; <hi>Isa.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 3. And 2. Because it is polluted, sinful and unclean by the infirmity and imperfection of grace in the best, and by the mixtures of sin and corruption that attend us in our best Duties; as <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>But we are all as an unclean thing, and our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags,</hi> and therefore not to be trusted in and relied upon when we come before, and have to do with God. Now therefore, ye that are in Christ, and desire to rejoyce in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35607:59"/>
Christ Jesus, have; <hi>see that ye have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the flesh: covet earnestly the best gifts</hi>; strive after the highest attainments of inherent grace and holiness, but trust not to, put no confidence in your own Works and Righteousness; for by the Works of the Law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And last of all; See that ye worship God in the Spirit; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. <hi>For we are the true Circumcision which worship God in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the flesh</hi>: So that to your rejoycing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh, you must add this also; To <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in the spirit.</hi> Now to worship God in the spirit implieth these three things; namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To Worship God in the Spirit, is to Worship God in Christ; those of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision spoken of in the beginning of <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Who trusted to Circumcision and the Works of the Law,</hi> or their own Righteousness, Worshipped God in the Deeds and Works of the Law, which the Apostle here calls Flesh; and so they Worshipped God not in the Spirit, but in the Flesh: They rested in their own Deeds and Works, and looked not to Christ Jesus who was the End, Perfection, and Substance of the Ceremonial Law. And
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35607:59"/>
so indeed their Worship terminated in their own Righteousness, and they did not by Faith go out of themselves unto Christ and his Righteousness; and so they did not Worship God in the Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and by Faith in Christ; but legally and presuming upon their own Merit and Worthiness without Christ; and so all their Worshipping was Carnal and in the Flesh, after the Old Covenant and Works; but not Spiritual and Evangelical, <hi>i. e.</hi> after the New Covenant and Grace. To Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God therefore in Christ, and by Faith in him as your only Righteousness, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to come unto the Father by the Son; this is indeed to Worship him in the Spirit relying upon his Mediation, Merit, Blood, and Righteousness as the Mediator of the New Covenant, and not upon the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Works.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Worship God in the Spirit, is to Worship him sincerely and with a true heart; and thus to Worship God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is to Worship him in truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4 23, 24. <hi>But the hour cometh and now is, when the true Worshippers shall Worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father seeketh such to Worship him: God is a Spirit, and they that Worship him, must Worship him in

with pure water, by the Blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ, before any Man can worship God in Spirit and in Truth; and I do, and dare too affirm it from the Word of God, that there is not a true and spiritual Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of God in all the World, but such as are so inwardly sprinkled and washed with the Blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; all others do worship God carnally and hypocritically, not in Spirit, and in Truth, not sincerely and inwardly: Oh therefore, you that are in Christ, see, look to it, that you worship God in the Spirit, and in Truth, for else there is none in all the World to do it.</p>

                  <p>We shall begin with the first of these Namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:35607:64"/>Doct. I. <hi>That the Righteousness which is by Faith of Jesus Christ unto all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, is the Righteousness of God</hi>; for so the Apostle calls it in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The Righteousness of God</hi>: And again <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Even the Righteousness of God</hi>; and it is not in vain and without special reason, that this Character is repeated and inculcated again and again in the Text, as also in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for herein lieth one Essential difference and characteristical distinction betwixt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Righteousnesses that can be pretended to amongst Men, and this Righteousness, which is by Faith, namely, that this Righteousness only and above all others by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is the Righteousness of God.</p>
                  <p>And this will appear and be made plain in these four general Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that God alone is the Author of this Righteousness; and as he is the Father of Lights from whom <hi>every good gift and every perfect gift comes, and in whom is no variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness nor shadow of turning; Jam.</hi> 1.17. So this good gift, this perfect gift of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, cometh down from above, from him who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights: And God is the Author of this Righteousness in a special and peculiar way. Indeed as all things of the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35607:65"/>
are of God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> so all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness amongst Angels and amongst Men is of God, and he is the Author and given thereof: The Righteousness that is found in the Elect Angels, who obey his Word, and do his Will, whatever it is, is of God, and he is the Author thereof; for he planted that rectitude and integrity at first in the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Nature, and he hath preserved the same in the Elect Angels that sinned not, and them in it, of his own Will: And if there be any Righteousness to be found amongst Men, it is still of God, and he is the Author of it. The Original Righteousness that was found in the first <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, was of God as the Author of it; for God made him after his own Image, and planted that Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, Rectitude and Integrity in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, conformable to that holy and righteous Law under which God put him: And if there be found in Faln Man any thing that may be called Righteousness amongst Men, as namely, that which Men call Moral Righteousness, it is certainly of God, and God is the Author of it, as it sheweth forth the work of his Law written at first in their hearts, though now to be found only in the broken remains of it: So that all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Angelical and Moral, that is found
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35607:65"/>
amongst Angels or Men, is of God, and God is the Author of it, as it is a part of his first Creation; for he made all things very good; <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. and Man expresly, after his own Image; <hi>verse</hi> 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>But this Righteousness which is by Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, is of God after another manner, and God is the Author of it in a more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and peculiar way, and by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy above all that is called Righteousness amongst Angels or Men besides this; for this Righteousness is of God, and he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, as it is indeed the foundation of his new Creation, and the whole Fabrick and Building of the new Creation is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and look as God's new Creation of Grace in and by his Son Jesus Christ, is a more excellent Workmanship than that of his old Creation, and God is the Author of the new Creature in a more especial manner; so also is God the Author of this Righteousness; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new Creature; old things are passed away, behold all things are become new; and as old things are passed away, and all things are become new</hi>; so particularly the old Covenant and old Righteousness by the Deeds and Works of the Law is passed away,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35607:66"/>
and a new Covenant and a new Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness brought in, not of Works, but of Grace; not by the Deeds of the Law, but by Faith in Jesus Christ; <hi>and all things are of God</hi>; as <hi>verse</hi> 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> all things of this new Creation, and so this Righteousness which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, is of God in a new and more peculiar and glorious way, under a new head, <hi>i. e.</hi> not <hi>Adam,</hi> but Jesus Christ, and by a new Covenant, not of Works, but of Grace; and by a new Birth, not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; not of the Will of Man, but of God; <hi>Job.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 31. And so this Righteousness is called by a new Name, <hi>The Righteousness of God</hi>; as God is the Author of it, and hath created it, and brought it forth after a more peculiar manner; and this will appear more plainly in the consideration of these three particulars; namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Particular. First, In that God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely free and soveraign Grace hath in and through his Son Jesus Christ, designed and conferred this Righteousness upon us by Faith in his Son. I say, God of his free Grace hath conferred this Righteousness by Faith upon the Heirs of Salvation, and that from all eternity the purpose and counsel of his Grace designed and conferred this Righteousness by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35607:66"/>
his Son before the World was; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>But according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ before the World began: But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and life to light through the Gospel:</hi> What is that which is made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, but this Righteousness of God? as in the Text, But now the Righteousness of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested: Now by this Righteousness of God is death abolished, and immortality and life brought to light through the Gospel. Now whence is this Righteousness of God, and so immortality and life brought to light? was it from, or according to Works? no, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; so that it was not our Works, but God's free purpose and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grace which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and conferred this Righteousness; and if you will know when this purpose and grace, or this purpose of grace in God moved him hereunto; it was from all eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began; and this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, is not a Righteousness of Work or by Works, but a Righteousness of Grace, given us in Christ, not as a reward of Works
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35607:67"/>
and of Debt, but as a gift of free and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace; and so it is called; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Much more they which receive abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace, and of the Gift of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and all that are justified by this Righteousness, which is by Faith in Christ, are said to be justified freely; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24 <hi>Being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</hi> And it is very much to be considered, that Mans Works are always excluded, and the Grace of God, and the Gift of Righteousness mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and mentioned in the business of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. And for as much as this purpose and grace, or this gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Righteousness by Faith was given us in Christ before the World began, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that Man not having then a Being, or having done good or evil, not Mans Works or Worthiness, but Gods own free Grace and Goodness moved him to confer and bestow this gift of Righteousness; as the Apostle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth concerning <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob; Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>For the Children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to Election might stand; not of Works, but of him that calleth</hi>: So that this Righteousness which is by Faith of Jesus Christ, is the Righteousness of God,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35607:67"/>
as his Grace, his free and soveraign Grace in Christ hath created, designed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and freely conferred the same on all them that believe: And thus no other Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but this of Christs only, is or can be called the Righteousness of God, because whatever other use there may be of other Righteousnessess, either Original<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Legal or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral amongst men in this World, yet certain it is that this Righteousness only was designed and conferred as the Gift of God's free Grace in Christ, as that wherein only Man can be be justified in his sight.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Particular. This is the Righteousness of God, as his Infinite Wisdom alone hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and found it out: For considering the case of Man now faln under sin by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the first Covenant, and the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and every individual person of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind comprehended in him, were now become sinners, and had lost all hope and possibility of Righteousness by the Law; it was above the reach and understanding of all created Wisdom; and would have put to a non-plus all the Wisdom of Men and Angels, to have found out a way, how Man, that had lost his own Righteousness, and all hope of it by the Law, could ever become righteous again, and be justified in the sight of God; and that God
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35607:68"/>
might be just in justifying Man that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. Instance. The Infinite and Eternal Power of God, was also as much seen and manifested in Christ, bearing our sins in this Humane Nature, in his own Body on the Tree: and first let us consider what a burden, what a weight sin and the guilt of sin is, when it is charged and laid upon the Conscience by the Power of God; and this may be considered in the Angels that sinned; Angels are greater in power than we, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Angels that excel in strength,</hi> or Psal. 103.20. <hi>Angels, who are Spirits,</hi> i. e. not flesh and blood as we are, weak and feeble; Angels that are not hay and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as we are, but a flaming Fire, <hi>Psalm</hi> 104 4 yet these high and mighty Angel, these strong and powerful Angels, that were natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the first-born of Gods first or old Creation, and the excellency of Creature strength, when they had once sinned, and God comes to charge them with Folly, and lay the guilt and punishment of sin upon them, how doth it sink and break all the Powers and Spirits

of the Angelical Nature; and casteth them down into the deepest darkness and despair, and that from the highest light, glory and confidence of their First and Heavenly state, and presently cast them down from Heaven to Hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. so unable were they each of them to bear the burden, <hi>i. e.</hi> the guilt and punishment of their own Sin.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Let us consider sin in man, and how unable man is to stand when God shall mark Iniquity, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3. <hi>If thou Lord shouldst mark Iniquities, O Lord who shall stand? i. e.</hi> none shall or can stand, no Nation or Kingdom, no House or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no Person under Heaven, no not the Church or People of God can stand; if God should mark Iniquity, and punish Sin but with his Temporal Wrath and Judgments in this World, there is none could possibly stand, for <hi>who can stand when God is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry? And who knoweth the power of his Wrath?</hi> The Sinners of the old World did know something of it, but they could not stand before it, it swept them all away with the Waters of a Flood; And whither did it sweep them? It swept them down to Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. <hi>The Spirits now in Prison</hi>; and that Prison is the Prison of Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. <hi>And in Hell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:35607:73"/>The Sinners also of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> did know somewhat of this Wrath: but they could not stand before it; They could no longer (as stout and hard hearted as they were) bear up under this burden and weight of their own Sin, for it brought a dreadful shower of Divine Vengeance upon them; a Shower of Fire and Brimstone from the Lord out of Heaven, by which they all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24, 25. <hi>Francis Spira</hi> also knew somewhat of this Wrath, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his own Sin, when God laid it upon his Conscience, in the guilt and punishment due to it, but he could not stand, but went despairing out of this World, and without any hope or comfort as to the next, as to what did appear.</p>
                  <p>And it may be some of you here present, and if you have not, I am sure others have known something of this matter, when God hath been angry but for a moment; and hath laid sin in the guilt of it, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; It made them sink immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der utmost despair, and bereaved them of all hope, comfort and patience, that had not Infinite Mercy stept in to their relief, they had gone despairing down to Hell.</p>
                  <p>The damned Spirits in Hell know more of the Power of Gods anger, and the weight

and burden of Sin laid upon their awakened and terrified Consciences, than any in this World have done or can do, and their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are intollerable, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24. <hi>There the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched</hi>; They are for their sin, a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Divine Wrath, and they are salted with Fire, and salted with Salt, and so are eternally Roasting in the Fire of Hell, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.48, 49. and yet they do not know all the Power of Gods Wrath, nor feel all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Power of the Fire of Hell: they feel much and fear more; They suffer that which is intollerable, and yet they fear what they have not yet felt: but must further feel and suffer to all Eternity. Oh Eternity! Eternity! Oh the Wrath of God, that is not only eternal, but infinite! They know not the utmost, they know not the end of it, nor can know! For that which is Infinite, hath no bounds or limits; and that which is Eternal hath no end.</p>
                  <p>Therefore last of all, Now consider this second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Man Christ Jesus, who though he had no sin of his own, to answer to God for, for he did no sin, <hi>nor was guile found in his Mouth,</hi> Isa. 53.9. <hi>He knew no sin,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. yet he had the sin of the World, <hi>i. e.</hi> Jew and Gentile laid upon

The Lamb of God which taketh away or beareth the sin of the World; For he did take away sin by his bearing of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> both the guilt of it, and the punishment due to it: for thus was the Iniquity and Sin of all God's Elect laid upon him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>And Jehovah hath laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Iniquity of us all</hi>; Now therefore the Sin of the World being laid upon him to bear, what an infinite burden and weight was it? and how impossible for created strength whether Angelical or Humane to bear; as hath been shewed. And yet that this one man, this second <hi>Adam</hi> should bear such an infinite weight as Sin and the Wrath of God due to sin is; what a wonder of Divine Power was manifested therein? The strength of Angels could not, the strength of Man could not bear such a Burthen and Weight, as ye have heard; yet they had but their own sin charged upon them, but here is a Man, the Son of Man, the Man Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the Lamb of God, that beareth and taketh away, by bearing, the Sin of the World; oh admirable and wonderful Power of the God-head; by which this man was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to bear such an infinite and eternal weight as Sin and the Wrath of God due to

Sin is; And therefore 'tis said of him, that by <hi>the eternal Spirit he offered himself to God for us, Heb.</hi> 9.14. for nothing less than the Power of the Godhead it self, could have enabled the humane nature to bear such an infinite Weight and Burthen, as Sin is, even the Sin of the whole World, and the whole, and compleat Wrath of God due unto it; The Flesh or Humane Nature was but a Vail to his Godhead, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.20. but the Eternal Power and Godhead within this Vail, was that which enabled this second <hi>Adam,</hi> this man to bear the Sin of many: oh therefore behold with wonder and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration the working of Divine Power in bringing forth such a Man into the World, and also in strengthening this Flesh and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, to bear that which no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Heaven or Earth could, neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels nor Men.</p>

what a manifestation there was of the mighty Power of God in the raising of this Man from the Dead, unto which he was delivered for our Offences: See how the Apostle doth set it out, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>According to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thereby is this Righteousness visibly declared and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the sight of Angels and Men, being crowned, and in the most solemn manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at his inauguration or being received up into glory, which was the ultimate and finishing Testimony and Witness from the Father that he is righteous; and as such, and upon that account he sits in Heaven; as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We have an Advocate with the

Father, Jesus Christ the righteous</hi>; and <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Of Righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more</hi>: So that Christs going to the Father, and sitting down in the heavenly places, so as to abide there in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Advocateship, and as Intercessor for us with the Father, is the highest evidence and demonstration of this Righteousness beyond all contradiction; and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Argument 'tis said the Holy Ghost shall reprove or convince the World of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, <hi>i. e.</hi> this Righteousness of Christ; because, saith he, I go to my Father; for he went as a publick person and second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Head of the Church, and there is set down, in our Nature, and in our stead, as he that hath wrought out for us, and brought in to us perfect and everlasting Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in whom, as such, all the Seed of Gods <hi>Israel</hi> shall be justified and glory, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.25. Now that this Exaltation of Christ, and the setting of him down at the right hand of God in the heavenly places, is a wonderful and glorious work of Divine Power; see <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21. <hi>According to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</hi> Now consider this work of Divine
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35607:77"/>
Power, and it will appear admirable; for God to take this Creature Man, made by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lower than the Angels, a Creature of the Earth, earthy; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.5. <hi>For thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels</hi>; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The first man is of the earth, earthy:</hi> Now I say, to take this Nature, and to advance it to Heaven, and to set it above Angels, both in its Union with the Godhead in the Person of the Son, and in its Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Authority and Power over all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven, and over all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth, and under the Earth; as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. <hi>far above all principality, and power, and might, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and every name that is named, not only in this World, but also in that which is to come</hi>; and thus to put all things under his feet; as <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>And hath put all things under his feet.</hi> This I say is such a work of glorious power, as fills Heaven and Earth now, and will fill Eternity hereafter with wonder and admiration: But then consider again, that this Creature Man was now faln under sin, the Curse of the Law, and the Wrath of God; stript of its Original Righteousness, which it was created in conformable to the Law of God, and utterly uncapable of Righteousness by the Law and the Works thereof, and so

separate from the Actual Union which he had with God his Creator, and set by sin at an infinite and eternal distance from God as to what this Creature Man could now do; and for God to take this Creature Man, and by a new Creation of it in Christ, to make all new, to purge and separate it from sin, take it into Union with the Godhead it self in the Person of his own Son, raise it from under sin and guilt, cloath it with perfect and everlasting Righteousness, and receive it up into glory above the highest Angels in Heaven: Oh what a work of divine and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Power was this! beyond whatever was seen in the Works of the old Creation, or in all the Works of Providence from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But then again fifthly, What a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation is there of the Power of God, and the working of it towards all them that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in order to the making of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this Righteousness of God by Faith in Christ; Divine Power hath not done in bringing forth and accomplishing this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness by Christ for us. But there is a further work of the mighty power of God required and manifested in applying this Righteousness to us, and working that Faith in us by which alone this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35607:78"/>
of God is made ours, and we are made partakers of it unto Justification of Life: For this Righteousness of God is unto all, and upon all them that Believe; and as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>For with the Heart man believeth unto Righteousness:</hi> Now this Faith is not a work of a mans own Heart, nor is it of a mans self to believe in Jesus Christ unto Righteousness: No, no, this Faith is not of our selves; <hi>It is the gift of God,</hi> Ephes. 2.8. And as this Faith is the gift of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, or the Grace of God in Christ to us, so it is also the work of his mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which worketh in us; and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the work of Faith with power, as well as the good pleasure of his will, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.11. <hi>And ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all the good pleasure of his will, and the work of Faith with Power.</hi> And without the mighty power of God put forth upon a mans Heart in the hearing of the Word; there is not one man in the whole World that would or could believe in Jesus Christ unto Righteousness, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed</hi>? The Arm of the Lord is his Power, his Mighty Power, and unless the Arm, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Mighty Power of <hi>Jehovah</hi> be revealed or manifested in the Heart of a man; he doth not, he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

the report which the Holy Prophets gave Christ; <hi>Who testified before hand the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, and the glory that should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>; 1 Pet. 1.11. And this I may say from the word of God, there are no more men in the World that have believed this report; than there are persons in whom this Arm of the Lord hath been revealed. Now that there is a Mighty Power of God put forth upon them that believe: See <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. <hi>And what is the exceeding greatness of his Power to us-ward who believe; according to the working of his Mighty Power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead, and set him at his own Right hand in the Heavenly places!</hi> Now look what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation there was of the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Power in raising Christ from the dead, and setting of him at his own Right hand in the heavenly places; (as hath been shewed) the same manifestation of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the exceeding greatness of his Power; and the Energy or working of it, is to be seen in &amp; towards all them that believe: For indeed no less Power can be sufficient to raise a Dead Soul from Death to Life, than to raise a Dead Body from the Grave; <hi>i. e.</hi> no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er less than the Infinite, no Power less than the Mighty Power of God; and therefore

it is so exprest <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: The superlative or exceeding greatness of his Power, and according to that which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the Dead: For no less instance and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Divine Power, and the working of it could reach and set out the working of this Power in and towards all them that believe; than this of its working in the raising of Christ from the Dead. And indeed to raise a man from the Death of Sin and Unbelief, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all are shut up as in the Grave, <hi>Rom,</hi> 11.32.) is no less a manifestation of Divine Power, than was the raising of Christ from the Dead: And when this comes to be fully known and understood by the Saints, it will fill them with deep wonder and admiration to all Eternity; as 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1, 10. <hi>When he,</hi> i. e. Christ <hi>shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe; because our testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was believed among you in that day.</hi> So that it will be the matter of admiration to the Saints themselves when they come to the perfect knowledge of this Power of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: That ever the testimony given concerning Christ by the Prophets first and the Apostles afterward; the Prophetical and Apostolical Testimony: Our Testimony
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35607:79"/>
was believed among you. And thus you see the mighty Power of God which wrought in Christ in performing and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Righteousness for us; and also as it works in us that believe; that by Faith in Christ we might partake of this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God. Now therefore it appeareth that God is the Author of this Righteousness as his Infinite Free Grace in Christ hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed and conferred it; his Infinite Wisdom hath contrived, and his Infinite and Eternal Power hath performed and wrought it out in Christ for us, and in bringing down this Righteousness by Faith in Christ to us. And so much may suffice to have been spoken to the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> General Head: Namely, That God is the Author of this Righteousness in a special and peculiar manner, as it is his work of the new Creation, and is therefore called the Righteousness of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Head. And secondly, it is called the Righteousness of God, because it is the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the glorious and wonderful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Christ Jesus, who is God Man, and whose name alone is <hi>Emanuel, i. e.</hi> God with us, or in our Nature; this glorious Person, whose name is Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, and yet is the Son of Man, the Child
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:35607:80"/>
born to us, and given to us; <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. was brought forth in our Nature and in our stead, to bring in everlasting Righteousness, as hath already in part, and shall be more fully shewed in its proper place; and he hath done it, he hath finished the work that the Father gave him to do; <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. and therein he glorified the Father; and the Lord is well pleased for his Righteousness sake: Now this Obedience which he hath performed to the Law for us, both in that part of it which we call Passive, and also in that part which we call Active, makes up to us and for us this everlasting Righteousness; and therefore this Righteousness which he in his Person wrought out for us, is called the Righteousness of God, because it is the Righteousness of that Person who is both God and Man in two distinct Natures, &amp; one Person for ever; &amp; hence it is that in this wonderful Person, what is more properly appertaining to one Nature, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ascribed to the other; as <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>To feed the Church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased with his own Blood.</hi> Here the Blood of Christ is called the Blood of God, though in propriety of speech it was the Blood of Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Humane Nature; for the Godhead is impassible, and cannot suffer, but by reason of the Union of the two Natures in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35607:80"/>
that suffered, it is called the Blood of God; even so the whole and compleat Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ both in his Active and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience, though properly it was not the Divine Nature that obeyed and fulfilled all the Righteousness which the Law required, but the Humane Nature, which was made of a Woman, and made under the Law; yet the Person who thus obeyed and fulfilled all Righteousness for us, being God and Man, his Righteousness, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e performed to the Law for us in the Humane Nature, is called the Righteousness of God; as in the Text; but now the Righteousness of God; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>have not submitted themselves to the Righteousness of God</hi>; and then it is added; <hi>for Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth</hi>: So that this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God, which the unbelieving Jews submitted not themselves unto, is plainly the Righteousness of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> of that glorious Person who is God-Man, or God in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us; and so an infinite dignity and merit is found in this Obedience, this Righteousness of Christ from the glory and dignity of his Person; and herein is also another part, and that no small part of the Mystery of Godliness; that as God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Flesh or Humane Natrue; so God,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35607:81"/>
thus manifested in the Flesh, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Humane Nature, should (being thereby made under the Law) become obedient, and fulfil all the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law for us; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is also this Righteousness of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, as the Person that performed it was God manifested in the Flesh, or Humane Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Head. And then thirdly; This Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is also called the Righteousness of God in opposition to all Righteousness of Man, either of the first Man <hi>Adam,</hi> or of all other men in the World pretending to a Righteousness of their own, and by the Works or Deeds of the Law, as they are or can be performed by them: And as it hath been shewed, the Holy Ghost casteth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon Man, when he calls him flesh; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>There shall no flesh be justified in his sight, i. e.</hi> by the Deeds of the Law, or his own Righteousness; and also casteth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon all a Mans own Righteousness and Works, in that he calls them flesh; and the putting confidence therein, to be putting confidence in the flesh; as <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4. So the Holy Ghost doth put a glory upon this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ, when he calleth it the Righteousness of God, and the putting trust and confidence therein, our rejoycing in Christ Jesus; and so this Righteousness which is by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35607:81"/>
the Faith of Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, is the Righteousness of God in opposition to all Righteousness of Man, or a Mans own Righteousness. And as the Apostle speaketh of the true, <hi>i. e.</hi> the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Tabernacle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. which the Lord pitched and not Man; so he speaketh of this Righteousness, which <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath provided in his Son Christ for us, and not Man; and therefore is Christ called, <hi>Jehovah our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, c.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Not <hi>Adam</hi> our Righteousness, or a Man our Righteousness, but <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the Lord our Righteousness; and so it is frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the holy Scriptures, the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, in opposition to, and contempt of that Righteousness which is of Man, or which is our own Righteousness; so <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods Righteousness, and going about to establish their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, have not submitted themselves to the Righteousness of God.</hi> Here is Gods Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness mentioned again and again in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own Righteousness! And so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Not having on mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, but the Righteousness which is of God</hi>: Where the Apostle calleth it Gods Righteousness, in opposition unto, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that which is or may be supposed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35607:82"/>
or pretended to be his own Righteousness.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Head. And then Fourthly; It is called the Righteousness of God, as it is that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which only is and can be accepted of God in the matter of our Justification, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Righteousness by which, and upon the account whereof only a man may be Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and Justified in his sight: For there is no other Righteousness by which a man may or can possibly be Justified in the sight of God: Or that God accepts of, and is well pleased with, but this as the matter of our Justification, as hath been already proved; So that this only is the Righteousness of God, as his Heart doth rest in it, is well pleased with it, and doth always accept it by Faith in his Son Jesus Christ; and is not, nor can be well-pleased without it: And as a broken Heart is called the Sacrifice of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; a broken and a contrite Heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</hi> Properly or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Speech, a broken Heart or Spirit is no Sacrifice; but it was that God expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Sacrifices which the People offered according to Gods appointment: For the Sacrifices for Sin were always slain, and so were offered up to God by Death, and shedding of their Blood. The Holy Ghost
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:35607:82"/>
hereby signifying, that as the wages of Sin is Death; so every person that sacrificed and brought his offering for Sin, did deserve Death. And therefore, though this Death was transferred and laid upon the Sacrifices, which Typically did look unto Christ; and so required Faith in Christ, the Lamb or Sacrifice of God, <hi>Which taketh away the Sin of the World</hi>; as <hi>John</hi> 1.29. Yet the very Nature and Import of all the Sacrifices did plainly declare and imply, that Sin was a bitter and a very evil thing that could not be expiated with less than Death: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever did present his Sacrifice to be slain, and offered up for Sin; did <hi>ipso facto</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himself a Sinner, to have deserved Death, and to be Consumed in the Fire of Hell; as the Sacrifices were either wholly or in part burnt and consumed in the Fire after they were slain: And so were offered up, not by Death only but by Fire also till they were consumed. Now for a man to bring his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be slain and burnt in the Fire, and salted with Salt; and yet to have no inward sense and feeling of his Sin, no feeling of the wrath of God due to Sin, and so no inward Repentance towards God. This was most hateful and abominable in the sight of God, and so the Sacrifice of that Person was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35607:83"/>
not accepted, but despised of God, as a piece of meer Hypocrisie and outward Formality; for in this Man there is neither Faith in Christ, nor Repentance towards God: And therefore all the Sacrifices that Men did or could offer, signified nothing as to Divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, without this inward sense of sin, and brokenness of heart: This one thing, a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart, did signifie more than all Sacrifices without it; and so it is put for, and by the Holy Ghost, preferred to all Sacrifices what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; the Sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; and why was a broken spirit more than all Sacrifices, and alone is called in the plural number, not Sacrifice, but Sacrifices; the Sacrifices, yea the Sacrifices of God, but because of the Divine acceptation, because God doth always accept this broken heart, this contrite spirit: <hi>A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise:</hi> The words are a holy Meiosis, there is more implied, than is exprest; <hi>thou wilt not despise, i. e.</hi> thou wilt certainly accept, thou wilt graciously accept and be well pleased with. Now therefore the Mystery is opened, the meaning of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,</hi> is abundantly made clear and plain: It is in this respect that a broken heart alone is called the Sacrifices of God, that, or upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35607:83"/>
the account thereof God is well pleased, yea more pleased, than with all outward Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices without it: Even so this Righteousness, which is by the Faith of Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, is called, <hi>The Righteousness of God,</hi> because that this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness only, and above all others, is that which carrieth the glory of the Divine accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; God will not despise, but will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will graciously accept this Righteousness, whenever it is presented unto him upon the Faith of a repenting, believing Sinner, upon the Faith of him that worketh not, <hi>i. e.</hi> that hath no Works or Righteousness of his own, which he dares to offer or bring unto God, <hi>but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly</hi>; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>His Faith is counted to him for Righteousness</hi>; and God is well pleased with this Man for this Righteousness sake which is alone by Faith in his Son Jesus Christ. Now that God is well pleased with this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of his Son Jesus Christ, is most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testified by the Voice from Heaven; <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased</hi>; which Voice from Heaven was heard by <hi>John</hi> when Christ was baptized of him in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and was now entred upon his work of fulfilling all Righteousness; as <hi>v.</hi> 15. Then cometh this Voice from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And again, when Christ was transfigured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mount a little before his Death and Translation into Heaven: Now when he was about to finish his Obedience and whole Righteousness of the Law for us; I say, then again comes this Voice from Heaven; <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased</hi>; and this Voice was heard from the most excellent glory by <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Which Voice from Heaven we heard when we were with him upon the holy Mount.</hi> Yea this is also testified by the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>And by him,</hi> that is, Christ, <hi>all that believe are justified and accepted</hi> as such; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners,</hi> or became sinners; <hi>so by the obedience of one shall many be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> or become righteous in his sight. And again; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6. <hi>To the praise of the glory of his Grace, wherein,</hi> or in which Grace, <hi>he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> We were not so by Nature, or by our own Works and Righteousness; but we are made so by Grace through this Obedience or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of his Son, who alone is the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that you may see 'tis through this Righteousness that we are made accepted, and stand before him as righteous; 'tis added in <hi>v.</hi> 7. immediately following; <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the forgiveness of sins</hi>; for though forgiveness of sins, or non-imputation of sins, is only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, which is but a part of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Justification; yet imputation of Righteousness is also implied, and necessarily inferred; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. The Apostle doth infer the imputation of Righteousness out of <hi>David; Psal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered: Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin</hi>; for unto this
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35607:85"/>
man the Lord doth impute Righteousness without Works; as <hi>v.</hi> 6. for else the Apostles Argument were of no force; and that the Lord is not well pleased with, or accepteth any person as righteous, but in and through this Righteousness of his Beloved Son appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Faith, is also as clearly testified in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>For without Faith it is impossible to please God:</hi> Where he proves that <hi>Enoch</hi> was a Believer, and an Heir of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness that is by Faith; because he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Translation received this Testimony, that he pleased God; which he could not do without Faith; nor can any man else under the whole Heavens be able to please God without this Faith; for the Scripture faith it is impossible. And thus have we finished the doctrinal part, namely, <hi>That the Righteousness which is by the Faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God:</hi> 1. As God is the Author of it. 2. As it is the Righteousness of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Person who is God-Man. 3.

                  <p>First; And first for the Ceremonial Law, that had its accomplishment, and was fulfilled in Christ: All the Types and Figures; all the Sacrifices, with the sprinkling of their Blood; all the Services and Ceremonies, looked and pointed unto him who was the substance of them all, and in whom they had
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35607:90"/>
their accomplishment, perfection and end; as <hi>Job.</hi> 1.17. <hi>For the Law was given by</hi> Moses, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ</hi>; Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that Grace of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication typified by the Sacrifices and the Sprinklings of Blood, and all that Grace that was shadowed out by the National Election, Adoption and Glory; all that Grace of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification typified and shadowed out by Circumcision, and the various washings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; all this Grace was given unto us from the Father by Jesus Christ; and the truth and substance expressed and darkly figured in that Law of the heavenly things themselves, was performed and made good to us in Christ: So Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ in opposition to works, and mans righteousness and trurh in opposition to the shadows and appearances; so <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>To seal up the Vision and the Prophecy, and to anoint the most holy</hi>; so that the anointing of the most holy, was to be the sealing up the Vision and the Prophecy of the Old Testament, <hi>i. e.</hi> the finishing and accomplishing thereof; for sealing up doth signifie and imply the finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and compleating of the things therein conveyed to us: And accordingly all that was seen, though but darkly in the vision of the Old Testament, and all that was testified aforehand in the Prophecy was fulfilled and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35607:90"/>
finished in Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the Grace that should come unto you, searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signifie, when it testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before-hand the sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow</hi>; So that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Prophecy of the Old Testament, pointed to the most Holy, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ, and had their end of Perfection and Accomplishment in him: The Old Testament, Tabernacle, Odinances of Worship, Priesthood and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was a <hi>Shadow of good things to come, but the Body is Christ, Col.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And then again Secondly, As to the Moral Law, which was added in that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical Law and Dispensation, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of Sin or Transgression, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. and was not the Covenant of God with that people particularly, as that by which they should expect righteousness and life, for the covenant of God with that people in the Mosaical Dispensation, was though more dark and shadowy, a Covenant of Grace. But I say the Moral Law was added, because of Sin; now as to the Moral Law, Christ is also the end of it, and it hath its perfection and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment only in Christ actually, and also in all them that believe virtually: now
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35607:91"/>
that the Moral Law is here mainly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally intended is plain, in that it is said, that Christ is the end of the Law for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; Now there is no other Law that is the measure and rule of Righteousness, but the Moral Law first, and then such other positive Laws as God superadded: for as sin is nothing else but the transgression of the Law, so Righteousness is nothing else but the fulfilling of it; So that for as much as Christ is the end of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, 'tis plain that he did fulfill the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, by giving that perfect obedience thereunto, that whole obedience, which the Law did and doth require of <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Posterity, and that as a Covenant of Works; I say this Law was fulfilled by Christ, for us in the perfection and utmost extent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it, as shall be more particularly set out in the opening of the next Doctrine; for otherwise he could not be the end of the Law for Righteousness to them that believe, if he had not perfected and filled up the Righteousness of the Law for them and in their stead; Therefore the Righteousness of the Law is perfected and fulfilled by Christ actually and personally: and he is the end or perfection of it.</p>

So that they are our elder Brethren yet our Brethren in Christ, but so, that Christ hath the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and is the first born amongst the many Brethren, both Angels and Men, being the head of the Election; Yet as hath been said, it doth not appear that they have any other or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Righteousness than their own; And as they are by nature greater and more excellent than
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35607:98"/>
we, so their obedience may excel the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of man, if he had also obeyed and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law of his Creator as they did; Yet still the obedience of Angels, and the righteousness wherein they are justified and stand before God, is but the obedience and righteousness of Creatures; though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so excellent, though it be Angelical; yet it is, and can be but Creature righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; And this righteousness which we have by Faith in Christ, is God's Righteousness, and therefore as God is more excellent than his Creatures, so his Righteousness is greater; and more excellent than theirs can possibly be. And here see, and behold again the triumph of Grace over sin and death; that fallen man is raised again and advanced in Christ, to a greater, better, and more excellent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hope of righteousness by Faith in Christ; not only, than Man had in innocency, or could have had by the works of the Law, but also than Angels in Heaven have: So that as they were preferred before us, and set above us by nature, we that believe are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them by Grace; for Christ took not Angelical but the humane nature into union with the Godhead in his own glorious person: and is sat down in that nature, <hi>at the right hand of the Majesty on high</hi>: and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35607:98"/>
we are said also to be <hi>sat down together with or in him in the heavenly places,</hi> Ephes. 2.6.

                  <p>Inf. 4.

This Righteousness of God by Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, is the great foundation truth of the Gospel; and as it concerns every wise and skilful builder to look well to his foundation, upon which the whole building and his success therein, and also his reputation as a workman doth depend: So it doth greatly concern every Gospel Minister, that he may be a skilful builder in the Church of God, to look well to the foundation of the Faith and Hope not only of himself, but also of the whole Church of Gods Elect: <hi>For other foundation can no man lay than what is already laid, which is Jesus Christ; the same yesterday, and to day and for ever,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. If a Minister lay his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the works of the Law, and mans Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it will never hold; whatever hope or confidence he builds upon this foundation in himself or others, will certainly fall, when his work shall come to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and himself, and all those that hear him, and whom he builds upon this foundation will certainly perish; unless another better foundation be laid: <hi>For by the works of the Law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight</hi>: As hath been shewed. No, no, mans Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness will not; no less than this Righteousness of God can be a sure foundation to build upon for Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in his sight, and for Eternal Life.</p>

The building must be uniform and answerable to the foundation in all parts of it, and bear a true proportion to, and agreement with the foundation to the very topstone; that the beholders may cry, <hi>Grace, Grace, to it</hi>; and that with shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4 7. There is a blessed harmony in the Gospel, and all Gods attributes do harmonize and shine forth in a joynt lustre and glory in Jesus Christ. So all mans duty is consistent with this principle of the Righteousness of God, and doth sweetly flow from it; Grace is manifested, and yet the Law is

                     </gap>y hearers, and with the same Spirit of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as furiously contended for by them, who are so imposed upon; As the Ephesian worshipers of <hi>Diana</hi> contended for her Goddess ship, as the <hi>Image that fell down from</hi> Jupiter <hi>out of Heaven,</hi> Acts 19.27, 28, 34, 35.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Doctrine and Opinion so cried up and contended for is; The Doctrine of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Eternity; Or that Gods Elect were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second is like unto it; Which at least must be admitted without the least scruple or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Justification from the time of Christ Death, or Resurrection: or that all Gods Elect were and are justified from the time of Christs Death or Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, because the price was then paid by Jesus Christ, and he as Head of the Church discharged by his Resurrection, according to the Interpretation they

give of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. Who was delivered for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and raised again for our Justification</hi>; Which they suppose and take for granted, must needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the time as well as the thing of Believers Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>We shall therefore fairly and truly try both these Doctrines by the Holy Scriptures according to what we are commanded. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>Beloved believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirit whether they be of God; for many false Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> And we shall first try the first of these Doctrines; As namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Whether Gods Elect, or any sort of men were justified from all Eternity, as some do say and affirm?</p>
                  <p>And unto this we answer affirmatively in two things. Namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is and was a gracious purpose, which God had purposed in himself from all Eternity, to Justifie and save his Elect through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.9. <hi>According to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself.</hi> And again, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>But according to his own Purpose and Grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the World began.</hi> And the Apostle in the Context doth not only plainly imply, but expresly declare the same, when he saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>To them, who are the called according to his purpose</hi>; and then, ver. 30. <hi>Whom he called, them he also justified</hi>; Therefore there is and was such a purpose in God before the World began to call and justifie them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all that have been, are now, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall be justified through Faith in Jesus Christ, from the Foundation of the World, to the end thereof, have been, are now, and shall be Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied according to this Purpose, which God hath
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35607:106"/>
Purposed in himself before the World began, and no otherwise, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.11. <hi>In whom also we have obtained an Inheritance</hi>; (And this Inheritance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained without free Justification by Grace, as Tit. 3 7. <hi>Being Predestinated according to the Purpose of him, who worketh all things after</hi> (or according to) <hi>the Counsel of his own Will</hi>; For in that he saith all things, 'tis manifest, that he worketh this one thing amongst all the rest, even his Justifying his Elect through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, after or according to this Counsel of his own Will; and Ephes. 1.3, 4. <hi>Who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ</hi>; Amongst which Spiritual Blessings, that of Justification must be acknowledged to be one, and none of the least or last of those blessings; It followeth, ver. 4. <hi>According as he hath chosen us in him, before the Foundation of the World</hi>; And again 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and graee, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the World began.</hi> And this also is plainly declared in the Context, Rom 8.30. <hi>Whom he did Predestinate, them he also Called, and whom he called them he also Justified</hi>; And if you will ask how? The answer is, According to his Purpose, as ver. 28. <hi>According to this Purpose,</hi> he calleth them, and according to this Purpose he justifieth them: So that thus far we do consent and agree.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is and was a purpose in God from all Eternity to Justifie his Elect, through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That all that are justified, are justified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Purpose, which God had purposed in himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:35607:106"/>But then we distinguish betwixt, being under a purpose of Grace from all Eternity to be justified: And being Justified from all Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though we grant and affirm the former, yet we deny the latter. Namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neg.</hi> That Gods Elect, or any person in this World, are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or is, or ever were, or was justified from all Eternity. This Doctrine of Justification from Eternity, I say, we truly reject, disown, and deny, as a false and unsound Doctrine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Holy Scriptures: all which will more than sufficiently appear in these following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part.</hi> 1. This Doctrine in the consequent of it, doth deny, destroy and overthrow the truth and true Doctrine of Gods Election and Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Holy Scriptures do establish, and which is one fundamental point of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, and from whence doth spring as from a Fountain, all the parts of our Salvation; This is called, <hi>The Foundation of God which standeth sure,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. And this is that from whence as from a Fountain all the parts of our Salvation do spring, and proceed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. There are two parts of this Election of God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, foreknowledge, and predestination. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; Now there neither is nor can be any fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge or fore-ordaining of that which is from Eternity, for nothing can be said to be before Eternity: And foreknowledge and predestination must be before the things foreknown and predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and therefore if Justification were from Eternity, there could be no foreknowledge, or predestination thereof; To speak with a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, God cannot be said to foreknow himself,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35607:107"/>
or to fore-ordain his own blessedness, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himself alone, 'tis true, the blessedness of God doth consist in that knowledge and injoyment of himself, which he hath in and of himself eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; But he could not fore-know himself, or fore-ordain himself this blessedness, because he hath and had this eternally, and nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, or be before eternity. Even so God could not be said to foreknow and predestinate his Elect to Justification and Salvation, through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, if they were J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ritten, Gal. 3.8. <hi>For the Scripture foreseeing tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Part.</hi> 2. This Doctrine of Justification from Eternity, doth by necessary consequences destroy and overthrow the Doctrine and Faith of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which is also another fundamental point of the Christian Faith: Reconciliation must go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35607:107"/>
Justification, at least in the order of Nature, though not of time; God must be first reconciled to that person in Christ whom he justifieth in Christ, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself:</hi> and then their justification follows, <hi>not imputing to them their trespasses</hi>; Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation must be first, and then Justification fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, for God Justifies a sinner upon the account of the price paid, and satisfaction made by Jesus Christ, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If when we were Enemies we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now reconciliation was not nor could be from Eternity, because reconciliation supposeth a breach first made by sin, now the breach made betwixt God and Man by sin, was not from Eternity but in time, and therefore reconciliation could not be from Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>without</hi> reconciliation by <hi>shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood there is no remission,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>i. e.</hi> No Justification to the Church of Gods Elect, for Remission of sins is their Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Part.</hi> 3. This Doctrine of Justification from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, destroyeth and overthroweth the true Doctrine of Justification it self also, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fundamental point of the Christian Faith: and therefore this Doctrine of Justification from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be true. Now the true Doctrine of Justification is, that Act of Gods Grace passed or put forth upon the person Elect, whereby of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ungodly, and unrighteous person before, he is really made and doth become, a righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in Gods sight, through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ given unto him. I say, he is made and doth become a righteous person in Gods sight, and that really, and not by opinion only as some would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and here are two things to be cleared, as namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:35607:108"/>1. That every man in this World is really made and doth become a guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y and condemned person in Gods sight by the first sin of <hi>Adam</hi> justly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by the Law, so <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, 10 and again <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. which the Apostle plainly affirmeth by a comparison of the two <hi>Adam</hi>'s, Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans disobedience many were made sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 18. <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came, or it came upon all men to condemnation,</hi> in Gods sight; So that 'tis plain the many <hi>ver.</hi> 19. is all men, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. even the Elect of God as well as others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> all men did become and were really made sinners in Gods sight, by the just imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin to them by the Law, even so in Christ <hi>many</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 19. or all <hi>men,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> all that believe are justified, <hi>i. e.</hi> are made and do become righteous in Gods sight, through Faith in Christ, by the righteousness of one, or by the obedience of one, justly imputed to them by the Law of Faith and Grace. So that as before Justification every man was really a guilty and unrighteous person in Gods sight; So now that Faith in Christ is come, every man that believeth is justified, and doth become, and is made a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous person in Gods sight; So that Justification maketh a real change of State, from a state of sin and unrighteousness, and death, to a state of Grace, Righteousness and Life.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore he that is Justified from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was from Eternity in a state of Grace, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Life, and never was in a state of Sin, Unrighteousness and Death: he never was a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Ungodly, and condemned in Gods sight, and Sin had never raigned in him unto Death, in whom Grace had raigned unto Life, through Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35607:108"/>
from all Eternity; but the contrary is true in all them whom God Justifieth, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Now to him that worketh not, but believeth on him, that justifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For when we were yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out strength in due time Christ died for the Ungodly,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might Grace reign through Righteousness unto Eternal Life, by Jesus Christ our Lord</hi>; So that we who are now Justified by Faith in Christ, were without strength, were ungodly, were under the reign of Sin unto Death: but he that was Justified from Eternity, was never any of these: and therefore no man was or could be Justified from Eternity; there is a contradiction in the things themselves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Doctrine is inconsistent with the truth: for Sin did not reign unto death in any from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but in Time: therefore Grace could not reign through Righteousness unto Life in any from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but in time.</p>

This Doctrine of Justification from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, destroyeth also the Doctrine of Adoption, which inseparably followeth Justification, and is another inseparable point of the Christian Faith; I say Adoption followeth, and is an inseparable companion of Justification by Faith in Christ; he that is Justified by Faith in Christ, is also adopted and taken into the number of Gods Sons or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the same Faith, as <hi>Gal</hi> 3.24.25.26. <hi>That we might be justified by Faith, v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now no man was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted from Eternity, and therefore no man was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:35607:109"/>
Justified from Eternity; And he that was Adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Eternity, was never a Servant but a Son; was never a Child of Disobedience, a Child of Wrath, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2, 3. but a Child of God from eternity: and then there never could be any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination to the Adoption of Children, as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.5. that the Adoption of Children had been from eternity.</p>

This Doctrine of Justification from Eternity denieth, destroyeth, and overthroweth by consequence, the truth and doctrine of discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or making a difference betwixt the state of Nature, and the state of Grace, which the holy Scriptures do every where establish; The state of Nature according the Scriptures is a state of Sin, and so of Death and Condemnation, as hath been already shewed: But the state of Grace, is a state of Righteousness, and so of Life and Justification, as hath also been declared, through Faith in the Son of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>John</hi> 5.24. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.14. Now he that saith he was Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from Eternity, saith that he was in a state of Life from Eternity, and by consequence never was in a state of Sin and Death: for Justification is Life, as Condemnation is Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. but most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that all were dead, and in a state of sin and condemnation, before they believed on Christ even the Elect of God as well as others, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. And the death of Christ for all the Elect doth prove that they were all dead, and in a state of Death Jews and Gentiles; for else Christ needed not to have died for them, and the love of Christ doth constrain all them to acknowledge, that they were dead, and therefore are debtors to Christ for their Life and Justification, through Faith in him, and so <hi>no more to live to themselves, but to him
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:35607:109"/>
that died for them and rose again.</hi> The words are most plain, and the sense most genuine: <hi>For the love of Christ constraineth us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again</hi>; Therefore seeing they were once dead, and in a state of Death and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were not justified from Eternity, no not one of them, that Live and are Justified by Faith in Christ, for they all, and always thus judge, that they were all dead, <hi>i e.</hi> condemned, and not justified before they believed in Christ, and do freely confess the truth, and therefore not one of them doth profess, or can profess any such Faith, that he was Justified from Eternity.</p>

This Doctrine of Justification from Eternity, denyeth and overthroweth the Doctrine of Regeneration or new Birth, and the necessity thereof; which Christ himself doth plainly affirm and urge upon every man in this World, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5, 8. and so do all the holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as may be easily proved if there were any so bold as to deny it. Now he that is Justified by Faith in Christ, and hath this power and priviledge given unto him to become a Son of God, as every true believer hath, <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. he also is born of God, as <hi>John</hi> 1.13. <hi>which were born, not of blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth:</hi> not one Believer (and so Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied person in this World) but he is born of God and begotten of God, and so is born again, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>being born again not of corruptible seed but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for ever,</hi> ver. 25. And this is the Word which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35607:110"/>
by the Gospel is Preached unto you: so that not one person is or can be justified by Faith, but at the same time and by the same word of Faith, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him and Believed by him, he is also born again: he therefore that saith he was justified from Eternity, saith also that he was born of God from Eternity: and he that was born of God from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, needeth not; nor can be born again: for Regeneration is but once; and those that were born of God from Eternity, are far from being new born Babes, as all true Believers are after their first Conversion and Calling, and as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter</hi> calleth and styleth them. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3.</p>

This Doctrine of Justification from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity denieth, destroyeth, and overthroweth the Doctrine of Repentance and Conversion to God by Christ, and by consequence takes away the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity thereof: the holy Scriptures do every where establish, both in the Old and New Testament the necessity of Repentance and Conversion to God, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.6, 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17, 18. <hi>Luke.</hi> 24.45, 46, 47. But he that saith he was justified from Eternity, by consequence saith, that he had remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins from Eternity, and that his Sins were blotted out from Eternity, for Justification is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, as <hi>Psalm</hi> 32.1, 2, 3. And blotting out of Sins, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.25. And so he needeth not to Repent and be Converted, for asmuch as he had his sins blotted out from Eternity, and was Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous from Eternity; and well it is if men of these notions and traditions, which they have received to hold, do not become as the Pharisees of old; so Whole as they need no Physician, and so Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their own Eyes, that like the 99 Just Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, they need no Repentance or Conversion, as <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4, 8. And if the name of Repentance and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35607:110"/>
Conversion shall still be pretended to, and boasted of amongst them; it shall only consist in making Proselytes to this their Tradition of Justification from Eternity, which they call the Gospel, and a more glorious Light than former Ages have enjoyed: And some have not blushed to affirm, than perhaps the Apostles had. But let them take heed, lest that Wo come upon them spoken by the Mouth of Truth himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15.</p>

This Doctrine doth frustrate and make void all the ends of Christ Death and Suffering, which are the Justification and Salvation of Gods Elect; for if they were Justified from Eternity, what need was there of Christs dying to obtain that for them, which they had from all Eternity? So that if this Doctrine be true, as they affirm: then as the Apostle saith in another case, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Christ is dead in vain.</hi>

                     <hi>Part</hi> 9. This Doctrine of Justification from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, destroyeth and overthroweth the Doctrine and Order of God's new Creation in Christ, and making all things new in him; which the Holy Scriptures do every where establish both in the Old and New Testament. This is certain the Old Creation was first and before the New, else it were not new; <hi>Adam</hi> was before Christ, or the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before the Second, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 46, 47. <hi>And so it is written, the first man</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>was made a living Soul, the last</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickning Spirit, howbeit, that was not first, which is Spiritual but that which is Natural, and afterward that which is Spiritual.</hi> The first or old Creation in <hi>Adam</hi> is the natural, and the second or new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ the Spiritual, now that was not first which is Spiritual, but that is first which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, therefore the Workmanship of God in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:35607:111"/>
or old creation was first; And the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God in the new Creation in Christ, is the Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tual and therefore last: the second must be after the first, or else 'tis not second, the new must be after the old, or else the old is not old, nor the other new. Now Justification by Faith in Christ, is Gods Workmanship in the new Creation, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature, old things (i. e.</hi> the things of the first Creation in <hi>Adam) are passed away, behold all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ.</hi> And therefore Reconciliation and Justification by Jesus Christ, as <hi>ver.</hi> 19. are parts of the new Creation in Christ as also is most manifest, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. 'tis manifest I say, that God at first setled all things: So the first <hi>Adam</hi> and all men in him upon the foundation of the Law, or Covenant of Works, which settlement was broken or dissolved by the first transgression, and Death entred upon all men by Sin, and no hope or possibility of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Life, by that Law or Covenant any more, therefore now God bringeth forth Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and settles all things again upon a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, restoring Righteousness and Life by Jesus Christ to all that believe, this is the new Creation, that which is Spiritual; Now therefore Justification and Salvation by Faith in Christ, was not from Eternity, because 'tis Gods new Creation in Christ; And forasmuch as the Old Creation, and that which is Natural, was not from Eternity but in Time; 'Tis manifest that Gods new Creation in Christ to any man in this World, was not from Eternity, but in Time, for the first must be before the second, and the old before the new; Therefore Justification and Life through Faith in Christ, was not from Eternity but in Time,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:35607:111"/>
though these things were laid in the purpose, and counsel of God from Eternity; yet they were not nor could be but in time; And if any will say, God calleth things that are not as if they were, 'tis most true but let such consider that all those things are still things that are not, till God brings them forth in time.</p>

                     </hi> all which must be after the time of Christs Death and Resurrection, for the Spirit was not given for these extraordinary works and miracles till Christ was glorified; and yet saith Christ ye shall see <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and ye your selves thrust out: so that those that lived before the time of my Death and Resurrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, as <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Prophets, ye shall see them hereafter, when that day shall come which revealeth all things: ye shall see them in the Kingdom of God, and ye your selves, who lived, professed my name, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied and did miracles in my name after the time of my Death and Resurrection, ye shall see your selves thrust out: and though you cast out Devils in my name, yet ye did not cast him out, nor was he cast out of your own hearts. But Christs Witness is most true, and will be found so at the great day; therefore let men take heed how they make him a Liar, who is Truth it self; for certainly Christ did not bear false witness, when he testified to the Sick of the Palsie, Mark 2.5. <hi>Son, thy Sins be forgiven thee,</hi> and when he testified in the House of <hi>Simon</hi> concerning the Woman that was and had been a great Sinner, when she washed Christs feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and brake so costly a Box of Ointment and poured it upon his head, that all the room was filled with the odour thereof: I say when he testified to <hi>Simon</hi> and all that were in the house concerning her, Luc. 7.47. <hi>Wherefore I say unto thee; her Sins which are many are forgiven, for she loved much</hi>: and when he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified to her, <hi>v.</hi> 48. <hi>And he said unto her, thy Sins
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35607:115"/>
are forgiven:</hi> Forgiveness of Sins is justification, and they had Faith in Christ wrought in them; for <hi>Mark</hi> 2.5. <hi>when Jesus saw their Faith,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 7.50. <hi>And he said to the Woman, thy Faith hath saved thee</hi>; and yet the time of Christs Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was not yet come; so that justification and Salvation through Faith in Christ was as sure and certain, and as full and compleat to them that believed before the time of Christs Death and Resurrection, as ever it was to any since or shall be to the end of the World: therefore the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods Elect is no more dated or doth commence from the time of Christs death, than from any time before or after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the justification of Gods Elect should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and bear date from the time of Christs Death and Resurrection, then thousands of Gods Elect that were Born, were Converted and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and have believed on Christ since the time of Christs Death and Resurrection, in Ages and Generations until now, were justified before they were Converted and Called, before they receiv'd the Spirit by the hearing of Faith, before they believed God or his word, before they had any Faith wrought in them; for they were justified from the time of Christs death, according to this Doctrine; so that they were as much and as truly justified in their unbelief, impiety, unregeneracy and enmity, as ever they were or came to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified afterwards when they believed and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Christ, which is most contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Paul,</hi> when <hi>Saul</hi> a Blasphemer, Persecutor, and Iniurious, was as truly justified as <hi>Paul</hi> when

called, a Convert, a Believer and a Preacher of Jesus Christ, contrary to the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15, 16. and <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. For <hi>Saul</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Unconverted, Uncalled, a Blasphemer, a Persecutor, and Injurious, Ignorant and an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer long after Christs Death and Resurrection; and yet according to this Doctrine must be justified when he lived, and continued in impenitency and unbelief and disobedience till that time; yea and all those <hi>Corinthians</hi> mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 11. <hi>And such were some of you: But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus; and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Now look back into the 9. and 10. <hi>verses; Know ye not that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God?

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Christ who dyed and rose again long before.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35607:116"/>
And that this must be the true sense of the Apostle, appeareth in that he tells them, <hi>but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus</hi>; He thereby conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and that truly, they were not justified before; though the time of Christs Death and Resurrection was past before.</p>
                  <p>And thus have we finished also the tryal of this second Opinion or Doctrine of Justification from the time of Christs Death and Resurrection, and find it not to be a true Doctrine; a Doctrine not of God.</p>
                  <p>All therefore which now remaineth to be done, is to shew and assign the true time and season of Gods Justifying his Elect; and from whence the truly justified person may humbly date his own Justification according to the holy Scriptures, and have the seal of God in the true witness of his holy Spirit in the word for the proof it.</p>
                  <p>Lastly therefore, The due time and season of Gods justifying his Elect, through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ, according to the Scriptures, is the time of their respective believing, embracing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and entertaining Christ; Christ in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or the promise in Christ: for <hi>all the promises are yea and Amen in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. Not a promise alone without Christ, for that is to be suspected; the promise when given by the Father, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by the Spirit is never alone or separate from Christ, but always in Christ and together with him: Even as <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to have received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises when he offered up his only Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. But <hi>Abraham</hi> did not receive the promise, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses alone, <hi>i. e.</hi> without Christ, the substance of all the promises; but he received the promise in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Christ in and through the promises. For as God made no promise of Eternal Life out
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35607:116"/>
of Christ, but in Christ and through him, so we can receive no promise or promises of Eternal Life and Salvation but in Christ, and Christ in and together with the promise. And therefore <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is said to have received the promise of God in Christ, as God gave it to him, so he received it in Christ; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. He therefore that believeth with a justifying and saving Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Christ in the promises, and embraceth not the promises alone, but Christ in the promise: and therefore union with Christ, and receiving Christ into the heart, and promises, and all things else to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is the true Faith of Gods Elect, and the Faith of the operation of God, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>This is the reward that God hath given to us, Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son: He that hath the Son hath Life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not Life</hi>; and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>He came to his own and his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not. But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> So that in short, Faith is receiving Christ, and without Christ be received there is no believing, and where there is no belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there is no justification.</p>
                  <p>The true time therefore of God's justifying his Elect, is the time of their believing, <hi>i. e.</hi> of their receiving and embracing Christ; then, and not before, and thence ever after God doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Elect: And they may from thence date the time of their justification acccording to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> so it is with all the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>; as it is written again and again; <hi>Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 4.3. Now from the time that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God from that time was he justified and ever after; even so it is with all
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:35607:117"/>
the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>; as, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.23, 24, 25. <hi>Now it was not written for</hi> Abrahams <hi>sake alone that it was imputed to him, but for us also to whom it shall be imputed: If we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the Dead; who was delivered for our Offences, and raised again for our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> Now therefore Christian, the time of Gods imputing Righteousness to thee, and justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee in Christ; is not the time of Christs dying and rising again, but the time of thy be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And to produce this Faith in thee, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; these three things must necessarily concur, all which did concur in the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi>: as namely,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There must be hearing; The word of God must be truly preached to thee, and thou must hear it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or there neither is, nor can be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

things which the Gospel Preacheth, but they will seem foolishness to thee because they are Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. and again <hi>verse</hi> 60 — 66. The word preached I say, will never be rightly understood till God by his Spirit openeth thy Heart to understand, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45, 46. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. And thus God opened <hi>Abrahams</hi> Heart to understand the Gospel or the promise in Christ preached to him by the gift of his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Faith must be wrought in thee by the same Spirit, for this is <hi>the Faith of the operation of God,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>The gift of God</hi>; as <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. Produced by the exceeding greatness of his power, as when he raised Christ from the dead; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>Which was done by the power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> Rom. 1.4. Rom. 8.15. And thus was <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith wrought in him and it was given him to believe, his Faith was not of himself, but was the gift of God; otherwise <hi>Abraham might have had whereof to boast, but not before God</hi>; as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing God, was as much of the Sovereign will of Gods grace and favour to him, as his imputing Righteousness to him upon his believing. And thus it is <hi>not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> So it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so it is with all the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>; and the Lord grant it may be so with thee: <hi>Abraham belived God and it was counted to him for Righteousness.</hi> That was the time of Gods justifying him through Faith in Christ; do thou believe God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did and it shall also be counted to thee for Righteousness, and this shall be the time of Gods Justifying thee through Faith in his Son Jesus Christ: Even then
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35607:118"/>
when all these things concur in thy Faith, as they did in <hi>Abrahams.</hi> 1. The hearing of Faith or the word of Faith preached to thee: 2. Gods giving and thy receiving the Spirit through this hearing of the Faith Preached: 3. Faith wrought in thee by the same Spirit to receive Jesus Christ: This time I say again, and no other is or can be assigned according to the holy Scriptures for thy Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods sight. When this Faith cometh into thy Soul, then cometh this Blessedness of thy Justification, whether it be in Circumcision or in uncircumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.8—12.</p>
