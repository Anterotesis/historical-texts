            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>carried in a Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot drawne with foure Kings, whom he before had conquered, when one of the foure, casting his eyes behinde him, looked often vpon the whéeles of the Chariot; which <hi>Sesostris</hi> earnestly noting, at last demaunded of him what he meant by looking backe so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, who replied, I sée that those things which were highest in the whéeles become lowest, and the lowest as soone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come highest, <hi>cogito de mutatione fortunae,</hi> I thinke vpon the inconstancie of things. <hi>Sesostris</hi> hereupon as in a glasse beholding himselfe, waxed more milde, and deliuered the imprisoned Kings from that slauerie.</p>
            <p>This Historie then so liuely expressing the mortalitie of mans life, that to the highest belongs a graue, assoone as to the lowest, and that man himselfe is a witnesse to himselfe, how vncertaine are his daies, (since sinne hath spread it selfe like a leaprosie ouer all flesh, and iniquitie hath gotten the vpper hand) that a Spider is able to choake vs, a haire to stifle vs, and a tile falling on our heads to extinguish vs, and in that moment when we least suspect so sudden Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>Our life then is so momentarie, that in that minute wée breath, if not defended by our maker, in that minute we

            <p>SOme Foure yéeres since néere <hi>Deuonshey</hi> Hundred in <hi>Essex</hi> liued a Yeoman one <hi>Anthony Iames,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the world was counted rich, and by the report of his Neighbours held credible and honest.</p>
            <p>This man in the desire of his youth matcht himselfe to an honest Countrey-maide, whose vertuous disposition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quald his owne thoughts, and whose diligent care was carefully to saue what her husband brought home, as his
<pb facs="tcp:13830:3"/>
labour did striue to procure it abroad; so that the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the one, and the care of the other, mixt such a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall content betwéen them, that they liued like <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sara,</hi> he louing to her, she obedient to him.</p>
            <p>In processe of time this couple growing wealthy by their labour, prooued to be as happie by their yssue, for it it pleased God to enrich them with two children, a Boy, and a Girle, that the wishes of the Father might be as wel satisfied, as the desire of the Mother, and both contented in so comfortable a blessing.</p>
            <p>The Mother being (as women vse to say) stored first with a Daughter, and called it by her owne name <hi>Elizabeth Iames,</hi> so that when time brought the Father as happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing of a Sonne, hee christened it by his owne name <hi>Anthony Iames.</hi> In the education and bringing vp of these two Children, there was a pretty louing contention betwéene the Goodman and the Wife, which of the two should prooue most happie to the Parents delight, whose loue indeede was alike to them both. So that time passing away in that comfortable strife betwéene this louing cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Daughter had attayned to the age of Eight yéeres, and the Sonne to Seuen, in which passage the mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other yssue, was then with childe with the third, and the better halfe of her time had carried so happie a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p>About that season of the yéere a Faire happened in <hi>Essex,</hi> to which the Seruants they then kept, some for pleasure, the rest about necessarie businesse were sent, so that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Yeoman with his wife and children were onely left at home, when mischiefe like a bramble that takes hold on whatsoeuer it touches, caught this occasion, and wrought in the mindes of Nine, I cannot call them men, but vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, and another not a woman, but a beast to make a prey of these harmelesse foure, and their increast possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So these wretches hauing fastened on this monstrous
<pb facs="tcp:13830:4"/>
intent, made hast to the execution thereof, and so soone had attained to this wealthy Yeomans house, where finding little or no resistance, they first bound the man and the woman, and giuing the two children to two of their asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats to hould, the rest fell to ransacke, where not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselues with that store of riches they found, as Gold, Siluer, Plate, Rings, and other wealth, hauing made vp their packe, they consulted with themselues for their further security, to make spoyle of the owners. It was not long in question ere this hellish Iury had giuen vp as damnable a verdict, for (<hi>suspition alwaies haunting a guiltie mind,</hi>) they determined with themseules they could not bee safe from pursute, from attachment, nay from shamefull death, which they worthily deserued, without the slaughter of the father and the mother, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently resolued vpon, and then two of them stepping to the man, where he lay bound vpon the ground, with their dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers stobbed him in the body: who ere his speach left him, lifting vp his eyes, beg'd only this of them; take my riches, I car'd for them to bring vp my posterity, but now they are yours, I giue them you fréely; then pitty my wife, bee mercifull to my children. These his last words séemed to beget some remorse (seldome séene) in the men which were murtherers, which the more than monstrous woman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing (as in a rage thereat) stept to his wife, and calling to him with these words; Talkest thou of pittie quoth shee, if thy eyes haue yet left so much sight to be witnes how ile be pittifull? behould how Ile performe thy peticion. So drawing out her knife, (O act too terrible to report, but the most damnablest that euer was heard of, executed by a woman) shée ript her vp the belly, making herselfe a tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call midwife, or truly a murtheresse, that brought an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue babe to the world, and murthered the mother.</p>
            <p>The good woman hauing not leaue to cry, and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hauing not the vse of speach, they both lift vp their hands, rowld their eyes one to another, and with that said, but silent; Farewell euer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13830:4"/>This tragicall spectacle enforced all the rest partakers in the robbery, and actors in the murther to remorce, nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to a repentance; that done, this horrible action had a beginning: but sinne alwaies seeking securely to shrowd it selfe in, they began now to question of their safety, and (as villaines are euer one affraid and in distrust of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) they conclude now to share their purchase, and euery Knaue to shift for himselfe.</p>
            <p>Some vrged let vs first kill the children, as we haue done their parents, others and the greater part glutted with the present obiect, and euen ashamed of themselues and their sinfull actions, not onely denyed, but confidently resolued they would be no further guilty in the blood of Innocents. In briefe they agréed euerie party to haue an equall porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ill purchased booty, which soone shared amongest them, and as it appeared, hauing more than they could tell what to doe withall, they gaue the remaine to thrée of their Consorts, of which the woman was one to conuey away the children from thence, and bestowe them in what place soeuer, while they would giue their Parents buriall.</p>
            <p>This was as soone done as talkt of, seuen of them caried the dead couple from the house to a wood néere adioyning, and there buried them, and the other thrée are gone to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell with the children.</p>
            <p>These Monsters thus diuided, whether of a determinate before of ancient acquaintance, or drawne by what means soeuer, it yet rests vndiscouered to the world. These two men, this woman, and these two children the next day some thrée houres before night, came to <hi>Bishops Hatfield</hi> in <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> shire seuentéen miles from <hi>London,</hi> the children being on a horse in a payre of Panniers, the woman riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them, as it had béene to visite some of their friends, then they tooke vp their Inne at one <hi>Dels</hi> house: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to their chamber, they called for their Hostesse, when after some other parle had betwéene them, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of her, if she would be secret in a businesse, they would vnfold vnto her, who presently without further
<pb facs="tcp:13830:5"/>

            <p>This, thus resolued vpon, they fell to drinking, and who so merry as this diuellish company, all this while the girle sat on the frame at the tables end, and in the meane time, the boy was strayd downe the stayres, where being playing vp and downe in a lower roome, this <hi>Dels</hi> wife hauing a labourer at worke in her backside to make her bauins, called <hi>Nicholas Dracon,</hi> it was his chance to come in to call for drincke, where taking note of it, by the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the behauiour it vsed; his Hostesse passing by him, he demaunded of her whose child it was, who answered it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a guest or two that are now aboue, the honest labourer hauing drunke his drinke that hee came for, went backe to end his busines in the yarde, while the child (they being aboue in the heat of their cups, and not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him) strayd out into the stréete, where one Neuey whelpe lay: the tailor taking notice of him, especially by a greene coate with nine skirts about the wast, the fassion then being new for children, hee called the boy to him to take a patterne thereof, and hauing satisfied his desire by noting it well and taking measure of the child, the tailor as the labourer, goes backe to his worke, and the boy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to <hi>Dels</hi> house.</p>

the monstrous femall (for no woman) began to egge her on with faire perswasion, Come apace swéet-heart, thy brother is before, and we are going to thy father and thy mother.</p>
            <p>The poore Girle encoraged with the remembrance of her Parents names, whose liues they had extinguished from her, as if the names of them (who first gaue her life) could haue created a new motion in her, (as far as her childhood &amp; féeble strength would giue her leaue) hastened after, and by the way cald to her with these words. Gammer, shall my mother make me ready to morrow morning, kisse me when I come from schoole, and heare me say my lesson? The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish Diuell answered (not hauing remorse, being remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of the execrable act she had done) I. when she sées thée next, she shall doe all this.</p>
            <p>The men hastening on before with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pitifull burthen of a murthered brother, when she the diuellisht of all came after with a tender sister, and by the way began to aske her of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall circumstances as where she was borne, who were her parents, and what her name was? when the child an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to euerie question according to her remembrance so pretyly, that if her leader had had left in her any sparke of womanhood, who by nature are kinde, flexible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morseable, and not béen made vp for one to be damned, she would haue pitied her.</p>
            <p>But who are created to be Murtherers, are created to be remorselesse, and so was she, onely beguild the way with these &amp; other such like questions, as what we walkt vpon, what she saw withall and what she spake withall, when the innocent Child (suspectlesse that her own tongue should be her owne betrayer) according to her discretion answered to euerie one, directly pointing to her foot, her eye, and to her tongue, that with those, and by the helpe of those she sawe, went &amp; spake. Whereupon this bloody Tygris<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make her selfe more monstrous, bad her put out her tongue that she might féele it, (being at this time come iust to a stile, where she sat down, and told the Girle that they would rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues a while) when the child, (little dreading it should be

By this time (with their conductor <hi>George Dell</hi>) the men had discharged themselues of their burthen by bottomelesse Pond, throwing the stake &amp; Boy they brought (&amp; bound him withall) into a Corne field, &amp; the child with her tongue in her aperne, and in the whores hand had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when presently went to act this last stratageme which before they had agréed vpon, &amp; threw the Boy (as he was in his clothes) into the pond, giuing him for his <hi>requie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The childe receiued, and the mony payd, the 2 theeues and the whore departed: when the beggar (whether not liking the bargain least after he should pay too déere for it, of slight care or selfe-will, it is yet vnknowne) he lost the child in <hi>Hatfield</hi> wood, where shortly after it was found in a hallow trée, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued some little cherishing of some well disposed people about the wood-side, from thence it strayd to <hi>Barnet,</hi> from <hi>Barnet</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where hapning in the dumbe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it vsed to begge at one Master <hi>Allens</hi> dore a Barber-surgeon for some reléefe, the Maister comming himselfe to the dore, and séeing the child make such pitiful signes to the mouth, he tooke it by the hand and led it into his shop, and opening her mouth to know the cause of the gréefe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned of, found the tongue to be cut out, and the wound vnheald, who (pitying the misfortune of the childe) of his owne charitable disposition, cured it.

her murthered brother in bottomelesse pond.</p>
            <p>This Child hauing remained thrée wéekes in the pond, on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day in the morning (for at that time of the yéere happened this Tragedy) some Gentlemen and others (being a hunting for Wild-foule) hapned with their dogs to beat about this Pond; when one of these dogges hauing scented the child (as where it was rose vp vnder the wéeds at a banke-side) whined and cried, and by no meanes could be beat or drawne from thence, which eagernesse of the Spaniels, wrought a desire in the men to know certainely the cause thereof, and with their long staues turning vp the wéeds, found there a Boy to be drowned, as they conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured; when carying newes thereof to the towne, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was by the Crowner taken vp, and layd openly for the view of all men to take knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>The whole Countrey néere thereabouts comming at the strangenesse of the report, that a childe should be murthered and then throwne into a pond, yet none could challenge in him the right of a sonne; yet the aforesayd <hi>Henrie Whilpley, Nicholas Deacon,</hi> and diuers others of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> made testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication both by apparell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other signes (for the Boy had a red head) that this was the childe, who thrée wéekes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was séene in <hi>Dels</hi> house, so many then signified to the Iustice: <hi>Dels</hi> wife was sent for, for her husband was a blinde man, when being demanded if such a child were not brought to her house, (as before is spoken) &amp; who they were that brought it thether, when she constantly denied, shee knew of no such, and for certaine she could affirme, that no such child did lodge at her house, and being offered her oath, hereupon she was as redy to sweare as resolute to deny, but who knowes not lying and swearing are partners, and as inseparable companions as a théefe and a receiuer, and (as I may say) sworne brethren, that alwaies iumpe together in a sinfull societie: her oath being taken (see the iust iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, she had not power to confes that truth which would haue wrought her out of all suspition, but vtterly <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nying that which was so manifestly prooued against her)
<pb facs="tcp:13830:8"/>
the Iustices thought it requisite (till further proofe could be had on this presumption) to bind her ouer to giue answere at the next Assizes.</p>
            <p>When from assizes to assizes, during the passage of foure yeares shée was compeld to appeare, nothing being further found against her, but her owne deniall; wherevpon the first demaund, if shée had made but this perswasion and satisfying answere, as Iudge <hi>Daniell</hi> very worthyly vrged against her at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tryall, that kéeping an Inne, shee had many guests, and many children lay at her house, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (for ought shée knewe) that might bee one, but who brougt them, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they come, or whether they will, shée is not bound to take notice of. This might haue been some instance of her innocency, but so to deny a question, the truth of which was not of sufficiency to heare her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, a suspition and mistrust of her selfe, and prooues her to be guilty.</p>
            <p>But to the former matter, shée hauing made her appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at so many seuerall assises and sessions, and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance against her, but the former, it was thought at lent assizes last, shée should haue béen dismist the Court: but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time such is the iust iudgment of God, to the plague of murtherers, and terror of them that delight in bad, the dumbe shall speake ere they shall escape vndiscouered.</p>
            <p>For the dumbe sister of this murthered child, for when shée was in question, led (no question) foure yeare vp and downe, from towne to towne, from country to country, by the hand of God was at Michaelmas last brought vnto <hi>Hatfield,</hi> before whose comming thither, though <hi>Dels</hi> wife was by the grauer iudgments held in some suspition, yet was her honest carriage such to taruelors, and to all sorts of people shée had to deale withall, that generally the whole country acquited her, and held her of honest condition; for since the time of this murther it is credibly reported, that betwixt that and a hundred mile from thence, mans meat and horse meate was not to bee had so reasonable as then, nor to a trauailer better vsage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13830:8"/>Well the girle is come to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and hauing béen there two dayes straying from place to place; the third day shée happened vpon <hi>Dels</hi> house, where, whether it were by es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall note taken before, but rather truely to be iudged by the diuine instinct of heauen, to euerye one that came by her, shee would make such pittifull action, as would haue pittied any reasonable creature to haue beheld her, as tearing of her haire, pointing to her throate, stopping of her mouth, poynting to the woodstacke, &amp; in the motion hereof, shed teares as bitter as if her brothers former murther had béen in present action.</p>
            <p>This strangenesse noted through all the towne, bred a wonder in the people, and the rather for that the girle by no means could be drawen from thence; at last the Bailiffe of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> taking aduise with some of his brethren, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted together, how they might trye whether the dumbe did this, as tending to the reuelation of some concealed suit, or prouoked thereunto by ignorance, and in searching many wayes, at last it came in their minds, that their neighbor <hi>Dels</hi> wife had of long béen in question about a child, taken vp in bottomles Pond (some foure yere since) or thereabout, whereupon they agreed to question the girle vpon what particulers, they could best thinke vpon to that purpose, and withall remembring that by commaund from the Iustices of the shire, they had reserued the murthered childes cote, and purposed to make tryall, if her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance could take any knowledge of it, but first resolued to tempt her memory, by shewing her diuers others.</p>
            <p>The girle brought into a parlor amongst them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan first to aske her of her name, as, is thy name <hi>Iohane, Alis, Agnis Frauncis, Besse,</hi> and euer as they spake her right name which was <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> shée would laughand reioyce; on the contrary, at the naming her wrong seem discontent.</p>
            <p>They hauing thus a knowledge of her name, began to question her further, if she neuer had had a brother; when <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

asked her what clothes he vsed to go in, &amp; she to the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration she could, made signes thereof; whereupon they shewed her many childrens Coats of seuerall colours, and euer as she happened vpon a gréene, that she would kisse, and cry, euer throwing all the rest from her, with so louely and liuely action, that they were confident the murthered Boy was her brother; at last they brought to her the right coat, which after she had earnestly taken note of, the poore childe grewe to that vehement passion, as if in the sight thereof, she had seene another brother murthered, when by no perswasion, offerings, gifts, nor no course that could be taken, to part from the coate, as it for the losse of a brother, she would kéepe it as a remembrance of him. All which signified to the Iustices and Knightes of the Shire, the towne had an especiall charge to prouide more carefully for her, and not to suffer her any longer to lye in the stréets, and her brothers coate was giuen to her to weare out.</p>
            <p>This wonder, the onely table-talke in the Countrey, though often brought to the widdow <hi>Dels</hi> eare, she made slight of it, (perswading her sele belike) that with her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest report and store of wealth, the Childe hauing not a tongue to vtter any thing in her reproofe to wrest out of it, which (no question) she had done, notwithstanding all the arguments and instances against her.

            <p>This Wench (as before is reported) being by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on placed where she had reliefe; one day, some month before Christmasse last, going to play with the Goodwifes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where shee soiourned in a Parke ioyning to <hi>Hatfield</hi> (commonly called the Kings Parke) as they were in sport together, a Cocke hard by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fell a crowing, when the other Girle mocking the Cocke with these words, <hi>Cocka doodle dooe, Peggy hath lost her shooe,</hi> and called to her <hi>Besse,</hi> canst not thou doe so?

            <p>Spéedy newes was carried to all the chéefe men in the Shire, who driuen into astonishment with the report, and the miraculous accident, that a Childe without a tongue should speake both discréetly and distinctly, to the reuealing of so monstrous a Murther, and by the crowing of a Cocke (that bird that put <hi>Peter</hi> in minde of his great sinne in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying our Sauiour and his Maister) was the Herauld to proclaime to this child, when she should speak these things, that by her the wonderfull workes of God might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Murthers discouered.</p>
            <p>But the liues of the Kings Subiects, and those which til then, had béen reputed honest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being now like to depend on her iustification: the Iustices were very carefull to sift her by seuerall examinations, to see if they could finde her alter or trippe in any part of her former discourse, as Sir <hi>Raph Conesbye,</hi> Sir <hi>Henrie Butler,</hi> Maister Auditor, and

Master Auditor <hi>Curle,</hi> to the number of 14 Knights and graue Gentlemen of note Iustices of peace, tooke her seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall examinations, when in the generall there could not be one found that differed in a sillable; nay though some of them threatned her with what vengeance God would stir vp for her in hell, and plagues here vpon earth, if she persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to be a lyer, and a murtherer, both which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in her (by the death of <hi>Dels</hi> wife and her sonne) if she perseuered in this testimony.

The honest man had scarse béen departed from her halfe an houre, but hée felt himselfe, as if he had béen set into your scotch-boote, or spanish strappado, or your <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> was nothing to it, sometimes in a pestiferous heat, at others, a chill cold, but at al times in continual aches, &amp; wracking of his limbs as if the Diuell had set him on his Tentors to make broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth of him.

When one of his neighbors comming in neighborly loue to visit him, he began to open his mind to him, that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded himselfe, by such a one she was bewitched, and hée was as faithfully perswaded, that if he could but haue 2 or 3 good scratches at her face, wherby he might draw blood of her, he should recouer presently, his neighbour aduised him by some wile to send for her home, yet (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> betwéen them both held vnconuenient, for that either suspecting her selfe, or for not being friends she would not come) that in the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his neighbor would haue this sicke man caried in a chaire, &amp; lodged in his house, and in the morning his wife, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knew she was good friends withal) should by some wile or another draw her theher, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he of himself were not stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g inough to scratch her, he (as he held charily) wold help him.

Nay, as for the comming out (answerd the fellow) I throwd it in aboue, &amp; it shal come out beneath, &amp; then thou shalt haue some of it, if thou wilt, because I am in hope it will poyson thée.
