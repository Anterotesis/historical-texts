            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE LORD hath broken the ſtaff of the wicked, and the Scepter of the Rulers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. HE who ſmote the People in wrath with a continual ſtroke, he that ruled the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Anger, is perſecuted, and none hindreth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The whole earth is at reſt, and is quiet: they break forth into ſinging.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Yea the ſir-trees rejoyce at thee, and the Cedars of Lebanon, <hi>ſaying.</hi> Since thou are laid down, no ſeller is come up againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Hell from beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming: it ſtirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth, it hath raiſed up from their Thrones all the Kings of the Nations.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. All they ſhall ſpeak, and ſay unto thee, Art thou alſo become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noiſe of thy viols: the worm is ſpread under thee, and the worms cover thee.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, ſon of the morning? <hi>How</hi> art thou cut down to the ground, who didſt weaken the Nations?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For thou haſt ſaid in thine heart, I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my Throne above the ſtars of God: I will ſit alſo upon the Mount of the Congregation, in the ſides of the North.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. I will aſcend above the heights of the Clouds, I will be like the moſt high.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Yet thou ſhalt be brought down to Hell, to the ſides of the Pit.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. They that ſee thee ſhall narrowly look upon thee, and conſider thee, ſaying, Is this the Man that made the Earth to tremble, that did ſhake Kingdoms?</p>
                  <p n="17">17. That made the world as a wilderneſs, and deſtroyed the Cities thereof, that opened not the Houſe of his Priſoners?</p>
                  <p n="18">18. All the Kings of the Nations, even all of them lie in Glory, every one in his own houſe.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But thou art caſt out of thy Grave like an abominable Branch: and as the raiment of thoſe that are ſlain, thruſt through with a sword, that go down to the ſtones of the pit, as a Carcaſe troden under feet.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Thou ſhalt not be joyned with them in Burial, becauſe thou haſt deſtroyed thy land, and ſlain thy people: the ſeed of evil doers ſhall never be renowned.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Prepare ſlaughter for his Children, for the Iniquity of their Fathers, that they do not riſe nor poſſeſs the land, nor fill the face of the world with Cities.</p>
