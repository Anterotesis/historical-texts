            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

were so many waies superfluous, that we shall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
leave it to the experience of sober and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
minds, than injure the High <hi>Elogiums</hi>
given of both the greatest and wisest <hi>Antients</hi>
and <hi>Moderns,</hi> by a disadvantagious Repetition
of them. And for to say any thing concerning the Countrey, <unclear>which</unclear>
was the Scene of the actions here represented, we conceive it needless
and improper, in regard we are immured by one Sea, breath one air,
speak one Tongue, and now closed together by an happy Coalition
under one Government.</p>
            <p>The proper work therefore is to offer what can be said of the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and the <hi>Author,</hi> and so dismiss the <hi>Reader</hi> to the Entertainment
of the Book it self. For his manner of Writing, though he treat of
things that are rather many than great, and trouble some than glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet he hath brought so much of the main together, as it may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
said, none of that Nation hath done before him: And for his
way of handling it, he hath sufficiently made it appear, how conversant
he was with the Writings of Venerable Antiquity, and how generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he hath emulated them by an happy imitation; for the purity of his
Language is much above that Dialect he writ in; his Descriptions

of some passages necessary to be foreknown.</p>
            <p>The direct Royal Line of <hi>Scotland</hi> failing in <hi>Alexander</hi> III.
(Son of the II. of that name) who when he a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had lost both his wife, and all his hopeful and numerous
issue, nothing remaining of it, saving a Girl to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
brought to <hi>Hungonan</hi> King of <hi>Norway.</hi> The Nobility
hereupon meet at <hi>Scone,</hi> and put the Kingdom into the hands
of six Persons. <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> sends to demand
the Daughter Grandchild in marriage, as next Heir of the
Crown. This was agreed unto, Embassadours sent for her,
but the death of the Lady frustrated all that Negotiation. The
death of this <hi>Margarite</hi> (so was she called) was the firebrand
that set <hi>England</hi> on fire, and had almost destroyed <hi>Scotland;</hi>
For two Competitors declared themselves both powerful, and
of great Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and strongly supported with
Forein Confederacies; for <hi>Iohn Baliol</hi> had engaged the <hi>English</hi>
Interest, and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> the <hi>French:</hi> But to be a little clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
we must look back; The line thus failing they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to run back to the line of <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi>

who made no claim. Now thus it stood, <hi>Dornagil</hi>
(the wife of <hi>Baliol</hi>) claim'd it as grandchild by the Eldest
Daughter, and <hi>Bruce</hi> as great Grandchild by the second, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
It was not fit that Daughters should inherit when there
were Sons to represent the Ancestor; <hi>Baliol</hi> he was neerer, as
being in the second degree, and the other but in the third:
The Controversie growing high and boysterous, and the
Power and Interests of both parties at home being equally
formidable and dangerous, they resolved to refer it to King
<hi>Edward,</hi> who comming to <hi>Berwick</hi> and calling Lawyers to
his Assistance, pretends all Equity, but rais'd up eight other pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Competitors, the better to weakon the claim of the other
two, and so handled the business whilst the Lawyers were
slowly consulting, that (<hi>Bruce</hi> having refused to accept the
Crown in Homage and Tribute from <hi>England</hi>) he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

(upon his acceptance of those conditions) <hi>IOHN BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIOL</hi>

after an appeal being made against him to King <hi>Edward</hi> by

where he sate to answer, but being inforced by the King so
to do, became so aliened in his affections from the <hi>English,</hi>
that a new quarrel breaking out between the <hi>French</hi> and the
<hi>English,</hi> and both by their Embassadours Courting the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Amity, it was resolved to adhere to the <hi>French,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

Force, <hi>Edward</hi> enraged at this (having obtained a Truce for
some few Moneths with the <hi>French</hi>) assails <hi>Berwick</hi> by Sea,
but with some loss, which enflames him the more, summons
<hi>Baliol,</hi> who refuses, pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rumoured as affecting the Royalty, and brought him such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
among the <hi>Brucos</hi> and <hi>Cumins,</hi> that they were resolved by
any means to ruin him, as disdaining that the fortune of the

whilst <hi>Edward</hi> regained the lost places; but the <hi>Scots</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

to put all upon the Dy; and made a general insurrection, to
oppose which King <hi>Edward</hi> sent <hi>Ralph Conyers,</hi> with a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

            <p>And here (to digress a little) from these cruel carnages, might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
arise some pretty questions, as, Where allegiance and obedience
begins and determins? who are properly Rebels, or Lawful Enemies?
how far the faith of a Nation, or particular men, are concluded in the
Oath of their Prince to a Foreiner? and what Limits Conquerours
ought to observe to Subjects, not naturally born so? and how far they, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

in the shortness of a Preface, or Rigor of an Epitome, we shall
dismiss at this Time without any further disquisition. Onely at the
present we will raise one Note from this Example of unfortunate
Courage, How apt great minds are, even out of false appearances of
good of their Countrey (the most powerful charm upon the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
spirits) to rush upon the most violent and dangerous efforts,
though it may be their Countrey, by a great deal of devastation and
blood, be made a loser by it; and some Territories are so seated, that
it is the more happy for them to be under the shade and protection of
a greater and more powerful, than be left naked to their own wants,
and devastation of prevailing neighbours, under the Notion of
preserving an imaginary, Antient, and Notional Liberty, which once

who having caused himself (after he had staied for the

               <note place="margin">1306.</note>
notwithstanding his Endeavours at first to strengthen
himself, by the enmity of the <hi>Cumins,</hi> and timorousness of
his own Followers, was routed by <hi>Edwards</hi> Lieutenants, and
forced to the Hills, and for a long time lurkt in great misery, to
the great ruin and slaughter of his Family and party; but
making together some little force, took <hi>Carrick</hi> and <hi>Inn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:51978:5"/>
by surprisal, and by this means augmented his Train, and
withstood the daring of <hi>Cumin</hi> Earl of <hi>Bughan,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him with a Considerable strength of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotish</hi>
forces, and though a Treaty were desired, would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
growing numerous by the accession of other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
persons. <hi>Edward</hi> the I, dying in an intended expedition
thither, left it to <hi>Edward</hi> II. his Son, who hearing some trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

which notwithstanding <hi>Robert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> though sick and forced to

it self, and a little after, by means of his Brother <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Sterlin</hi> upon Conditions. <hi>Edward</hi> thereupon enters
with a great Army, and many forein auxiliaries; But had
a great defeat at <hi>Bannocks-burn,</hi> which occasioned the
loss of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and <hi>Bruces</hi> confirmation in Parliament,
the declaring of <hi>Edward</hi> (his Brother) to be heir, in case of
<hi>Roberts</hi> want of Issue Male, as also making of him King of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> at the request of some of the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

furnished him with some forces for that attempt, yet in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
he and all his followers were cut to pieces. Some few
years after were spent in light skirmishes and incursions, and
<hi>Thomas Randolph</hi> obtained the battel called the <hi>White,</hi>
and quieted the <hi>English. Robert,</hi> this time of Repose,
conven'd the Nobles, intending to determine the rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances,
which many men had unjustly usurped in the times
of Rapine and Licence; This brooded a Conspiracy, which

               </gap>eing detected, a meeting was appointed at <hi>Perth,</hi> where, by
the Conviction of their own Papers, many were executed,
some pardon'd; but none drew more pitty from the Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
than <hi>David Brechin,</hi> the Kings Sisters Son, whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,

<hi>
                  <q>From whence we may consider, That to be a Traytor, is not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to engage in Treason, but to conceal it is to foment it: for if in
private Friendships it is infidelity not to reveal a danger to a
friend, it holds stronger as to the Magistrate, who is not only our
Common Friend, but our Parent and Tutor; since the seeds of all
Treasons (like them of Vegetables, lurking qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

where as the Sovereign Power, enlivening and peiroing all, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
the more Noble things, and only discovers the imperfection
of the meaner.</q>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time a Legate comming from <hi>Rome,</hi> armed
<pb facs="tcp:51978:5"/>
with all the Thunderbolts of that See (whose force, even that
age had wit enough to discern) to threaten them into a peace
with <hi>England,</hi> but missing of his Errand, the <hi>Scots</hi> followed
him with an Army, and marcht as far as <hi>Stainmore.</hi> The K.
of <hi>England,</hi> in revenge, raises an Army so potent and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that it might be supposed they came for absolute victory,
not uncertain hazard. <hi>Robert</hi> therefore (like a wise Captain)
considering that it was Stratagem not force that must preserve
him safe from so great a storm, caused all the Cattel to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
into the avious retreats of the Hills, lest they might be
serviceable to the Enemy, who, confident of their strength,
peirced <hi>Scotland,</hi> and endeavoured to draw him and his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of their Holes: But having wasted all about (sparing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Churches) and wanting Victuals, were forced to retire.
<hi>Bruce,</hi> knowing this disorderly retreat, pursues them as far as
<hi>York,</hi> and, by a great defeat, was Master of their Baggage,
and some Considerable Prisoners; the great occasion of which
was imputed to Sir <hi>Andrew Barcley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> who was
therefore degraded. This begat two Embassyes, one to the
Papacy, for a Reconciliation to it, and the other to <hi>France,</hi>
for a Renovation of the old League, both which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with equal easiness, with this addition to the latter,
That the King of <hi>France</hi> should be Umpire in controversies
concerning the Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi> About these times (saies
Excellent <hi>Buchanan)</hi> the Family of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> (since so
great in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and pernicious to England) took their rise,
one of them upon a Quarrel and murder of an <hi>English</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
flying to <hi>Robert</hi> for Protection, who gave him lands,
which retain the name to this day; the <hi>Spensers</hi> (upon whose
account this quarrel arose) were soon after discomposed, and
ruined, and <hi>Edward</hi> himself dethroned, and (as is said) mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at <hi>Pontfract</hi> Castle, by means of his wife, and <hi>Edward</hi>
his Son succeeded, the III. of that name; <hi>Bruce</hi> in the
mean time, composing himself to the cares of Peace, by Act
of Parliament settles the Inheritance of the Kingdom upon
his Son (though a Child) and in case of his decease, to <hi>Robert
Stuart</hi> his Grandchild by his Daughter, and for preventing
any pretences of <hi>Baliol</hi> (being then old and miserable in
<hi>France</hi>) a full release of all his Claim,<note place="margin">1320.</note> but the active young
<hi>Edward</hi> filling them with the terrour of a new <hi>Bruce,</hi> repaired
the defects of his age, and travels, by substituting <hi>Thomas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Randolph</hi> his Vice-Roy, whom, with <hi>Iames Dowglas,</hi> he sent
with a flying Army of Horse, into <hi>England,</hi> the better to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the prevailing force they were to expect, and it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
accordingly, for after tedious Marches, and hardships on
both sides, they parted without a stroke, saving onely that
<pb facs="tcp:51978:6"/>
               <hi>Dowglas</hi> with two hundred Horse, beat up the Quarters of
the <hi>English</hi> Camp, and cut (as is said) two Ropes of the Kings
Tent, and made a good Retreat; this begat a Truce for
three years, and afterwards (1328.) a dishonorable Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a Parliament at <hi>Southampton</hi> of all the <hi>Scotish</hi> privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and independencyes of that <hi>Crown</hi> (for which some
after smarted) with the Concession of some Counties, and
Rendition of Monuments, the <hi>Scots</hi> paying thirty thousand
<hi>Marks: Bruce</hi> finding himself wasted by age and toil, left
the Tuition of the Nonage of his Son to <hi>Randolph</hi> and <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas,</hi>
retiring himself to the Abby of <hi>Kilross,</hi> confirming
the Settlement of the Kingdom upon his Son <hi>David</hi> (then 8
years old) and <hi>Stuart,</hi> as he had done before, leaving these
three Counsells behind him <hi>(Illustrious Spirits that have long
moved in great Orbs, being best measured, when they are falling below
their Horizon.</hi>) 1. Not to let any man solely command the
<hi>Aebneae.</hi> 2. Never to put all their Strength at one hazard
with the <hi>English.</hi> 3. Never to make long Truces with them.
The first being to be feared by their power at Sea. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
for the Fertility, Power and Numbers of the <hi>English.</hi>
The third, to prevent the Enervation of a long Peace. Thus
he dyed, leaving Charge with <hi>Dowglas</hi> to convey his heart
to the <hi>Holy Land</hi> (whither himself had designed an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)

               <q>A Prince, that mounting the Throne over the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses of his neerest kindred, encountring with the greatest difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and calamities of a Countrey opprest by powerful and martial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, bravely struggled with the disadvantages, and left behind him the Character of a great Captain, and a prudent Prince, and such an one as whose Reputation relies upon his single virtue, unlesse you will say he had the assistance of the heads and hands of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors and Captains, yet even in the chusing of One, and the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Other, it must be confest he was a man excellently squared out for Government, and a man the most fit to arrest our Conquests in that Nation.</q>

               <q>Yet, by the way, we shall take up one Remark, How much the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and reputation of any people, depends upon the Conduct of their
Supreme Governour; and we cannot have better instance, than by
reflecting upon the preceding History. <hi>Edward I.</hi> (worthily called
<hi>Coeur de Lion)</hi> brought them in their greatest power upon their knees;
His Son (an effeminate and weak Prince, enchanted with Flatteries,
and lost in Sof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ny; His Son, for a time (which we must call his
pupillage of War, he did such wonders afterwards) was unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and all this through the Opposition, Courage and Conduct of
<pb facs="tcp:51978:6"/>
one unfortunate person; And indeed, upon survay of all Histories,
we shall find, that the ability and excellency of the Prince hath been the
most powerful ascendent of the Genius of a Nation, and that the
Governing mind of the World, when ever it determines any to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
actions, raises up such Leaders, as by their wisdom, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
may lead them to the performance of its own secret determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And again, How infectious the example of a bad or weak Prince,
which, like an unhappy contagion, perverts and infects the manners
of a people, and so much the more easily seduces them, by how much
the mind of man is inclinable to understand better things, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the worse, and most people are more easily emasculated into Vice,
than tutured into Virtue.</q>

            <p>This Prince being gone to his long home,<lb/>
DAVID BRUCE<lb/>
His Son, succeeding, his Coronation was deferred till permission
could be had from <hi>Rome</hi> to make the business more solemn.<note place="margin">1331.</note>
The first thing memorable in his reign was the suppression of
a sort of Thieves, by <hi>Randolph,</hi> who (if you will believe the

so, as he eluded another invasion, though he dyed soon after

being for his lewd life excommunicated, slew the Bishop of

discontents of the People and Exiles, the want of the

Bruce,</hi> L. of <hi>Carid</hi> and <hi>Galloway,</hi> forsook his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and submitted to the Conquerour, who, by this means,
became so besotted with a contempt of the Enemy, and so
neglected Discipline; which being known to the Vice-Roy,
he sent a party of Horse under <hi>Archibald Dowglas,</hi> and others,
who beat up his quarters, and routed them, himself escaping

<hi>Sterlin</hi> going to a Fair at <hi>Dunfermling,</hi> the besieged let the

to retreat, and the rather in design of a <hi>French</hi> War; but

which after four Moneths stay was reduced, and a little after
<hi>Sterlin,</hi> and (by Stratagem) the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh; Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
making a happy Expedition into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and
taking <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> regaining all their ground, except <hi>Berwick.</hi> In the year 1342. <hi>David,</hi> after 9. years stay,
returns, and after quieting of some dissentions, resolves an
expedition into <hi>England,</hi> though disswaded by his Council,
by reason of want of Victuals, making <hi>Iohn Randolph</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
himself going <hi>incognito,</hi> and for two Moneths together
depopulated <hi>Northumberland,</hi> but after, declaring himself
General, made a second Expedition, which met little opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by reason of the diversion of the <hi>English</hi> strength in
<hi>France,</hi> a third to as little purpose. A Peace for two years
was treated of, which <hi>David</hi> would not accept, without
the consent of <hi>Philip.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who having a great defeat
given him by <hi>Edward,</hi> excited him, by all means, to an invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which his friendship perswaded him to (though things
at home were not in Order) and having Marcht so far as the
County of <hi>Durham,</hi> had his Army routed, and was there
taken Prisoner; The <hi>English</hi> limits being enlarged as far as
<hi>Cockburn,</hi> and all <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a manner, depopulated by the Plague and deadly fewds, yet by the encouragement of <hi>Iohn</hi>
Son of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, some were still making In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions,
and an unsuccessful attempt on <hi>Berwick.</hi> By this
time <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was Prisoner to <hi>Edward,</hi> whom the
<hi>Scots</hi> courted as full of Honour and Victory, for the delivery
of their own, who (by the Mediation of the Pope) for a great
sum of Money, was redeemed, and set free, after eleven years
Captivity, and at his Rerurn punished some of those who
had deserted him at <hi>Durham,</hi> and endeavoured to remove the
succession of the Crown, from <hi>Robert Stuart,</hi> to whom he
was some years after reconciled. The last five years of his
reign were spent in appeasing domestick fewds, and are nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a great inundation and plague; but things quieting in
the year 1363. he retired into a Monastery, and declared (in
case of his decease) <hi>Edward,</hi> or his Son, for their King. This,
whether it was caused by some former Oath, or from weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of War, or design of quiet to Both Nations, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:51978:8"/>
universally disliked by the Estates it was like to breed a
dissention, which his wisdome closed up. All was now quiet
but the Highlanders, whom he appeased by their mutual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
when Fate in the 47. year of his age, the 39. of his Reign,
came to Eternal Rest,<note place="margin">1370.</note> in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in the year
1370.</p>
            <p>By this King and his competitor <hi>Baliol</hi> (who went out in the snuff)
we may in part measure the interests and advantages of Princes; the
one by the assistance of a Potent Neighbour did unexpected things, yet
failed in Conduct and Management; the other, wanting neither spirit
nor vigilancy, became a Captive and ineffectuall Prince; which may
give us occasion to observe, That though Travel do best inrich the
mind with variety of observation, yet it is not so successfull in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for their Minds not being exempted from humane weakness, may
draw in tinctures and prejudices not consisting with the humors of
them they are to govern, and by knowing abroad grow strangers at
home, neglecting to study the humor of the People they ore set over;
the disquisition of which is certainly the greatest Mystery and Chain of
Government: The People being an unruly Beast, easily led, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to be forc'd, and the Magick that so powerfully forces them, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a piercing, discerning, flattering, or eluding their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Davids</hi> Fundamental fault, which, like Error in the
first concoction, multiplied it self through the rest of his Reign. He
was bred a Stranger, knew not the disposition of his people, met
with troublesome Times, and a Formidable Enemy, and therefore he
may very well be charged with three oversights; First, after three,
not unfortunate, incursions into <hi>England,</hi> then imployed by <hi>France,</hi>
not to rest there with his proportion of glory and prey: But secondly,
By the allurement of the <hi>French</hi> King, and that upon a score of
Friendship; whereas Friendships of Princes and Private Men are
different, the one being particular, the other diffusive and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Millions; besides, that Princes are to consider the interest of
their States, not their private inclinations. And for the third, To make
an invasion, when he left so high discontents in a turbulent people
behind, besides those of his own, that by force, obligation or interest
were devoted to a victorious Enemy, and assured of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
was very imprudential, both in going to find out an Enemy,
whose force he knew not, and leaving behind him Subjects, whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and force he understood not.</p>
            <p>But no more to disturb his ashes; Had he had another Countrey,
another Enemy, another Education, and other Circumstances of
Time, he might have been as glorious as any of his Predecessors, it
is the more probable (though the Change of Time does often heighten
and aggravate the Vices of Princes) there is nothing either Cruel or
Vicious recorded of him. So that even in the severest sense we may
<pb facs="tcp:51978:8"/>
dismiss him with this Character, That he rather was unhappy than
sloathful in his Government.</p>
            <p>This mans eyes being for ever closed, the Nobility appointed
a meeting for the accepting of<lb/>
ROBERT STUART<lb/>
For their King, as he was formerly designed, who appeased
the dissention of the Earl <hi>Dowglas</hi> by marrying his Daughter
to the Earls Son. His first two years were spent in making
incursions upon the <hi>English;</hi> the Kings wife dying in the next
year, he maries <hi>Elizabeth Moor</hi> his own Concubine, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to legitimate the children he had by her, and them he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with Titles, and declared his Successors; two years
after an attempt is made on <hi>Berwick,</hi> but in vain, and <hi>Talbots</hi>
Expedition frustrated, but a Truce for three years was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
which being expired, little quarrels awoke again,
and occasioned the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> to be sent thither with
a great Army and Navy, though not with the same fortune
at Sea as at Land, which occasioned the return of the Duke,
who was pursued by some small depredations of <hi>William Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas,</hi>
though his Son of the same name, and some others,
during a Treaty, made an inroad as far as <hi>Newcastle. Robert</hi>
having assistance from <hi>France,</hi> is forced to retire, especially
upon the news of <hi>Richards</hi> (Grand-child and Successor to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the third,) marching with a great Army, fac'd the <hi>Scots</hi>
with an unbloody bravery. The <hi>Scots</hi> designing to besiege
<hi>Roxburgh,</hi> but quarrelling with the <hi>French,</hi> it came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
which occasioned so much dissention, that it arrived
at this pass, That the <hi>French</hi> should pay for their plunder and
be dismist, their general remaining as hostage for their satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
whilst <hi>William Dowglas</hi> (who had maried the Kings
Daughter) makes an expedition into <hi>Ireland,</hi> plunders <hi>Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi>
and knowing his Father to be imployed against the
<hi>English,</hi> hastens to his assistance. The attempt was in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
of <hi>Richard</hi> then struggling with Domestick difficulties;
But they of <hi>Scotland</hi> being unable to live without War and
Rapine, they were resolved to make a business of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King, and his eldest Son were infirm, came to choose
(privately) the second for their Leader; but this being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the <hi>English,</hi> they altered their Resolution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to divide themselves, one by the way of <hi>Berwick,</hi> the
other of <hi>Carlisle,</hi> the former party led by <hi>Dowglas</hi> gave a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
to the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> with the loss of his Life (the other
not having the like Success) who impatiently fighting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the comming up of the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>'s Forces, lost
his own and indangered the others. This happened in the
year 1388. at <hi>Otterb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spent with age, makes <hi>Robert</hi> his second Son his Vice-Roy,
(his eldest being unactive) who to affront <hi>Peircey,</hi> that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lessen the loss, led in an Army, but after facing retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with some little depredation. Soon after a Peace was
mediated between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> in which <hi>Robert,</hi>
without consent of a Parliament, would not be comprized;
But his doubts were all resolved by death in the year 1390.
when he had lived 74. years, and reigned 19. being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the grave with such acts of Barbarisin, as have been
frequent in that place.</p>
            <p>He is a Prince we find little said of, as to his person, and possibly
best to be considered in the Negative; We find many things done by
his Captains, not by him; which notwithstanding we may rather at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the stirring and violent humour of that age, than either
his age, want of Genius, or love of quiet; yet herein appears some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of his Character, that meeting with turbulent times, and a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
people, he met not with any Insurrections, and was a gainer; and
though he did it by other hands, we must suppose that their Motions
were directed by his Brain, that communicated Motion and Spirits
unto them, since the Minds of Kings, like the first Mover, turn all
about, yet are not perceived to move, and it was no humane wit said
their hearts were unscruitable.</p>
            <p>The same year his Eldest Son <hi>Iohn</hi> was called to succeed,
who thinking that name ominous to Kings (and there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not examples) as of him of <hi>England,</hi> and him of <hi>France,</hi>
and fancying somewhat of the felicity of the two former
<hi>Roberts,</hi> was crowned King by the name of<lb/>
ROBERT the III.</p>
            <p>This man being unactive, the weight of the Government
rested upon his Brother <hi>Robert.</hi> The first seven years of his
Reign past in a calm with <hi>England,</hi> by reason of two Truces,
but not without some fierce fewds among his Subjects, one
whereof was very memorable between <hi>Thomas Dunbar</hi> Earl
of <hi>Murray,</hi> and <hi>Iames Lindsay</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> and was
most high, insomuch that seeing the difficulty of reducing
them, he resolved to make this proposition to them, That
300. of each side, should try it by dint of Sword before the
King, the conquered to be pardoned, and the Conquerour
advanced; This being agreed on, a place was appointed on
the Northside of <hi>St. Iohnstons,</hi> but when they came to join
battel, there was one of one side missing, whom when his
party could not supply, and none would relinguish the other,
a Tradesman stept out, and for half a <hi>French Crown,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of maintenance for his life, filled up the company. The
fight was furious, but none behaved himself more furiously
than the Mercinary Champion, who they say was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb facs="tcp:51978:9"/>
cause of the Victory, for of his side there remained ten
grievously wounded, the other party had but one left, who
not being wounded, yet being unable to sustain the shock of
the other, threw himself into the <hi>Tey</hi> and escaped. By this
means the fiercest of two <hi>Clanns</hi> being cut off, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
being headless,<note place="margin">1398.</note> were quiet. Two years after the King
in Parliament made his two Sons Dukes, a title then first
brought into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Next year <hi>Richard</hi> the second of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
being forced to resign, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth succeeded, in
the beginning of whose reign, though the Truce was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the seeds of War began to bloom out, and upon this
occasion, <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> had betroathed <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his
Daughter to <hi>David</hi> the Kings eldest Son: <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of
<hi>Dowglas,</hi> not brooking this, gets a vote of Parliament for
revocation of this mariage, and by the power of <hi>Robert,</hi> the
Kings Brother, made a mariage between <hi>Mary</hi> his Daughter,
and <hi>David,</hi> and, giving a greater sum, got it confirmed in
Parliament. The Earl of <hi>March,</hi> nettled at this, demands
redress, but being not heard, leaves the Court, and with his
Family and Friends goes into <hi>England,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Peircey,</hi>
an utter Enemy of the <hi>Dowglasses,</hi> wasts <hi>March,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
depradating the lands of the <hi>Dowglasses.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> an enemy, and send to demand him
up of the <hi>English,</hi> who deny to surrender him. This made
<hi>Hot-spur Peircey</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> make several incursions into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> till at last they were repulsed at <hi>Linton</hi>-Bridge by
the <hi>Dowglasses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1400.</note> This was about the year four hundred, at
which time War was denounced, and the <hi>English</hi> entered
with a great Army, took <hi>Haddington</hi> and <hi>Lieth,</hi> and laid
siege to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle, <hi>David</hi> the Kings Son being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, which the new Governour, ambitiously delaying to
relieve, the <hi>English,</hi> satisfyed with the terrour they brought,
retired again. After which <hi>March</hi> did not cease his little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions;
which to be revenged of, <hi>Dowglas</hi> divided his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into two Squadrons, the first to <hi>Halyburton,</hi> who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from <hi>Barmborough,</hi> with some prey; the second and
greater to <hi>Patrick Hepburn,</hi> who unwarily roving with his
prey, was set on by the <hi>English,</hi> and with all the youth of
<hi>Lothian,</hi> put to the Sword. To revenge this, <hi>Dowglas</hi>
gets together 10000. men, and passing beyond <hi>Newcastle,</hi>
met with young <hi>Peircey,</hi> &amp;c. who at <hi>Homildon,</hi> a little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the year 1401<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave him and his
Party such a considerable defeat, as <hi>Scotland</hi> had not receiv'd
the like for a long time. This put <hi>Peircey</hi> in hopes to reduce
all beyond the <hi>Fryth,</hi> but the troubles at home withdrew
him from that design. By this <hi>Annabel</hi> the Queen dying,
<pb facs="tcp:51978:10"/>
               <hi>David</hi> her Son, who by her means had been restrained,
broke out into his natural disorders, and committed all kind
of Rapine and Luxury. Complaint being brought to his
Father, he commits him to his Brother the Governor (whose
secret design being to root out the off-spring) the business
was so ordered, as that the young man was shut up in <hi>Falkland</hi>
Castle, to be starved, which yet was for a while delayed,
one woman thrusting in some thin Oaten Cakes at a chink, &amp;
another giving him milk out of her papps through a Trunck.
But both these being discovered, the youth being forced to
tear his own members, dyed of a multiplied death; which
murder being whispered to the King, and the King enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
after it, was so abused by the false representations of his
Brother, that grief and imprecations was all the Relief he
had left him, as being now retired sickly to <hi>Bote</hi>-Castle, and
unable to punish him. The King being solicitous of <hi>Iames</hi> his
younger Son, is resolved by the example of the good usage of
<hi>David,</hi> to send him to <hi>Charls</hi> the sixt of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Shipping at the <hi>Basse,</hi> as he past by the Promontory of
<hi>Flamborough,</hi> whether forc'd by tempest, or that he was <hi>Seasick,</hi>
he was forced to land, taken by the <hi>English,</hi> and detained,
notwithstanding the allegation of a Truce of eight years,
and his Fathers Letters. And though it came to the Privy-Council
to be debated, yet his detention was carried in the
Affirmative. This advantage he had by his Captivity, that
he was well and carefully educated; but the News so struck
his Father, that he had almost presently dyed, but being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into his Chamber, with voluntary abstinence and sorrow
he shortned his life, three daies longer, <hi>viz.</hi> to the first of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi>

raise him to preferment at Court. But his wit being of a greater
delicacy, could not engage on the toyls and difficulties of that study,
as being wholly enclined to ease and retirement, and a prosecution
of the easier and softer entertainments of the Muses. In this humour

his Friends.) Yet though he retreated from all the World, yet

we have of him is this Book, and his Poems, of which when they are
to be published, you all have have better information. In this manner

of Rebellion, the King having his party within the Realm,
by the assistance of the <hi>English</hi> would keep under the other
Factions; and thus the Estate by both being made weak, it
would be a fair breach for a Conquest, and the annexing that
Kingdome to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>

though they would have dismissed him freely, in respect of the
Dowry of his <hi>Queen,</hi> which was not delivered, having use of

the more to cover the injustice of his Captivity, they thought
it expedient to set a Ransom upon him.</p>

a sufficient sum of moneys their King might return and enjoy
his own Liberty; the one half to be paid in hand, able Hostages
remaining in <hi>England</hi> till the other half was fully discharged.
The Ransom agreed upon was <hi>four hundred thousand Merks,</hi>

to take away all Discords, abolish Factions, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Oppression, as no Forein Power hath attempted ought
against you hitherto, so that ye should not endeavour ought
one against another, nor any thing against the weal publick

himself to a civil and regular form of life, especially you
(my Nobles) think vertue and civility true Nobility, that to
be accounted noblest which is best, and that a mans own worth
begets true glory. By these and the obedience to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
your ancestor acquired what ye now enjoy, there is no
stronger means to keep the goods acquired from a Prince,
than the same by which they were first purchased, which is
still obeying. Though by leagues, Factions, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of all true Policy and Order of Government, Man
may imagine he can shun the Judicatories of Man, let none
how great soever, conceive he can save his wrongs unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

count Authority, honesty and virtue idle names, nor reckon
that right which ye may winn or hold by dint of Sword.

answer to God, and for you my Subjects do so ye shall an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No mans Greatness shall appall me in doing right, nor the
meaness of any make him so contemptible that I shall not give
ear to his grievance; for I will strive to do justice on Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
and support the innocent to my uttermost.</p>
            <p>Here he easily found the power which the Presence of a

of the Parliament, a mutual oath passed between him and his

            <p>That same day on which their fatall sentence was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the two young men <hi>Walter Stuart</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Sonnes
to the Duke, were taken forth to the Hill which ariseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Castle of <hi>Sterling,</hi> and had their heads cut off.
The day following <hi>Mordoch</hi> Duke of <hi>Albanie</hi> late Governour,
with <hi>Duncane Lennox</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was beheaded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:51978:16"/>The deaths of these Noblemen, were so far from breeding
any distaste in the common People, that out of their depraved
disposition and envy against their betters, they flowted at
their fall, reproached their insolencyes, delighted in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution:
and as much without reason railed on them when
they were dead, as they had flattered them being alive.</p>
            <p>Whether by the wisdome of the King it hath fallen out,
who caused abolish the Indictment (being against persons so
near unto him in blood) or bluntness of those times, which
thought such clear evidences needed no Records, the
particulars of the Attaindor of these great men are swallowed
up in dark oblivion.</p>
            <p>Moved at the Imprisonment of his Son, did <hi>Mordoch</hi> with
<hi>Lennox</hi> (hating him whom they had wronged) attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kings person, and that same very Treason which
afterward had success, was it then between the plot, and the
execution surprised, and in the very head cut off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Earl
of <hi>Athol,</hi> a man whose desires were both extremly wicked
unbounded, was a great actor in this Tragedy.</p>
            <p>Did the King, standing in fear of their extraordinary
greatness, bend his eyes upon the disposition of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
squaring their actions by the rule of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and weighing what, not how far they did offend? for
Princes quickly free themselves from their very shadows in
matter of jealousie of State. And they have great reason to
prevent such crimes which cannot be punished when they
are committed, nor should they expect to amend a mischief
when the Criminals are become Masters of their Judges.</p>
            <p>People believe not that any conjure against a Prince, till
they find the Treason to have taken effect, and distrust the
Plot till they see him dead. But the Death of such who
are suspected to be the Authors of disorders in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
spareth an infinite number of lives, and much civill
blood when they are first surprized, neither are too strict cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Law to be observed when a small delay may
abolish all observing of order and Laws.</p>
            <p>The Duke to raise his own reputation to the disadvantage of
the King with all secrecy of his intentions, had procured
himself a vast Authority with the Nobles, by a semblance of
liberality wasting the Patrimony of the Crown, as remitting
Treasons, restoring again Lands annexed to the Crown. He
had studied so conciliate to him the minds of the Commons,
that the desire of a King did not much touch them, using such
moderation in his proceedings that his Government seemed
unto many not only tolerable but desirable.</p>
            <p>He had essayed to draw the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> and had
drawn the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> to enter into a League with him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51978:17"/>
and these Noblemen then in the Castle of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> divided
the Nobility and made them break their Allegiance to the
King. Upon which attempt it seemeth that that Act of this
Kings second Parliament was made. That no Subjects should

been passed by such remissions, yet horrible and crying crimes
were not within the compass of such authority. Whilest he

gave full Authority to make Inquisition of the breach of poenal

appointed to be made, unto which the rest should be conform

            <p>The roughness of the times, and perpetual wars and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

advancement of the Commonwealth, and that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

all their beginning to these Times. Schools of learning were
sounded, to which great Liberties and priviledges were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

but none was so implacable as <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> Uncle and Tutor
to <hi>Miles Graham,</hi> the son of <hi>Eupheme,</hi> daughter to <hi>David</hi> Earl

            <p>Embassadors came also from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, not

            <p>Having Audience, the Lord <hi>Scrope</hi> spake before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
to this purpose:</p>
            <p>[<q>I am directed hither by my Master and his Council, about
a Business which concerneth the Honour and profit of the two
Kingdoms above any other which can be projected; and it is
the establishing of a perpetual Peace and Concord between
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51978:22"/>
them, and happily (when it shall please the higher Providence)
their uniting in one Body, under one Prince, one day. How
vain the attempting of this heretofore by Arms hath proved,
the world can but too well bear witness; the many proofs of
eithers valour against themselves having been but a lavish effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of humane Blood; the fairest way, easiest means to
make enmities cease and these ancient Quarrels, was begun
Sir, in your person, by the happy Marriage of the Daughter of
<hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and
Son to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and prosperously hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
these years past: Now that Peace may be lasting, and the
affections and minds of the two Nations soldered together, our
Request is, that this Alliance may be again renewed, by the
Marriage of your eldest Daughter with our young King, a most
fitting and equal match. And in seeking of her, we crave but
our own; She is descended of our Royal Stem, and if again
she be ingrafted in that stock out of which she sprang, it is but
natural. And you (my Lords) where can ye find a Match more
Honorable for both Nations? Where can ye finde a better and
more profitable Friendship then ours? Are we not a people in
habiting one Island, have we not both one Language, are we
not of like Habit and Fashion, of like quality and condition
of life, guarded and separated from the other World by the
great depths of the Ocean? What evil Customs have come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Country by your last Allyance with us? Nay what Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vility,
Policy, and laudable Fashions (to the confusion of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity)
have not followed hereupon? By this the Glory of
both Realms will encrease, either being sufficient not only to
furnish necessaries, but even all lawfull and moderate content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of life to support others. Besides that, an assurance of
Defence, Strength and Power to invade, ease in undergoing
publick Charges will hereby follow.</q>

            <p>
               <q>We are not ignorant that your Lady is designed for <hi>France;</hi>
but how long (alas) will ye continue prodigal of your blood
for the <hi>French?</hi> What have ye advantaged your selves by your
Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> save that they engage your bodies in their
Wars, and by conferring upon you unprofitable titles of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

of this Isle seemeth to cry unto us her Nurselings to stay
our cruel hands, no longer to be her desolation, and the wrack
one of another; not to pass over and neglect these fair occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of mutual Alliances, which will not only effectuate Truces
and Leagues amongst our selves, but at last bring a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Peace and Union; for by interchange of Marriages (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united) this Isle shall continue stronger by entertaining
Peace and Amity, then by all these Giant walls, Rampiers of
Mountains, and that huge ditch of Seas, by which Nature
hath environed and fortified her. Now that ye may know how
dearly we esteem your Friendship and Alliance, whereas
others go to take from you, we will give you <hi>Roxburgh, Berwick,</hi>
and all the lands between <hi>Tweed</hi> and <hi>Redcross.</hi> If shadows
prevail and prove stronger with you then essential reason,
and that ye disesteem our offer, losing this good occasion;
we as Neighbours and Friends entreat you, that ye do not
uphold the <hi>French,</hi> now in the Sun-set of their Fortunes, and
at their weakest; that ye would not shoulder this falling
Wall; but that ye would live quiet within your selves, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>The</hi> French Embassadour <hi>spoke to this purpose.</hi> It seemeth
strange to me that it should be questioned and fall within the Circle
of deliberation whether old, ever true and assured Friends; or old,
never trusted, and only Enemies, should in an honourable suit be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred:
whether ye should stand to a Nation which in your greatest
calamities never abandoned you, or embrace and be carryed away
with one which hath ever sought your overthrow. The <hi>English</hi> sue

between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> ye had scarce till now kept your
Name, less your Liberties; can ye prove so ungrateful as not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them who supported you? Can ye prove so unconstant, after so
many glorious wounds received in the defence of <hi>France,</hi> as coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to turn your backs upon her in her greatest need, defacing all the
Traces of your former fame and glory? with what countenances
could ye look upon those <hi>Scots,</hi> which at <hi>Vernueill</hi> and <hi>Cravant</hi>
in the Bed of honour <unclear>left</unclear> their Lives, if unrevenged ye should adhere
and join your selves to their Enemies and Killers? Now though ye
would forsake the <hi>French,</hi> at this time intangled in many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
not regarding their well being, nor be solicitous of their stan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding:
at least be carefull of your own.</p>
            <p>It cannot subsist with your well and safety, to suffer a bordering
Nation, alwaies at enmity with you, to arise to that height and
power by such an addition as is the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> so soon
as a State hath a Neighbour strong enough and able to subdue it, it
is no more to be esteemed a free Estate. The <hi>English</hi> are already
become so potent that no less than united forces of Neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes
will serve to stop the current of their fortune. Neglect not the
certain love of the <hi>French,</hi> your often tryed and antient friends
for the uncertain friendship and within a little time, forgotton Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liances
of the <hi>English</hi> your late reconciled Enemies.</p>
            <p>But it may be, after mutual marriages have one day joined your
two Kingdoms in one, they will seek no preheminency over your
State, nor make thrall your Kingdome, but be knit up with you in
a perfect union: Do not small brooks lose their Names when they
commix their Streams with mighty Rivers, and are not Rivers
ingolfed when they mingle their waters with the Seas? Ye enjoy now
a kind of mixed Government (my Lords) not living under absolute
Soveraignty; your King proceedeth with you more by Prayers and
requests than by Precepts and Commandements, and is rather your
Head than Soveraign, as ruling a Nation not conquered: But when
ye shall be joined in a Body with that Kingdom which is absolutely
royal and purely Monarchical, having long suffered the Laws of a
Conquerour, ye shall find a change and a terrible transformation.
The free mannaging of your own affairs shall be taken from you; Laws,
Magistracies, Honours shall depend on them, the wealth of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
shall be transferred to theirs; which to obey and prostrate your
selves unto, if ye be found stubborn, ye shall suffer as a Nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
be redacted in a Province, have Deputies and Governours
set over you, Garrisons in your strongest holds and Castles, and
by a Calm of Peace and Union receive more fearfull blowes than ye
could have suffered by any Tempest of war; The miseries of a most
lamentable Servitude. What courtesie can ye exsp<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

who contrary to all divine and human Laws detained your King
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51978:24"/>
eighteen years prisoner, and besides an exorbitant Ransom (as if
he had been taken in a lawfull war) did not without Hostages send
him home? We of <hi>France</hi> did never forsake you in your extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and we expect ye will assist us with all your power. They are in suit
of your Daughter, but it is long after she was assured unto
us; in claiming her we claim but our own, this time past ye have
only had the custody and education of her, yet if they be so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of your Alliance, God hath blessed you with more than this.
But it is not that which they sue for, it is to make you disclaim your
Friends, hate those which love you, and love them which hate you:
and they are working upon you as upon a rude unpolisht people. They
offer to render you <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are to be feared; they know it is in their own power to re-obtain
them when they please.</p>
            <p>As for that point wherein they would have you indifferent Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the blowes, and that it shall be profitable for you not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with this Warre, ye are too near engaged; neither is there any

               </gap>geable unto you; for, if ye be not of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ye may assure your selves that your Countrey shall remain a Prey
and Reward to the Conquerour, with content and applause of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
who is not bound to succour those who refused to assist and
help him in his necessities. Prove firm and constant to us your first
Confederates, combine your forces with ours, and by the assistance
of that supreme providence who pittieth at last the oppressed, we
have fair certainties and true hopes to cut so much work abroad
to the <hi>English,</hi> that they shall do little or no harm to you at
Home.</p>
            <p>The King and Nobles though it seemed more profitable for
the present time to follow the <hi>English</hi> (weighing their offers)
yet held it more advantageous and sure for comming times, to
follow the <hi>French,</hi> for if the <hi>English</hi> should make conquest of
<hi>France,</hi> the conquest of <hi>Scotland</hi> would scarce be one Moneths
work to their power? and for matter of allyance, God knows
how little Princes regard it, when occasion is offered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their power and Dominion. Thereupon they declare they
will not break the antient League and Peace they have kept

            <p>The <hi>English</hi> fleet had waited upon her, but (Providence so

Them they beset with fourscore Vessels, commanding the

when they would not accept of friendly answers, they fall to

Rears; the two Generals road about the Armies, remembring
them of their ancient valour, the wrongs received, the justness
of the Quarrel, the glory of the Victory, the shame of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
No sooner were they come within distance of joyning
when the sound of the Drums and Trumpets was out-noysed
by the shouts of the Assailants, who furiously ren-countred.
The Guns being about this time found out, were here first pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> in an open field. When
the fight with equal order had been long maintained on both
sides, now the <hi>Scots,</hi> then the <hi>English</hi> yielding ground, many
of the Commanders at length began to fall, most of the <hi>English.</hi>
Then was the <hi>Piercy</hi> constrained to be at once Commander and
Souldier, but ere he could be heard some Companies had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their backs, among the thickest throngs of which breaking
in, he found so great disorder, that neither by Authority, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
or Force he was able to stay their flying. Thus distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between the two courses of honour and shame, he is hurried
far from the place of Fight: And Victory declared her self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
for the <hi>Scots;</hi> which was not so great in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as in the death and captivity of some brave men. Of the
<hi>Scots</hi> two hundred Gentlemen and common Souldiers were
slain, amongst which was <hi>Alexander Elphinstoun,</hi> maintaining
the Battel with his sword, voice and wounds, and two other
Knights. Of the <hi>English</hi> died, Sir <hi>Henry Cliddisdail,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Ogle,</hi>
Sir <hi>Richard Piercy,</hi> with fifteen hundred Gentlemen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers, of which fourty were Knights, four hundred
were taken Prisoners.</p>
            <p>The King irritated by the way-laying of his Daughter, the
invading of his Borders, and encouraged not a little by this
little smile of Fortun at <hi>Popperden,</hi> it being more sure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
then repel dangers, and with the same Policies to defend
by which the Enemies offend, resolveth by open wars to invade
<hi>England.</hi> He was also stirred unto this by his intelligence from
his friends in <hi>France,</hi> who had brought greater matters to pass
then in so short a time could have been expected; for concealed
envy and old malice, bursting out between <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of <hi>Sommerset, Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>
being entred in friendship with King <hi>Charls,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> began
to be daily losers, and were put out of <hi>Paris</hi> and many Towns
of <hi>France.</hi> To this effect King <hi>Iames</hi> having raised an Army
cometh to <hi>Roxburgh</hi> (a Place fatal to his) and there besiegeth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51978:25"/>
the Castle of <hi>Marchmond,</hi> which is <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> it was valiantly
defended by Sir <hi>Ralph Gray:</hi> but when he was come so near the
end of his labours that they within the Castle were driven to
terms of Agreement and conditions for giving up the Fort the
Queen in great haste commeth to the Camp, representing to
her Husband a Conspiracy, the greatness of the peril of which,
if it were not sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>edily prevented, should endanger his Estate,
Person and Race. Whether she had any inckling of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
indeed, or contrived this to divert his Forces from the
Assault, and further harm of the <hi>English</hi> her Friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
it is uncertain. The King who found his imagination
wounded upon this point, after many doubtful resolutions and
conflicts in his thoughts, raiseth the Siege, disbandeth the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and accompanied with some chosen Bands of his most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds returneth back, to provide for his own safety. A
strange resolution, to disband an Army for a tale of Treason,
where could there be greater safety for a King then in an Army?
Yet have Conspiracies been often in Camps, and in his own
Time, <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> brother to <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of
<hi>York, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> with Sir <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> Knight, at the
instigation of the <hi>Daulphine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> for a great sum of money
conspired to murther <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, King of <hi>England,</hi> in the
midst of his Armies, if they had not been surprised. The
King feared all, because he had not yet heard the names of
any, but most the Army, by reason of the Nobility, many of
which, who liked not the present form of Government, were
irritated against Him. Were the Conspiracy a Rebellion, and
in general by them all, they were ready in Arms to maintain
their factions, and if upon suspition the King should attach any
(being secretly joyned in a league) He could hardly have med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with their persons, without a Civil War, which in regard
of his Engagement with <hi>England</hi> he endeavoured to spare; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
pensive, sad, he cometh to <hi>Perth,</hi> stayeth in the Covent
of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> named the <hi>Black-Friers</hi> (a place not far
from the Town Wall) endeavouring so secretly as was possible
to finde out the Conspiracy. But his close practising was not
unknown to the Conspirators, as that there was more peril to
resolve then execute a Treason, a distance of time between the
Plot and execution discovering and overthrowing the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise:
Hereupon they determine to hazard on the mischief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tryal or remedy could be thought upon.</p>
            <p>The Conspirators were <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> Uncle and Tutor to
<hi>Miles Graham, Robert Stuart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Nephew to <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi>
and one of the Kings sworn Domesticks: But he who gave
motion to all, was the Earl of <hi>Athole</hi> himself, the Kings Fathers
Brother, whose quarrel was no less then a pretended title and
claim to the Crown; which he formed and alledged thus. His
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51978:26"/>
Brother <hi>David</hi> and he were procreated by King <hi>Robert</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
on his first wife <hi>Eupheme Ross</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Ross,</hi>
and therefore ought and should have been preferred to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Crown, before King <hi>Iohn</hi> (named <hi>Robert</hi>) and
all the Race of <hi>Elizabeth Moor,</hi> who was but his second wife,
and next them but Heirs to King <hi>Robert</hi> the second.</p>
            <p>They were the eldest sons of King <hi>Robert</hi> after he was King,
<hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> being born when he was but in a private State,
and Earl of <hi>Strathern;</hi> for it would appear, that as a Son born
after his Father hath lost his Kingdom, is not esteemed for the
Son of a King, so neither he that is born before the Father be
a King. These reasons he thought sufficient, the King taken
away, to set him in the room of State. But considered not
how sacred the name of King is to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation; how a
Crown once worn quite taketh away what defects soever: and
that it was not easie to divest a King in present possession of a
Crown, who had his right from his Father and Grandfather,
with the Authority of a Parliament, approving his Descent,
and secluding all other; less came it in his thought, that those
children are legitimate, and lawfull which cannot be thrust
back and rejected, without troubling the common Peace of the
Country, and opening Gates to Forreign Invasions, Domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
disturbances, and all disorders, with an unsetled course of
Succession: the Common errour making the Right or Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athole</hi> animated by the Oracle of a Sooth-sayer of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Countrey, who had assured him he should be crowned in
a Solemn Assembly before his Death, never gave over his
hopes of obtaining the Crown: and being inferiour and weak
in power and faction to the other Brothers, to compass his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
he betaketh himself to treacherous devices. It was not in
his power to ruine so many at once; for mischief required there
should be distance between so many bloody Acts, therefore
be layeth his course for the taking away of his kindred one by
another at leasure; he soweth jealousies, entertaineth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
maintaineth factions amongst them; by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

instrument for such a business, proving the Crimes laid
against him in the Attaindor, he himself sat Judge against him
and his Children. Thus stirring one of the Kinsemen
against another, he so enfeebled the Race of <hi>Elizabeth Moore,</hi>
that of a numerous off-spring there only remained <hi>Iames</hi> and

his Son (a childe not yet six years of Age) upon whose Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
building his designs, with a small alteration of the State,
he thought it an easie step to the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Graham</hi> had been long imprisoned, at last released;
but being a man implacable once offended, and cruel, whom
neither benefits could oblige, nor dangers make wife, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to Peace, Factious and Ambitious alike, by many wicked
Plots afterwards, and Crimes against the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
driven to an Out-lawry, and to live as banished, he had
ever a male-talent against the King since the adjudging of the
Earldom of <hi>Strathern</hi> from his Nephew <hi>Miles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> was very familiar with the King, and his access
to his Chamber and Person advanced the Enterprise: being a
riotous young Man, gaping after great matters, neither respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Faith nor Fame, and daring attempt any thing for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
of his own foolish hopes, and his Grandfathers
ayms and ambition. These having associated unto them the
most audacious, whom either fear of punishment for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds,
or hopes of preferment by a change of the Government,
would plunge into any enterprise, in the Moneth of <hi>February,</hi>
so secretly as was possible, assembled together, where the Earl
spake to this sense unto them.</p>
            <p>These engagements which every one of you have to another, and
which I have to every one of you, founded on the strongest grounds
of consanguinity, friendship, interest of committed and received
wrongs, move me freely here to reveal my secret drifts, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the depths of my hidden purposes and counsels.</p>
            <p>The strange Tragedies which in the State and Government have
been acted, since the coming of this <hi>English</hi> man to the Crown, are
to none of you unknown: <hi>Mordock</hi> with his children hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> his Father in Law had that same end,
the Nobility repine at the Government of their King, the <hi>King</hi> is in
jealousie of his <hi>Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> are in way of Rebellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These
all have been the effects of my far-mining Policies. And hitherto
they have fallen forth as fortunately, as they were ingeniously plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For, what more ingenious and cunning Stratagem could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
to decline the rank growth of these Vsurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, then to take
them away by handles made of their own Timber? And if there was
any wrong in such proceedings, in small matters wrong must be done,
that justice and equity may be performed in great. My fear was (and
yet is) that the taking down of the Scaffold of <hi>Mordock</hi> should be
the putting up of ours: Crowns suffer no corrivals, the world
knows, and he himself is conscious to it, that the right and title of
the Crown, by descent of blood from <hi>Robert</hi> the second my Father,
was in the person of <hi>David</hi> my Brother, and is justly claimed now
by me and our Nephew. As for an Act of Parliament confirming the
right of that other Race, and for oaths of Allegiance, no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51978:27"/>
Authority can take away Iustice, and the Law of God: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is an oath to be observed when as it tendeth to the Suppression of
truth and right; and though for a time such Acts and oaths have
prevailed, our designs having good Success we shall have a Parliament
approving our right, abolishing their pretensions, and declaring them
Vsurpers. This one man and a child taken away (if we can give the
blow) the Kingdome must obey the Lawfull Successor; against whom
what Subject will revolt, or who dare take arms? and here is more

should take patiently the title of Earl, when I should have been King

but through necessity and fear, and now he also feareth that some
do that to him which he hath deserved.</p>
            <p>Let us resolve his doubts, our ends are honour and revenge, our wills
against him all alike and one. The Heavens seem to conspire with
us, having brought him to disband his Army, and render himself
in the wished place of our attempts; and let us rather follow them

Soveraignty at the first was but a violent usurpation of the stronger
over the weaker. How great Enterprizes must begin with danger,

            <p>Not long after when they had ponderated and digested the
Design, <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Stuart</hi> with their accomplices guided by
<hi>Resolution,</hi> and guarded by the darkness of the Night, came
to the <hi>Black Fryers</hi> of <hi>Pearth,</hi> and having the way made open
unto them entered the Gallery before the Kings Chamber-door,
where they attended some of their confederates, who should
have stoln away the Barr, by which means they might enter
the Chamber, but before their comming Fortune casteth the
occasion in their hands.</p>

of the Chamber, and finding armed men rushing rudely to

her body sought to save (being hardly pulled from

towards the heart, was left dead.</p>
            <p>Thus was King <hi>Iames</hi> the first who had so superabundantly
deserved well of the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 1436.</note> murthered the 21. of
<hi>February</hi> in the end of the year 1436 the 44. of his age when he
had reigned 13. years.</p>
            <p>This King was for the proportion and shape of his body of a
middle stature, thick and square, rather somewhat mean than
tall, not such as is counted for dainty, but for gracefulnesse and
Majesty. His hair was abourn, a colour between white and red.
He was of so strong and vigorous a constitution, that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to endure all extraordinary extremities both of travail and
want, and surpassed for agility and nimbleness in any exercise
his companions. He was of so sharp and pregnant a wit that
there was nothing wherein the commendation of wit consisted
or any shadow of the liberal arts did appear, that he had not
applied his mind unto: seeming rather born to Letters than
instructed. He wrote Verses both <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> of which many yet are extant: He exercised all Instruments of Musick,
and equalled the best Professours thereof. He had studied all
Philosophy, but most that which concerns Government; in
which what a Master he was the order which he established in
such a confusion as he found in the State doth witness; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
old Laws commodiously renewed and amended, others for
the publick good established. He was a great observer of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
forms: easie for access, fair in speech and countenance, in
behaviour kind, using sleep and meat to live, not for voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
He had good command over his Passions, his desires
never being above his reason, nor his hopes inferiour to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
Though he was much obliged to the gifts of Nature, yet
was he more to his good education and training in <hi>England.</hi>
Scarce had he passed the nineth year of his age when he was
committed to the Sea to shun the Treasons of his Uncle, and
was surprized at <hi>Flambrough</hi>-head in <hi>Holderness. Windsor</hi> Castle
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51978:28"/>
kept him a Prisoner, but by Commandment of King <hi>Henry</hi> he
was so carefully instructed that no Prince could have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bred in the Schools of <hi>Europe.</hi> What his valour was, the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>France</hi> bear witness: for accompanying the King of <hi>England</hi>
there, he layed siege to the Town of <hi>Direx,</hi> and with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and valour (saith the <hi>English</hi> History) assaulted it for the
space of six weeks, that with main strength he compelled it to
be rendred to his hands, and gave it to King <hi>Henry.</hi> That <unclear>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</unclear>
which was given him by that same King of <hi>England,</hi>
being recorded by their writers, proved prophetically true of
him. For the King remembring him of his benefits received,
and promising him greater, with free liberty to return to his
own Countrey, if he could cause the <hi>Scots</hi> who were adherent
to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to return to their native soyl and leave
him; To this he answered, He was a Prisoner, had no possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Realm that he was neither sworn to his Subjects, nor
they by any Oath of Allegiance bound to him; and though he
were bound to them, and they to follow his commandment he
would foresee whether it were to him honourable, and to his
Realm honest, to leave their Old Friend of <hi>France</hi> in his extrem

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. With this answer, though the
King was not content, when <hi>Iames</hi> went out of his presence, he
is recorded to have said, <hi>Happy shall they be which shall be subjects
to a King endued with such <unclear>wisdome</unclear> of so tender years of age.</hi> His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
in Justice was traduced by some under terms of cruelty,
but considering the Disorders of his Countrey, by the fierce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the People over whom he ruled, who by often Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did not only exasperate him to some severity, but even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
him to keep them in aw his rigour was rather an effect
of necessity than of his natural disposition. No Prince did more

defects repaired, sedition and discord was put from

man had a certainty of enjoying his own and security. Into all
Men was either infused a will to do well, or a necessity of so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imposed upon them, virtuous actions being honoured,
crimes punished. The mean man did respect the great, not fear
him; the great man did precede the mean, not contemn him;
favour was mastered by equity, Ambition by Virtue: for the

so to do.</p>

            <p>The rumour of his Murther blazed abroad, it is incredible
what weeping and sorrow was through all the Countrey, for
even by them to whom his Government was not pleasant, he
was deplored, and the act thought execrable. The Nobles of
their own accord and motion from all parts of the Kingdome
assembled and came to <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> and ere they consulted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(as if they had all one mind) directed troups of armed
men through all the quarters of the Kingdome, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Murtherers and produce them to Justice. Such
diligence was used (grief and anger working in their
minds) that within the space of fourty daies all the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
were taken and put to shameful deaths. The common
sort, as <hi>Christopher Clawn</hi> or <hi>Cahown</hi> and others, that were of the
Council in the Conspiracy, having had art or part in the plot
were hanged on Gibbets. The chief Actors, that the Common
wealth might publickly receive satisfaction, were made specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Justice by exquisite torments, the punishment of <hi>Athole</hi>
was continued three daies: on the first he was stript naked to
his shirt, and by a Crane fixed in a Cart, often hoised aloft, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed,
and hanging shown to the People, and thus dragged
along the great Street of the Town; on the second day he was
mounted on a Pillar in the Market place, he was crowned with
a Diadem of burning Iron, with a Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all Traytors,</hi> thus was his Oracle accomplished; on the third
he was laid naked along upon a Scaffold, his Belly was ript up,
his heart and Bowels taken out and thrown in a fire flickering
before his eyes. Lastly, his head was cut off and fixed in the most
eminent place of the Town, his body sent in quarters to the
most populous Cities of the Kingdom to remain a Trophie of
Justice.</p>
            <p>His Nephew <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> was not altogether so rigorously
handled, for that he did but consent to others wickedness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and entrails were thrown in a fire, his head exalted, and his
Quarters sent amongst the Towns, to satisfy the wrath and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the injured people; being asked during his torture how
he dared put hand in his Prince, he made answer, that having
Heaven and Hell at his choice, he dared leap out of Heaven
and all the contentments thereof, in the flaming bottomes of
Hell, an answer worthy such a Traytor.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Carce were the tears dryed for the loss
of the Father when the three Estates
of the Kingdom meet,<note place="margin">1654.</note> and at <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood-House,</hi>
set the Crown upon the
head of the Son, then a child in the
sixth year of his age. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Realm is trusted to Sir
<hi>Alexander Levingstoun</hi> of <hi>Calendar;</hi>
the custody of the Kings person with
the Castle of <hi>Edenbrough</hi> are given
to the Chancelor Sir <hi>William Creightoun,</hi> Men for that they had
been ever faithful to the Father, without apparent vices, of no
capacity to succeed, nor entertaining aspiring thoughts for a
Diadem, held worthy of these charges and dignities. Good
men may secure themselves from Crimes but not from envy and
calumnies; for men great in trust in publick affairs are ever as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by the ambition of those who apprehend they are less
in imployment than they conceive they are in merit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Archembald</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> grudging mightily that the State
had bestowed those honours upon men far inferiour to him, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51978:31"/>
though by this the many merits of his Ancestours had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and his own service neglected; They being ever accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
in times of Peace to be nearest the Helm of the State,
and when any danger of war blazed, sent abroad to encounter
it. In a confusion of those thoughts being diversly tossed, he
retireth to his own Castles, and after great resolves proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that none of his Vassals or Tenants, especially within <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandale</hi>
and <hi>Dowglass-Dale</hi> (parts remote from the more Civill
Towns of the Kingdom) should acknowledg the present Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment,
or obey any precepts, licences, or proclamations wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the Governours or Chancelours hands were set. If any
question of Law or contention arose amongst his Friends, Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
Tenants, He knew none fitter to be their Judge, sentence
all their wrongs, attone and take up their quarrels than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
To discover to the world the weakness of the two Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and how men never so well qualified, small in means, and
silly of power, were not for great places, he giveth way for the
the increasing of evil: overseeing many disorders, of which he
was the secret cause, especially the insolencies of vagabound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ravaging Borderers. Men of purpose sent forth to
spoil and rifle the more quiet parts of the Countrey, and to cut
work to these strengthless States-men, as he named them. Thus
as overcome with sloth and pleasure, he passed some moneths
amidst Countrey contentments, expecting what effect time
would bring forth of the equal authority of those two Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
for to fit minds equal in authority to so even a temper
that they should not have some motions of dissenting, he
thought impossible. Neither did this conjecture fail him, the
event being the only judge of opinions: for after this the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
began to jar with the Chancelour for ingrossing whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to himself from his Partner the person of the King, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which could not altogether be separate from his place,
and which would give the greater authority to his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
urging, the Chancelour in many other matters had usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and taken upon him more than the Parliament granted.
The Chancelour was no better affected towards the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
what the Governour commanded to be done, he one
way or other over-turned. The buildings of the one was by the
other demolished: by common and continual brawlings thus
living in turmoil, neither of them was obeyed, the Countrey
usurped a licentious liberty, every man doing what he thought
best for his particular advantage and gain. The remote Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Kingdom are left a prey to the lawless multitude:
where their authority is scorned, turn places of robbery; where
admitted, places of faction.</p>
            <p>The Queen all this time, after her ordinary custom remained
in the Castle of <hi>Sterling.</hi> The divisions, partialities, jealousies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51978:31"/>
of the Rulers, she taketh in an evil part, knowing usually they
had a dangerous consequence. She had ever found the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
sincere and loyal in his proceedings; against his counsel
and will her Son was kept from her by the Chancellour whom
the great ones hated for possessing the King, for drawing to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of best trust and benefit his own creatures, displacing such
he suspected to favour his partner in Rule; and the Commons
loved him not, as managing every thing after his pleasure to
their damage and loss. Transported by divers motions she
at last resolveth to change the Game of State, and by a woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
conceit befool masculine Policy. To effectuate her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the came to <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> and by many fair and passionate
speeches obtained of the Chancelour to enter the Castle and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
her self some daies with the company of her Son. Then
to countenance her plot, she giveth out a pilgrimage inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by her to the white Kirk in <hi>Buchan:</hi> There will she make
offerings for the health of the King, and perform her other vows.
The honest States man, who thought it disloyalty to distrust a
Queen, and a Mother, whom years had made reverend; and
impiety to hinder such religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s intentions, giveth leave to her
self with some Servants to remain in the Castle, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
her houshold stuff and other necessaries after what manner
she pleased. In this time she perswardeth the King; wantonly
set and delighting to be obsequious to <hi>Her</hi> his Mother, to be
handsomely couched in a Trunk, as if he had been some fardel
of her apparel, and convoyed by one of her trustiest Servants
upon a Sumpter horse to <hi>Leith:</hi> from whence he was put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by water to <hi>Sterling,</hi> there received by the Governor, and
wel-comed with great joy and laughter, at the manner of their
so quaintly deceiving the grave Man.</p>
            <p>By this advantage the Reins of Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

Governour; The Queens Trick is approved, his own procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
are strengthned and confirmed. Proclamations are made
against the Chancellour, and he charged to render the Castle of
<hi>Edenbrough</hi> to the King: which he refusing to do, by a great
power raised by the Governour of the Countrey, and the
Queens, and his own followers, he is be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Chancellour ready to fall in the danger, considering he
had to do with too strong a party, imploreth the assistance of
the Earl of <hi>Dowglass:</hi> but the Earl as a matter he had long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and earnestly wished might fall forth, refuseth to assist any
of them, saying it belonged not to the antient Nobility to succor
these Mushrooms, whose ambition with no less could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than the Government of the whole Realm. This disdainful
answer, procured a meeting of the two Rulers, which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the rendering of the Castle to the Governour, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51978:32"/>
of true friendship between them, that they might not
prove a sport to the envious Nobility. The Governour to shew
the roundness of his intentions and his honesty, continueth the
Chancellour in his office; and restoreth him to the keeping of
the Castle of <hi>Edenbrough.</hi> After this agreement the Earl of

far the King in his followers and Train, being accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have hundreds of Horse men attending him; most of
which were Robbers and men living upon unlawful spoils all
under his protection: But however thus he seemed to set forth
his greatness, this seemed much to bewray a distrust, and that
he rather travelled amongst a people which hated him, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his friends and men lovingly disposed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames Stuart</hi> Son to the Lord of <hi>Lorne</hi> about this time marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Queen Dowager, not so much out of love of her Person
or Dowry, as of ambition, by her means intending to reach the
Government of the State, and get into his custody the person
of the King. And that it might rather seem the work of others
out of conveniency, than any appetite of his own, he so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth
himself with the Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> that the Earl essay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lay the first groundwork of his aims. The Governour

and now began to repent her of the former courtesies done to
the Governour; wishing her Son had yet remained in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody

as he appeared in outward show (delighting in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

his Sagacity in preventing astorm in the State before it

Justice at <hi>Pearth,</hi> the Chancellour one Morning commeth
to the Park of <hi>Sterling</hi> where the King was hunting, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of his Mother more early raised for this sport, she be
wailed the present estate of his Court, that he was thralled to
the covetousness and pleasure of others, living under the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of a Man greedy of Rule: that a King of <hi>France</hi> is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be of full years and Major the fourteenth of his age, that
a Prince should transfer his affection especially in tender years;
that by an escape he might enjoy a princely freedom, better
know himself, and make his Rulers relish his Authority; that
three houres was sometimes of more importance than three
daies, and one hour of more than all the three; that he should
take hold of the present occasion offered him. Prepared with
such informations he is no sooner accosted by the Chancellour,
when approving his motions he posteth towards <hi>Edenbrough</hi>
with him: Received all the way as he went with many compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Chancellours friends and attendants. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
finding the face of the Court altered, by a King young in
years and judgement, possessed by his Mother, dissimulating
his interest in a patient and calm manner cometh to <hi>Edenbrough,</hi>
there after long conference and mediation of Friends in Saint
<hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, he meeteth the Chancellour, and by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Murrays</hi> and <hi>Aberdeens</hi> diligence an agreement is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them concluded, which was that the King should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the custody of the Chancellour, and the Governour
should still enjoy his charge. Amongst these divisions of the
Rulers the Queen all this time handsomely kept some authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
affecting and entertaining sometimes the one of them som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the other, as by turns they governed the King and
State.</p>
            <p>The many and great disorders in the Countrey invited a
Parliament: the authority of Magistrates was despised, no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
was administred in many places, few could keep their
Goods, or be assured of their Lives, but by taking themselves
to the servitude of one Faction or other. Troubles a rose in the

These cruelties and insolencies against all justice and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being avouched such to be were, held fit to be remedied and
courses laid down to obviate them: but <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass</hi>
permitting wickedness, and wincking at mischief, often
approving them for lawful and good policy, whilst he neither
reformed them himself by his power, nor suffered the Rulers
to proceed against them by their authority; purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51978:33"/>
the name and reputation of a lawless and strong oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor.
The three Estates assembled, complaints being given up
against Oppressours, most against him and his Followers, as the
source from which the miseries of the Country sprang, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not, nor any to answer for him.</p>
            <p>The Parliament determinateth to proceed by way of Rigour
against him; but to this the two Rulers oppose, perswading
them that fair speeches and entreaties; was a safer and easier
way to draw unto them a young Man, mighty in riches and
power, arrogant by his many Followers and Vassals, then to
give out a Sentence against him before he were heard, and by
threatnings stir his turbulent and ambitious thoughts, which
instead of making him calm, might turn his neutrality in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Rebellion: and his insolency, in madness and despair. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as the present estate of the Countrey stood, could he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
civil blood be commanded and brought in, which by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
might be effectuate; that verity enjoyed not always
that priviledge to be spoken in every place and time; it was
good to keep up in silence matters concerning him, the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which might produce any dangerous effect. Upon this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Letters in their Name are sent unto him, remembring him of
the splendor and glory of his Ancestors, the place and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he possessed by them in Parliament: that without his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
they neither would nor could proceed in great matters.
If he apprehended any cause of let or stay by the offences and
disorders committed by his Attendants and Followers, they
would freely remit them, as accidents following the injury of
the times, and his yet tender years, his greatest fault being his
giving way out of rashness and negligence to the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
That of himself they had conceived such singular hopes
of great towardness and all vertues, if he would come and take
a part with them, giving in his complaints and grievances, he
should not only have full satisfaction, but be honoured with
what place or charge in the Government he liked best; by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
them with his Presence he should oblige not only his
Countrey infinitely but particularly every one of them to stand
for him to the utmost of their powers and wishes.</p>
            <p>This Letter wrought powerfully upon the Minde of the Earl,
by nature and years desirous of glory and preferment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
easily that which was plausible to his hopes. His friends,
who now began to promise to themselves new Heavens, think
upon great matters, and forecast to themselves by the change
of their Lords Fortune, a change of Offices in the State, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him likewise to come to the Parliament; and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged
the certainty of his Progress. The Chancellour when
he understood he was upon his way rode forth of <hi>Edinbrough</hi>
to meet him, &amp; by many obsequious complements and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51978:33"/>
blandishments allured and drew him to his Castle of <hi>Creigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
which was in his way: where some days he rested and was
honorably entertained. Amongst many healthfull admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by way of counsel, he told him, that the greatness of a
Subject consisted in due obedience to his Prince, whom he
should acknowledge to be his Lord and Master.</p>
            <p>That by obedience he would vindicate the Name and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the <hi>Dowglasses,</hi> not only from blame of Treason, but
from all suspition of Novations; that he would endeavor to
execute justice more strictly then he had done in times past,
not protect Oppressors against Laws and Equity, but suppress
all insolencies of Theeves and Robbers, because cruelties and
wrongs never stood secure before either God or man. That the
estates of ancient Houses were often maintained more by repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of things done, then any other foundation, which a
little disobedience to a Prince might shake, if not altogether
ruine. That it was fatal to all Princes in their under-age, and
the beginnings of their Reigns, to have troubles and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and be tormented by some of their Subjects who studied
novelties; but when these Princes came to perfect years, they
knew well to chastise those who troubled the Government in
their youth. That he would hereafter rather content himself
with mediocrity, then expose himself as a mark to envy. That
he would make a proof of his power, not in excess and riot or
pride of his ancient honours, but in bounty and religious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
toward his Country-men.</p>
            <p>That he wished as his House had long continued, it might by
following what he had spoken unto him ever flourish. The Earl
of a good inclination, if Flatterers and wicked Company had
been removed, took in good part his advertisements and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
thinking he spake as he thought, and (perhaps) so he did,
for he had not yet put on his double Visage, and promised to
repair what offences by youth, negligence, rashness or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion
had escaped him: thus with his Brother <hi>David,</hi> the
Chancellor accompanied him to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had not long there stayed, when the frequent meetings,
many secret conferences of the Governor and Chancellor at
their several houses, which often held the greatest part of the
night, who were not wont to be so kinde to others, bred a
great jealousie and suspition in some of the Earls friends, that
some lurking mischief was a plotting to entrap him. That
small trust should be had in a reconciled enemy, and his many
courtesies, and too exceeding favours were to be suspected.
Hereupon some freely counsel the Earl to return home, and to
leave off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> private meetings with them. Others intreat him not
to enter the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> at all, or if he should, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
his brother <hi>David,</hi> to keep themselves scattered that they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51978:34"/>
might not be inclosed in one Net, as upon his Death-bed their
Father had instructed and admonished them. For if any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
course were intended against them, men would not dare
to put in act against one of them, which they would against
both. <hi>David</hi> presaging some strange accident to follow this

Earl took this counsel in an evil part, saying, Great Families

they cared not what blame were laid upon their Chiefs, so it

to be tempered together, did meet him and guide him to the

brake up, leaving grief, terrour, astonishment in the hearts of
all the people, who ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not many after his Fortune to be Earl. He was Father to seven
Sons, the eldest of which by a Dispensation from the Pope he
married to <hi>Beatrice,</hi> the only Sister of his Brothers Son <hi>William,</hi>
named <hi>The Fair Maid of</hi> Galloway, not so much in respect of
her Beauty as her Fortunes; the Lands not tailed in <hi>Galloway,
Annandale, Balveny</hi> and <hi>Ormond</hi> falling from the Heirs male to
be her Portion. This Marriage was much blamed and cryed out
upon by the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Dowglass</hi> of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and
other Gentlemen of that Name, not as they gave out for the
propinquity of blood, being between Cozen Germans, but
that so fair and easie a purchase was taken out of their arms.
They had always followed the king, and procured prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Marriage; but these with spur-haste advanced the
celebration of it, and upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> which the common People
prognosticate to be ominous, and to have some sad event.</p>
            <p>This Earl, ambitious, factious, popular, subtile, vindicative,
prompt in the execution of his enterprizes, liberal and far from
the dor-muse humour of his Father, began to think neither
himself nor his kindred in safety, if the deaths of his Brothers
and Cousins, wrought by the two Rulers remained unrevenged,
and therefore since openly without troubling the common
peace of the Countrey he could not, by secret and um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bragious
wayes he laboureth to bring it to pass: Procuring
a far off a disobedience to their Decrees, and contempt of their
Authority, by men in a great distance from him in place, blood,
friendship and familiarity; who after any fashion grudged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined,

One <hi>Iohn Gormack</hi> of <hi>Athole</hi> (not without suspition that
he wrought by the motion and order of the Earl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
his Caball) essayed with a great number of Out-lawes to
hinder the execution of a Malefactor, and take him by main
force from the Sheriff of <hi>Pearth William Ruthen:</hi> but he perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>Dowglass,</hi> by whom he is protected, notwithstanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
informations given in against him at Court, and his cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to answer to Justice.</p>
            <p>The King whose non-age was now near expired, began to
relish the Sweetness of Government in his own Person, and
became tyr'd of the long and awful tutelage of his jarring
Rulers; and the Flower of his youth seeming fram'd for great
affairs, promised the fruit of a wise and happy reign; finding it
difficult to put men near dayly unto him; long experienced
and greedy of Rule, from high Places, except by the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a stronger and more powerful faction. He setteth
his thoughts upon the Earl of <hi>Dowglass;</hi> small favours to him
would be a great umbrage to the ambition of his Tutors, bring
them within the compass of answering to what might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to them concerning their Service in the State; he would
not sue to the Earl, but as occasion served he gave many signs
and open speeches, that he had not altogether withdrawn his
love and favour from the antient House of the <hi>Dowglasses,</hi> their
passed faults being by them acknowledged and recompenced
with fidelity and obedience in times comming. The Earl of
<hi>Dowglass,</hi> whose towardness and liberality had acquired him
many Friends at Court, upon assured advertisement of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
good-will towards him, cometh to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and is no
sooner presented upon his knees before the King in the Church,
when with all demonstrations of benevolence he is received in
grace, pardoned, and not manies dayes after admitted to be of
the Privy Council. The King imparting to him his greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
sheweth he will follow them by his advice and counsel,
honoureth him with the plausible name of <hi>Cousi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
such familiarity with him that all others give him the place.</p>
            <p>The promotion and credit which the Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> in a
short time acquired about the King, his faction dayly increas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
moved the two Rulers (by their moderation seeking to
avoid disgrace) to leave the Court. After which they were both
removed from their offices, and their places and authority in
Council with their whole Friends and Followers. They are
upbraided with disorders, both in their private actions and
the manner of their Government, and at last are summoned to
answer before the King to such things as they should be legally
accused of, The murmurs every where whispered amongst the
people, warned and certified them if they should appear and
present themselves of some sad and tragick act. Whereupon
with protestations of their Innocency declining the time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to the King in his majority, and when he should be of
full years, from these Judges their mortal enemies than abusing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51978:35"/>
absolute power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they suspend their appearing, declaring withal
their readiness in every thing to obey the King.</p>
            <p>This availeth them nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for at a Parlament holden in
<hi>Sterling,</hi> articles being forged and urged against them, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Peculate, as sale of Crown Lands, waste of the Kings
Treasure, the laying of their hands upon the Kings jewels,
transporting Lands to themselves and their friends, distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Offices and places of the Crown and state (which should
have been by the Authority of the Councel) as Hunters divide
a Prey between themselves. Dispensing with Riots, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the force and vigour from the Laws of the Kingdom; thus
as betraying the administration of the Realm into the hands of
worthless and corrupted men, they are denounced Rebels,
their persons and estates proscrib'd. Charge is given to Sir <hi>Iohn
Foster</hi> of <hi>Corstorphane</hi> and others the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> adherents, to
bring all their moveables to the use of the Exchequer, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
their houses, invade their friends with fire and sword and
all that sided them. Thus the uncertain vicissitude of humane
accidents overturns often them who seem to be raised to the
highest degree of honour. The Castle of <hi>Barentoren</hi> is besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
taken, thrown down, with other houses upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
and Chancellours Lands, their Farms and small Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
are plundered and ransacked. In revenge of which the
Rulers waste the Earl of <hi>Dowglasses</hi> Territories, the Villages of
<hi>Straw-Brock, Abercorn, Blackness</hi> are burnt, with <hi>Corstorphane.</hi>
The ravage begun, continueth with dayly loss to both parties,
and the overthrow of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The Earl wondreth (now having the Kings Authority) to
finde his enemies so strong, and hold so long out against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He suspecteth they have secret support by some not well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
towards him. The most powerfull and eminent of which
he guesseth to be <hi>Iames Kennedie</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and
Cousin germane to the King. He knew him jealous for his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
favours at Court, and that he had whispered amongst his
Friends, that he feared the ambition of the Earls unlimited
heart was now exalted to such exorbitancy of height, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
top-heavy it would fall by its own weight, and turn up
the Root.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> will have this Prelate less powerfull to assist the
Rulers, or do harm unto him. To this effect he instigateth
the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> his Allie, and <hi>Alexander Ogleby</hi> of <hi>Inuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wharety,</hi>
to invade the Bishops Lands, and rifle his Vassals in
<hi>Fife,</hi> without order or declaration of wrongs done by him.
The Bishop after the burning and spoiling of sundry of his
Farms being weak by power to resist their violence and repair
his losses, took him to his Spiritual Arms, and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Earl of <hi>Crawford.</hi> Though he made small account of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51978:36"/>
this verbal Thunder, yet did not this injustice long escape the
revenging hand of God, who raise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

title to the Baylerie of <hi>Arbrothe,</hi> out of which he was kept by
<hi>Alexander Ogleby,</hi> whose title was equal to his, if not better.
This enmity kindled to such a flame, that upon either<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Quarrel, and presuming upon the respect due to his place

to demand a parly of <hi>Alxander Ogleby</hi> with his Son: but ere he
could be known or was heard, he is encountred by a common
Souldier, who thrust him in the mouth with a Spear, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
him dead upon the ground. This sudden accident joyned
the Parties, who fought with great courage and resolution:

Castle of <hi>Creighton</hi> is plundered, a garrison placed in it, and

blocked up. Nine moneths the Assailers lie about it: but it

was purged by an Assise of his Peers of what was laid against
him, his lands and goods seized upon by the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Dowglasses</hi>
are decreed to be restored, as well to his followers as himself;
he is established in his dignities and places of honour, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of all Edicts, Proclamation, Confiscation before,
which were declared null; all matters past put in oblivion, as
not done. This considering the credit of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass,</hi>

By this blow the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass</hi> thought he was more
terribly avenged, then if he had proved his power against the

his pompous attendance, his haughtie carrying of all business,

for the space of three years, 1450.</p>
            <p>This Victory obtained chiefly by the valour of the <hi>Dowglas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
advanced highly their credit with the young King, and the
Court sounded with nothing more then their praises. But
great Fortunes are as hard to bear as to acquire and ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prosperity carryeth us into insolencies, without pondering
the consequence of our actions. <hi>William Colvill</hi> Knight, upon
a private quarrel having slain <hi>Iames Auchinleck</hi> a follower of
the Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> the Earl revenged his death, not only
with the slaughter of <hi>William,</hi> but with the throwing down of
his House, and spoil of all his Lands: which turned cold the
affections of many about the Court towards him, and made
him terrible to all of a contrary faction to his. After, whether
tyred with his working thoughts, or to shun more hatred and
envy, or to try what time would produce, amidst the inward
grudges and rancours of Court, or that he held his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
too narrow Lists for his glory, he leaveth the Kingdom:
substituting one of his Brothers Procurator for his affairs, and
in his absence to govern his estate, accompanied with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Prince, when many are suborned to give up complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the oppressions, riots, wrongs of his Kindred, Servants
and Vassals. The faults of his governing the King are pryed
into, every oversight and escape aggravated to the height. The
<hi>King</hi> at first was loth to lend an ear to misreports and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of a man lately so well deserving and dearly of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51978:38"/>
but overcome by importunity and urged by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Complainers, he gave way that his Brother and Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
should make answer for wrongs suffered by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers:
after many citations his brother not appearing is at
last by force presented to the Councel: when he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to such faults as were laid against the Earls Vassals and
Followers, nor acquit them of violent oppressions, he was
only enjoined to restore to the Complainers their loss, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
all damages. Upon fair promises of Restitution the King
bringeth him off the danger, and obtaineth him liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home.</p>
            <p>There, after long advisement with his other Brothers and
some haughty Vassals, they declare, old Rapines and Wrongs
being joyned to new, and recent with which they were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
the restitution was impossible, and like spilt water which
could not be recovered. Not satisfied with this Answer, the
Councel citeth the Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> upon some days to appear
before them, and all his Vassals and Followers with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to answer according to Law, to such Articles as should
be given in against them. The Earl was far off, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
it consisted not with their weal to hazard their persons
to the Arbitrement of Judges, many of which had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to their affronts. Thus for not appearing they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Rebels, and Warrants granted in invade and spoil
their Lands, as publick enemies to Authority and the present
Government. This Decree is followed by open force; and to
facilitate the execution of it, and to take up the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses</hi>

him, and if there were any possibility in this ebb of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
to have access to him.</p>
            <p>The King ingenuously promiseth to accept him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it for all that hapned by the misdeameanor of his
Friends in his absence, requesting that he would but live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
according to the order of the State, without hating that
which his Prince loved, or improving that which he approved
and authorized; and that as himself and his Brothers were
ever the most able and readiest to repel the wrongs of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
so they would endeavor to entertain unity and concord
in the Countrey it self, and purge their Lands of Theeves and
Robbers; if mischievous and wicked men were not punished,
there would be no surety nor safety for the good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Past wrongs are pardoned, the Garrisons removed from
his Castles, and they are rendred unto him. Then to put him
in assurance of increasing favours, he is made Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Kingdom: a place great and requiring great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being onely to be bestowed upon a Man active, great in
power and friends.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Dowglss,</hi> again afloat
in the stream of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns
favours, might have continued, if his miseries had
not been decreed from above: soon after he falls in new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace;
whether upon a promise of return, or that he was sent

when he was in his way homewards, he passeth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and without his Masters know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or leave hath many days serious conference with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of that Kingdom, then many ways distressed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the factions of the great Men. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
cause of his journey was given out to be the repairing
of his own and his Vassal lsosses, sustained by the in-rodes of
the <hi>English</hi> the time of his travels abroad, and the redressing of
other disorders on the <hi>West</hi> Borders; but his Enemies suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he intended to enter a League with some of the <hi>English</hi> to
the disadvantage of his Master, and trouble of his Countrey,
by changing the form of Government, or the Officers of State.
King <hi>Iames</hi> took this meeting with the <hi>English</hi> in an evil part;
but after great intercession and many requests of the
Queen and Noblemen after he had submitted himself to his
clemency, and acknowledged his errors, received him. In this
mean time he is discharged of all publick imployments; his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of State are divided between the Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Creighton</hi> his reconciled Enemies.</p>
            <p>Removed from publick imployments he giveth himself to
study private revenge, and the whole secret Council turn
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51978:39"/>
distasteful unto him: especially <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Creighton,</hi> men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
abhorring his ambition, and who greatly feared his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measured greatness.</p>
            <p>Their suspected affronts and alledged wrongs towards him
were increased daily by tales of Sycophants. It was told the
Earl that the Lord <hi>Creightoun</hi> in conference with the <hi>King</hi> had
said, it were expedient for the peace of the Countrey, that the
Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> with all his friends and followers were root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and their memory abolished; but if that were left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
neither should the King rule in due Majesty, nor the
Subjects ever give him that obedience which they ought. That
wise Princes suffered houses to grow as men do Spider-webs,
not taking heed of them so long as they were small, but when
offensively encreased, they swept them wholly away. Irritated
by these and many such like speeches, after much contempt of
the Chancellor, one dawning, as he was early coming form
<hi>Edinburgh</hi> to his Castle of <hi>Creighton,</hi> the Earl who wanted not
his own intelligence amongst his followers (Hatred being an
evil Counsellor) laid an ambush for him on the high way. But
the clearness of the morning discovering it, by swiftness
of his horse he escapeth; some of his company being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and one of the Assailers slasin in the pursuit. Two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Chancellor to repair his credit, accompanied with a
number of his Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Followers, coming in great
haste to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> had unawared surprized the Earl of
<hi>Dowglas,</hi> then attended but with a small number of his friends
if he had not speedily shifted himself form the danger. This
contention now bursting forth into open hostility, divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Factions the whole Kingdom; The Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his by the long continued grandeur of his House, the
Chancellor standing by his Princes favour, and a long practise
of the affairs and course of the World; the Earl fearing the
Authority of the King might sway the Ballance and make the
party unequal, if he should be brought to call to remembrance
passed actions and attempts of his Predecessors, findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more expedient to curb his enemies, and strengthen his
proceedings, then to renew his old Confederation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
with him many others. Hereupon the Earls of <hi>Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Ross, Murray, Ormond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Balvenny</hi> Knight of <hi>Cady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow,</hi>
many Barons, Gentlemen with their Allies, Vassals, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to a great number, subscribed and swore solemnly never
to desert one another during life; That injuries done to any
one of them, should be done to them all, and be a common
quarrel; neither should they desist to their best abilities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them: That they should concur indifferently against
whatsoever Persons within or without the Realm, and spend
their Lives, Lands, Goods Fortunes in defence of their Debates

this contempt of Soveraignty, it was universally blazed
that the Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> in respect of this new Covenant,
the power of his Kinsmen and Allies, the entertaining of such
who were discontent and discountenanced at Court, the love
and favor of the men of Arms in <hi>Scotland</hi> (ever governed by
some of his Name) his riches, the honor of his Ancestors, had
resolved to dissemble no longer, but openly to play his game,

            <p>The King who before but disdained the pride, after this
League became jealous of the Earl of <hi>Douglass</hi> (a League gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Law to a King breaking all Bonds of Soveraignty, and
inviting people to look for a new Master) and though his
modesty and patience served onely to turn the Earl more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,
and his boldness more active, yet in a foul game he bare
a fair countenance; knowing the last thing which a Soveraign
Prince should do is to show himself male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and offended
with any of his Subjects; for instead of chastising him, he
would give him fairer means and greater power to do him
harm: He would not shew a token of any prejudicial thought
to the Earls proceedings, till he had first heared himself.</p>
            <p>Thus very calmly he desired him to come and speak with
him at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> whiles he (conscious of his own misdemeanor)
except upon a publique assurance under the great Seal for his

the Court then remaining at <hi>Sterlin</hi> Castle,<note place="margin">1452.</note> accompanied with
many of his Confederates, and a powerful Retinue: The
King with a gracious countenance, and all apparent respect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him, endeavoring rather by kindness and humanity,
then by rigor to reclaim him to his former obedience. The
day near spent, the Gates of the Castle shut, all removed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some of the Councel and the Guards; the King taking the
Earl friendly apart, remembred him of favors received, wrongs
forgotten, the duties, as a Subject, he owed to his Prince, his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation
before he would come and speak with him; he tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with the exorbitant abuses and out rages of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
Then he told him what Informations he had of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of mutual defence &amp; adherence betwixt him and some of
his Nobles &amp; Gentlemen, which he would scarce believe: He
prayed him to consider the murmuring, or rather begun sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his people, his long patience in tolerating his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
his misbelief of evil reports towards him, until he had
heard what he had to say for himself and his innocency.</p>
            <p>The Earl answered the Kings towardness in equal terms,
trusting much to his confederatiom; for his favors he should
strive with all obsequiousness to deserve them; That as he had
the honor to command others who obeyed him; he knew very
well how to be commanded, and obey his Prince, and in what
disobedience consisted, that as none of his Subjects enjoyed
more Lands and Honors then himself, there should not one be
found who more willingly would engage all his Fortunes and
person for the Honor of his Prince: That they who layed
snares for his life, being so near his Majesty, for the surety of his
person he could not come to Court, except upon a publique
assurance, and well accompanied: For the wrongs commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Followers and Vassals, he would give what satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
should be required; Concerning the Band of mutual
friendship betwixt him and some Noblemen, they would have
adhered together without any writing; they were driven
thereunto for their own safety, not out of minde to offer, but
repel injuries: That he was infinitely oblig'd to his goodness,
in not condemning him before he was heard, and for that he
had not lent a credulous ear to his enemies mischievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
            <p>The King replyed, effects and not words make the affection
and submission of a subject known; and could there be any
greater surety for him, then to rely on the Laws of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
and Countrey? especially (continued he) in a
Countrey where Laws, and not Faction rule, and where a mans
own goodness is able to preserve him: But such men as you
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51978:41"/>
are, raise these Factions, to the subvertion of all Laws and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
and for Subjects to make an offensive and defensive
League against all persons, is to disclaim all Government, and
do what they please without controlment; commit Treason
in the highest degree, and make your own Swords and Power
justifie your proceedings, which, though ye first use against
mean persons, and conceal the progress of your actions (for
there are degrees in evil, and wicked men begin at that which
seemeth the least of evils, or not an evil at all at the first) your
last aim is likely to be the robbing upon the Crown: Consider
(my Lord) ye are born under a Monarchy, which admitteth
no Soveraignty but it self, and it is natural to Princes to hold
it in highest esteem, and in no case to suffer it to be shaken by
their Subjects: Take your Prince for your best protection, and
an innocent life; renounce that Union and League with your
Peers, which excepted, or commanded, or approved, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by your Prince, subsisteth not in Law nor in Reason, being
forbidden under great pains; and let it not be heard any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that ever such an unjust Confederation was, and so wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Earl replyed, The League being drawn up by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of many Lords, Barons and Gentlemen, and subscribed,
it could not be cancell'd nor renounc'd but by their common
consent; nor was it profitable for the King, nor to him other
ways to have it done: That being together, they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to the renouncing and cancelling of it. But (says the
King) you to shew good example to the rest, shall first begin;
Neither (living) shall any Traytor in my presence disavow and
disclaim my Authority, in what is within my possibility of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing.
The Earl requests him to remember, he came to
Court upon a publique assurance: A publique assurance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so warrant any man, but that he may fall by his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
misdemeanor, answered the King; withal, considering
a mean courage in a King to be an imputation, and that he did
neither wrong towards God nor his Fame, in revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the enemies of the State; The place, a strong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle;
his present power, all within being his Councellors and
Servants; the danger, if he should escape; the easiness of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the Rebellion, the head taken away: (The Earl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
hot and stubborn, in debating his points of the League,
wrath banishing other Doubts and Interests) his Dagger per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,

the Siege of <hi>Dalkeith;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Auguss,</hi> by their many
wrongs and insolencies, remained more constant to the King.</p>
            <p>In this time the King writeth to all the good Towns of the
Realm, and Church-men, giving reasons for the taking away
the <hi>Earl,</hi> imputing the fault to the <hi>Earl</hi> himself, exhorting the
people to make no stir for the just execution of a Man born
for the ruine of the Kingdom, and who voluntarily had preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated
himself in his own mis-hap; offering all his power to
keep the Countrey in quietness, according to that Authority
in which God hath placed him: This blow, as particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
made the hearts of men incline, and as passions were
various, was variously and in several maners taken: Some
without inquiring of circumstances, after what fashion or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
soever done, allowing it, thought the King had more
clear and evident inducements for his deed, then could fall
within the Labyrinths of reasoning. The Majesty of a Prince,
hardly falleth from an height to a midst, but easily is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
from any midst, to the lowest degree and station; The
King (said-they) hath obviated this fall, hath set a foot again
and raised his Authority threatned with ruine; he hath vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his liberty almost thra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld, hath assured the Lives, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
Estates of many loyal Subjects which were endangered
by not adhearing to the league of the <hi>Earl,</hi> and keeping their
Oath of Allegeance to the King; he (if he please) now with
Honor and Reputation may hold his Parliaments, bring to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51978:42"/>
pass his designs for the conservation of his Authority, and the
peace of his Subjects. Other blamed this Deed everywhere,
and in every circumstance: laying perjury and murther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and the breaking of the publick Faith and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
the common Band of humane Society, the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of all, and the ground of Justice.</p>
            <p>To which it was answered, that the <hi>Earl</hi> was not taken away
for his past demerits and misdeservings, but for what he had
recently committed in the Kings own presence, having spoken
to him with an insupportable irreverence; They which have
safe conduct, being obliged to shun all kindes of offence towards
him who gives it them, any enormity being sufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null
the benefit of it.</p>
            <p>More, for the breach of Faith, the <hi>Earl</hi> and his confederates
were the more perjured; and he the murtherer of himself:
they having violated that Natural Oath to their King, which
all Subjects owe to their Soveraigns, by drawing up a League
among his People, to the breaking of the tyes of Soveraignty,
giving by this, occasion and just cause to the King to reward
them after their demerits. Most said the killing of the <hi>Earl</hi>
was evil, but that it was a necessary evil. That as Nature suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
not two Suns. so Reason of State suffereth not that in
one Kingdom their be two Kings, but that of necessity the one
must overthrow the other; and matters going thus, he who
giveth the first blow hath the advantage. Thus did Men judge
diversly, after their proper interests, of the Deeds of others.</p>
            <p>The Torrent of these disorders increasing, Laws are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
Towns, Villages, Houses, the High-ways are every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
afflicted with Rapine, Fire and Fury, and save needy
boldness, nothing is safe and secure in any place.</p>
            <p>The changing Multitude (like Mad-men limning Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicts
with their won blood) delight in their Proceedings and
daily increase the number of the Rebels. In this Insurrection
the King is reduced to many extremities, and is said to have
thought upon an escape Sea to <hi>France,</hi> if he had not been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by <hi>Iames Kennedie,</hi> Bishop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> who told
him, that to leave the Kingdom was to give all over to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency
of his Rebels, and for fear of burning, to leap into
the fire it self. That besides the high and long continued title
of a King, which the best part of his Subjects yet reverenced,
he had sufficient Friends and Warlike men, who appearing in a
Field with him would raise a just fear in the hearts of those
who so hainously dared disobey him. That God would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to revenge wronged Majesty, and turn their hopes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair;
That the Common People were ever changing, and a
little time would make them flow to these from whom they
did ebb; and all would return again, except such as were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51978:42"/>
of other offences, or such whose poverty made them fear a
beggerly Peace as their greatest punishment. That his chiefest
and principall City stood good for him, which example the
other Towns would undoubtedly follow; that Rebellion was
like Thunder the noise of which (if observed duely) was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
more terrible then the blow, and dissolved ordinarily in
tears of Repentance and fair Weather: that here the prudence
of Prince manifesteth it self, when he cannot suppress and
stop all the evils in his State, to suffer and tolerate the least, and
with leasure and time, abolish and extirpate the greater, and
make vertue of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King,</hi> by the Bishops Counsel and Assistance, gathereth
an Army, but will not try the hazard of a Battel, before those
he had advertised and sent for, should-joyn with these already
about him, and his Forces from all the Quarters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be united. In the North, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Huntley</hi> had raised a
goodly Company to come to his aid; but the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Crawford,</hi>
a Confederate of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> with a power of the
men of <hi>Anguss,</hi> and all who would follow him, guided by some
<hi>French</hi> Commanders essayed to cut off his passage, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth
him at <hi>Breche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> the Battel is fought, and the victory
inclined where the Kings Standard was displayed by the Earl
of <hi>Huntley.</hi> The equity of the cause laid aside, the occasion of
this Victory was ascribed to <hi>Iohn Coloss</hi> of <hi>Bonnymoon,</hi> who
having one of the wings of the Army to guide, which confist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of battel-axes, great swords, and long spears, and the best
invasive weapons, in the hottest of the skirmish gave ground,
and left the middle Ward naked upon his side: the reason of
his revolt is reported, that the night before the Battel, when
every man was resolving with his affairs of the world, <hi>Bonny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon</hi>
requested the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> of whom he held his
Lands Ward and relief, since the next day he was resolved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be victorious or die in the field, to subscribe a Precept
(himself falling) for entring his Son to his Lands. This the
Superiour refusing, the Vassal out of a just indignation, when
he should have charged, retired, and his Company with him.
Such thoughts possessed not the Earl of <hi>Huntlies</hi> minde; he dealt
not so sparingly with his friends in hope of their good service:
To the <hi>Forbesses, Oglebies, Leslies, Grants, Irwines,</hi> he freely gave
many of his own lands, which raised their courage to the height.
In requital of which, the King after bestowed upon him the
Lands of <hi>Badyeeno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ere the Earls of <hi>Douglass, Crawford, Ormond, Murray.</hi>
the Lord <hi>Balvenye,</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> and others, are cited
to answer according to Law: They instead of appearing, in
the Night, upon the Doors of the principal Churches and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places eminent, fix many Placates and Libels, signed with
their hands; which bear, the Earl of <hi>Douglass</hi> nor his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
will never obey command nor charge in time coming,
nor answer citation, for that the King is not a just Master, but
a Blood-sucker, a Murtherer, a Transgressor of Hospitality,
a Surpriser of the Innocent and such who deserved no harm
at his hands: Not long after the King levied an Army, which
by the approaching Winter did little Service; and the Earl of
<hi>Douglass,</hi> to save the Lands of <hi>Beatrice</hi> his Brothers Widow,
unseparated from the House, sought by a Dispensation from
the Pope to have her in Marriage, alledging her untouched of
his Brother; which being refused him, he kept her in place of
his wife, the effect of his Sorbon Divinity, and found hereby
more Bryers then Roses.</p>

pulling down the Houses of his Rebel-Subjects, and wasting

continued almost two whole years, the Faction of the

Incursions, sundry of the chief men and heads considering
the least faults were the best, that it was better to strike fail in
time, then make a full Shipwrack of their persons, Honors,
and the well of the Kingdom and State, counsel the <hi>Earl,</hi> that
Fervors growing colder, since it could not be undone which
was done, he would not set greater work on foot, but proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with conveniency, submit himself friendly to the King,
who had as much goodness as generosity, and sought and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
nothing of his Subjects but obedience; and having now
prove how difficile it was to overcome them by Arms, was
(perhaps) as much tyred as they, would pardon these faults
which he could not otherways amend. Necessity in Affairs of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51978:43"/>
Princes, constraining them to yield to many things in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against their first Conclusions, and resolve to grant that
which they could not well hinder: That there were many
hours in the day, and the hearts of Princes were subject to
change in them; that he should not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orsake the publique weal
of the Kingdom for his private Considerations: That after
this trouble of State, he might be more esteemed and sought
after by the King, as it is ordinarily practised among Princes
and great men, who affect onely that which is necessary unto
them.</p>
            <p>To these the Earl answered, That they had went too far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to think upon any cowardly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

that the onely vertue under a Tyrant, was to die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
that other vertues did fight, but constancy alone tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed:
That for himself, he would never trust his life to
the mercy of those who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder colour of friendship and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting,
had first made away his two Kinsmen, and after his
own Brother; for if they being Innocents, were thus handled,
what might he expect who had been the occasion of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction
in the State? He that once had broken his faith, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by a surety, is unable again (in Law) to contract and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Bond with any; Who will be surety between a King and
his Subjects? That Treaties, Agreements, Covenants, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
of a Prince with Rebellious Subjects, engage him no
farther, no longer then the Term-time or day, which pleaseth
him to accept, observe and keep them, as they turn or may
turn to his utility and advantage; that as in Nature there is
no regress found from privation to an habit, so neither in State
men once disgraced do return to their former Honors: That
Princes mortally hated all Subjects who had either attempted
to over-rule them by power, or had cast any terror upon them;
and howsoever by constraint they bear sail for a time, in the
end they were sure pay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>masters: That there was nothing more
contrary to a good Agreement, then to appear to be too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and busie to seek to obtain it; he would sue for none: That
all his days he had loved sincerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> constancy and fidelity, and
could not unsay and recant what he had promised and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
nor do against his heart: His friends and his own stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was by their Swords, which should either advance their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes
and turn them Victors, or they would die Honorably
like themselves and men, and not ignobly be murthered like
Beasts.</p>
            <p>This free and dangerous resolution of the Earl moved many
who heard, to provide for their own safety, and resolve not to
suffer long misery for other mens folly, finding this war was
not like to have any end, and that danger and death would be
the only reward of their Rebellion. Amongst others the Earl
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51978:44"/>
of <hi>Crawford,</hi> after great adversity, when he could not move the
Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> to submit himself to the Kings clemency,
with many tears and protestations of his sincere love and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
to him, left him; and some weeks after, as the King was in
progress in <hi>Anguss,</hi> in a sad penitential manner, accompanied
with his best friends, coming in his way with much humility
and sorrow, He acknowledged his fault, pleading rather for
pity to his house, which had so long flourished, then to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The King knowing his Example would be no small oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to weaken the power of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> and that
of all the Rebels he was the greatest object of his Clemency,
was content to receive him, but he would have it done by the
mediation of <hi>lames Kennedie,</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Creightoun,</hi> once his greatest Enemies, which he refused
not to embrace. Thus freely remitted with those who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
him, he returned to his own house of <hi>Phanheaven,</hi> where
within few moneths he died of a burning Ague.</p>
            <p>The three Estates, after assembled at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where <hi>Iames
Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> the Countess <hi>Beatrix,</hi> whom he kept by way
of a pretended Marriage, <hi>Archembold Dowglass, Earl</hi> of <hi>Murrey,
George Earl</hi> of <hi>Ormond, Iohn Dowglass,</hi> Lord of <hi>Balveny,</hi> with
others their adherents, friends and followers, are Attainted of
High Treason, and their Lands and Goods are Confiscate and
discerned to be seized on to the Kings use. The <hi>Earldom</hi> of
<hi>Murrey</hi> is given to <hi>Iames Creighton,</hi> who had married the eldest
Daughter of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Murrey;</hi> but he perceiving he could
not possess it in peace, turned it back again to the King. At
this time <hi>George Creightoun</hi> was created <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Caithness; Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Hay</hi> Constable <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arrole, Darly, Halles, Boyd, Lyle</hi> and
<hi>Lorn,</hi> Lords of Parliament; the King maketh a rode into <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>
reducing every strong hold and Castle of the Countrey
to his Power; <hi>Dowglass-dale</hi> he abandoned to the spoil of the
Souldier.</p>
            <p>Matters at home turning desperate, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to that pass, that he knew not to what to wish or
fear, <hi>Iames Hammilton</hi> of <hi>Cadyow</hi> is sent to <hi>England</hi> to invite
the ancient enemy of the kingdom to take a part of her spoil,
and help to trouble the <hi>King.</hi> But the <hi>English</hi> had greater bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
amongst themselves then could permit them to Wedd
the Quarrels of the <hi>Earl.</hi> After Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun</hi> was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an excuse, and regret that some of the <hi>English</hi> Lords
could not supply their Confusion, but only by their Counsel,
he advised the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Dowglass</hi> to trust to his own Power and
Forces, which were sufficient, measuring their Courage, and
not counting their heads, to hold good against the <hi>King.</hi> There
was no humane affairs where men were not necessitated to run
some danger, nor any business taken in hand with such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51978:44"/>
which by unknown causes, and even light ones, might
not run a hazard of some mishap; That he should study to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and accept of what was most honorable and least dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
it was better once to try the worst then ever to be in fear
of it: it was fit for him to commit something to fortune, and
wisdom could counsel nothing but to shun the greatest evil.
This lingring war would not only tire, but over-come and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
them, when one fair day of battel, either by death or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
would Crown their desires. Others advised him not to
hazard upon a Battel, except upon seen and approved advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and to time it out a while; in this lingring war a Truce
might be agreed upon, which ere long might turn in a Peace,
in which every thing passed might be forgotten and pardoned;
That Wars were managed more by occasions and times then
by arms; That the King could not be now but tyred, since he
had learned, that by essaying by arms to overcome them he
had gained nothing but trained up his Subjects, whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Rebels, in all warlike Discipline, and had his Countrey
spoiled and the Policy defaced. Should they once enter in
blood, all hopes were gone of any conditions of peace.</p>
            <p>At this time the King besieging the Castle of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the besieged, hither marcheth with all his Forces the <hi>Earl</hi>
of <hi>Dowglass;</hi> being come within view of the <hi>Kings</hi> Army, he
observeth their march slow, the countenances of his Souldiers
altered, much whispering, and their spirits in a manner deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Countrymen were to fight against Countreymen, friends
against friends, and all against their Prince. Interpreting this
rather to proceed from their weariedness, then want of good
will to enter the Lists, as well to refresh and cherish them to
be more prompt and lusty of courage the next morning, as to
take counsel what course to follow, and how to dispose of their
Game, he stayeth that afternoon and pitcheth his Tents. To
men unfortunate every thing turneth an Enemy. Whether Sir
<hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> gave way to this, or not, uncertain; but after
(it is said) that in a chase he told the Earl, he had neglected
the opportunity of Fight, and should never see so fair a day
again, in which he might have hazarded one Cast of a Dye for
a whole Kingdom. But his Fortune was now declined, and
(perhaps) would never stand upright; that by giving that
night to his Souldiers to pause and deliberate on the matter,
they would (perchance) take the safest way, be more advised
what to enterprise the next morning, readily not fight at all,
consisting of a number of bold young Gentlemen, Volunteers,
who for the most part out of bravery and compassion follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; That the Kings Army by his lingring and lying off
was encouraged, finding they were to cope with men who
would adviseere they fought. After which speeches he bad the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51978:45"/>
Earl farewel: And now, knowing that the way lay open both
for Pardon and Favor to him that would first seek it, he in the
night breaketh out with some friends, and having got over
the fields betwixt the two Camps, was brought sately to the
King, who graciously received, and freely pardoned him:
The Army having understood the clandestin Revolt and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
of Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton,</hi> disbanded, every man slipping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by secret passages to his own habitation, that on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
there was nothing to be seen but the solitary field upon
which they had encamped: The King out of joy of this blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Victory, caused Proclaim in all his chief Towns, That
since Soveraign Authority had no less splendor by the actions
of Clemency, then by these of Justice; all those who had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Earl of <hi>Douglass,</hi> and been of his party, rather by
mis-fortune and unadvised rashness, then any evil will against
him, should be freely pardoned: Those who would abandon
the Earl and come to the Kings Camp, whosoever they were,
no Justice, no Law should trouble them, but they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to mercy, and have all pardon: After this Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
many submitted themselves to the King and were pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
though Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> was remitted, yet that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of reconciliation worse mischief might not be plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the King sent him, with the Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Rossline</hi> during his pleasure, and the taking in of the
Castle of <hi>Abercorn;</hi> remembring also it was some prejudice
to a Prince to be obliged to any Rebel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Douglass</hi> gathering together the split pieces of
his Ship-wrack, with his Brothers, and so many of his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
as would not forsake him, flieth to <hi>England;</hi> here with
much Travel, by many promises of Rewards, great hopes of
spoil, gathering unto him a power of Out-laws, Felons, Banc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-outs,
and such as lived by Rapine, as well of his own
Nation, as of the English, he maketh a Rode upon the West
Borders of <hi>Scotland;</hi> some Villages being burnt, many preys,
much spoil driven into <hi>England;</hi> at last, he meeteth with the
valiant men who were appointed ro defend the <hi>Marches,</hi> the
<hi>Maxwells</hi> and <hi>Scots;</hi> here in a furious skirmish his Companies
are discomfited: <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Brother is slain,
and his head sent to the King; the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> is taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner;
himself with the Lord <hi>Balvenny</hi> with great difficulty es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeth
in a Forest; when he sought to return again into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he findeth all Passages stopped up, the wayes layed for
him, and begining to feel much want, he is constrained in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised
habit to lurk meanly in the inmost parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
till he wandred toward the far High-lands, where finding <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald</hi>
Earl of <hi>Ross,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Isles,</hi> one of his League, a man
cruel, arrogant, unpolisht, after many discourses and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

with him (being no less eloquent then active) he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
him with great hopes (after a division of the Kingdom
between them two) of an absolute power and Government of
of all the High-lands, besides the wealth and treasure which
he would purchase by the spoil: He requireth onely he would
break upon the more civil Countries, bring all the Fire-brands
he could to kindle and trouble them, and cut work for the
King, whilst he with new supplies, and a great Army to be
raised in <hi>England,</hi> should invade the <hi>Marches</hi> and bordering
Countries: The Earl of <hi>Ross,</hi> who thought nothing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him, being to himself in these barbarous parts by phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
a King, and was used to vaunt of a long pedegree from
<hi>Fergus,</hi> relisbeth the profit and possibility of this Enterprise,
sweareth to leave nothing undone for the accomplishing of it;
and parting with him upon mutual assurance, intreateth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
celerity and swift performance of what they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Scarce was the Earl of <hi>Douglass</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Ross,</hi> the two pillars of his Designs being Injustice and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
supported by fair hopes from, the <hi>South</hi> with his wilde
Mountainers and Islanders (like an inundation) over-runneth
the Neighbor bounds: <hi>Argile</hi> suffereth the first effects of their
fury; the Isle of <hi>Arrain</hi> is taken, &amp; the Castle made a Bon fire (as
if they were the sacrifice for the sinns of the rest) the Bishop of
the Isles saveth himself by flight, and taketh Sanctuary; <hi>Lochqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi>
and <hi>Murryland</hi> are spoiled, the Town of <hi>Innerness</hi> is set on
fire, the Castle surprized, Murthers, Ravishings, Robberies,
with what insolency the barbarous Canibals could commit, are
every where, and the sad image of death ravageth amongst the
common people: The Earl of <hi>Douglass</hi> now at his last shifts
and efforts, leaveth no shifts nor helps unsought out; such who
lived upon prey and spoil resort unto him; he maketh hot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incursions,
and after a most hostile maner, which purchased
him the hatred of all his Countrey-men, and turned those who
were indifferent in his quarrel, his professed enemies: This
ravage continuing, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (after slain
at <hi>Caxtoun</hi>-field) whom love of the valor of the house of <hi>Doug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass,</hi>
and true commiseration, had brought to take arms with
him, invadeth one quarter of the <hi>Marsh,</hi> and the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Dowglass</hi> turneth towards another: But whilest they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed,
and more eager and intentive to carry away spoil, then
to look to their own safety and military discipline, the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>Auguss,</hi> with Sir <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Cadyow,</hi> put them both
(with number and confusion overborn) to flight, slaying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and taking more prisoners: After this overthrow, during
the Kings reign, the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Douglass</hi> deliberating not to oppose
longer to necessity, but to be still till better times, never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted

            <p>Amidst these incursions, the Earl of <hi>Orm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y her out
of a certain fear of her life, submitteth her felt to the Kings
Clemency. The King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who denied not mescy to any sought it
of him, that the less guilty amongst the seditious might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves, and the obstinate remain the less powerful
and weak, receiveth her; and giveth her in Marriage to his
Brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Athole,</hi> son to the Black Knight of
<hi>Lorne,</hi> designing for her Dowry the Lordship of <hi>Balveny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By her example the Countess of <hi>Ross,</hi> abhorring the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and cruelties (as she gave out) of her barbarous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but rather out of policy to be an Agent for him, flyeth
to the King, and hath Revenues allowed her for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of her Estate. Not long after the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Ross</hi> himself, the
misadventure of his Confederates having taught him now
some wisdom, having seen the <hi>Kings</hi> clemency towards others
equal to him to Treason and Rebellion, by many humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
craved pardon, and begged peace. The King by his
great prudence, and the course of the affairs of his Kingdom,
knew that it was necessary sometimes to condiscend to the
imperfections and faults of some Subjects and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
apply and accomodate himself to that which though
according to the strictness of equity was not due, yet for the
present occasion and reason of State was convenient answered,
he would neither altogether pardon him, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

there being many signs of his wickendness, few of his changed
minde; when honestly without fraud or guile, he should erave
a Pardon, and give satisfaction to those whom by blood and
pillage he had wronged and by some noble action deface the
remembrance of his former crimes, then should it be good time
to receive him. Notwithstanding this should not discourage
him, but he should know he had a desire to make him relish the
effects of his bounty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so he himself would finde the means and
subject. In this interim he wished him to keep the common
peace of the Countrey, and not oppress any of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

            <p>The Crown of <hi>England</hi> hanging at this point, the Queen to

These remembring the duties one King oweth to another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Queens and their Sons, with the approbation of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of their Party, to restore to the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the lands
of <hi>Northumberland, Cumberland</hi> and Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> after
the manner the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> in former times had held
these Territories of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> so he would raise
an Army, and advance to their aid and supply.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> sent hither also his Ambassadors, giving in
many complaints against <hi>King Henry;</hi> he had oppressed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with taxations, and all kinds of exactations; he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to places of State and Government new men, by whose
Counsel, and his Queen, he governed only; he despised the old
Nobility, he had lost <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Gascony,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> had been
lost by him; <hi>England</hi> was likely to run the same danger. They
could not longer suffer his dull sluggishness, and his Wifes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
pride; he was courageless in War, and base in peace.
For the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> if Justice did not warrant his claim, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his Descent were undisputable, and his Title without all
exception, he would not desire the possession nor succession
of the Crown. King <hi>Iames</hi> should remember, it was King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
who entertained the late Dissentions and Civil Discords of
<hi>Scotland;</hi> he supported the banished <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and after
they had much enlarged their discourse with reasons of a just
War against King <hi>Henry,</hi> if <hi>King Iames</hi> will arise in arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and assist them, They promise to restore and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the Forts and Places of importance taken in the old
Wars from the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to him and his Successors.
King <hi>Iames</hi> answered the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors, that he was not
ignorant of the State of their Kingdom, neither to whom
their Crown did appertain, but that he would not take upon
him to be umpire of their strife; for the raising an Army, he
would think upon it, though he had small assurance for the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51978:47"/>
performance of their promised conditions: he had long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the recovering of the lost Fortresses of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their
hands, and now he would try whom he might trust. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
dismissed, the King raised an Army, but left to the
Divination of the posterity, which of the Parties he was to
side. The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Writers affirm he was to aid King
<hi>Henry,</hi> and revenge the death of the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Brother, the <hi>Scottish</hi> to assist the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and that
by a counterfeit Legate from the Pope after he had been upon
his March, he was moved to return. It seemeth perswaded by
the <hi>French</hi> King (the ancient Confederate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and who
for that end had sent his Ambassador) to keep the <hi>English</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their own Countrey, and disable them in their Conquest of
<hi>France,</hi> he intended upon the advantage of this Civil discord
to make a rode in <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> made an Algarad by
Sea upon <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> Army being gathered, that it should not loyter in
idleness, attending greater intelligence from the event of the
<hi>English</hi> Factions, having passed the <hi>Tweed,</hi> invadeth the Town
of <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> which with little travel is taken and equalled with
the Ground; the Castle a strong Fortress is besieged. Whilst
the King here passeth the time, inviting it more by courtesies
and blandishments, then Ammunition and Warlike Engines
to be rendred to him, Commissioners come from the Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> requiring him to leave his Siege, and contain himself
within his own kingdom, unless he would run the hazard to
engage himself in a War against the whole Body of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England;</hi> they give him thanks for his forwardness to
their supply; all things succeeding after their desires now, and
as they could have wished, they request him to return home;
when their necessity required his aid, they would implore it,
and not prove forgetful for what he should do towards him.
<hi>King Iames</hi> asked the Commissioners, if the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and
his Associates had sent any direction concerning the keeping
of their promises to him, when he should appear with an Army;
They assuring him they had no such Commission; I (answered
the <hi>King</hi>) before their Embassie came, had resolved to take in
and throw down this Castle builded upon my bounds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by no benefit obliged to any of your Factions, will not for
words leave off what I am about by arms to perform. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
departing the <hi>King</hi> caused apply his Battery against
the Castle, which couragiously defended it self, and holding
good beyond expectation bred an opinion that famine would
be the only Engine to make it render.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> Army daily at this Siege increased, and amongst
all the Companies none were more forward and prompt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
their duties in this Service, then those of the late League

            <p>Who will take a fair view of this Prince, shall finde him to
have been endowed with what conditions and qualities are to
be desired or wished in a Monarch, both for minde and body,
of an excellent feature and pleasant aspect, a strong vigorous
complexion, given to all Knightly exercises: He is said to have
had a broad red spot upon one of his cheeks, from which by
his Country-men he was named <hi>Iames with the fiery face,</hi> which
would make Physiognomists conceive, he was of an hot, active,
violent disposition, and one who had more need of restraint
then encouragement in all difficulties; yet in his actions we
finde him temperate, stayed, and of a well setled humor, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
upon sound grounds, and after mature deliberation,
being much given to follow the advice and counsel of grave
men about him; He was upright, sincere, affable, courteous,
loving to his Domesticks, humane towards his Enemies, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and benign to all men, a lover of Justice, liberal, but
without oppression of his loyal Subjects, wise, in adve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sity
industrious and diligent, politick in Affairs of State; having
always raised up one Faction to relieve him from the hazard
and burthen of another, and expose the Faction he most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the nearest hazard: He was wisely diffident, and put on
a judicial distrust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> often to be governed as occasions should va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and could dissimulate according to the fashions and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the time: He seemeth to have been indifferent in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Favorites, and that he could ever as well transfer his
fancy, as he had setled his affection; For like the Sun he
would make a round, and not always shine upon one Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</p>
            <p>The death of the two Earls of <hi>Douglass</hi> were fatal to him;
and though he was innocent of the first, the second chanced
deservedly in his hand; Couragious Princes are not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by any Subject how great soever: Confederations and
Leagues are fearful attempts against Soveraignty, and for the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51978:48"/>
most part end with the ruine of their Authors: The extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earls of <hi>Douglass</hi> in the person of <hi>Iames</hi> (a Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>man)
proceeded rather from his own stubbornness, then any
male-talent the King had against him. In all Nations it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
That there are some Families fatal to the ruine of their
Common wealths, and some persons fatal to the ruine of the
Houses and Race of which they are descended: Since in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
some have no compassion of their Prince, nor the loss
of his Honor, a Prince should not much regret their loss, nor
the ruine of their persons and Estates: His great clemency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in this, That the heads taken away of that long Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
he followed no particular revenge upon their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
not onely granting pardons, but forgetting the offences;
knowing it was better to heal and cure the faulty and sick
members of a State, then to abolish and cut them away; and
more valor for a Prince to overcome his own passions and just
wrath, then to vanquish and subdue his proudest enemies;
yet was not his clemency a soft weakness, it being no less cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to forgive all then to spare none, but an order and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Justice, temperate with severity towards some more
then towards others, according to their demerits: He was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sensible of the afflictions of such as were distressed, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the Countesses of <hi>Douglas</hi> and <hi>Ross:</hi> His life having set in
the Orient of his Age and hopes, he deserveth in the Records
of Memory and Fame, a place amongst the best but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Princes.</p>
            <p>He had Issue of his Queen, <hi>Iames</hi> who succeeded, <hi>Alexander</hi>

            <p>Amongst the Garrisons placed in <hi>Northumberland</hi> by the

under the Command of <hi>Peter Bruce,</hi> otherwise named

lying near to <hi>Durham,</hi> there beleagured him: Whether this
man came from the Race of the <hi>Bruces</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or no, is

their friendship to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and of their valour
to the <hi>French;</hi> whilst he is everywhere beset, and near past hope

being known a far to Captain <hi>Bruce,</hi> he taketh a resolution to

            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> having taken all the Castles and Forts which
in the North held out against him, placing Garrisons in them,
returned to <hi>London:</hi> as King <hi>Henry,</hi> void both of counsel and

amidst her last Trances when her Son had come to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit

sense.</p>
            <p>That Providence which brought me upon the Earth, and set a Crown
on my head, doth now recal and remove me to a better Kingdom;
and my happiness is not in this a little, that I leave this life without
change of that estate in which I peaceably lived. Death now sheweth
me as in a mirrour, the frailty of all worldly Pomp and glory, which
before by the marble colours of false greatness was overshadowed and
covered from me. My Griefs have been many, few my Contentments;
The most eminent of which, was the hopes I conceived of you, and
my other children: And now may greatest regret is, that I leave you
before I could see my wishes accomplished towards you. My onely
care was to have you brought up in all vertue, and goodness: But
Heaven shall bestow that charge to more prudent Governors: Always
take these motherly directions from me, who can leave you no better
Legacy. Be earnest to observe these Commandments which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto you by Religion, for this supporteth the Scepters of
Princes: and a Religious King cannot but have obedient Subjects.
What an unreasonable thing is it, that a King will have a People to
acknowledge him for their Soveraign Prince upon Earth, and will
not acknowledge God for his supream Lord in Heaven? A King who
rebelleth against God, all subordinate Creatures will rebel against
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51978:52"/>
him. Love my children, and laying aside the Port and Stateliness of
a King, receive them with the affection of a Brother. Endeavor to
make your Subjects obey you more out of Love then Fear: or make
your self beloved and feared both together, seeing love alone of it
self is often cause of contempt, and fear alone begets hatred. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
ye Govern not the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soft effeminate People of the <hi>South,</hi> but
a sierce Warlike <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> which oftner use to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then commanded by their Princes. Be sparing to lay Subsidies on
them, which maketh many Male-contents; and live upon your own,
suffering others to enjoy what is theirs: Beware of Flatterers, and
exalting undeserving Persons above your ancient Nobility. Suffer not
your Prerogatives to come in Question; but foreseeing the danger,
rather give way to all that with reason is demanded of you. Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
your Passions; He shall never Govern a Kingdom, who cannot
govern himself, and bring his Affections within the Circle of Reason.
It fears me, Envy and Malice arm themselves against you, which
to overcome, endeavor to be Martial in your self; for a Prince that
is not Martial in himself, shall never be freed of Rebell on amongst
his subjects: a strong arm should hold the Ballance of Iustice:
When dissention ariseth, be not a Loyterer and Sluggard, but with all
celerity suppress it in the infancy. Rebellion is like fire in a City,
which should be quenched, though with the pulling down of the
neighbour Houses: Others will instruct you in the art of Governing,
with greater curiosity and wisdom, but not with the like love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
I wish this Counsel be ingraven in your heart and conscience
after my death, for a perpetual testimony of my sincerity in your
education. And if by the unjust counsel of others, ye be brought to
practise ought contrary to these instructions, Remember ye cannot
shun inevitable dangers both to your State and Person. But now I am
warned from above to deliver this grief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>King</hi> as he increased in years, increasing in strength and
ability for exercises either of recreation or valour, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
is given to a Brother of the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> to be bred in
Knightly Prowess; a man singular for his Education abroad
and demeanor at home. The <hi>Kennedies</hi> were now aged, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
tyred to give such assiduous attendance at Court as they
were wont, and the times required. The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> by the
weakness of his Co-partners governed the State alone, as Sir
<hi>Alexander</hi> his Brother did the young <hi>King</hi> To whose Natural
inclination he did so comply and conform himself, that he had
the whole trust of his affairs, and the <hi>King</hi> had no thoughts but
his. So soon as the King began to know himself, he turned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51978:53"/>
of being subject to the Laws of Minority, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
should be restrained by that Authority which did derive
from him, to loath the Superintendency and Government of
others, and to affect an unseasonable Priviledge to be at his
own disposal and the governing himself. Many things are
done without the advice of the Governors, and occasion is
sought to be disburdened of their Authority. The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi>
and his Brother in a little time increasing in greatness, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an intention to transfer the Power of the State and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Court to their Family, fail not to finde opportunity
to free the <hi>King</hi> from the severity and rigour of the Governors
Schooling, and to frame him an escape. Whilst the <hi>King</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hayls,</hi> Lord <hi>Sommervail,</hi> Sir
<hi>Andrew Carre</hi> of <hi>Cesford,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Boyd,</hi> agree upon a
match of Hunting, and will have the <hi>King</hi> Umpire of the
Game; Early, the morning following, the Gentlemen who
were upon the Plot failed not in their Attendance. The <hi>King</hi>
being a mile off the Town, and holding the way towards <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Kennedy,</hi> whose quarter then was to attend,
and who had leasurely followed, suspecting this Hunting to be
a Game of State, the <hi>King</hi> continuing his Progress, laying his
hands upon the Reins of his Bridle, requested him to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> for that he perceived the time was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for him to go further, neither was heat a convenient
match in absence of his best deserving followers: Sir <hi>Alexander
Boyd</hi> impatient that the <hi>King</hi> should have been thus stayed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
injurious words stroke the Reverend Governour with a
Hunting-staff upon the head, and took the <hi>King</hi> along with him
to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> At a frequent meeting of the States, the <hi>Kennedies</hi>
urged to have the <hi>King</hi> continue under Minority, the <hi>Boyds</hi> to
take the Government in his own Person; after long contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wisdom being overcome by boldness, the Authority of
the better party was forced to give place, and yield to the will
of the greater. Thus the Faction of the <hi>Boyds</hi> prevailed.</p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Kennedies</hi> full of indignation, and breathing
Revenge, leave the Court; cares, grief and age about this time
brought <hi>Iames Kennedie,</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to his Tomb,
which in great magnificence he had raised in a Church builded
by himself in the City of St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> where also he
founded a Colledge of Philosophy, and indued it with many
Priviledges, and sufficient Endowments to entertain Professors.
By the Death of this Prelate, venerable for his Wisdom, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
for his Justice and the tranquillity following his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and magnificent in all his actions, the Glory of the Court
and Country suffered a great Eclipse.</p>
            <p>For, he taken away, the <hi>Boyds</hi> laying Foundations for their
power and greatness, began to turn all to their own advantage;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51978:53"/>
The first mark of their envy was <hi>Patrick Graham,</hi> the Brother of
Bishop <hi>Iames Kennedie</hi> by the Mother, who was Sister to' <hi>King
Iames</hi> the first; after this man had been chosen Bishop of St.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> as the Custom then was, by the Chapter appointed
for that Election, he was barred from his Place, and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repulsed by the Faction at Court: To repair which indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
he made a journey to <hi>Rome;</hi> where, being a Man noble by
birth above others, for his Learning and many Virtues, in a
little time, by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, he was re-established
and confirmed in his Place.</p>
            <p>During his abode at <hi>Rome,</hi> the old Question concerning the
liberty of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> began to be exagitated.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> contested, that he was Metropolitan
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the twelve <hi>Bishops</hi> of that Kingdom
were subject to his Jurisdiction. <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> remonstrated
how the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> considering the usual Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Kingdoms, was often unaccessable to the
Church-men of <hi>Scotland,</hi> especially in Causes of appellation.
The <hi>Pope,</hi> after the hearing of both Parties, erected the See ofs
St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to the dignity of an Archbishops See; and <hi>Patrick
Graham,</hi> not only was made Primate and Metropolitan of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> ordained to have the other Bishops under him, but
for the space of three years designed Legate for the Pope, with
full power to Correct and Restore the Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
and examine the Manners and Conversation of the
Clergy: Notwithstanding these favors of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the worth and excellencies of the man himself he dared
not return home to his own Country before the declining of
the Fortunes of the <hi>Boyds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Family seemed now in the Zenith and Vertical point
of its greatness, no imputation could be laid to the <hi>Boyds</hi> in
the time of their Government, except that they brought the
young King by their private working, without the consent
and approbation of the other Regents, to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> for the
assuming the Government in his Minority. In approbation
of their innocency, and to warrant them from this danger,
the King in a Parliament declareth publickly, that the <hi>Boyds</hi>
were not the Authors, nor Projectors of that business, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Assisters of him and his followers, being not formal but
instrumentary causes of his coming to the Helm of the State
himself: That they were so far from being obnoxious to any
blame or reproach for this deed, that they deserved immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
thanks, and an honorable Guerdon in all time to come, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obeyed him in that which was most just, honest and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for the well of the Kingdom. Upon this Declaration
of the King, the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> required the present action might
be registrated amongst the Acts of Parliament, and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51978:54"/>
what was desired, but not with that success was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for.</p>
            <p>In this Parliament, the other Regents are rid of their charge,
the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> being made only Governor of the Kingdom,
and the object of all mens respects: having the whole power
and authority to minister justice of all kinds to the Subjects
during the Kings non-age, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill he had fully compleat one
and twenty years, the defence of the Kings Person, of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the keeping of the two Ladies his Sisters, are trusted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: He hath all the Towns, Castles, Fortresses, Sea-ports,
Places of Importance at his Command. These proceedings of
the Parliament seemed to some very strange in advancing
Men already great enough, and bestowing upon them all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of State, and adding power to such who wanted only will
to do mischief, except that they knew well how to abase and
pull them down again, making their fall the more sudden.
<hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> having the Reins of Government in his
hands, and the custody of the Kings Sisters, dazelld with the
golden Sun of honour, to lay more sure the foundation of his
greatness, joyneth in Marriage <hi>Thomas</hi> his eldest <hi>Son,</hi> a youth
of extraordinary endowments, both of minde and body, with
<hi>Margaret</hi> the Kings eldest Siste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; Not long before designed by
her Mother to have been given in Marriage to <hi>Edward</hi> Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> and he is created Earl of <hi>Arran.</hi> The Father know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how easily the conversation of young persons breedeth a
liking, had brought them up together, which turning in a
love and delight of others company, concluded last in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
This match though royal, great and rich, instead of
supporting the Fortunes of the <hi>Boyds</hi> much weakened them
turning them the objects of envy. The Nobles repined at
it, and the common people (lighter than the wind and more
variable than the Rain-bow) made it the subject of their fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
discourses. Now (said they) the <hi>Boyds</hi> aspire to the Crown;
for the King with his Brothers removed, it appertaineth to
them, a Kingdom being the Dowry often of a Wife of the
blood Royal. The <hi>Kennedies,</hi> and such who disliked the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government take the occasion of the discontentment of
the Nobility, and the rumors of the people, to shake the Kings
minde towards the Governor, and change the brawl of State.
To this end they give way to great and universal oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
most of which were hatched and occasioned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
By these in a short time the Commons turn licentious
and dissolute, contemning all Government, every man do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what seemed best in his own eyes, and the Gentry divide
in Factions: Such who wont to live upon Rapine and Theft
return to their wonted Trades: honest men are spoiled of their
goods; the seditious and wicked are maintained and defended
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51978:54"/>
against all Laws and Justice by their Parties. The State thus
troubled, and all order confounded, by slie and crafty men,
who at first pretended great friendship and interest towards
the <hi>Boyds,</hi> the Kings affection towards them is assailed, and
resolutions tryed. Many times having been plausibly listened
unto, at last, pulling off their masks, they lay imputations
against them. They remonstrate to him what great disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was between the King of <hi>Scotlands</hi> eldest Sister and the
Son of the Lord <hi>Boyd;</hi> that by this match he was robbed of
one of the fairest jewels of his Crown; the <hi>Boyds</hi> should not
have appropriated that to themselves of wich they had only
the keeping; she should have been reserved for some neighbor
Prince, by which Alliance the state of the Kingdom, and the
Person of the King might have been in great safety. For, if the
<hi>King</hi> should chance to be infested by some insolent nobility, the
name and power of a neighbor Prince were sufficient to keep
him safe on his Throne, which by this match was endangered.
They suggested that the <hi>Boydes</hi> builded their estimation in
the air of popular applause, and endeavored to endear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the opinion of the multitude. A Prince is not a Lord
of that people that loveth another better then him. Should
the <hi>Boydes</hi> be accused of peculate &amp; robbing the King and the
commonTreasure, the King might make a prey of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
conquest, and by their Attaindors reward the services
of many of his necessitated friends, it being acquired most
height to which their riches was increased should be feared;
the faults of all the disorders of the Common wealth are laid
upon the <hi>Boydes,</hi> as the Authors of every breaking out &amp; sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that they might the more securely possess the places neer
the King At this time complaints from all parts of the
Kingdom, and by all sorts of persons, incessantly being given
unto him, advance the intentions of their enemies, and the
Kings minde naturally inclined to fears and superstition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long tossed and perplexed, began to turn away from the
<hi>Boydes,</hi> and with their power in some degrees brought lower
and lessened (Preambles of Ruine) but he would go lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely
to produce this effect and make one change bring forth
another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> increasing in yeers and youthful perturbations,
is councelled for the continuing of the Race and Succession,
and the keeping hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Person without the common disorders of
the world, to think upon some match profitable for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and honorable for himself. He is courted by many, and
courteth others; the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had offered him his
daughter, as to other Princes his friends and neighbors, but
his minde was not to have her married at all during his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>

               <hi>Andrew Stewart</hi> Lord <hi>Evandale,</hi> then Chancelour of the
Kingdom, with the Bishops of <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Orkenay,</hi> being sent
Embassadors to <hi>Christern</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
and taking up some business concerning the Isles of
<hi>Orkenay</hi> and <hi>Schythland 1468.</hi> the quarrel was taken away
by a marriage to be celebrated between the King and Lady
<hi>Margaret,</hi> King <hi>Christerns</hi> daughter; a Lady thought worthy
of his bed, in respect of the excellency of her beauty, her
royal descent and greatness of her birth. All matters being
agreed upon, these Isles engaged for her Dowry, there wanted
onely an honorable retinue and convoy to bring home the
Lady. To this negotiation, by the craft of some about the
King, and vanity of others who gloryed to see their friend
promoted to such great honour, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> as
a man flourishing in fame and riches, and able to maintaine
and discharge all magnificence, is deputed as the fittest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Thus by the ambition and unattentiveness of his friends,
his worth was made the Scaffold of his ruine; the lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
condition of men of high desert. In the beginning of
the Harvest, accompained with some young Noblemen and
Gallants, most of which were his select friends and well-wishers,
he ascendeth his ships. Whilst as the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
brother in law, he is some moneths riotously entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the <hi>Danish</hi> Court, the rigor of that <hi>Northern</hi> climate, by
the congealing of the Ocean moored up his ships, and barred
all return till the following Spring. In this absence of a man
so neer unto the King, his Father and Uncle, by age, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and their private affaires, not so frequently haunting
the Court as they were accustomed: the <hi>Kennedyes</hi> and they
of the contrary faction having shaken the Kings affection, and
broken these bands (his pleasures, idlenese, and vacancy from
the publike affairs of the State) by which the <hi>Boydes</hi> thought
they had kept him sure, move him, now a litile delighting in
action, to proceed to the consideration of such matters as
might be objected against the government of the <hi>Bodyes.</hi> But
that this might not appear to be an act of Faction, but the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
consent of the Kingdom apart, a Parliament was
summoned to be holden in <hi>November</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Here
<hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> with his brother Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> are sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to answer in Judgement to such points as should be
exhibited against them. At the appointed day the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi>
appeared, but accompanyed with such multitude of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, and numbers of his friends, vassals, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
all in arms with such ostentation and boasting, that the
King and Courtiers were well pleased to suffer them dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solve

               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:51978:55"/>
the King conceived such indignation, that he raised a
strong guard to attend justice and his commandments, and
laid secretly Forces to assist these if the <hi>Boydes</hi> should oppose
his laws by convocation of the Lieges. The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> after
private intelligence of the Mines of the Court to blow him
up, rather amazed then in choler at the change of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
mind, fled into <hi>England;</hi> his brother Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> arested
by sickness, and relying upon his own integrity more then he
ought to have done, considering the malice of his enemies
was brought before the Parliament; his brother and he were
challenged, that upon the tenth of <hi>Iuly 1466.</hi> they laid hands
upon the Kings Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and against his purpose brought him
on the high way to the Castle of <hi>Calendar;</hi> and that by their
private power and consent, contrary to the established order
of the State, and the other Regents advice, they brought the
King to <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> when Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> sought to produce an
act of Parliament for abolition or approbation of this deed as
good service, it was kept up, and he being condemned had
his head cut off. Their other accusations contained the topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
faults of Favourits, that they had enriched themselves
out of the Kings Treasure, monopolized things belonging to
the Crown, diminished the Revenues thereof, removed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men from the Counsel, placing such in their rooms as had
dependency from them. <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arran</hi> imployed in

of Ships, and enacting Laws for the present time were
pretended, a liberal Subside was the greatest aime. His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
being empty, and many of his best friends turning
necessitous and needy, <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord of the <hi>Isles</hi> was attainted
for his own and his Father misdemeanour, the King raiseth
forces to pursue him; the Earle of <hi>Crawford</hi> being made Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
the Earle of <hi>Athole</hi> the Kings Uncle Lieutenant of the
Regiments by land, such means in a short time was used by
the Earle of <hi>Athole,</hi> that the Lord of the Isles submitted
himself to the Kings elemency, and in a convention of the

Earledome of Ross, the lands of <hi>Knap-den</hi> and <hi>Kintyre,</hi> which
the King annexed to the Crown.</p>

<hi>Rome</hi> understood the fall of the <hi>Boydes</hi> returneth to his own

peaceable sort of the Clergy, he divulgateth the Bull of the
<hi>Pope</hi> for his supremacy over the other Churchmen of the
Kingdome, and his power of their tryal and promoting to
benefices, and after caused proclaim it at all publike places.
The laudable Elections anciently used about the Places and
Offices of Churchmen by the corruption of the times, being
taken away, and that Power altogether assumed by the
King. The Courtiers, who were accustomed to sell Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and the Churchmen who were wont to buy them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the Bull, and set themselves against him; by their traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
he is discharged to take the Place or Ornaments of an
Archbishop, or carry any other Cross or Cap then what the
former Bishops used to have. But here they set not up their
rest, <hi>William Schevez</hi> a man in those times admired for his skil
in Astrology, and promoted to be Arch-Dean of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
seconded by <hi>Iohn Lock</hi> the Rector of that University,
a better Grammarian then Christian, excommunicates this
Archbishop for his presumption, and that he sought to bear
rule over his Brethren Bishops. When this censure had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon him, he is degraded and shut up in Prison. <hi>William
Schevez</hi> is after promoted to his place, and consecrated upon
the Passion Sunday in <hi>Lent</hi> at <hi>Holy-rood house,</hi> the King being
present: he likewise receiveth the title and faculty of Legate,
and is confirmed Primate of the Realm; notwithstanding
the impediments objected to <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
concerning that same dignity and preheminencie; <hi>So
various and deceitful are the wayes of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being slow to action, and more inclined to a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
form of life, then to travel and business; his brothers
being Princes of unquiet and restless Spirits, to whom pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51978:57"/>
like imployments were recreations; and withall being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
prodigal desirous of Rule, and to be Governors of the
people themselves, and Kings in fact, how ever their elder
brother was in title; they set themselves altogether to study
novations, and bring the King in contempt with his subjects,
and divert their minds and love towards him. To this effect
they had drawn by their towardness and familiarity, many
of the young Nobles and Gentlemen to follow them. The
King was obnoxious to some publike scandals, for by his too
great frugality, care to increase his Treasure, and study of
purchasing, by taxations, sale of Church Benefices, and too
exact taking up of fines, supervaluation of Wards; he had
gotten the Name of covetous, and was not small distast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Commons. <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> that the
<hi>Scots</hi> by the instigation of the <hi>French,</hi> should not trouble his
new and scarce settled government, imploying all his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and diligence to divide them amongst themselves,
wrought not alittle on the unquiet spirits of these young men.
The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> having been taken upon the Seas by the
<hi>English,</hi> was honorably intertained by him, and with great
hopes sent home; after which time King <hi>Edward</hi> and he
kept alwayes private intelligence together. The Duke being
promoted to the keeping of the Castle of <hi>Dumbar</hi> and Town
of <hi>Barwick;</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> to insinuate himself in his
affection, was wont to whisper unto such who loved him, that
if his brother kept not fair with <hi>England,</hi> he would one day
set him in his Place upon his Royal Throne.</p>
            <p>At this time the King was served by men whom his opinion
of their worth and love towards him had advanced to places,
and whose fortunes and estates wholly depended upon his
safety, and who were less apt to do him harm. His counsel
was likewise of men approved for their affection to him; and
thus secluding great men from his familiarity and affairs, he
gave them cause of offence. His brothers long masking
their ambition under discontentment, stirr the male con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
to complain against the Government, which ordinarily
falleth forth, not because a people is not well governed, but
because great ones would govern themselves. These upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>King</hi> with inglorious sloath, and endeavour by his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to increase the credit of his Brothers. These spared
not to speak evil of him every where, and what they pleased
of his Ministers and Favorits; they said he neither used rule
nor moderation in his proceedings, that his counsel was base,
and of men of no great account, who consulted only to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor

believe, what was plotting against them, was against his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Authority; and that it was not them his brothers and
the Nobility sought to pull down but his Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>His counsellors, servants, and such who loved him, having
long busied their wits to save their Masters reputation, and
that no shadow of weakness should appear to the Common
people, understanding by whom these rumors were first
spread abroad, and observing many of the Nobility and
Gentry to favour the proceedings of his brothers, not daring
disclose themselves to the King what their suspicions made
them fear would come to pass, knowing him naturally su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
an admirer and believer of Divinations, suborn
an aged woman one morning as he went a hunting to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him, and tell, she had by Divination, that he should
beware of his nearest kinsemen; that from them his ruine
was likely to come. This was no sooner told when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was shifted, and some who were upon the Plot began to
comment the Prophesie of his brothers. A Professor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
for his skill in Divination brought from <hi>Germany,</hi> and
promoted to some Church-benefice, about that same time
told the King, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Lyon should be devoured by
his Whelps. <hi>William Schevez,</hi> then Archbishop of Saint
<hi>Andrews,</hi> by way of Astrological predictions, put him in a
fear of imminent dangers from his kindred, though truly he
had his knowledg by Geomancy and good informations upon
earth, by the intelligence between the Nobility and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Many such like aspersions being laid upon the <hi>King,</hi> the
people cryed out that he had only for his fellow-companions
Astrologers and Sooth-sayers, whom as occasion served, he
preserrd to Church-benefices and Bishopricks. <hi>Patrick Graham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
then Prisoner in <hi>Dumferling,</hi> a man desolate and forgotten,
as if there had not been such a man in the world, taking the
opportunity of the rumors of the time, sent a Letter to the
King, which contained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:51978:58"/>That the misery of his imprisonment, was not so greivious unto
him as the sad reports which he heard of his Majestyes estate; he
was hardly brought to believe them, but by his long detention and
imprisonment, he was assured his great enemy was in great credit
with him. That he had brought the King very low in making him
jealous of his brothers by giving trust to his vain Divinations;
and no wonder these Arts bring forth dissentions, which have their
precepts from the father of lyes and discord: to foment discord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
brothers, was reproachful to Religion, and outragious to
Policy, to seek to know things to come by the Stars was great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
that Oracles leave a man in a wilderness of folly.</p>
            <p>That there was no other difference betwixt Necromancy and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology,
saving that in one, men run voluntarily to the Divel, and
in the other ignorantly. Humanity attains not to the secrets above,
and if it did, it is not wise enough to divert the wisdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is not to be resisted, but submitted unto; that never
any had recourse to these Arts, but they had fatal ends; that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
providence permitting that to befal them out of his justice
of necessity, which before the Oracle was sought, was scarce contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
that he should rest upon the Almightyes Providence, and then
all things would succeed well with him, whose favors would wast
him out of the surges of uncertainties.</p>
            <p>After this free opening of his minde, <hi>Patrick Graham</hi> was
removed out of <hi>Dumferling</hi> to the Castle of <hi>Lock<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The people now throughly deceived and incensed against
their King, the most audacious of the Nobility had brought
his brothers on the way of taking the Government to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
their power being able to perform what their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
projected; and the murmuring of the people seeming to

the same; but no such faith should be given unto
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to <hi>B. W. E.</hi> who was living in that time, and whose

they confessed that the Earle of <hi>Marre</hi> had dealt with them in

For the Kings Image being framed in wax, and with
many spels and incantations baptized, and set unto a fire, they
perswaded themselves the Kings Person should fall away as
that image consumed by the fire, and by the death of the
King, the brothers should reach the Government of the State;
with such vanities was the common people amused.</p>

               <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> imputing the death of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the favourits of the King, and avouching them to have
been the occasioners of his distraction, stirred the Nobility
and People to revenge so foul a deed; but whilst he keeps
private meetings with them of his Faction in the Night to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
their enterprise, betrayed by some of his followers,
he is surprised, and imprisoned in the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
Out of which about the appointed time of his tryal, by the
killing of his keeper he escaped, and in a Ship which to that
effects was hired, sailing to the castle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> of which
he had the keeping, he passed to <hi>France.</hi> After the escape of

            <p>The Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> tossed along with civil
troubles, and affecting peace with all their neighbors, by an
equal and mutual consent of thoughts send at one time Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to one another who first conclude a peace between
the two Nations; and that the Posterity might be partakers
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51978:59"/>
of this accord, contract afterwards an Alliance between the
two Kings. It was agreed that the Princess <hi>Cicilia</hi> youngest
daughter to King <hi>Edward,</hi> should marry with <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of
<hi>Rothsay,</hi> when they came to yeers of discretion. A motion
heard with great acceptance; but it was thought by some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with King <hi>Edward</hi> and in his most inward Counsels,
that really he never intended this mariage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that this nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
aimed onely to temporize with <hi>Scotland,</hi> in case that
<hi>Lovys</hi> of <hi>France</hi> should stir up an invasion of <hi>England</hi> by the
King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> King <hi>Louys</hi> at this time had sent one Doctor
<hi>Ireland</hi> a <hi>Sorbonist</hi> to move King <hi>Iames</hi> to trouble the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>England,</hi> and to give over the projected marriage;
which when King <hi>Edward</hi> understood, knowing what a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
was between things promised and performed, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
King <hi>Iames,</hi> and try him more strongly to the bargain,
that this marriage might have more sway, he caused for the
present maintenance of the Prince, and as it were a part of
the Dowry of Lady <hi>Cicilia,</hi> deliver certain sums of money to
King <hi>Iames.</hi> Notwithstanding of which benevolence the
the witty <hi>Louys</hi> wrought so with the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nobility, that
King <hi>Iames</hi> sent Ambassadors to the King of <hi>England,</hi> entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him not to assist the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> his brother in Law
against King <hi>Louys,</hi> which if he refused to do, the Nobility
of <hi>Scotland</hi> who were now turned insolent, would constrain
him by reason of the ancient league between the <hi>French</hi> and
the <hi>Scots</hi> to assist the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> during his aboad in <hi>France,</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
a daughter of the Earle of <hi>Bullogine</hi> (she was his second
wife, his first having been a daughter of the Earle of <hi>Orkenay,</hi>
a Lady of great parentage, and many friends) who incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
importuned King <hi>Louys</hi> to aide the Duke for the recovery
of his inheritance and places in the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of
which he was kept by the evil Counsellors of his brother.
<hi>Louys</hi> minding to make good use of his brother, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
increasing discords and jealousies between him and the
King of <hi>England,</hi> slighting his suites told him, he could not
justifie his taking of Armes to settle a Subject in his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
That Princes ought to be wrought upon by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
not violence, and he should not trouble a King other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
then by Prayers and Petitions, which he would be
earnest to perform. Upon this refusal the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi>
(having burryed his Dutchesse) troubled with new thoughts
came to <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> with accustomated courtesies
receiving him, giveth him hopes of assistance, entring of in
communication with him how to divert the Kingdome of
<hi>Scotland</hi> from the invasion of his Dominions at the desire of
the <hi>French,</hi> the Agents and traffickers of <hi>Louys</hi> lying still in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:51978:59"/>
and daily bribing and soliciting the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility to
necessitate the <hi>English</hi> to stay at home. The Duke freely, and
in the worst sense revealed the weakness of his Kingdom,
that his King was opinionative, and had nothing of a Prince
in him but the name: His ungoverned Spirit disdained to
listen to the temperate Counsell of sober men, obeying only
his own judgement. Such who govern'd under him, were
mean persons and of no account, great only by his favour,
and indued with little vertue, who ruling as they listed,
and excluding all others, made use of his Authority for
their own profit and advantage. The Nobility were male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
and affected a change in the Government; which
might be easily brought to pass by the assistance of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
If he would help to raise some civill broyls and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention
in the Nation it selfe, he needed not to be in fear
that they could or would trouble his Country by any inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
The King hearing the Duke manifest what he most
affected, approving his judgement, promised him all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
and what he could desire to accomplish the design:
and he undertaketh by some fair way to traffick with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of <hi>Scotland</hi> for an alteration of the present form of
Government. After a dangerous intelligence, the Lords of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> who under the shadow of the publick good, but
really out of their disdain and particular interests, conspired
against the <hi>King</hi> send the Duke word, the golden Age could
not be fram'd, nor Arms taken for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
nor the State alter'd, without the frequestring
of those from the King who misgovern'd him. And these
could not be remov'd by that power which was amongst
themselvs, without great danger and trouble, considering
the Kings faction and the malignant Party. If King <hi>Edward</hi>
would agree to the raising of an Army in <hi>England,</hi> in favour
of the Duke of <hi>Albanie,</hi> and for restoring him to his Places
and inheritance, out of which he was most unjustly ejected:
and other pretences, of which they should afford the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
which no way should do harm to the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> disorder'd already, and laid waste, more by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
of a Tyrant in peace, then it could have been by war;
and at this time bestow upon them favours, as they might
one day hereafter challenge to receive the like; The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be ready with an other Army, not to
fight, but to seize upon the Kings Favourits, and Misgover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of the State: for which the <hi>English</hi> should have many
thanks. That this Enterprize could not but prove most
successfull, the hatred of the Commons considered against
such violent oppressions. The King was fallen into so low
esteem, that assaulted by the <hi>English,</hi> he would be constrain'd
by the submission of his Crown to intreat for safety. The

<hi>Scots</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> some Villages on either side are burnt.
The secrecy to this business, which was inviolably observed,
was of great importance, which is the principal knot and try
of great affairs. Rumours are spread that the Dukes of
<hi>Gloucester</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> with <hi>Iames</hi> late Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> and
<hi>Alexander Ierdan</hi> and <hi>Patrick Halyburton,</hi> men proscrib'd, and
upon whose heads a price was set, were at <hi>Anwick</hi> with a
powerful Army, and in their march towards <hi>Kelsoo.</hi> The
King wakened out of his Trances by the Alarms of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and clamours of the people, made proclamations to
all between sixty years and sixteen to meet him at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
and to be in readiness to oppose their old enemies of <hi>England</hi>
now come upon the Borders.</p>
            <p>After many delayes and much loytering an Army is assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the Nobility, which consisted of

               </gap>rts charged with small Ordinance. New
incursions being blazed to have been made by the <hi>English,</hi>
the King amidst these Troops marched to <hi>Lawder.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was encamped, and all things Ordered the best way the
occasion could suffer them, little or nothing being left to
Fortune, if the <hi>English</hi> should invade, whom the Lords

in a Body, and upon the Bord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from his Nobilitie, which made them malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>This he did as his pensiveness conjectured, that his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
should not attempt any thing to the prejudice of his
royal Authority, independent of any Council. But what he
most feared came to pass; he resolved and dispatched all
matters by his Cabinet Counsel: where the Surveyor of his
Buildings was better acquainted with the affairs of the State
than the gravest of his Nobility. This preposterous course
of favour made the great men of the Kingdom to fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
upon their rest, though long projected attempt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many private conferences in their Pavilions, the
Chiefs of the Insurrection, as the Earls of <hi>Anguss, Lennox,
Huntley,</hi> the Lords <hi>Gray, Lile</hi> and others, about midnight come
together in the Church of <hi>Lawder</hi> with many Barons and
Gentlemen. Here every of them urging the necessity of
the times, and the dangers the Common-wealth was like to
fall into, requireth speedy resolutions: and having before
premeditated, deliberated and concluded what to follow,
they draw up a League and confederation of mutual adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in this order.</p>
            <p>Forasmuch as the King suffereth himself to be governed
by mean persons and men of no account, to the contempt of
the Nobility, and his best Subjects, and to the great loss of
the Commons: The confederates considering the imminent
dangers of the Kingdom, shall endeavour to separate the
Kings Majestie from these naughty upstarts, who abuse his
Name and Authority, and despise of all good men; and have
a care that the Common-wealth receive no dammage. And
in this quarrel they shall all stand mutually every one to the
defence of another. The design agreed upon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
sworn, the chiefs of them in Arms enter the Kings
Pavilion, where, after they had challenged him of many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
in his Government, contrary to his honour, the Laws
and good of his Kingdom, they took Sir <hi>William Roger,</hi> a
man from a Musitian, promoted to be a Knight, <hi>Iames Homill,
Robert Cochran,</hi> who of a Surveyor of his works was made
Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> or as some mittigate that title, Intromittor and
taker up of the Rents of that Earldom, by whose devise
(some Authors have alleged) copper moneys had been coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by which a dearth was brought amongst the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
which (as others have recorded) was an unjust impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
for that copper money was coined in the Minority of
the King, in the time of the Government of the <hi>Boyds,</hi> with
others. All these being convicted by the elamours of the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51978:61"/>
Army, were immediately hanged upon the Lidder. <hi>Iohn
Ramsey</hi> a youth of eighteen years of age, by the intreaties,
Prayers, embraces of the King was preserved. Thus they
the late objects of envy, were turn'd and become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Pity and Compassion. The body of the Commons
and the Gentry of the Kingdome by this notorious act at
<hi>Lawder,</hi> being engaged, and being made Partakers of the
Quarrel of the discontented Noblemen, and for their own
safety tyed to second and assist all their intentions, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their ends: The King is conveyed to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and
shortly after he either enclosed himself in the <hi>Maiden Castle</hi> as
his lodging or, which is more probable, was there, by the
contrary faction committed as his Prison, the Earl of <hi>Athole</hi>
and some other Lords being appointed to attend him.</p>
            <p>During this time the general humour of the kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ripe for mischief, <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> (every thing
falling right as it was plotted) prevailed so with King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
that the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the title of Lieutenant general for him set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

twenty thousand and five hundred. In his retinue went of
the Nobility, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland, Thomas</hi> Lord
<hi>Stanley,</hi> with them was the Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi> The Earl of

high Demands; That King <hi>Iames</hi> should perform what he
had covenanted with his Brother King <hi>Edward;</hi> That he
should give satisfaction for the damage done the <hi>English</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the last inroads of the Borders, which if he refused to
accomplish. He as Lievtenant to his Brother was to exact of
him and take satisfaction of his Countrey, denouncing him
open war, and proclaiming him all Hostility. King <hi>Iames</hi>
for saken of his People, and wrong'd by his Lords, laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
his Passions, and taking to him more moderate and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
thoughts, as a Man in Prison, answered nothing to his
Demands.</p>
            <p>The Lords, who by their Kings misfortune had reckoned
their felicity, having obtain'd what they chiefly desir'd, to
obviate the common and last danger, the thraldom of their
kingdom by these strangers whom they had drawn into the
Country for the recovery of their Liberties, assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together at <hi>Hadington</hi> with some Companies, not to
fight but to supplicate. They sent the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi> and the
elected Bishop of <hi>Murray</hi> to intreat a suspension of Arms,
and require a firm and lasting Peace for time to come: The
beginning of the war, and taking of Arms was for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this the neighbour Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> miserably
thral'd by a licentious Prince: there was nothing more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of a King or Republick, than not to keep their promis'd
Faith. The <hi>English</hi> could have no colour for executing their
indignation further upon this Countrey, which already by
the rapine of their own Men was impoverish'd and unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd:
Only now to be recover'd by entertaining Peace
with their Neighbours, and amongst themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that the Marriage contracted between the Prince of
<hi>Rothesay</hi> and Lady <hi>Cicily</hi> King <hi>Edwards</hi> Daughter might be
accomplish'd when it should please the King of <hi>England,</hi> and
the age of the two Princes might suffer it. For any spoyl
taken in these last incursions, the interest consider'd upon
both sides, satisfaction should be given out of the publick
contributions. The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> as forgetting and
seeming not to know the grounds of their coming into the
Country, and looking to nothing more then his own fame
and Glory, Answer'd, his coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was to right
the honour of his Country so often violated: and to restore
the Duke of <hi>Albanie,</hi> unjustly commanded to exile, to his
own native soyl, and the dignity of his Birth: as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Mariage of the Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Daughter
of <hi>England,</hi> He knew not how his Brothers resolution stood
at the present; whereupon he requir'd repayment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
lent to their King upon the first agreement: and withall
a delivery of the Castle of <hi>Barwick</hi> up into his hands: or if
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51978:62"/>
they could not make the Castle to be render'd, they should
give their oaths upon the holy Evangelists that they should
neither assist the besieged, nor harm the Besiegers, till the
Castle were either by force taken, or upon fair conditions
rendred.</p>
            <p>The Lords having received this answer, yielded freely to
all the Conditions, except they found themselves perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the rendring of <hi>Berwick:</hi> it being a <hi>Town</hi> of old apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though by force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the <hi>English</hi> had a long time kept it, that did not take
away their right and title. After much contesting, agreeing
to the surrender of <hi>Berwick,</hi> they desired that the walls of
the Town should be demolished, that it might not be a place
of Tyrannie and incursion over their bordering Countreys.
No arguments could prevail against the Duke of <hi>Gloucesters</hi>
resolutions, and being stronger in power he persever'd in
his demans, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll likelihood this was agreeed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and the confederate Lords, and
the <hi>English,</hi> before their entring <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus the Castle
and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> returned to the <hi>English</hi> the 24. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust 1482.</hi>
after it had been delivered by Queen <hi>Margarite</hi> to
gain Sanctuary for her Husband King <hi>Henry</hi> (when expelled
<hi>England)</hi> and remained in the possession of the <hi>Scots</hi> twenty
and one years.</p>
            <p>They likewise appointed a day for restitution of all the
moneys lent by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and promised upon a full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion
to make satisfaction for all dammages done the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
by any in-road of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Borders. For the Duke of
<hi>Albanies</hi> provision, whose safety was principally pretended
in this expedition, a general pardon was promised for him

               </gap>is followers; Together with an abolition of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents;
Whereby he had given unto him the Castle of
<hi>Dumbar,</hi> with the Earldoms of <hi>Mar</hi> and <hi>March;</hi> he should
be reinvested in all his former Dignities and Places, and by
consent of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was proclaim'd Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Peaceproclaimed, the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> in all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of greatness returned towards <hi>London,</hi> being wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
by the King with many demonstrations of great joy.
He to show how much he approved the conditions of this
Peace, went solemnly in procession from St. <hi>Stevens</hi> Chappel,
now the Parlament House, accompanied with the Queen
his Sister, and a mighty retinue of the greatest Lords into
<hi>Westminster</hi> Hall. Where in presence of the Earl of <hi>Anguss,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Liddale,</hi> Embassadours extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51978:62"/>
from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the peace was ratifyed. At the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the <hi>Scots</hi> Embassadours to their Countrey, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
sent an Herauld with them, who in his Masters name
gave over the marriage contracted between the Lady <hi>Cicilia</hi>
and the Prince of <hi>Rothsay,</hi> and required the money which
had been delivered upon hopes of consummation to his
King. The Citizens of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> had given their Bond for
the redelivery, and a day being granted to them for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they at the appointed day intirely delivered the sum.
Some thought King <hi>Edward</hi> recalled this marriage of a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
he conceived, that the Ambition of the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany,</hi>
and the hatred of the Subjects against their King amidst
the manifold distractions of the Realm, might hazard the
Succession of the Prince of <hi>Rothsay</hi> to the Crown. But king
<hi>Edward</hi> having gained what he had endeavoured most to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
a division amongst the Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by
this a Security from their assisting the <hi>French,</hi> rejected the
Match. Besides the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who after his
comming in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was laying the foundations of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping
the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> his Brother once dead,
thought the alliance of his Brothers Daughter with a King of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> too strong a Support to that Race, which he was
to declare Bastards, and a Rock upon which he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he should make a fearful shipwrack. Neither his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Daughter being marryed to a King of such martiall and
turbulent Subjects as the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> durst he ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the
taking away of her Brothers: and King <hi>Edward</hi>
in neglect of this match committed a greater errour of State
than he did in his marrying the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gray,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
the Lady <hi>Bona</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the Records of some Authors whilst the
King is kept nine Moneths in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> the Lord <hi>Evandale</hi> Chancellour, the Earl
of <hi>Arguile,</hi> the Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Uncle (who for the preservation of his person and
honour of his Office accepted the charge to attend him in that
Fortress) governed the State.</p>
            <p>The King (say the honest Records) had all honour which
appertained to a Prince, save that he could not come abroad,
and none was permitted to speak unto him, except in the
audience of some one of his Lords Keepers; and that his
Chamber doors were shut before the setting of the Sun and
long after the rising opened. Proclamations are publisht in
his name and Authority, and other publick writings. Such
who only heard of him could not but take him to be a free
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51978:63"/>
and absolute Prince, when near he was but a King in phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie,
and his Throne but a Picture, the regal Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
turned into a cloak to cover the Passions of those who
did govern.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> dayly importuned by the solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Prayers and tears of the Queen (a calm and temperate
Lady) for her Husbands Liberty; finding himself not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
by the other Governours as his birth and merits did
deserve; being a man who delighted in nothing more than
in changes and novations of Court and State; after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
scorns and rebukes offered to his Brother, and King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserating
his long sufference, and believing that good turns
would make past offences be forgotten, and recent benefits
were sufficient to blot away old injuries, withall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of former discontents, whilst the other Governours
at <hi>Sterling,</hi> securely passed the time, posted in the night to
<hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Here a meeting being appointed of some of his
friends and Vassals, who knew nothing of his intentions,
by the assistance of the Citizens of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> (men intirely
loving their King and devoted to him all the time of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of his Nobles) who gave the first assault, (yet was
it rather their intelligence than force) the Castle is surprised,
the King and all his Servants set at libertie. This unexspected
and noble act of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> having so fortunate a
success, brought a mighty change on the Court and State.
The King is now again reinstall'd, and hath this residence in
his own Palace, to which many Noblemen and Gentlemen,
have frequent concourse; rejoicing to see such evident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of love pass between the two Brothers, if their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
could have continued. The Provost and Baylies of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
in recompence of their service, were made Sheriffs
within all the bounds of their own Territories, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with other privileges contained in that patent, which
they call their golden Charter 1482. The Lords of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
faction, who remained at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> by this new accident,
betook themselves to new thoughts and considerations, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man full of fears and repinings flying to his own dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
place, and conceaving a great hatred against the Duke
of <hi>Albany.</hi> They said he was inconstant, rash, mad, in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at liberty the man who would prove his Executioner,
and one who would never forget any profer'd injury: that
if he perished before them, it was but his own just deserving
and procurement. The Duke contemning those reproaches,
and answering their calumnies and evil words with patience
and good deeds, by the mediation of the Earl of <hi>Anguss,</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
a reconciliation between the King and his discontented
Lords. And his endeavours had such good success, that in a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51978:63"/>
short time after this Atonement; some of them turned so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
and inward with the King, that, like the <hi>Ivy,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to sap the wall by which they had been supported. They
made the wound of the Kings old jealousies ranckle again,
and added poison to former discontents; remembring him
of the unnaturalness of his Brothers first Rebellion, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
him that his antient Ambition had yet more power of
him than his new fears of honesty and respect. That howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he shewed outwardly the arguments of a reconciled
Brother, he loved yet to govern, and aimed at the Crown.
That he had wrought his liberty to bring a greater confusion
in the State than he had ever done before. The King, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had a watchful eye over his reconciled Enemies, and
who desired to be freed and fairly quited of them all, gave
way to their calumnies. And they after long deliberation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon a plot to bring the Duke within compass of law:
and summoned him to answer upon Treason. And this was
the rendring of the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> to the <hi>English:</hi> which
they undertook to prove was only by his intelligence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation
and being in company with the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
in that expedition. Though the Duke had an absolute and
general pardon and an aboli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion for all was past, and the
Kings hand at it, they doubted not to null and make it void.
All being done by a King constrained by a powerful Army,
and a close prisoner, which writing could not oblige any
private man far less a King: what he then bargained was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
constraint and yielded unto upon hopes of saving his life,
and an act exacted by force. The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> finding by
the malice and detraction of a malignant faction, his brothers
countenance altered towards him: and danger the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
of his late setting him at liberty, the established re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
being shaken by suspitions and fancy of revenge,
obeying necessity, fled to his Castle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> out of which
he came to <hi>England</hi> to present to King <hi>Edward</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Gloucester</hi> the consideration of his grievances.</p>
            <p>In his absence he is convinced of many points of treason,
besides the being accessarie to the taking of <hi>Berwick</hi> by the
<hi>English.</hi> As his dangerous and long intelligence with the
King of <hi>England:</hi> his sending of many Messengers at all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
unto him. That, without any safe-conduct or pass
from his Brother, and not so much as acquainting him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
had left the Countrey, come into <hi>England</hi> to devise conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
against his King and native Kingdom. The Lord
<hi>Creighton</hi> as his friend associate and complice, is forefeited
with him, against whom Informations were given, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and divers times, under the pretence of hunting, secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Duke at <hi>Albany,</hi> he road into <hi>England,</hi> and there
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51978:64"/>
meeting with Commissioners sent by King <hi>Edward,</hi> he delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
of matters concerning novations and of the altring the
state, That there he kept appointments with <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of
<hi>Dowglass,</hi> the often quench'd fire-brand of his Country. That
in spight of the Kings forces sent there to lie in Garrison, he
kept the Castle of <hi>Creighton.</hi> The greatest discontent the
King conceived against him was love to one of his Sisters,
and some feminine jealousies. When the Duke understood
the proceedings against himself and the Lord <hi>Creighton,</hi> and
that for their contumacy and not appearing to answer and
give in their answer, they were convict of Treason, and their
lands to be seased upon; He caused give up the Castle of
<hi>Dumbar,</hi> of which he was Lieutenant, to King <hi>Edward,</hi> who
immediately placed by Sea a Garrison in it.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> left this world
1483. and his brother <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> did first
take the name of Protector and Governor of the Kingdom
of <hi>England,</hi> and after his brothers Sons put in the Tower,
and their Mother the Queen taking Sanctuary, in the moneth
of <hi>Iune</hi> possest himself of the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> finding that <hi>Richard</hi> by his change of
Fortune had not changed his affection towards him, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
his aid in restoring him to his own, and repairing not
his wrongs alone, but a wrong done in his sufferings to the
King of <hi>England,</hi> sith there was now an open breach of the
Truce and Peace so solemnly by him set down and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Brother. If he could be furnished but with a few
number of choice men of reputation and power to pass into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and take a tryal of the Minds and good will of his
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iends and confederates, he douted not at his entring the
Countrey to finde numbers who by his presence would haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
upon the most desperate dangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> finding the man his Supplicant with whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
once an intire frindship, and whose advancement
in Authority he had most studied, condescendeth that five
hundred men and Horses should be chosen upon the borders,
with others who were ontlawes and necessitated sometime to
make incursions, and with <hi>Iames</hi> the old Earl of <hi>Dowglase,</hi> a
man well known and renowned in the West-borders, should
make an in-road into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two and twentie day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the banished Champion
having chosen a good number of their borderers put forward
towards <hi>Loch. Maben</hi> to surprize a Fair, spoil a publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
seise upon all the Buyers and Sellers, which here meet
and traffick every St. <hi>Magdalens</hi> festival, under pretence of
Devotion and the liberty of trading many <hi>English</hi> had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
relsorted: at the twelfth hour of the day when the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51978:64"/>
and Countrey-people were in greatest security, the
bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e is invaded and not bloud but wares sought after; the
Lard of <hi>Iohnstoun</hi> who was warden, and lard of <hi>Cock-pool,</hi>
with many stout borderers having surveyed and Ridden
through the places where the people were met, to prevent
and hinder all disorders and dangers, at the noise of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion
of the <hi>English,</hi> dispatch Poasts to the adjacent bounds
for supply, and in the mean time rencounter the plunderers
of the Fair. Here is it fought with greater courage than force,
and in a long continued skirmish the danger of the loss stir'd
up and incited the parties as much as fame and glory.</p>
            <p>The day was neer spent leaving the advantage to either
side disputable, when the supply of fresh men come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Countrey, and friends turned the Fortune of the
fight, and put the <hi>English</hi> borders all to the rout. The Duke
of <hi>Albany</hi> by the swiftness of his Horse, and the good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of his Servants winneth <hi>English</hi> ground: but the Earl
of <hi>Dowglass</hi> loaden and heavy with years and armes, is taken
by <hi>Robert Kirken-patrick</hi>(who for that service got the lands of
<hi>Kirk-michael)</hi> and brought as in triumph to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> It is
recorded that when the Earl was come in the Kings presence,
he turn'd his back &amp; refused to look him in the face, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many outrages he had perpetrated against his Father,
and this late offence. The King taken with the goodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage,
gravity and great age of the man, commiserating his
long patience and cross fortune being in his young daies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to be a Church-man, confined him as in a free Prison
in the Abacy of <hi>Lyndores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides he considered that when occasion served he might
bring him out of this solitariness, and in these turbulent
times by his counsel and presence play more advantageously
his game of State, being a man of long experience in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the world, and the most learned of all his Nobility.
He was now become tyred of the Earl of <hi>Anguss,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his first offence remaining deeply ingraven
in his heart, and to counterpoise his greatness this was the
only weight. The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> found little better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in <hi>England,</hi> the battel being lost, some men taken
and killed (this being the first roade upon <hi>Scotland</hi> under the
reign of <hi>Richard,</hi> who had been formerly so fortunate in his
own person) his fame injur'd, and reputation by this dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
the Duke began to be disliked, and was not received
with that kindness he was wont, whereupon by the assistance
and convoy of <hi>Iohn Liddale,</hi> he secretly retired to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the road of <hi>Lochmaben</hi> sundry incursions are made
by the <hi>Scots</hi> upon the <hi>English</hi> borders, and by the <hi>English</hi>
upon the <hi>Scottish:</hi> The Champian ground is scoured, houses
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51978:65"/>
are burnt, booties taken, with great loss to both, and little
advantage to any of the parties, <hi>Richard</hi> having his reign in
the infancy, and not yet settled nor come to any growth
and maturity, being obnoxious to the scandal of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Sons, and possessed with fears of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi>
then remaining in <hi>France,</hi> who by all honest and good men
was earnestly invited to come home, and hazard one day of
battail for a whole Kingdom, knowing it necessary for the
advancement of his designs to have peace with all his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Princes to render himself more secure and safe at home,
and terrible to his enemies abroad, sendeth Embassadours
to <hi>Scotland</hi> to treat a Peace, or a suspension of Arms for som
years; King <hi>Iames</hi> no soflier rocked in the Cradle of State
than <hi>Richard;</hi> chearfully accepteth this Embassage; for by a
peace he may a little calm the stormy and wild minds of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
Subjects, reducing them to a more quiet fashion
of living, and seclude his Rebels and banisht from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in <hi>England,</hi> and all places of Refuge and Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The two Kings agreeing in substance, Commissioners

            <p>In the latter end of <hi>Septemb.</hi> these conclude a peace between

unto the setting of the Sun on the 29. of <hi>Sept.</hi> in the year 1487.
During which time it was aggreed that not only all hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and war should cease between the two Realms, but that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
all aid and assistance against enemies should be afforded.</p>
            <p>It was agreed, the Town and Castle of <hi>Berwick</hi> should
remain in the hands of the <hi>English</hi> for the space of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
term, with the same bounds the <hi>English</hi> possessed.</p>

left his Countrey. Which Castle for the space of six moneths
should be exposed to the invasion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> if they could
obtain it, and during the assaulting of this Castle, the Truce

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld not be broken. Neither should the <hi>English</hi> within the
castle do any harm to the <hi>Scots</hi> dwelling thereabouts, except
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51978:65"/>
to those who invade the Castle, and at that time. And that
it should be lawful to any of the Parties to use all Statagems,
and extend their power either for winning or defending the
said Castle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was agreed,</hi> That no Traitor of either Realm should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by any of the Princes of the other Realms: and if any
Traitor or Rebell chance to arrive in either Realm, the Prince ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>
               <hi>Scots</hi> abiding within the Realm of <hi>England</hi> and sworn there
to the King, may remain still, so there names be made known to the
King of <hi>Scotland</hi> within fourty daies.</p>
            <p>If any Warden of either Realm shall invade the others Subjects,
he to whom such a Warden is subject shall within six daies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
him Traitor, and certifie the other Prince thereof within twelve daies.</p>
            <p>In every safe conduct this Clause shall be contained, Providing
alwaies that the Obtainer of the safe Conduct be no Traitor.</p>
            <p>If any of the Subjects of either Prince, do presume to aid
and help maintain and serve any other Prince, against any of
the Contractors of this Truce, Then it shall be lawful for him to
whom he shewed himself enemy, to apprehend and attach the said
Subject, comming or tarrying within any of their Dominions.</p>
            <p>Collegues comprehended in the Truce (if they would assent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto)
on the <hi>English</hi> part were, the King of <hi>Castile, the King of</hi>

               <hi>and</hi> Norway, <hi>The Duke of</hi> Guilderland, this
treaty was appointed to be published the first of October in all the
great and notable Towns of both Realms.</p>
            <p>It was agreed that Commissioners should meet at <hi>Loch-maben</hi>
the 18. of <hi>November</hi> as well for redress of wrongs done on the
west Marcbes, as for declaring and publishing the peace, where
the greatest difficultie was to have it observed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> after this truce intreated a marriage between the
Prince of <hi>Rothsay</hi> eldest Son to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and Lady <hi>Anne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Pool,</hi>
Daughter to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> of his Sister. To
this effect Embassadours meet at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> others say at
<hi>York,</hi> and it is concluded. Writings thereupon being drawn
up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ingrosled and seal'd. And affiances made and taken up
by Proctors and Deputies of both parts. Lady <hi>Anne</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
being stiled the Princess of <hi>Rothsay.</hi> But by the death
of her Uncle she injoyed not long that title:</p>
            <p>After the league and intended marriage, King <hi>Iames</hi> wrote
friendly letters to <hi>Richard</hi> concerning the Castle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi>
Whether he could be content that the same should remain
only six moneths in the power of the <hi>English,</hi> or during the
whole space of True? That he was not minded to seek it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51978:66"/>
by arms during the term of the whole Truce. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he earnestly required out of the bond of Love and
Frindship between them, since it was given unto the <hi>English</hi>
by Treason, and neither surprised nor taken in lawful war, it

<hi>Embassadours to King</hi> Iames, <hi>for renewing the Truce,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dours, that what he imparted to
them, should not be laid open to his Nobility, told,</hi> He ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
affected a Peace with all his Neighbours, but above all others
with their King, as much for his own valour, as for the honour
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51978:66"/>
and interests of the two Kingdoms: But he knew his people so
stubborn and opposite to all his designs, that if they understood his
mind and resolutions, they would endeavour to cross his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
wherefore publickly he could only condescend to seven years
truce, a long peace being hardly obtained from men brought up in the
free licence of war, who disdained to be restrained within the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
limits of Laws. Notwithstanding they should undertake for him
to King <hi>Henry,</hi> in the word of a Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this Truce before the
exspiring of it should be renewed, and with all solemntyes again
confirmed.</p>
            <p>The Embassadours respecting his good will towards their
King, accepted the conditions. Thus was there a Truce or
Peace convenanted and confirmed for seven years to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Realms.</p>
            <p>After so many back-blows of fortune and such canvassing,
the King enjoying a Peace with all his Neighbours abroad,
became exceeding religious; the miseries of life drawing
the mind to the contemplations of what shall be after it. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
hisresidence at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he was wont to come in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
from the Abby of <hi>Holy-rood-house</hi> to the Churches in
the High-Town every Wednesday and Fryday. By which
devotion he became beloved of his People: Nothing more
winning their hearts than the opinion they have of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of a person. And that he did not this for the fashion
nor hypocrisy, the application of his wit and power to the
administration of strict justice did prove; for he began to
suppress the insolencies of strong oppressors, defend and
maintain the Rights of the poor, against Tyrants and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of their Neighbors. He sitteth himself in Council dayly,
and disposeth affairs of most weight in his own person.</p>
            <p>In the Moneth of <hi>October</hi> following the Peace with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
1487. a Parlament was called, in which many acts were
made against Oppressours. Justices were appointed to pass
thorough the whole Kingdom, and see malefactors deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
punished. Acts were made that no convention of friends
should be suffered for the accompanying and defence of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Persons: But that every one attainted should appear
at the most with six Proctors; that, if found guilty, they
should not be reft from Justice by strong hand. Such of the
Nobility who feared and consequently hated him, finding
how he had acquired the love of his people by his piety in
the observance of Religion, and his severity in executing
Justice, were driven unto new meditations. They began
to suspect he would one day free himself from these turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Spirits who could not suffer him to enjoy a Peace, nor
raign. He had advanced at this time to Offices of State and
Places men whose Fortunes did wholly depend upon his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51978:67"/>
safety and wel-fare: at which some Noblemen whose Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
was to be in publick charge and of the Counsell, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to that out of right, which was only due unto them
by favour, did highly storm and look upon those others
with envious eyes. The King thus falling againe into his old
sickness, they bethought them how to renew their old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.
They were also jealous of the remembrance of the
dis-service they had done him, and that he would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
old quarrells; They were prepared and ready to make
a Revolution of the state, but had not yet found their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to begin motion, nor a ground for Rebellion. All this
while there was not matter enought for an insurrection, nor
to dispose the Peoples Hearts to a Mutinie.</p>
            <p>The King delighted with his Buildings of the Castle of
<hi>Sterlin,</hi> and the amenity of the Place, for he had raised there
a faire and spacious Hall, and founded a College for divine
service, which he named the Chappel Royal: and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to be possest and taken up with the Religion of these
times, endeavoured to endow this foundation with constant
Rents, and ample Revenues, and make this Rock the choyse
Sanctuary of his Devotions. The Priory of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> then
vacant and fallen in his hands, he annexed the same to his
Chappel Royal, and procured an Act of Parliament that
none of the Lieges should attempt to doe contrary to this
union and annexation, or to make any Impetration thereof
at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> under the paine of Treason. The Priors
of this Convent having been many years of the Name of
<hi>Hume,</hi> it was by the Gentlemen of that Name surmi'sd that
they should be interested and wronged in their Estates, by
reason of the Tithes and other Casualtyes appertaining to
this Benefice, if a Prior of any other Sirname were promoted
to this Place. The King being often petitioned and implored
that he should not alter the accustom'd form of the Election
of that Prior, nor remove it from their Name, nor suffer
the Revenues to be otherways bestowed than they were
wont to be of old; and he continuing in his resolution of
annexing them to his Chapel: after long pawsing and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
amongst themselves, as men stirred up by the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
and a proud faction, fit for any the most dangerous
entrprise, they proceed upon stronger Grounds to over-turn
his intentions and divert his purpose. The Lord <hi>Hailles</hi> and
others, of the Sirname of <hi>Hepburn,</hi> had been their constant
friends, Allies and Neighbours; with them they enter in a
combination, that they should mutually stand to the defence
of others, and not suffer any Prior to be received for <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingham</hi>
if he were not of one of their two Sirnames. This

Lords knowing those two Sirnames to be numerous,
active and powerfull in those parts of the Countrey where
they remayn'd, lay hold upon this Overture, and beginning
from their particulars they make the cause to be general.
They spread Rumours abroad that the King was become ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and not to be trusted; notwithstanding all his Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and outward demeanour, that he yet meditated Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and had begun to invadea nd shake the ancient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of the <hi>Humes,</hi> more out of Spight and discontent
against them for having assisted and follow'd the Lords of the
Reformation of the State, than any intention of the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Rents of his new erected Chappel. That ere long he
would be avengedupon all whom he either knew were acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssary,
or suspected to have been upon the Plot of <hi>Lawder</hi>
Bridg, or his committing in the Castle of <hi>Edenbrough.</hi> That it
was some time better to commit a fault unpardonable than
venture under the Pardon. That the King had taken a
Resolution to live upon the Peoples contributions, and give
his owne Revenues to particular Men. The faults of his
Counsellours are highly exaggerated. They were base Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and he himself given to dissimulation, misdevotion and
revenge; as occasion served he would remember old wrongs:
It was good to obey a King but not to lay the head upon a
Block to him, if a Man could save himself.</p>
            <p>After along smother of discontent and hatred of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and People, rankor breaking dayly forth into
Seditions and alterations. The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Haylles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ring-Leaders, many Noblemen and Gentlemen
under fained pretences, especially the courses of swift Horles,
keep frequent meetings. Where they renew their Covenant
agreed upon at <hi>Lawder</hi> Church, the necessity of the times
and the danger of the Common-wealth requiring it, and
gave their oaths that at what time soever the King should
chalenge them directly or indirectly, or wrong them in their
Rights, Possessions, Places, Persons, They should abide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as if they were all one Body, marry each others quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells,
and the wrongs done to any one of them should be done
to them all.</p>
            <p>When the King understood the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ederacy of the Lords,
to anticipate the Danger, he made choyse of a Guard for the
preservation of his Person and Servants, Of which he made
<hi>Iohn Ramsay</hi> of <hi>Balmayne,</hi> a Man whom he had preserved at
<hi>Lawder</hi> and advanced to be Maister of his houshold at Court,
Captain: giving him a warrant not to suffer any Man in
Arms approach the Court by some miles. This in stead of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51978:68"/>
cooling, exasperated the Choler of the Male-contents, and
stirr'd them to assemble with numerous Retinues all in
Arms. The King scarce beleeving the Mindes of so many
were corrupted, and perswading himself the Authority of the
publick name of a King would supply the want of some
Power, summond certain of them upon fourty days to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
according to Law.</p>
            <p>Of those some rent his Summons, and beat shamefully his
Heraulds and Messengers for discharging their Offices: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
appeared, but with numbers of their Adherents, Friends,
Allies and Vassals: And here he found that the faults of great
Delinquents are not without great danger taken notice of,
and reprehended; he used some Stratagems to surprise the
Heads and chiefs of their faction: But unadvisedly giving
trust to the promises of those who lent their ears, but not
their hearts to his words, his designs were discovered before
they produced any effect; his secrets all laid open to his great
hatred and disadvantage, the discoverers taking themselves
to the factious Rebells, and cherishing unkind thoughts in
all whom they saw distasted with his Government; Perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself betrayed and his intentions divulged, he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in great doubt to whom he should give credit. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and manner of all things changed by the League of the
Confederates, he thought it high time to remove a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from that Torrent which might have overwhelmed
him, and made them Masters of his person. To temporize
and win time, caused furnish the Castles of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and
<hi>Sterling</hi> with provision of Victual, Ammunition, and Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to defend them from the dangers of war; he resolved to
make his aboad beyond the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> and to leave the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>outh Parts of the Kingdom. After which deliberation he
entred a Ship of Sir <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> (a famous Navigator and
stout Commander at Sea) which pretended to make sail for
the low Countreys, and was lying at Anchor in the <hi>Forth.</hi>
These who saw him aboard, spread a rumour that he was fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Lords of the insurrection making use
of this false report seised on his carriage in the Passages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North, rifled his Coffers, spoiled his Servants of
their stuff and baggage. And then after certainty that he was
but landed in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and from that was in progress to the
Northern parts, preparing and directing his good Subjects to
be in readiness to attend him at his return, they surprised
the Castle of <hi>Dumbar.</hi> The Moneys found in his Coffers
wage Souldiers against him, and the Harness and Weapons of
his Magazines arm them. Having gathered some compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
together, tumultuously they overrun the Countreys
upon the South of the <hi>Forth,</hi> riffling and plundering all men
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51978:68"/>
who went not with them, or whom they suspected not to
favour their desperate and seditious ends. In his progres,
the King held Justice Courts at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Inneress,</hi> where
<hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Creighton,</hi> not long before impeacht with the
Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> submitted himself to his Clemency, and
was received in favour and pardoned: after which grace he
shortly left this world. Whilst the King in the North, the
Lords in the South are making their preparations; When they
were assembled at <hi>Lithgow</hi> they find themselves many in
number and strong in power; the success of their proceedings
being above their hopes: there only wanted a Man eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in esteem with the people, and noble of Birth, to give lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streto
their Actions, shadow their Rebellion, and be the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular
and painted head of their Arms. When they had long
deliberared upon this great Man, they assented all that there
was none to be paralleld to the Prince of <hi>Rothsay</hi> the Kings
own Son. So strongly providence befools all human wisdom
and foresight; his keepers being corrupted by gifts, pensions
and promises of divers Rewards, he is delivered into their
hands: and by threats, that they would otherwaies give up
the Kingdom to the King of <hi>England,</hi> he is constrained to go
with them. To heighten the hatred against the King, and
the closlier to deceive the people (for the love of subjects is
such towards their natural Kings, that except they be first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by some pretence and notable sophism, they will not
arise altogether in arms and rebel) they make proclamations
and by their Deputies by way of Remonstrances spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
seditious Papers, in what a Sea of blood would these
men launch into? that all true Subjects should come in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Prince, and take arms; because his Fathers jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
and superstitious fears were risen to that height that
nothing but his Sons death or imprisonment could temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
them. That he was raising an Army to take his Son out
of their hands, that he might do with him as he had done
with his own Brothers. That force was the onely means to
work his safety and keep the Plotters of this mischief within
bounds, they also should take arms to reduce the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a better form, for that the Kingdom was oppressed
with insupportable grievances: the King being altogether
given to follow the advice, projects and counsels of base
men; to amass and gather great sums of money from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
upon which he studied to maintain his Court and State,
and give away his own.</p>
            <p>When the Engin was prepared for the people, and spread
abroad, they sent to the Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> then closely as a
Monck shut up in the Abby of <hi>Lyndores,</hi> to come out, be of
the Party, and assist them with his Counsel and Friends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51978:69"/>
if their attempt had happy Success, to restore him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to his ancient possessions and Heritage, former dignitys
and the Places of honour of his Ancestors. The Earl, whom
time and long experience had made wary and circumspect,
having a suspition the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who possessed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of his estate, had been the chief motioner of this
liberty, and that rather to try what he would do, then that
he minded really to set him free, refused to come out of his
Cloister. And by his letters disswaded them from their bold
enterprize against their Prince; wishing they would set his
house and himself for a pattern &amp; precedent of Rebellion. He
sent to all such of his Friends whom his disasters had left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruined
to take arms for the King, as the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> of <hi>Kayvers</hi>
and others.</p>
            <p>The King neither losing courage nor councel for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the danger of the Rebellion, trusting much to his
good fortune, with such forces as came with him from the
North, in Captain <hi>Woods</hi> Ships and other Boats and Vessels
prepared to that end, passeth the <hi>Forth</hi> near the <hi>Blackness,</hi> an
old Fortress and Sea port in <hi>West Lothian,</hi> not far from the
Castle of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> and that place where the Forces of the
Earl of <hi>Dowglass</hi> left him, and the King his Father obtained
so harmless a victory. Before the arrival of the King at this
Place, the Earls of <hi>Montross, Glencarn,</hi> Lords <hi>Maxwell</hi> and
<hi>Ruthven</hi> with others, advertised by Letters of the Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz,
had come to the Place, had encamped, and were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
him. And he mustered a sufficient Army to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the Lords of the association, who from all quarters
were assembled, having with them the Prince to add Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to their quarrel. The two Armies being in readiness to
decide their indifferences by a Battail, the Earl of <hi>Athole</hi> the
Kings Uncle so travailed between the Lords of either party
and the King, that a suspention of Armes was agreed upon
and reconcilement: and the Earl of <hi>Athole</hi> rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a pledge for the accomplishing of the Kings part of the
reconcilement, to the Lord <hi>Haylles,</hi> and was sent to be kept
in the Castle of <hi>Dumbar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was not a small fault of this Prince: the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
forces were not at this time equall to his, neither had
they essayed to hinder the landing of his Army, being
but in gathering; the Castle of <hi>Blackness</hi> was for his defence,
and his Ships traversing up and down the <hi>Forth,</hi> in case of
necessity for succour. That if he had hazarded a battail, he
had been neer to have recovered all that reputation he had
before lost. Now upon either side some common Souldiers
are disbanded, some Gentlemen licensed to return to their
own dwelling places. The King in a peaceable manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51978:69"/>
to the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Athole</hi> was
now removed from him, and many of the other Lords who
loved him returned to their houses; the Counsel of man not
being able to resist the determinations of God. The Lords
suspecting still the King to be implacable in their behalf and
unaccessible in his Castle, keeping the Prince alwaies with
them, entring upon new meditations hold sundry meetings
how to have his person in their power, and make him a prey
to their ambitious designs. The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
with troups of armed men, the Villages about reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Soldiours. The <hi>King</hi> warned of his danger, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
of new the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for his defence, and is
brought to such a tameness, that resolving to do that with
love of every man which he feared in end he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
unto with the universal hatred of all, and his own
damage and danger, out of a passive fortitude sent Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,
indifferent Noble men, to the Lords and his Son to
understand their intentions and what they meant. Why his
Son was kept from him, and continued the head of their
faction. Why his Uncle was so closely imprison'd, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as it were blocked up by their tumultuous meetings in
Arms? He was content they should have an aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that was past, that their punishments should not
be infinitely extended, and that they should think upon a
general agreement after the best and fittest manner they
could devise, and set it down. They finding their offences
flew higher than hope of pardon could ascend unto. Their
suspitions, and the conscience of their crime committed,
breeding such a distrust out of an apprehension of fear, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that they found no true meaning. Open war was to
be preferred to a peace full of deceit, danger and fears, that
being assured he would weave out his begun projects against
them, they could not think of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afety, nor have assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their lives nor fortunes, unless he freely resigned
the title of his Crown and Realm in favour of his Son, and
voluntarily deposed himself, leaving the Government of the
People and Kingdome to the Lords of his Parliament,
divesting himself wholly of his Royall dignity. Neither
would they come to any submission or capitulation, until
he consented to this main point and granted it submissive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> notwithstanding of this answer, after a cleer
prospect of the inconveniences and mischiefs which were
growing, and the many injuries, indignities, and affronts
put upon him, yet really affecting a peace, sought unto <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
King of <hi>England,</hi> as also to the <hi>Pope</hi> and King of <hi>France</hi> to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51978:70"/>
make an attonment between him and his Subjects. The
King accordingly interposed their Mediation in a round and
Princely manners, not only by way of request and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but also by way of protestation and menace, declaring
that they thought it to be the common cause of all Kings, if
Subjects should be suffered to give Lawes unto their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign;
a ligitimate King, though a Tyrant, was not subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to the Authority of <hi>Subjects. Iames</hi> was not a Tyrant;
his errours proceeding most part form youth and evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
That suppose the King had done them wrong, it was
not wisely done, for a desire of revenge, to endanger their
particular Estates, and the peace and standing of the whole
Kingdome. What State was there ever so pure, but some
corruption might creep into it? That they should be very
ment too far; That they would accordingly resent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it. Rage prevailing against Reason and fears, the Lords
made that same answer to these Embassadours which they
had sent to the King himself before. As for the <hi>Popes</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy
which was sent by <hi>Adrian de Castello,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Legate
was comming, and the Lords fearing the danger of it, for
in those times it might have drawn the most part of all the
Towns, and the Commons, for fear of Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
to have adhered to the King, or stood in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,
made all possible haste before it should have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
to make head against their Soveraign, and decide
their quarrel in a battel; <hi>Vraban</hi> the fourth armed <hi>Henry</hi> the
third King of <hi>England</hi> against all those that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their due and old obedience to him, and all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
subjucts.</p>
            <p>The King was in a strong Fort, and if he had remained
still there, matters in a little time had faln forth more to his
wishes; and his Enemies might have been brought to a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:
for his good Subjects of the North, as the <hi>Forbesses,
Oguilbuyes,</hi> the <hi>Graunts, Frazeres, Meldrums,</hi> many of the
<hi>Gordounes, Keethes,</hi> and others who adhered to him out of
affection and duty, were advancing towards him. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
misinformed or betrayed by some his own, who made
him believe that unless he could command the Countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the Castle was of no such importance as was
the Castle of <hi>Sterlin</hi> for him, in consideration of the passage
over the River of <hi>Forth</hi> at a Bridge for those were coming to
his aid: The Lords of the association counterfeiting a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treit
and dispersing themselves in the Countrey, that they
might draw him from that bold, he rashly and unadvisedly
issued out of the Castle and left his beloved Town of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
The Earls of <hi>Montross, Glencarn,</hi> Lords <hi>Maxwell</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:51978:70"/>
and <hi>Ruthen</hi> accompanyed him to the <hi>Blackness;</hi> his Forces
here encreasing he marched towards <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Rendevous
and destinated Place of meeting for all his loyal Subjects,
there he displayed his Royal Standard. Here the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Constable (an unparralleld example of ingratitude) who
had betrayed the Son, in an hostile manner kept the Father
out of his own Castle, Cannons mounted, Pistols cockt, and
leveld at him, and exposed him a prey to his Robels, In the
amazement and deliberation what to go about, being thus
shut out of his Castle, Tidings came to him, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
were come neer to <hi>Falkirk,</hi> a little Town six miles
eastward from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> that his Army should not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by this unexspected accident, trusting to his right and
present Power; being more stout than prudent, he resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to set all upon the hazard of a Battel. The Confederates
had passed the <hi>Carron,</hi> a River under the <hi>Falkirk,</hi> and were
encamped above the Bridge neer the <hi>Torwood:</hi> The King set
forwards with his Army upon the other side of the <hi>Torwood,</hi>
neer a smal brook named <hi>Sawchy-Burn.</hi> This field is a plain
not far distant from that <hi>Bannoch-burn,</hi> where King <hi>Robert</hi>
the <hi>Bruce</hi> overthrew the great Army of <hi>Edward Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi>
Here both Armies advance forward in Battail ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray.</p>
            <p>The Lords rang'd their Host in three Squadrons; the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
was led by the Lords, <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Hailles</hi> and their friends
consisting of east <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Marss-men;</hi> The middle ward
was composed of the <hi>Liddesdale, Annandale, Ewesdale, Tivot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,
Twededale, Galloway-Men:</hi> the mayne battail was of west
<hi>Lothian-men,</hi> where most of the Lords were, and amongst
whom the Prince was kept. In the Kings Army the Earle of
<hi>Monteeth,</hi> Lords <hi>Aresken, Graham, Ruthen, Maxwell</hi> commanded
the vanguard. The left wing which consisted of Westland and
Highland men, was commited to the Earle <hi>of Glencarn.</hi> The
Lords, <hi>Boyd, Lyndesay,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Crawfoord</hi> commanded in
the Reer or great Battaill, amongst whom was the King armd
from head to foot upon a great Coursier, easie to be known
and discern'd from the rest. The first charge is valiantly
given and Launce meeting with Launce, the vanguard of the
Lords began to yield ground, and was strongly repulsed. But
the next charge being given by <hi>Annandale</hi> Men and the ranck
Riders of the Borders, The middle ward of the Kings Army
is beaten back to the mayn Battaill; Notwithstanding of
which it is fought a while with marvellous obstination and
great hardiness and assurance, untill the standard Royal was
beaten downe, and those who defended it were slain, the
violence of the bickering being mostly where it was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Kings army now beginning to bow, nor being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51978:71"/>
sufficient to resist the numbers of fresh assailers, the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
obeying no direction, turned their backs. In this rowt
and confusion of horse and foot men, the King seeking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
towards the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> where not far off som Boats
and the Ships of Sir <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> attented the fortune of
Battail, by the fall of his Horse, in leaping a Ditch, being
sore bruised, was carryed by such who knew him not, to a
Mill at <hi>Bannoch-Burn.</hi> The day was now the Confederates
and wrong had prevailed against Right, when the Prince of
<hi>Rothsay</hi> amazed at the noise and clamours of the flying and
following Souldiers, and in suspition of the worst, gave out
express and strait Commandement with threatnings to the
Disobeyers, that none should presume to pursue his Father,
nor others in the chase. Notwithstanding which, he was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and killed in a Mill in cold bloud. These who follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
him were the Lord <hi>Gray, Robert Sterlin</hi> of <hi>Keer,</hi> Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
Borthick</hi> a Priest, whom fame reporteth after shiriving
to have stobb'd him with a Dagger.</p>
            <p>The Ensigns taken, the Army dissipated and put to flight,
the Baggage rifled, the Death of the King being rumoured
through the Armies, the Victors turned slow in the chase,
and gave field-room to all that would fly, no severity being
used against any found unarmd; for the Lords of the associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pursu'd the King not the people. The discomfitted fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Sterlin;</hi> the victorious retir'd to their Camp, and the
next morning to <hi>Linlithgow.</hi> On the Kings side <hi>Alexander
Cunningham</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> was slain, and as some have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
the Lords <hi>Aerskin, Simple, Ruthen, Iohn Ramsay</hi> of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn</hi>
created <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and his chief favourite, with
their friends and Vassals: the Lard of <hi>Inneys, Alexander Scot</hi>
Director of the Chancery, with some Noblemens Friends
and Vassals: many were hurt who recovered of their woundes,
and this Battail seem'd rather a brave encounter and meeting
of Launces in some lists, than a Field of great deeds of arms,
and the victory was obtained rather by disorder, and the
rashness of the vanquished than by the valour of the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
This battel was fought the year 1488. the eleventh day
of <hi>Iune</hi> which is the festival of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the 29. year of
the Reign, and thirty five of the age of this King. He had
issue <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth who succeeded, <hi>Alexander</hi> Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Earl</hi> of <hi>Marr:</hi> The Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
with all funeral Rites and and Royal Pomp, as in expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the wrongs they had done him living, neer his
Queen in the Abby Church of <hi>Cambuskynneht,</hi> buryed his
body.</p>
            <p>This King concerning his personage was of a Stature som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
higher than ordinary, well proportioned, his hair was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51978:71"/>
black, his visage was rather long then round, approaching in
colour more to those in the Southern than Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.
Concerning his conditions, He was a Prince of an
haughty and towring Spirit, loved to govern alone, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an absolute Power and Royal Prerogative over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He knew that Noble-men were of his Predecessors
making, as the coyn, and why he might not put his stamp
upon the same mettal, or when these old Medails were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
that he might not refound them and give them a new
print, he thought no sufficient reason could be given. His
reign seemeth a Theater spred over with mourning and staind
with bloud, where in a revolution many Tragedies were
acted. Neither were the neighbour Kingdoms about in a
calmer estate during his reign. <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Lovys</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<hi>England</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>sixth, Edward</hi> the fourth, and
<hi>Richard</hi> the Usurper, <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the
War-like; <hi>Arnold</hi> Duke of <hi>Guilders</hi> was imprisoned by his
own Son. As if the heavenly Influences were sometimes
all together set to produce upon this Ball of the Earth nothing
but conspiracies, treasons, troubles, and for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Inhabitants to deprive them of all rest, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
            <p>This King is by the most condemned, as a rash, imprudent
dangerous Prince: good People make good Kings; when a
people run directly to oppose the authority of their Sov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>raign,
and assume Rebellion and arrogancy for obedience, resisting
his fairest motions and most profitable commandments, if
a King be martial, in a short time they are beaten and brought
under. If he be politick, prudent and foreseeing in a longer
time (as wild Dear) they are surprized, and either brought
back to their first order and condition, or thrall'd to greater
miseries. If he be weak and suffer in his Reputation or State
or person by them, the Prince who suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eedeth is ordinarily
the Revenger of his wrongs. And all conspiracies or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
if they prosper not in a high degree, advance the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty:
This Prince seemeth not to have been naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
inclined, but to have been constrained to leave his natural
inclination and necessitate to run upon Precipices and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:
his turbulent Subjects never suffering him to have rest.
Many Princes who in the beginning of their reigns have bin
admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed for their fair actions, by the ingratitude of their
Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts, have turn'd from one extremity to another, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their rebellious Subjects executioners. He was provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to do many things by the in solency of private men: and
what some call tyranny and fierceness in a Prince, is but just
severity. He sought to be feared, believing it to be the onely
way to obedience. It is ture, injuries took such deep impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51978:72"/>
in his mind, that no after service could blot them away.
The taking away of his Favourites, made him study revenge,
which if he had not done, he had to much of the <hi>Stoical</hi> virtues,
little of the <hi>Heroical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These who blame Princes, under a pure and absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
for having favourites, would have them inhumane,
base and contemptible, and would deprive them of power
to confer favours according to the distinguishing power of
thier understanding and conceptions. The choise a Prince
maketh of men whom he advanceth to great imployments, is
not subject to any mans censure. And were it bad, yet ought
it to be pass'd over, if not approv'd; least the discretion
and judgement of the Prince be questioned, and his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wounded: Favourites are shrines to shadow Princes
from thier People, Why should a people not allow a Prince
some to whom he may unmask himself, and discover the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of his Heart? If his secrets should be imparted to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
they would be no longer Secrets? Why should it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on a Prince to love all his Subjects alike, since he is not
beloved of them all alike? This is a desire to tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the affections of Princes, whom men should reverence.</p>
            <p>He seemeth too much to have delighted in retiredness, and
to have been a hater of business; nor that he troubled himself
with any but for formalities sake, more desirous of quietnes
than honour. This was the fault of the Governours of his
youth, who put him off business of State, that they might
the more easily reach their own ends, and by making him
their shadow, govern after their pleasure; Of this delight in
solitariness his Brothers took their advantage and wan the
people to their observance.</p>
            <p>He was much given to Buildings and trimming up of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,
Halls, and Gardens, as usually are the Lovers of Idleness:
and the rarest frames of Churches and Pallaces in <hi>Scotland</hi>
were mostly raised about his time. An humour which though
it be allowable in men which have not much to do, yet is
harmfull in Princes; As to be taken with admiration of Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Clocks, Dyals, Automates, Pictures, Statues. For the
the art of Princes is to give Laws and govern their people
with wisdom in peace, and glory in war; to spare the humble
and prostrate the proud.</p>
            <p>He is blam'd of Avarice yet there is no great matters recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of it, save the encroaching upon the dealing, and taking
the giving to whom he pleased of Church Benefices; which if
he had liv'd in our times, would have been held a virtue. He
was of a credulous Disposition, and therefore easie to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap> to inquire of future accidents: which if it
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51978:72"/>
be credible was the fault of those times. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth of
<hi>England</hi> is said to have had that same fault, &amp; that by the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpertation
of a prophecy of a Necromancer, which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
that one, the first Letter of whose name was <hi>G.</hi> should u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp
the Kingdom, and dispossess the children of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
he took away his Brother <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi>
which being really practised in <hi>England,</hi> some <hi>Scottish</hi> writers
(that a King of <hi>Scotland</hi> should not be inferior, to any of his
Neighbor Princes in wickednes) without grounds have recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same to have bin don by this King, his love was great to
learned men, he used as Counsellors in his important affairs
<hi>Iohn Ireland</hi> a Doctour of Divinity, and one of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in
<hi>Paris,</hi> made Arch-deacon of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
whom he promoted to be Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

he surrogated in the place of Mr. <hi>Robert Blackadore,</hi> and
made Bishop of <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> and his faults either in Religion
or Policy may be attribuied to these and his other Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>Many have thought that the fatal Chariot of his Precipice
was, that he had equally offended kindred, Clergy, Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and People. But suppose this had been true, why should
such an horrible mischief have bin devised, as to arm his own
Son against him? and that neither the fear of Divine justice,
the respect of infamy with the present or after times, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the example, had power to divert the minds of men
from such a cruel Design! This was really to seeth the Kid
in the Mothers milk, and to make an innocent youth obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
to the most hainous crime that could be committed.
What ever courtains could be spred to overshadow and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this mischief, the horrour of this fact possest this Prince
to his last hour, and God out of his Justice executed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of this cruelty upon the Nobles, Commons, and the
Prince himself at the field of <hi>Flowden:</hi> where some of the
chief Actors of this paricide were in their own persons, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the persons of their Successors, sacrificed to the
Ghost of this <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lords who had chosen rather to
be reputed famous Rebells than
contemn'd Subjects, by their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of enterprizing, skill of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the publick affairs, and
continued purchases, swelling to
that greatness of power, that they
found none to counterpoise, few
to oppose to their Designs; To
make their Rebellion lawful, and
show the world they intended not
the subversion of their Countrey, but of their opinionative
King, nor that they did dislike Soveraignity, so they might
have a Prince who would be ruled by their directions, take
the name, and leave to them the Majesty and Authority of
his Place: after the killing of the Father, call a Parliament
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51978:74"/>
for the installing of the Son in the Royall Throne; few of
the three Estates here meeting, except themselves, and the
Commissioners of Burroughs, in the Moneth of <hi>Iune</hi> the year
1488. at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the Prince is crowned, then having not
attained the sixteenth year of his age. Though these men had
assumed the Government, yet in divers parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
they had bur doubtful obedience, nor was their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
universally acknowledged, the flames of dissention see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
yet neither to be extinquished, nor altogether smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the life of the late King. On the Sea Sir <hi>Andrew
Wood,</hi> who had attended the event of the last Battel, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
resolutely the Quarrel of his dead Master. Five tall
Ships sent by the King of <hi>England</hi> to his Confederates aid
(but which came too late) pretending a Revenge upon his
disloyal Subjects, pillaged the maritime Towns, and forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the adjacent parts of the Countrey, shut up the mouth
of the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> and interrupted the Commerce of
Merchants. To repel which violence, the Ships gathered by
the Lords struggled in vain, being every way inferiour and
weak to supprels their incursions and Algarads. On the land
the Forces of those who had stood out for the late King had
rather been by the last conflict scatter'd, than throughly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and brought under. The ablest and most convenient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
which were gatherd to his assistance, having never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
and joind in one body, the fight being inconsideratly
precipitated and the Dye thrown, before they could descend
from the far Mountains, and cross the Foord-less Rivers;
And of those who were in the Fray not many being taken
prisoners, fewer killed, falling under the weight of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arms.</p>
            <p>The prime Men of those who had chosen rather justly to
follow the King, than profitably his Rebells, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for their loyaltie, and that good will which they had
carryed to their Soveraign, persecuted and proscrib'd in their
Fortunes and Persons, inflamed with indignation and shame
resolve to oppose wisdom to Fortune, courage to strength,
and hazard some one day more for the repairing the losses
of former: the Pillage begun upon the Seas by the <hi>English</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating
them. And being desirous to make as many fellows
of their danger as they could, they send Letters thorough all
the Quarters of the Kingdom to their Friends, Familiars
and Confederates, encouraging them to ply the business ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously,
opposing their valour and courage to the strength
and power of the abusers of the Prince. By publick writings
they cast aspersions on the present Government. After that
battail of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and since the Coronation of the King they
had not fallen in the power of a Monarch, but under an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygarchy,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:51978:74"/>
the most depraved form of all Governments, the
name and Title of a <hi>King</hi> a young man searce sixteen years of
age enjoyed, but he governed not, but was by the Killers of
his Father misgoverned, who under false pretences intended
the ruin of the State. <hi>What reproach and shame would it be not
onely with all men now living but also with Posterity to suffer these
who had hazarded what they had dearest for the honour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their Prince, to be branded with the name of Traytors,
be banished and followed to death. Whilst the Transgressors and
Abusers of all Laws, divine and humane, sit Judges over them, as
Revengers of general wrongs, usurping the Titles of Deliverers of
the Countrey, and Restaurers of the Common-wealth, amongst
whose pawes the present King could not be assured and safe. They
being the men who to justifie their injustice, and make their fact
meritorious, brought him in Arms, not knowing whither, against
his King and Father, most wofully taken away: besides the abusing
of his Name and Authority in every civil matter. The late
King had lost the day and himself by his own errours, not by their
power and designs. Now they should oppose to their proceedings,
&amp; though they might be esteemed inferiour in number to them, yet
(if they met together) they might be found equal to them in worth
and courage, being puft up by the last misfortune, and only put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their confidence in that they mastered their Designs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much being projected and designed for their meeting in
arms, in the North <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Forbes,</hi> a Man born nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to rest himself, nor suffer others, in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and other
Towns on the point of a Launce displayed the shirt of the
slaughtered King purpled with his bloud, inviting the
Countrey as by an Herauld to the revenge of his Murther. In
the West the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> a man eminent by his Birth
and Fortunes hath the same resolution; the Earl of <hi>Marshall,</hi>
Lords <hi>Gordon</hi> and <hi>Lyle,</hi> with their confederates in other parts
of the Kingdom, where their power or eloquence could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
move all their Engins to advance the enterprize, and put
every thing in readiness.</p>
            <p>The Lords of the insurrection having the young King in
their hands to countenance their proceedings, joining dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
to their good succes, determine except upon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
not to spill more civil blood. And to disperse the clouds
of that appearing storm, they encourage Sir <hi>Andrew Wood,</hi>
now received in favour and brought not onely to be no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but to be their friend and fellow-helper (having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from them the Barony of <hi>Largow,</hi> disposed to him
hereditarily of which before he had only a lease of the late
King for his first service) with his Ships to clear the <hi>Forth,</hi>
and scoure the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

his assistance the Vessels and Boats of the Havens neer adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51978:75"/>
At that same time <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Drummond stuart</hi> of <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,</hi>
a Nobleman, couragious and adventurous, is directed
to wait upon the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> stopt his ravaging and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
the Countrey, and kept him back from joining with his
Confederates of the <hi>North,</hi> and infesting the more civil parts:
being the greatest, ablest and nearest Man of that Faction.
The Earl had raised many high-land and West-land men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to be two thousand; but when he could not pass the
River of <hi>Forth</hi> at the bridge of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Lords having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
the Town, he assayeth to pass amongst the Fens and
Marishes at a Foord not far from the head of the River,
where other his Confederates had appointed to meet him.
Whilst he is encamped at <hi>Tilly-moss,</hi> far from all appearance
or suspition of danger, the Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> by the advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Alexander Mackealp</hi> (who had taken Arms with the
Earl only to find out his waies) in the Night invadeth his
Camp, the sentinels and these of the formost Guard seised
upon, or killed, or driven back, they in the neerest Cabines
amazed with the suddain mischief, rise to arm themselves
and think of fight, but finding the danger to be on all sides
and thorough the whole Camp, neither seeing before them
nor hearing any Directions given them for the great noise
of the Invaders, it being impossible to put themselves in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,
confusedly each overthrowing other take themselves to
hopeless and disordered slight. Sleep here to some is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in death, many disburthening themselvs of their arms,
seek sanctuary amongst the winding pathes of these Marshes.
Others are taken, but by their acquaintance and friends suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
after to escape. Revenge is only followed against such
who in malice had enterprized any thing against the present
Government, and persevered in their attempts.</p>
            <p>This defeit of the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> by the Lord <hi>Drummond,</hi>
is seconded with the rumour of a Sea victory obtained by
Sir <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> against <hi>Steven Bull,</hi> a man excelling in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
affairs, who had come upon the Scottish seas to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Quarrel of his Matters Ships not long before taken
and spoyled by Sir <hi>Andrew,</hi> They had met neer the Island of
the <hi>May</hi> at the mouth of the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> and arranging
themselves for fight had been two daies by the waves and

The rumour of these Victories spread abroad, so amaz'd
the Companies raised in the North by the Lord <hi>Forbess,</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51978:75"/>
other his Confederates, that they, changing their opinions
with the event of actions, gave over further prosecution or
desire of war, and every Man retired to his own home. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which by indifferent friends having sought a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(it being more expedient to take them in by Policy
than by force) they were easily received in favour: amongst
which was the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> and the Lord <hi>Forbess.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Governours to ingratiate themselves more with the
people, by calming the present troubles, and uniting the
divided members of the Common-wealth; that every man
might have a publick assurance for the freedom of his Person
and private estate and fortunes, call a Parlament, and it is
held at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> having the Law in their own
hands, that the insurrection might be thought just; here
was it adjudged that those who were slain in the field of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
had fallen by their own deservings, and justly suffered the
punishment of their rashness: that the Victors were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
guiltless of the blood there shed, and fairly acquitted
of any pursuit: The three estates testifying the same by their
subscriptions and Signets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was Ordained,</hi> That they who came against the present
King in aid of his Father, should take remissions or pardons: and
so many of them as were in hereditary Offices, as Wardens, Iustices,
Sheriffs, Stewards, Baillyes, Lieutenants, or in other publick
Charges, should be suspended from them for the space of three years,
that such who had offices for term of life, or for terms, should be
dispossessed and dennded of them altogether.</p>
            <p>All which, though done under a colour of Punishment,
was only to invest Places, and to turn some of themselves
rich by their spoils. The punishment of mean men challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of these garboyls is either made little or passed over. All
Donations howsoever made by Patent from the King or by
Parliaments in prejudice of the Crown, beginning from the
moneth of <hi>September</hi> before, till the day of his decease are
repelled and annihiled. All honours bestowed on such the
late King sought to obliege unto him were recalled. The
Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> was divested of his title of being Duke
of <hi>Montross,</hi> as the L. of <hi>Balmayn</hi> was of his, of being Earl of
<hi>Bothwell.</hi> Embassadours are directed to the <hi>Emperour, Pope,</hi>
Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and other Princes, to renue
the Leagues, antient Confederacies and Allyances, as in
times past had been the custome of the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> to
their neighbour Princes, but especially to take away the
blame of their Kings slaughter from the Governours: and
manifest to all the world the candor of their minds, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of their proceedings. For that some few <hi>English</hi> Ships
had shut up the narrow Seas of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and interrupted the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51978:76"/>
commerce of Merchants, pillaging the Coasts, Order was
established for building of many Ships, and that every Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
should be stored with them, as well to maintain traffick
abroad with Strangers, as for fishing, and to be walls to the
Countrey at home. In a matter so important, and near concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the weal and standing of the State, the Barons were
ordained to share and bear a part with the Merchants and
Burroughs. And in so fair a project, to encourage his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the King himself was content first to begin, and to build
ships for his own and the publick service of the Kingdom.
This being one of the greatest miseries of the late King that
he suffered himself to be misgovered by (as they term'd
them) worthless men, some Prelates and Noble-men eniment
in learning and virtue are selected who should still be resident
with the King, and of his Council without the advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and decree of six of which if any matters of importance
were proceeded on and concluded, they should be void and

            <p>Now is every thing ordered to the best, Justice is executed
on oppressours and Robbers, and in the remotest parts of
the Kingdom, the King himself in person seeth it admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.
He is of so contrary a temper to the humour of his
Predecessors that he granted freely to every man what could
be demanded in reason. To give a testimony to the world
of the Agonie of his mind, for the Death of his Father, and
what remorse and anguish he suffered for the faults of those
who brought him to the Field against him, he girded himself
with a chayn of Iron, to which every third year of his life
thereafter he added some rings and weight. Though this
might have proved terrible to the Complices of the Crime,
yet either out of conscience of his gentle disposition and
mild nature, and confidence in his generosity, or of the trust
they had in their own power and Faction, they bewrayed no
signs of fear, nor attempted ought against the common peace
and tranquility, some records bear that they forewarned
him by the example of his Father not to take any violent
course against them, or which might irritate the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him and every thing to embrace their counsels: and
that finding him repining and stubborn, beyond mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

the sixth <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> arrived in <hi>Scotland</hi> with instruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the Clergy, and Letters from his Master to the <hi>King</hi>
and the <hi>Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings were full of ordinary consolations to asswage
his passions, and reduce his mind to a more calm temper for
the accident of his Fathers death.</p>
            <p>The most glorious victory a Prince could acquire, was sometimes
to overcome himself, and triumph over his disordered passions.
In all perturbations, to which we are subject, we should endeavour
to practise that precept, <hi>No thing too much,</hi> but chiefly in our
passions of sorrow and wrath: which not being restrained over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm
the greatest and most generous Minds, that by passion the
fewest actions, and by reason the most do prosper.</p>
            <p>Though a King he must not imagine himself exempt from things
casual to all mankind, especially in Seditions and civil tumults:
from which no kingdom nor State hath been free. There being no
City which hath not sometimes wicked Citezens, and alwaies and
ever an headstrong and mad multitude; he should take what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln
him from the hand of his Maker, who chastiseth those he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.
What comes from heaven be should bear necessarily, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from Men couragiously; there was no man so safe, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and transcendent, who by an insolent Nobility and ravaging
Populacy might not be compell'd to perpetrate many things against
his heart and intentions.</p>
            <p>The will being both the beginning and subject of all sin, and the
consenting to and allowing the action being the only and main point
to be considered and look into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which he was free, the sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
was not his, nor could the punishment which by the divine
Iustice might follow belong unto him.</p>
            <p>Sith he had done nothing of himself, but as a bound man had
been carryed away by mutinous Subjects: these that lead trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
not alwaies they that follow. To these men remorse and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of conscience belong'd, it was they should lament and mourn
who under false pretences had abused the people, maskt their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and malice with a reformation of errours in the State,
whose rage could not be quencht but by the bloud of ther Soveraign.
It was these should bewail their in justice and cruelty, the sin, shame
and judgement, for so hainous a fact followed these men; He
should not impute the wrongs and wickedness of others, by which
he had been a sufferer with his disastered Father, to himself. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
belonged to the Almighty, to whose Tribunal he should submit
his quarrel. He should not decree the worst against his mutinous
Subjects, nor turn them desperate, as if there were no place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
Great offenccs, ordinarily were seldom punisht in a State,
that it was pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itable for a Prince sometime to put up voluntarily an
injury, the way to be invincible was never to contend, and to stand
out of danger was the benefit of peace, that he should apply soft
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51978:77"/>
Medicine where it was dangerous to use violent; That following
his Maker he should endeavour to draw Good out of evil.</p>
            <p>As he was for that disaster of his Father pittyed by Men upon
Earth, so assuredly he would be pardoned in Heaven. If his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
returned to their crooked Byas and did revolt again, he would
make the danger his own, use his Ecclestastical censures and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
power against th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m till they became obedient, and submitted
themselves to the sway of his Scepter.</p>
            <p>In the Letters to the Nobles he exhorted them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Ambition was the cause of Sedition, which had no limits, and
which was the bane and wrack of States &amp; Kingdoms of which they
should beware of; Kingdoms subsisting upon the reputation of a
Prince, and that respect his Subjects carryed towards him. He
was the Eye and Sun of Iustice; the Prince weakned or taken away,
or his authority contemned; the Common-wealth would not only
fall into a Decadence, but suffer an Earth-quake and perish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Either
after by Forrainers be invaded, or by intestine dissentions rent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.
Confusions followed where obedience ceased and left: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
deposed Kings as well as death, and Kings are no longer
Kings when their Subjects refuse to obey them.</p>
            <p>That good people made good Kings, which he requested them
to endeavour to be, as they would answer to God whose Lientenants
Princes were, and by whose power they ruled.</p>
            <p>After, this time the Lord <hi>Evaindale</hi> being dead, the Earl
of <hi>Anguss,</hi> was made Chancelour, and the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the place of great Chamberlain of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
enjoyed a great calm of peace, the grounds of dissention
seeming to be taken away.</p>
            <p>The King in the strength and vigour of his Youth, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that to live in Idleness was to live to be contemned by
the world, by change of Objects to expell his present sadness
and to enable himself for wars when they should burst forth,
gave himself to recreations by Games, and with a decent
Pomp entertained all Knightly exercies keeping an open
and magnificent Court. When time and Exercise had ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

in marital Sports, Tilting and Barriers proclaimed; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

            <p>Not long after well and honorably accompanied arriveth
in <hi>Scotland</hi> a young man naming himself <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of
<hi>York</hi> son to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, true Inheritour of the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> divers Neighbor Princes testifying the same by
the Letters, which contained,</p>
            <p>That <hi>Edward</hi> the eldest son of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth who succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Father in the Crown, by the Name of <hi>Edward</hi> the fifth, was
murthered by <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> their unnatural Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
but <hi>Richard</hi> the younger Son his Brother, by the Man who
was employed to execute that Tragedy (making report to the Tyrant
that he had performed his command for both Brethren) was saved,
and with speed and secrecy convoyed to <hi>Tourney,</hi> there conceal'd
and brought up by his Fathers Sister <hi>Margarite</hi> Dutchass of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy;</hi>
Nhat King <hi>Iames</hi> should acknowledge this for Truth, and

            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> graciously receiving this young man, told him
<hi>That whatsoever he were, he should not repent him of putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into his hands,</hi> and from that time forth, though many
gave Informations against him as a Counterfeit, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him every way as a Prince, embraced his quarrel, and sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
both his own eyes, and the eyes of the world, he gave
consent that this Duke should take to wife Lady <hi>Katherine
Gordoun</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> which some thought
he did to increase the Factions of <hi>Perkins</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> stir the
discontented Subjects against King <hi>Henry,</hi> and to encourage
his own Subjects to side on his quarrel.</p>
            <p>Not long after in person with this Duke of <hi>York</hi> in his
Company, who assured him of powerful assistance, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with an Army into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> but not one Man
comming to side with them, the King turned his enterprize
into a Road, and after he had spoiled the Countrey return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is said that <hi>Perkin</hi> acting the part of a
Prince handsomely, where he saw the Scots pillaging and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51978:78"/>
wasting of the Countrey came to the King, and in a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
manner requested him to spare his afflicted people, that
no Crown was so dear to his Mind, as that he desired to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
it with the blood and ruin of his people: whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
King <hi>Iames</hi> answered he was ridiculously careful of an
interest another man possessed, and which perhaps was
none of his. The King of <hi>England</hi> who delighted more to
draw treasure from his people than to hazard the spilling
of their blood, to revenge the predatory war of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
and find out <hi>Perkin,</hi> requireth a subsidy of his Subjects:
and though few believed he would follow so far a flying
Hart, he was levying a puissant Army.</p>
            <p>No sooner this Subsidy began to be collected amongst
the <hi>Cornish</hi>-men when they began to grudge and murmur,
and afterwards rebelled; which when it was understood of
the King, he retained the forces raised, for his own ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and use. In the mean time dispatching the Earl of
<hi>Surrey</hi> to the <hi>North</hi> to attend the <hi>Scots</hi> incursions, whilst
the <hi>Cornish-men</hi> are in their March towards <hi>London,</hi> King
<hi>Iames</hi> again entered the Frontiers of <hi>England</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and besieged the Castle of <hi>Norham</hi> in person. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> was advancing with greater
forces, loaden with spoil he returned back again; the Earl
of <hi>Surrey</hi> finding no Enemy, sat down before the Castle of
<hi>Aytoun,</hi> which he took, and soon after returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the cold season of the year, with the unseasonableness
of the weather driving away time, invited a Treaty of Peace
on both sides.</p>
            <p>Amidst these turmoyls and unprofitable incursions of
the two Kingdoms, <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> sent one
<hi>Peter Hialas</hi> to treat a marriage between <hi>Katherine</hi> one of their
Daughters, and <hi>Arthur</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> This allyance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
agreed upon, and almost brought to perfection King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
desirous of quietness, and to have an end of all Debates,
especially these with <hi>Scotland,</hi> communicateth his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to <hi>Hialas</hi> a man wise and learned, and whom he thought
able to be employed in such a service: for it stood not with
his Reputation to sue unto his enemy for Peace.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hialas</hi> a stranger unto both, as having Direction from
his Master for the Peace of Christian and Neighbor Princes,
might take upon him this reconciliation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hialas</hi> accepteth the Embassage, and comming to King
<hi>Iames,</hi> after he had brought him to hearken to more safe and
quiet Counsels, wrote unto King <hi>Henry, That he hoped that
Peace might easily be concluded, if he would send some wise and
temperate Counsellour of his own, that might treat of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51978:78"/>
Whereupon the King directeth the Bishop of <hi>Duresm, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Fox,</hi> who at that time was at his Castle of <hi>Norham,</hi> to
confer with <hi>Hialas,</hi> and they both to treat with some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
deputed from King <hi>Iames.</hi> The Commissioners of
both sides meet at <hi>Iedbrough,</hi> and dispute many articles and
conditions of Peace. Restitution of the spoils taken by the
<hi>Scotish,</hi> or dammages for the same is desired: but that was
passed as a matter impossible to be performed. An enterview
in person at <hi>Newcastle</hi> is desired of both Kings: which being
referred to King <hi>Iames</hi> his own arbitrement, he is reported
to have answered that he meant to treat a Peace, and not go a
begging for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The breaking of the Peace for</hi> Perkin Warbeck <hi>is highly
aggravated by the Bishop, and he demanded to be deliver'd
to the King of</hi> England; That a Prince should not easily believe
with the common people, that <hi>Perkin</hi> was a fiction, and such an
one that if a Poet had projected the figure, it could not have been
done more to admiration, than the house of <hi>York</hi> by the old Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chess
of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Sister to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, having first rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Lambert Simnel,</hi> and at last this <hi>Perkin,</hi> to personate Kings
and seduce the people. His birth, education, not residence in any
one place proved him a Pageant King, that he was a reproach to
all Kings, and a person not protected by the Law of Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Glasgow <hi>answered for his Master,</hi> That the
love and Amity grounded upon a Common cause and universal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
amongst Kings to defend one another, was the main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
upon which King <hi>James</hi> had adventured to assist <hi>Edward</hi>
Duke of <hi>York;</hi> that he was no competent Iudge of his title; he
had received him as a Suppliant, protected him as a person fled
for refuge, espoused him with his Kinsewoman, and aided him
with Arms upon the belief that he was a Prince; that the People
of <hi>Ireland, Wales,</hi> and many in <hi>England</hi> acknowledged him no
less than their King, whether he were so or not; sith for a Prince
he had hitherto defended him, he could not leave him upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of his most terrible Enemy and the present Possessour of his
Crown. That no Prince was bound to render a Subject to another
who had come to him for Sanctuary, less a Prince who had recourse
unto him for aid and Supply, and was now allyed with the antient
blood of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Much being said at last they conclude upon a truce for
some moneths following.</p>
            <p>After this treaty of Peace the Counterfeit Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
with his Lady, and such Followers as would not leave him,
sailed over into <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Truce happily concluded and continued, by a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
and untoward accident went neer to have been given
up and broken.</p>

There were certain <hi>Scottish</hi> young men came into <hi>Norham</hi>
Town, and having little to do went sometimes forth and
would stand looking upon the Castle. Some of the Garrison
of the Castle observing them, and having not their Minds
purged of the late ill-humour of Hostility, either suspected
them or quarrel'd with them as spyes, whereupon they fell
at ill words, and from words to blows, so that many were
wounded of either side, and the <hi>Scots</hi> (being strangers in the
Town) had the worst: Insomuch that some of them were
slain, and the rest made hast home. The matter being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
on, and often debated before the Wardens of the
Marshes of both sides, and no good order taken, King <hi>Iames</hi>
took it to himself, and sent <hi>Marchmond</hi> Herauld to the King
of <hi>England</hi> to make protestation, <hi>That if reparation were not
done according to the Conditions of the Truce, his King did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
war.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> (who had often tryed
fortune, and was enclined to Peace) made answer, <hi>That what
had been done was utterly against his will, and without his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
But if the Garrison Souldiers had been in fault, he would see
them punished, and the Truce in all points to be preserved.</hi> This
answer pleased not King <hi>Iames.</hi> Bishop <hi>Fox</hi> understanding
his discontent, being troubled that the occasion of breaking
the Truce should grow from his men, sent many humble and
deprecatory Letters to the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to appease him.
Whereupon King <hi>Iames</hi> molified by the Bishops submiss and
discreet Letters, wrote back again unto him, <hi>That though he
were in part moved by his Letters, yet he should not be fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
except he spake with himself, as well about the compounding
of the present difference, as about other matters that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the good of both kingdoms.</hi> The Bishop advising first with
his Master, took his journey to <hi>Scotland:</hi> the meeting was
at the Abby of <hi>Melrose</hi> where the King then abode. The
King first roundly uttered unto the Bishop his offence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for the breach of the Truce by his Men at <hi>Norham</hi>
Castle, after speaking with him a part, he told him, <hi>That these
temporarie Truces, and Peace were soon made and soon broken:
but that he desired a straiter Amity with the King of</hi> England,
<hi>discovering his Mind, that if the King would give him in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
the Lady Margarite his eldest Daughter, That indeed might
be a knot indissolvable; That he knew well what Place and Power
the Bishop deservedly had with his Master; therefore if he would
take the business to heart, and deal in it effectually, he doubted not
but it would well succeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bishop answered soberly, <hi>That he thought himself ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
happy than worthy, to be an instrument in such a matter, but
would do his best endeavour.</hi> Wherefore the Bishop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

disposed in it, gave the King first advice to proceed to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of Peace, and then go on with the Treaty of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
by degrees; hereupon a Peace was concluded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
for both the Kings lives, and to the overliver of them
one year after. In this Peace there was an Article contained,
<hi>That no English man should enter into</hi> Scotland, <hi>nor no Scotch
man into</hi> England, <hi>without Letters Commendatory from the king
of either Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Treaty of the Marriage it is reported that the
King of <hi>England</hi> referred this matter to his Council, and that
some of the Table in freedom of Counsellours (the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

failing of the race of his two Sons, that then the Kingdome of</hi>
England <hi>would fall to the King of</hi> Scotland, <hi>which might preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the Monarchy of</hi> England. Whereunto the King himself
replyed, <hi>That if any such event should be,</hi> Scotland <hi>would be
but an accession to</hi> England, <hi>and not</hi> England <hi>to</hi> Scotland, <hi>for
that the greater would draw the less, and that it was a safer union
for</hi> England <hi>than that of</hi> France.</p>

and Rewards of their Valour, licensed to return

            <p>During the Treaty of this Marriage with <hi>England,</hi> a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a new and strange shape was born in <hi>Scotland</hi> near
the City of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the body of which under the waste or
middle varied nothing from the common shape and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the bodies of other men, the members both for use
and comliness being two, their faces looking one way; sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
they seemed two men to such who saw not the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
and standing it could not be discerned to which of
the two Bulks above the thighs and legs did appertain. They
had differing passions, and diverse wills, often chiding others
for disorder in their behaviour and actions: after much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
embracing that unto which they both consented.
By the <hi>Kings</hi> direction they were carefully brought up, and
instructed in <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Foreign Languages.</hi> This Monster li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
twenty and eight years, and dyed when <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of
<hi>Albany</hi> Governed. <hi>Claud Gruget</hi> maketh mention of the like
Monster born in <hi>Paris</hi> before the marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth

death of it were neer together.</p>

and his lavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

founded, Castles repaired, Ships builded (three of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
greatness) finding himself needy of Treasure to
support the dayly expences at Court, engaged to many and
sunck deep in debt; and that Subsidies he could not levy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by the Suffrages of his Parliament, by whose power
they were imposed and rated setteth the most learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
at Law and men experienced in foreign Policy to find
out new means and waies to acquire and gather him monies
by Laws already made and Ordained, which was in effect to
pole the people by executing the rigour of Justice, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of wise men arising often on the expences of Fools,
after the example of King <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh of <hi>England,</hi> his
Father-in law, who taking the advantage of the breach of
his penal Statues gave power to Sir <hi>Richard Empson</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Dudley</hi> by Informers and Promoters to oppress and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the estates of many of his best Subjects, whom <hi>King Henry</hi>

the eight to satisfy his wronged people, after his decease cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
execute. Old customes are by these men pryed into, and
forgotten absolet Statutes quickned.</p>
            <p>Amongst the titles of possessing of Lands in <hi>Scotland</hi> there
is one, which in process of time of an ungodly custom grew
strong and is kept for a Law, being fetched by imitation
from the Lawes of the neighbouring States; That if the
possessour of Lands dy, and leave a Minor to succeed to him
his Tutelage belongeth to the King, and the profit of the
Lands until the Minor be of the age of one and twenty years.
This is of those lands which are termed Wards. The King
causeth bring up his Wards, but bestoweth no more of their
Rents upon them than is useful to such of that age. By a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Law they have not any thing better than this, which
they call <hi>Recognition,</hi> that if the evidences of any possessour
of Ward-lands be not in all points formal, and above excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Law, the lands (the possessours put from them) shall
return to the Lord Superiour: and like to this, That if a
Possessour of Ward Lands without the consent of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
sell and put away the half, or above the half of his
land and Farm, the whole land and Farm returneth to the
Superiour or Lord Paramount. They have lands held with
clauses which they call irritant, that if two terms of a few
duty run unpaid into the third, the Land falleth unto the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour.
When those lawes and other like them by reason
of the Neighbourin cursions and troubles with <hi>England,</hi> and
the civil broyls at home had been long out of use amongst
the Subjects, and the execution of them as it were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner forgot,
these Projectors and new <hi>Tol-masters</hi> the king gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way to enrich his Exchequer, awakned them. Many
of the Subjects by these inquirles were obnoxious to the
king and smarted, but most the most honest, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
either to buy their own lands and inheritance from
the Exchequer, or quit and freely give some portion of them
to those Caterpillars of the State. The King was so dearly
beloved of his people, that in the height of those Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(which reached near the exorbitant avarice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
none refused or made difficultie to give all that the laws
ordained. The King seeing their willingness to perform, and
knowing their great disability thereunto, out of his singular
Grace and Goodness remitteth not onely the rigour, but even
the equity almost of his lawes, insomuch that thereafter
none of his Subjects were damnified in their persons or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
by his proceedings: which gain'd him the hearts of
all: And to put away all suspitions and jealousies from their
minds (an Ordinary practice amongst Princes) acts that fill
Princes coffers ever being the ruin of their first Projectors,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51978:81"/>
of any wrong intended, He suffered the Promoters and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
of this polling, with others of the most active to be
thrown into Prisons, where some miserably ended their
daies.</p>
            <p>The year 1507. <hi>Iames</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Isles</hi> was
born at <hi>Holy-rood-House,</hi> the 21. of <hi>Ianuary:</hi> the Queen in
her throwes of birth, being brought neer the last agony of
death, the King (overcome with affection and religious
vows) taketh a Pilgrimage for her recovery on foot to Saint
<hi>Ninian:</hi> in <hi>Galloway;</hi> a place in those credulous times famous
for the burial of St. <hi>Ninian</hi> the Apostle of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and
notorious by the many Processions and Visits of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Countreys of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> at his return he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his Queen recovered, the child after dyed at <hi>Sterlin,</hi>
with the Bishop of <hi>Galloway,</hi> who was appointed to attend
him. The year following the Queen brought forth another
son named <hi>Arthur</hi> at <hi>Holy-rood-House,</hi> but he died also in the
Castle of <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh his Grandfather
accompanyed him to the other world. King <hi>Iames</hi> to the
Coronation of the young King his Brother-in-law sendeth
Embassadours.</p>
            <p>After the death of his two Sons, and his Father-in-Law,
as if he had been warned from above to think upon his own
mortality (whether he had resolute intention so to do, or
that for reasons known to himself, he would have it so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear)
he giveth out, That out of remorse for bearing arms
in the Field where his Father was slain, he had a resolution
to leave his kingdom and visit the holy Sepulchre. Then to
prepare his way <hi>Robert Blacka-Towre</hi> Abbot of <hi>Dumfermling</hi>
is directed; but the Abbot in his journey is arrested by death,
and the King findeth other hinderances to keep him at
Home.</p>
            <p>Amidst these deliberations his Queen is delivered in the
Pallace of <hi>Linlithgow</hi> of her third Son, in the Moneth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi>

<hi>Alexander Stuart</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> natural son, after promoted to be
Arch-Bishop of <hi>St. Andrews.</hi> The cause which was given
out to the rumours of the people of their comming, was,
That the <hi>French</hi> King having no male children, crav'd the
advice and counsel of the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> his Confederate,
concerning the marriage of his Eldest Daughter: whether
he should bestow her upon <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> the <hi>Daulphine</hi>

and Duke of <hi>Augulesm,</hi> or upon <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> who
had presented her with many tokens of affection, and by his
Embassadours earnestly sought her from her Brother. But

               <hi>Anne</hi> Daughter of <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> after the death
of her Sister <hi>Isabella</hi> remained sole heir of that Dutchy, her
wardship falling to the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight; He

would not loose so fair a Dowry for the blustering rumour
of Malecontents, which in a little time would grow stale and

Church-Patrimony, suspitious of the power of the <hi>French</hi> in

of <hi>Naples</hi> and Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> but one day hazard for

out of his Chair, and substitute in his Room their Cardinal
of <hi>Amboise,</hi> or some other of their own, began to study no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations

to give over the protection of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and

The King refusing to forsake Confederates, the Pope betak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> before his meeting with <hi>Bernard Stuart</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Forman,</hi> was fully purposed to prove an indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder

            <p>To throw the apple of Dissention, <hi>Bishop Forman</hi> is sent

            <p>
               <hi>King Henry</hi> mistrusting that Embassy, offereth all and
more than they demand from him. Shortly after the <hi>English</hi>
beginning to interrupt the traffick of the <hi>French</hi> by Sea, king
<hi>Iames</hi> will send his Ships, lately well mann'd and equipp'd
for fight, which not long before had been prepared (as was
given out) to transport the <hi>king</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> to his Cosin Queen
<hi>Ann,</hi> supposing this Gift would rather seem a <hi>Pledge</hi> of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51978:82"/>
and alliance to the English than any Supply of Warre.
But <hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arrain</hi> having got the command of them,
instead of falling towards <hi>France,</hi> arriveth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whether
by tempest of weather, or that he would disturb the Kings
proceedings in assisting the <hi>French,</hi> instigated and corrupted
by <hi>King Henry,</hi> it is uncertain: and after he had spoild <hi>Knock-Fergus</hi>
a maritime village, returneth with them to the Town
of <hi>Ayre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King taking in an evil part the invasion of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
but more the lingring of the Earl, for he had received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from Queen <hi>Anne</hi> and Bishop <hi>Forman,</hi> regretting the long
and vain expectation of his Ships, giveth the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guss,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> a Commission for both him and
them. The Earl of <hi>Arrain</hi> by his Friends at Court, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Masters displeasure, ere they could find him,
hoiseth up Sails, and committeth him self rather to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
fortune of the Seas, than the just wrath of a King.
After great Tempest arriving in <hi>French Bretaign,</hi> these Ships
built at such extraordinary Charges, Sayls and Cordage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken from them, rotted and consumed by weather, in
the Haven of <hi>Erest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now matters grew more exasperate between the Brother
Kings; <hi>Robert Car</hi> Warden of the Borders is killed by three
<hi>English, Hieron, Lilburn, Struthers. Andrew Barton,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an old quarrel begun in the reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the third,
had purchased Letters of Reprisal against the <hi>Portingals,</hi> by
<hi>Thomas Howard</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Admiral is slain, and his Ships ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
To this last Grievance (when it was expostulated) <hi>King
Henry</hi> is said to have answered, <hi>That truce amongst Princes was

falleth in an ambush of the <hi>English:</hi> where Sir <hi>William Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure</hi>
with a thousand Archers put him to flight, and took his
Brother <hi>George.</hi> During these border incursions, the Lord
<hi>Dacres</hi> and Doctor <hi>West</hi> came as in an Embassy from <hi>England,</hi>
not so much for establishing a Peace, and settling those tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,

and concluded nothing) as to give their Master cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and true Intelligence of the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> with
the <hi>French,</hi> and what they attempted.</p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de la Motte</hi> was come with Letters from the <hi>French</hi>
to stir <hi>King Iames</hi> to take arms against the <hi>English,</hi> and had
in his voyage drowned three <hi>English</hi> Ships, bringing seven
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51978:83"/>
with him as Prizes to the Harbour of <hi>Leyth. Robert Bartoun</hi>
in revenge of <hi>Andrew Bartouns</hi> death, at that same time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with thirteon Vessels all Prizes. King <hi>Lovys</hi> had sent
a great ship loaden with Artillery, Powder and Wines; in

earnest request for the renuing of the antient <hi>League</hi> between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Letters froom Queen <hi>Anne</hi> for the
invasion of <hi>England.</hi> In which she regretted he had not one
Friend nor maintainer of his Honour at the Court of <hi>France</hi>
(after the late delay of the sending his Ships) except her self
and her Ladies: that her request was, He would for her sake
whom he had honoured with the name of his Mistress in his
Martial sports in time of peace, march but one mile upon the
<hi>English</hi> bounds, now in time of an appearing war against her
Lord and Countrey.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> thinking himself already engaged and interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his fame, drawn away by the promises, eloquence, and
other perswasions of the <hi>French,</hi> assembleth the three Estates
of his Kingdom to deliberate about a war with <hi>England.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
oppose it, but in vain; for at last for fear of the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
it is concluded, uncertain whether by a worse Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
or event. But before any hostility against the <hi>English</hi> they
determine and decree that <hi>King Henry</hi> shall by an Herauld be
fairly advertised and desired to desist from any further inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Territories of the <hi>French</hi> King, or Duke of <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
(who was General of the <hi>French</hi> Army) the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
Confederates and Kinsemen: which not being yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto, the Warre as lawfull and just shall be denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the eight then besieging <hi>Therovenne,</hi> answered the
Herauld who delivered his Commission: That he heard no
thing from him, but what he had expected from a King a
Despiser of Gods and Mans Law; for himself, he would not
give over a War so happily began for any threats. Neither
did he care much for that Mans friendship, of whose uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
he had so often had experience, nor for the power of
his Kingdom and ambitious poverty.</p>
            <p>After this answer of the King of <hi>England,</hi> A Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was published almost to this
sense.</p>
            <p>Though Princes should direct their Actions more to conscience

and Incursions have been made upon our Borders; Sundry of our
Leiges have been taken, and as in a just warr, turned Prisoners;
the Warden of our Marches under Assurance hath been miserably
kelled; our Merchants at Sea invaded, spoiled of their goods, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
lives: above others, the chief captain of our Ships put to
Death, and all by the kings own Commission; upon which breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
between the two kingdomes, disorders and manifest wrongs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon our Subjects, when by our Embassadours we had divers
times required satisfaction and Reparation, we received no justice
or answer worthy of him or us, our Complaints being rejected,
and we disdainfully contemned, that longer to suffer such Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
and not by just force to resist unjust violence, and by
dangers to seek a remedy against greater or more imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
Not to stand to the defence of our Lieges, and take upon us their
protection, were to invite others to offer the like affronts and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to us hereafter.</p>
            <p>Besides these Breaches of Duty, Outrages, Wrongs done unto us,
his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> king of <hi>England</hi> without any just cause or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
offered to him or any of his by the king of <hi>France,</hi> hath le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed
a mighty Army against him, invaded his Territories, using
all hostility: Continuing to assault and force his Towns, make his
Subjects Prisoners, kill and ransom them, impose Subsidies, and
lift moneys from the quieter sort, which wrongs, dammage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
we cannot but repute done unto us in respect of our earnest
intercessions unto him and many requests rejected, and that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
League between the two kingdomes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
in which these two Nations are obliged respectively, and mutually
bound to assist others against all Invaders whatsoever; that the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51978:84"/>
Enemy of the one shall be the Enemy of the other, and the Friends
of the one the Friends of the other. As all motions tend unto rest,
the end of a just war being Peace, that our Brother (who hath no
such Enemy as the too great Riches and abundance in which he
swimmeth) may entertain Peace with his Brother Princes, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
that boundless ambition, which maketh him usurp Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over his equals; we have been compelled to take us to defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
arms; for our Brother hath now declared himself, and vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that he is sole Iudge and Umpire of the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
that from his will, the differences of Successions and Titles of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
wrongs and other interests depend, as that all should
be obsequious to his authority; and what particular Authority can
be more intolerable, than that he should hinder so great and just
a Prince as the King of <hi>France</hi> to claim his own and defend his
Subjects?</p>
            <p>If our Brother the king of <hi>England</hi> by the supply and assistance
of many neighbour Countreys, now by the Provocation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> arising upon all sides against the <hi>French,</hi> should
extend his Power and Victory over <hi>France</hi> (under what colour and
pretence of Iustice so ever) to what an extremity shall the kingdom
of <hi>Scotland</hi> be reduced, having so powerful and ambitious a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?
Fear of any neighbour Princes Greatness, when it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it self over adjaeent Territories, is a Good cause of Defence
and taking of Armes, which cannot be but just, sith most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>We are not ignorant that here will be objected against us, The
breach of a League contracted between our Brother and us: We
have not broken that League; but for great Causes and Reasons
separate our selves from it, our Brother having taken away the
means, occasions, reasons, were had to observe it. In all Leagues,
Confederations, Alliances and Promises amongst Princes, the last
Confederation is ever understood to be contracted without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to the Rights of any former Alliances: and when our Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
made that League with our Brother, it was to be understood
that it should hold no longer, nor we longer be bound unto it than
he should keep to our first Allies and antient Confederates, not
breaking their Peace, nor troubling the Government and Estates of
their Countreys. A National League is ever to be preferred before
any personal, an antient to a new; the Leagues between the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> having continued many ages,
should justly he preferr'd to that which we as a new Ally of the house
of <hi>England</hi> did contract, which yet we are most willing to keep:
but the love of our Countrey passing all private respects hath mov'd
us to separate our selves for a time from it.</p>
            <p>All Leagues, Confederations, Alliances, Promises amongst Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are respectively and mutually understood, with this condition
and Law, providing both keep upon either side; the one party
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51978:84"/>
breaking or departing from the League, Allyance or Promise, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is no longer bound to keep nor adhere unto it. So long as the
King of <hi>England</hi> kept unto us, we kept unto Him: He now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
many waies broken to us, we are no longer obliged to keep to
him; That same oath which obliged and tyed us, after his breach
absolving and making us free; and of this we divers times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
him, giving him assurance, except we would betray that
Trust and confidence our Subjects and Confederates had in us for
the maintenance of their peace and safety, we could not but assist
them in their just cause (howsoever the justest actions have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the mrst profitable events) and be constrained to have a recouse
to arms for a remedy of their present misery.</p>
            <p>And now notwithstanding of our advanced Expedition, and
preparations for war, that the world may judge rightly of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
We declare and manifest that if our brother shall leave
off the Invasion of our Confederates, use no more hostility against
them, and give satisfaction for the wrongs done unto our Subjects,
that we shall disband our forces: and are content that all matters
of difference aswel between the King of <hi>France,</hi> and our brother,
as our brother and us, be amicably judged, decided and taken away.
As that not only a Truce and Cessation of their Miserie for a time,
but a perfect and lasting Peace be concluded and established, to the
full contentment, and lasting happiness of the three kingdoms and
our posterity.</p>
            <p>Whilest the King staied at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> attending the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Army, now ready to set forward, and full of cares
and perplexity, in the Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> heard Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song
(as then it was called) while he was at his Devotion, an
antient Man came in, his amber coloured locks hanging down
upon his Shoulders, his fore-head high and enclining to bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his Garment of azure colour, somewhat long girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him with a Towel or Table Napkin, of a comely and
reverend aspect. Having enquired for the King, he intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himself into the prease, passing thorow till he came to
him, with a clownish simplicity, leaning over the Canons
Seat where the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate, Sir (said he) I am sent hither to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you for this time to delay your expedition, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
no farther in your intended journey: for if you do, ye
shall not prosper in your enterprize, nor any of your follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.
I am farther charged to warn you, if ye be so refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
as to go forward. not to use the acquaintance, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or counsel of Women, as ye tender your honour, life
and estate.</p>
            <p>After this warning he withdrew himself back again, into
the prease; when service was ended, the King enquired
earnestly, for him, but he could no where be found, neither
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51978:85"/>
could any of the Standers by (of whom diverse did nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
observe him, meaning afterwards to have discoursed
further with him) feel or perceive how, when, or where
he passed from them: having as it were vanished in their
hands.</p>
            <p>After his Army had mustered in the Borrow-moor of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi>
(a field then spacious and delightful by the shades of
many stately and aged Oaks) about the midst of the Night
there is a Proclamation heard at the Market Cross of the
Town, summoning a great many Burgesses, Gentlemen, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
Noblemen to appear within fourty daies before the
Tribunal of one <hi>Plot-Cock;</hi> the Provost of the Town in his
Timber Gallery having heard his own Name cited, cried out
that he declined that Judicatory and appeal'd to the mercy of
God almighty.</p>
            <p>Nothing was the King moved with those advertisements,
thinking them Scenick pieces acted by those who hated the
<hi>French</hi> and favoured the <hi>English</hi> faction: being so boldly
and to the life personated that they appalled and stroke with
fear ordinary and vulgar judgements, as Trage-Comedies of
Spirits. The Earl of <hi>Anguss</hi> disswaded him from that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and many of the most reverend Church-men, but
the Angel which most conjured him was <hi>Margarite</hi> his Queen
who at that time was with child; her tears and prayers shook
the strongest beams of his Resolutions. She had acquainted
him with the Visions and affrightments of her sleep; that
her Chains and Armelets appeared to be turned into Pearls;
she had seen him fall from a great Precipice; She had lost one
of her eyes. When he had answered these were but Dreams,
arising from the many thoughts and cares of the Day, but it
is no Dream (saith she) that ye have but one Son, and him a
a weakling; if otherwaies than well happen unto you, what
a lamentable day will that be, when ye shall leave behind
you, to so tender and weak a Successour, under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a woman, for inheritance, a miserable and bloody
war? It is no dream that ye are to fight a mighty people;
now turned insolent by their riches at home and power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
that your Nobilitie are indigent ye know, and may
be brib'd to leave you in your greatest danger. What a folly,
what a blindness is it to make this war yours, and to quench
the fire in your Neighbours house of <hi>France,</hi> to kindle and
burn up your own in <hi>Scotland?</hi> ye have no such reason to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the <hi>French,</hi> as ye have to keep your promises to <hi>England,</hi>
and enjoy a Peace at home. Though the <hi>English</hi> should make
a conquest of <hi>France,</hi> will they take your Crown, or disin

               </gap> their own r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce, this is even as the left hand would cut
off the right? Should the Letters of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> (a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51978:85"/>
woman twice married (the first half in Adultery, the last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Incest) whom ye did never nor shall ever see) prove
more powerful with you, than the cryes of your little Son,
and mine, than the tears, complaints, curses of the Orphans
and Widdows which ye are to make? If ye will go, suffer
me to accompany you; it may be my Countrey-men prove
more kind towards me than they will to you; and for my
sake yield unto a Peace. I hear the Queen my Sister will be
with the Army in her husbands absence; if we shall meet,
who knowes what God by our means may bring to pass.</p>
            <p>The King answered all her complaints with a speedy march
which he made over the <hi>Tweed:</hi> not staying till the whole
forces came to him, which were arising and prepared.</p>
            <p>The twenty two of <hi>August</hi> comming into <hi>England</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
neer the water of <hi>Twisel</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> where at
<hi>Twisel-haugh</hi> he made an Act, that if any man were slain or
hurt to death by the <hi>English,</hi> during the time of his aboade
in <hi>England.</hi> his heirs should have his Ward, Relief and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
<hi>Norham, Wark, Foord, Eatel,</hi> are taken and cast
down. Amidst this hostility the Lady <hi>Foord</hi> (a noble
Captive) was brought in a pitty-pleading manner, with her
daughter (a Maid of excellent beauty) to the Camp. Not
without the Earl of <hi>Surreys</hi> direction, as many supposed, for
they have a vigorous Prince and his Son (though natural by
the gifts of Nature and Education above many lawful) to
try the Magick of their eloquence and beauty upon. The
King delighting in their Company, not only hearkeneth to
the discourse of the Mother, but giveth way to her counsel:
which was, if she should be dismissed, to send him true and
certain intelligence of what the <hi>English</hi> would attempt, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her way to their Camp: but in effect proved the winning
of time to the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the losing of occasion to
him. Her few daies stay bred in him a kind of carlessnesse,
sloath, procastination and delay, a neglect, and as it were
a forgetfnlness of his Army and business: eighten daiestary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>England,</hi> in a Territory not very fertile, had consum'd
much provision, the Souldiers began to want necessaries, a
number in the night by blind pathes returned to their own
Countrey. In a short time only the Noblemen and their
Vassals attended the King. These request him not to spend
more time on that barren Soyl, but to turn their Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Berwick,</hi> which Town was of more importance, than
all the Hamle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and poor Villages of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> neither
was it impregnable or diffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le to be taken, the Town and
Castle being no waies provided and furnished to endure a
siege. The Courtiours move the King to continue the belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guering
of <hi>Berwick</hi> till their comming back: which would
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51978:86"/>
be an easie conquest <hi>Northumberland</hi> once forrag'd, in absence
of the bravest of the <hi>English</hi> then in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest the Army languished, and the King spent time a
<hi>Foord,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> directeth an Herauld to his Camp,
requiring him either to leave off the invasion of his Masters
Countrey, and turn back giving satisfaction for wrongs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
or that he would appoint a day and place wherein
all differences might be ended by the Sword. This Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
being advised in Counsel, most voices were that they
should return home, and not with so small number as rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hip
with <hi>France;</hi> why should a few Souldiers, and these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
tired out by forcing of Strengths, throwing down Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
be hazarded against such multitudes of the <hi>English,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
lately and encreased with fresh Auxiliaries? <hi>Thomas
Howard</hi> Admiral, a Son of the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> having new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought with him to <hi>New Castle</hi> out of the Army lying in
<hi>France</hi> five thousand men, and one thousand tall Sea men. If
they should return Home, the <hi>English</hi> Army could not but
disband, and not conveniently this year be gathered again,
consisting of men levied from far and distant Places. Again
if they should be engaged to come to a Battail; their own
Countrey, being fields to them well known, would prove
more commodious and secure to fight upon than <hi>English</hi>
ground, besides the opportunity of furnishing and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Camp with all necessaries at less charges. The <hi>French</hi>
Embassadour and others of his faction remonstrate to the
King, what a shameful retreit he would make, if at the
desire of the Enemy he returned, and without the hazard of a
Battel, being so neer unto him; that by fighting in <hi>England,</hi>
he kept his own Couvtrey unforraged; and consum'd the
Provision of his Enemy which at last would weaken his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
That for contentment to both Armies, <hi>Islay</hi> a <hi>Scottish</hi>
Herauld should return with <hi>Rouge-Cross</hi> the <hi>English,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
upon a day, promising them the mean time tarrying
and aboad till the righteousness of the cause were decided in
a Battel.</p>
            <p>The set and appointed Day by the Heraulds in which the
two Armies should have joined being come and the <hi>English</hi> not
appearing, nor any from them: The Nobility again resort
to the King; show how by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light of the Enemy matters
were prolonged from one day to another: the <hi>English</hi> forces
daily encreasing, whilst the <hi>Scottish</hi> wear away and waxed
fewer: that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light should be opposed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lights; the day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by the Heraulds not being kept, it would be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to them to turn home without battel, or if retiring,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51978:86"/>
to fight upon their own ground. If this counsel pleased him
not, but that he would there give them battel, The next
was to study all advantages for victory, either by stratagem,
or the odds and furtherance of the Place of fight; Where the
<hi>Chiviot</hi> hills decline towards the plainer fields arising behind
them with high tops with best Ordnance should be fortified;
the water of <hi>Till</hi> running deep and foord-less upon the right
hand, and but passable at the Bridge, the first Companies
of the enemy being passed, before they could be relieved
and succoured by their followers, the Bridge by the Artile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
should be beaten down, and the enemy charged when they
began to pass the Water.</p>
            <p>The King, impatient of Counsel, answered, though their
number encreased to as many more as they were, he with
that remainder of his Army would fight them. That ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
were to be imbraced according to the occasion of
the fight without tedious deliberation, if any man was afraid
he might if he pleased return Home. A strange Resolution
in a Prince, who imagined every man in his Army to have
the same strength, courage, boldness and resolution with
himself.</p>
            <p>This answer astonished the Nobility, and since they could
not perswade him to a fair retreat, but that he will fight and
that without the advantage of the Bridge, being inferiour
in number to the <hi>English</hi> (for they were reckoned by the
Scouts fix and twenty thousand) they fortify themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Commoditie of the Hill where they lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
with a resolution not to suffer the King to hazard
his person in the battel. If victory should incline to them,
their Gains were but smal and Glory less, extending but
over some few of the Nobility, and a small parcel of the
Body of the State of <hi>England,</hi> a number of yeomen, and
pressed Horsemen, the flower of the Kingdom being in
<hi>France.</hi> But if they were overthrown, theirloss would prove
unco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable, yea unspekable, a martial yong <hi>King</hi> either k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l'd,
taken or put to flight; wherfore they think it fitting, not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
the King be pleased with so many as either chance or
election might separate with him, to be a Spectator of the
fortune of the day. To this the King replyed, he neither
wanted ability to discharge the part of a Souldier, nor wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to command as a General, and to outlive so many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
Countrey-men would be more terrible to him than
death it self. When forced to give way for his personall
presence in the field; they appoint some to be arraied in
like furniture of Arms and a like Guard as the King; Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
to per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onate him in sundry quarters of the field, that
the enemy should not set one man as their chief mark to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51978:87"/>
invade, from whose death the victory and conclusion of the
war might depend: and if the King should fall, the Army
should not lose courage, nor be brought to believe he were
lost, so long as they saw a General with his Coignoscance
and Guard present and neer them to be a witness of their
valour and atchievements, as not long before at the battel of
<hi>Fornou</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> had been practiced by the <hi>French</hi> to their king
<hi>Charles</hi> the eight.</p>
            <p>By this time the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> with the power of the <hi>North</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> was come within three miles of the Place where
the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army was encamped, and perceiving he could
not but with great disadvantage fight them; he sendeth an
Herauld requiring the King to come forth of his strength to
some indifferent ground, where he would be ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
him. The King being forward to condescend to this
request, the Lords cryed out, it was madness to accept of
opportunity of fighting from his Enemies, and to set all at
a main chance according to their appointment, it being their
advantage to prolong time, and trifle with him, in whose
Camp there was already scarcity of victuals, which ere long
might put him to such a stand, that he should not know well
what to do. Neither was it likely he could be furnished
from the inner parts of the Countrey, by reason of the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersom
waies for carriage to pass, after the falling of so
great and continued rains, and the softning of the Ground;
that by sitting still, and committing nothing to Fortune, he
might have his enemy at his pleasure; if they dared assail
him at their perils be it. He lacked nothing but patience to be
victorious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> keeping their Trenches, the earl essayeth to
draw them out, and the ninth of <hi>September</hi> removing his
Camp marcheth towards the same Hill of <hi>Flowden</hi> where they
lay encamped; his Vant-guard with the Cannon passeth the
water of <hi>Till at Twysel</hi> bridge, the Reer-ward going over at
<hi>Mylnfoord.</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> seeing them pass the water imagineth
they meant to win a Hill between his Camp and them; To
prevent which (setting fire to the Cab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nes raised of boughs
of Trees and Reeds) he removeth to another Hill, before
the <hi>English</hi> could observe his motion, the smoak darkning
the aire between the two Armies. Whilst the <hi>Scottish</hi> Army
was removing the <hi>English</hi> advance to the foot of <hi>Flowden</hi> hill,
by which they have double advantage, the <hi>Scottish</hi> ordinance
could not much annoy them, they marching upwards and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the level thereof, again by their shot they might easily
gall their enemies as they came downwards upon them.</p>
            <p>The fatal hour of the Battel approaching the <hi>English</hi> draw
up in good order six and twenty thousand men (some write
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51978:87"/>
thirty) in two Battails any of which was equall in number
to the whole <hi>Scottish</hi> Army. <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Admirall
had the Vant-guard, of which Sir <hi>Edmond Howard</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
led one of the wings, and Sir <hi>Marmuduke Constable</hi> the
other; The Lords <hi>Dacres</hi> and <hi>Cliffoord,</hi> with Sir <hi>Edward Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
kept the Rear: the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> with <hi>Latymer Scroop,</hi>

marshal themselves in four, three of which should enter in

right wing of the Van; the Earls of <hi>Crawford</hi> and <hi>Montross</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Divers diversly report of the Fortune of the King; We
without affirming any thing for certain, shall onely set down
what Fame hath published, a false Witness often of human
accidents, and which many times by malignant brains is
forged, and by more malignant ears received and believed.
The <hi>English</hi> hold that he was killed in this Battail; the <hi>Scots</hi>
that many in like Arms with the like Guards, were killed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one of which was held for the King: Amongst others
<hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Elphinstoun</hi> his Favourite, who had marryed
<hi>Elizabeth Barley</hi> one of the Dames of Honour of Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garite;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a man not unlike to the King in face and stature,
and representing him in arms in the field, with the valiantest
and most couragious of the Army fought it out, and acting
heroically his part, as a King was killed, heaps of slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
bodies environing his. In the search where the fight was,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51978:88"/>
the number, taleness, furniture of the dead bodies being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
their faces and wounds viewed, his body, as if it
breathed yet majesty, was amidst the others selected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for his Maisters, brought to <hi>Berwick</hi> and embal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
That it was not the body of the King, the girdle of
Iron which heever wore, and then was not found about him,
gave some, though not certain, testimony.</p>
            <p>Some have recorded that the fortune of the day inclining
to the <hi>English,</hi> four tall men mounted upon lusty Horses, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upon the points of their Launces, for coignoscances,
Streamers of Straw, mounting the King on a Sorrel Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
convoyed him far from the place of fight, and that he
was seen beyond the <hi>Tweed,</hi> between <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lso</hi> and <hi>Dunce.</hi> After
which what became of him was uncertain. Many hold he
was killed in the Castle of <hi>Hume,</hi> either by the intelligence
between the <hi>English</hi> and the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> kinred, or out of
fear (for they were at the slaughter of the Kings Father and
the most violent in that fight) or of hopes of great fortunes,
which would follow innovations, and the confusion of the
State, being men who liv'd best in a troubl'd Common wealth
and upon the Borders.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Carra</hi> follower of the Lord <hi>Humes,</hi> that same night
the Battail was fought, thrust the Abbot of <hi>Kelso</hi> out of his
Abbacy: which he never durst attempt the King being alive.
Another, <hi>David carbreath</hi> in the time of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Governour
vaunted that however <hi>Iohn</hi> wronged the <hi>Humes,</hi> he was one
of fix who had abated the insolency of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and
brought him to know he was a Mortal. To these is added,
that the Governour <hi>Iohn,</hi> not long hereafter, cut off the
heads of the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> and his Brother without any known
great cause. The Common people (ever more addicted to
superstition than verity) believed he was living, and had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over the Seas, and according to his promise visited the
holy Sepulchre in <hi>Palestine.</hi> Therefor his other offences and
the bearing of Arms against his Father, in prayers and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
he spent the remainder of His tedious daies.</p>
            <p>That he would return again when he found opportunity,
and the necessity of <hi>Europe</hi> requird him. This report was of as
great truth, as that which the <hi>Burgundians</hi> have of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of their Duke <hi>Charles</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Nancy,</hi> most
of them believing he escaped from the conflict. He was
lost the twenty and five year of his Reign, the thirty and
ninth of his age the ninth of <hi>September 1513.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This King was of a vigorous body, his stature being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too tall nor too low, of a pleasant countenance, of a
pregnant wit; but by the faults of the times in which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not polished with Letters. He excelled in horse-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51978:89"/>
fencing and shooting. By much watching, slender diet,
and use, he was enabled to endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e all extremities of weather,
scarcity or want of rest, with good health of body.</p>
            <p>He was just in giving judgement, in punishing malefactors
severe, yet tractable and moderate. With the peril of some
few he restrained vices and rather shook the Sword than
struck with it. He knew there were some things, though
Princes might, yet they ought not to do. He was easie of
access. most courteous in speech, and meek in answering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man. He was so far from being over taken with anger
or other violent perturbations, that he was never observed
to have given an evil or disobliging word to any, or that the
colour of his face changed by any offence offered him, or
informations given him, relying without passion upon his
own magnanimity.</p>
            <p>He was of a free and liberal disposition, far from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation.
As he understood well the Art of giving, so to
acquire and purchase he was not sufficient of himself, but
made use of men who drew more hatred upon their own
heads, than moneys into their Princes coffers.</p>
            <p>Though he delighted more in War than the Arts, he was
a great admirer and advancer of learned men. <hi>William El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinstoun</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> builded by his Liberality the
College of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and named it The Kings College, by
reason of those Privileges and Rents the King bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>His Generosity did shew it self in not delivering of
<hi>Perkin Warbeck;</hi> he trusted much, and had great confidence
in his Nobility, and governed by love not by fear his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder amidst so much worth, that some humane
frailty, and some according discord be found. There is no
day so bright and fair, which one moment or other looketh
not pale, and remaineth not with some dampish shadow of
discoloured Clouds. He was somwhat wedded to his own
humours, opiniative and rash; <hi>Actions of rashness and timeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
even although they may have an happy event, being never
praise worthy in a Prince. He was so infected with that illustrious
crime which the Ambitious take for virtue, desire of Fame, that
be preferred it to his own life, and the peace of his Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He so affected popularity, and endeavoured to purchase
the love of his people, by Largesses, Banquetting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other
Magnificence, diving in debt, that by those Subsidies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns which of necessity he should have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to have levied and squeized from the people, longer
life had made him lose all that favor and love he had so pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
purchased, that death seemed to have come to him wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedly
and in good time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51978:89"/>
The wedding of others Quarrels, especially of the <hi>French,</hi>
seemeth in him inexcusable; a wise Prince should be slow
and loath to engage himself in a war, although he hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
some wrong. He should consider that of all humane
actions and hazards, there is not one of which the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is so dangerous, as that of beginning and undertaking
a war. Neither in humane affairs should there more depths
be founded nor hidden passages searched and pryed into than
in this. He should remember that besides the sad necessity
which is inseparable from the most innocent war (the wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and destroying of the goods and lives of much people)
there is nothing of which the Revolutions and Changes are
more inconstant, and the conclusions and ends more uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Sea is not more treacherous, false and deceiving, nor
changeth not more swiftly her calms into storms than wars
and the fortune of arms do, the event and success belying the
beginning. It is not enough that a Prince know a war which
he undertaketh to be just, but he should consider also if it
be necessary, and if it be profitable, and conduce to the State
which he governeth.</p>
            <p>As men of strong and healthful bodies follow ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delight in their youth, he was amourously carryed away.
He confined the Earl of <hi>Anguss</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Arran,</hi> for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Iane Kennedy</hi> a Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Cassilles</hi> out of
<hi>Galloway,</hi> a fair and noble Lady, of whom he became ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
as he went in his pilgrimage to <hi>St. Ninians.</hi> In his
last expedition the Lady <hi>Foord</hi> was thought to have hindered
the progress of his arms, and hasten'd the success of the battel.</p>
            <p>Though virtue be sometimes unfortunate, yet is it ever in
an high esteem in the memories of men: such a desire remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him in the hearts of his people after his loss, that the
like was not of any King before him; Princes who are out
of this life being onely the Delights and Darlings of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Anne</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queen not many dayes out-lived the
rumour of his death. He serves for an example of the frailty
of great men on the Theatre of this world, and of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of all Sub-Lunary things.</p>
            <p>He had children, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> who dyed Infants,
<hi>Iames</hi> who succeeded him, <hi>Alexander</hi> born after his death who
dyed young; <hi>Alexander</hi> a natural son, Arch-Bishop of <hi>Saint

of a Daughter of the Lord <hi>Drummonds,</hi> maried to the Earl
of <hi>Huntley,</hi> whose mother had been contracted to the King,
and taken away (to his great regret) by those who governed
the State, that he should not follow the example of King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>

the Protection of the Realm and Tutelage of her Son,

as well out of a Religion they had to fulfill the will of their deceased Soveraign, as to shun and be freed of the imminent arms and imminent danger of her Brother

remnant subdivideth, after these jars of the Church men,
which were cherished by the Nobility, the Nobles began to
jar among themselves, and grudge at others preferments.
<hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> ruled and commanded the Countreys
north-ward the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Hume</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped
almost a royal Authority, and commanded over the
Countreys on South-side of the <hi>Forth,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Anguss</hi>

            <p>Iames Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> Lord <hi>Hamiltown</hi> being neerest in blood
to the King, could not but wit indignation look upon the

            <p>Amidst these confusions these confusion the Queen in <hi>April</hi> brought forth

of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> baptized and named <hi>Alexander.</hi> After she was

she found the authority of her place was turned weak, and

people delighting to live rather without rule and in all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
than to be subject to the obedience of a Woman
though a Queen. After great deliberation and many essays in
vain to curb their insolency and vindicate her authority from
their contempt, as also to save her son from the dangers of
an insulting Nobility, and settle her estate, she resolved to
match with some Nobleman eminent in power and worth,
who could and would protect her and hers in greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
Amongst the choise of the young Noblemen of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for a long succession of renowned Auncestors, comely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of person, nobleconversation, prudence in affairs of
State, being lovely, courteous, liberal wise, none was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Earl of <hi>Anguss;</hi> him she determines to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without acquanting her Brother the King of <hi>England,</hi> or
the Nobles of the Kingdom with her design, she afterwards
marryeth him, transferring, if she could, the whole weight
of the Kingdom and the rains of the Government of the
State into his hands, having no more freedom in her own
determinations.</p>
            <p>No sooner was this revealed to the World, when the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry divided into two Factions, one adhering
to the <hi>Dowglass,</hi> in whom kindred, friendship long obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance had bred hopes of benefit and preferment; another
of such whom envy of his greatness and advancement had
made hungrey of change. The first would have the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
continued in the Queens person and Her husbands:
because hereby the Realm should still have peace with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which at that time was the most necessary point to be
respected. The adverse party, of which the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain was the principal, who was a man both in Power,
Parentage, Riches equal, if not beyond, to many of the
great men of the Countrey, importuned the election of a
new Governour and Protectour of the young King. The
Queen loosing by her marriage both the tutelage of her Son
and the Government, should not take it to heart that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were chosen and put in her place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:51978:92"/>
Her marrying the Earl of <hi>Anguss</hi> had made him too great
already to be a Subject; the continuing of her in Authority
would promote him to the greatness of a Prince. Who
should be Governour, is upon both sides long and coutenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
argued. Many gave their voices for the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi>
as being neer in blood to the King, and a man affecting
peace more than others, and every way sufficient for such a
Charge. The Chamber lain had determined of another, and
told it was a wrong to bar from so high an honour a man of
the Masculine line in blood to the King, and prefer one of
the feminine. <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> son to <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke
of <hi>Albany,</hi> the Brother of King <hi>Iames</hi> the third, before all
others by all reason should be preferred to the Government.
Being demanded if he would the first, to give example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, set his hand to this election, he without pawsing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, with a protestation, that though the rest of the
Nobility opposed it, as to his comming into <hi>Scotland</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Government, he alone would go to <hi>France,</hi> charge
him with it, be his Convoy hither, and maintain his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>This he was thought to have done, for that despairing to
reach and obtain this Dignity himself, out of emulation he
laid a design that never any other of the Nobles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
should reach it: affecting rather to give a stranger the
place than a Competitor, bringing in the <hi>French</hi> to equal the
ballance as principal, himself only as accessory, nothing
doubting of a chief place in State, as well for his forwardness
in this election as for the necessity of his Service which the
<hi>French</hi> could not well want, and should never be lacking. He
feared aslo if the faction of the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> prevail'd, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Earl of <hi>Anguss</hi> would be an umbrage to his, and
lessen and impair it; Their Lands and Fortunes lying neer to

            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> had sent a Letter to the Lords of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(as he had done to the <hi>French</hi> King for that same effect)
remonstrating how dangerous it was for the State of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and young King, if they should make choise of the
Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding of all which through ambition, malice,
envy of others, discords amongst themselves, they made
choise of this Gentleman, a stranger by his education and
birth, ignorant of the nature and manners of the <hi>Scots:</hi>
whose Father was banished for Treason against his Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and dyed unrestored. One altogether devoted to the <hi>French</hi>
King, and an enemy to the <hi>English;</hi> not caring to keep the
Countrey of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Warrs and Troubles, so he might

defend the <hi>French</hi> Nation, by making the <hi>Scots</hi> fight their
battels.</p>
            <p>After many private Letters from his Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi>
(especially from the Chamberlin) inviting him to come

               </hi> In the Parlament which had been porogued
for his comming, the Duke accepted the Government, and
gave his oath of fidelity to the King and Countrey: and the
three Estates gave their oath of obedience to him, and both
swore in the administration of Justice, neither should be

being of a subtle wind, malitious, crafty, rich and endued
with some Courtly eloquence, by a counterfeit Pretence of
knowledge of the affairs of the Kingdom and State (neither
in some things did he err) at first being very familiar with
the Duke and in a little time after, by bribing secretly some
of his choise Servants, turned his only Privado, and almost
possessed alone his judgement and ear. He informed
him of the strength and Riches of the Countrey, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

many secrets of the Government. He gave him a Catalogue

at that time would either be cuto off, or kept under, but with
such cunning and dexterity that it should not be perceived,

Government.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Anguss,</hi> a man in the prime of his youth, of
high flying thoughts by his Alliance with the King of <hi>England,</hi>
and that estimaion the people conceived of him by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits
of his Ancesters, and the singular love the Subjects
bare him, carryed a mind above the fortune of a private man,
and seemed not born to live a subjects life, each action of his
bearing in it majesty and magnificence, he had power to hurt
if he would hurt.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chamberlain, a man unpolisht, stubbornly stout,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rdous, mighty in riches and power, and consequently
proud, of a working mind and vehement Spirit, whom time

him as his Legateship, pluralty of benefices, many

him by his present treasure, he could make a weak par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
strong, and add weight to what side soever he inclined.
He was therefore with piercing eyes to be lookt into, and all
his actions and waies to be observed.</p>
            <p>The Governour gave not great attention to what the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
had instructed against the Arch-Bishop, having before
had some inkling of the rancor, grudge and enmitie between
them. And he was conscious the Arch-Bishops riches were
above envy; he having been even more solicitous magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
to spend what he had acquired than hoord up. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he bestow so much upon any of his Countreymen,
as he did upon the <hi>French,</hi> the Friends and Servants of the

away with his private delights and Courtly pleasures.</p>
            <p>But what the Priour informed against the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
he deeply ingraved in his memory, and ever after his
countenance bewrayed certain flaws of ill concealed discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
Neither did he thereafter shew him wounted favours,
which the Chamberlain observing and guessing at the change
of the Governors mind towards him by more than ordinary
evidences and signs: He having been the onely man who
wrought his advancement and comming to <hi>Scotland,</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
now either forgot or ungratefully remembred, full of
grief and disdain, retired from the Court to his own Castles,
where, when he had rested a while, half astonished to see his
hopes so frustrate, he taketh new resolutions and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations

he leaveth no meanes untryed to become entire with the
Queen and her Husband, and by observance and frequent
meeting with them, he wrought himself not onely to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced

they had great confidence. He many times with them deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Lords, who by turns interchangeably should attend the two
Princes and have a care of their education. That no violence

Here with an unexspected suddenness, M. <hi>Gaven Dowglas</hi>
Uncle to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Dunkel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Secretary to the late King, were committed. Mr <hi>Gaven</hi>
in the Castle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in <hi>Garvet</hi> Castle.
The Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> grand-Father to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beaten a Lyon Herault, who too imperiously had given
a charge to answer such things should be objected against
him, was imprisoned in the Castle of <hi>Blackness. Alexander</hi>
Lord <hi>Hume</hi> being charged to answer for his actions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and not appearing, was denounced Rebel, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables
seised on and brought to the Exchequer. Stir'd up
and irritated by this outrage, he maketh Roads upon the
neighbour bounds, plundereth <hi>Dumbar</hi> which was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
chief resort, and to revenge his wrongs, setteth on
work the Robbers on the borders. To repress and bridle this
ravaging, the Governor in person with a thousand hardy
Souldiers marcheth to the Borders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directeth some companies
to find out the Lord <hi>Hume;</hi> but he, either dismaid at the
worth and fortune of the Governor, or broken and bowing
under the burthen of his won miseries, commeth to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
and submitted his life and estate to his faith and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency:
brought to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he is trusted to the custody of
<hi>Iames</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> the Husband of his Sister, with threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
under pain of High Treason, that he should not part
with him, nor suffer him to escape. The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> had not
long staid in the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> when with glosses of
probalityes of changes casual, and such as might fall forth,
he moved the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> to be of his Mind, and brought
him to conspire against the Governor, and hazard to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his place of State. He himself was the only man who had
brought in the Governor, and he knew well how to put him
out, if the Earl would be of the Party, and by his negligence
nor reject a Supream honor thrown in his arms. He is begun
already not to be lov'd, if he was not already hated by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

could find some few Noblemen to make head against him, he
would constrain him to leave the Country. The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>
was neerest heir to the King, it was more reason he should be
second in the Kingdom than <hi>Iohn,</hi> who though descended of a
brother, yet a banisht man, and a stranger to the <hi>Scots</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51978:96"/>

of language. After many such like imducements, the
Prisoner took away his Keeper with him to the South parts of
the Country: and both by Letters to their Familiar, Kinred,
and acquaintance, and private meetings with other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
strove to make strong and increase their faction.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Spring <hi>Iohn Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi>
the Sisters son of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> listed himself in the party
of the conspiring Lords, and with a number of his Friends
and Followers invested the Castle of <hi>Galsgow;</hi> which if they
could have kept, had been a great advancement to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.
But the Governor gathering an Army of as many as
hast would suffer him to assemble, the Defenders not being
strong enough to resist him, recovered the Castle with small
loss of his men. After which in indignation he marched to
throw down the Castle of <hi>Hamilton;</hi> here victorious anger was
conquer'd by pitty and compassion: for the old Countess of
<hi>Arran</hi> being at that time there resident (who was daughter to
King <hi>Iames</hi> the second, Sister to King <hi>Iames</hi> the third, mother
to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Grand-mother to the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi>
Aunt to the Governour) a Lady venerable for years and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
with tears of affection and sorrow falling down at the
Governors feet, and received by him with great commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in a merciful manner, not only preserv'd the Castle, but
by the means of the Arch-bishop <hi>Andrew Forman,</hi> entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Treaty for peace to her Son, and the Earl of <hi>Lennox.</hi>
And in <hi>November</hi> the two Earls comming to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by the
means of this <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> were reconciled with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
About this time (his Mother being far from him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the last duties of affection towards him) <hi>Alexander</hi>

his Brother to the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Mark Car</hi> in <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet</hi>

many of the <hi>Humes and Cockburns</hi> Fugitives for this

number of Souldiers, and some great Ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
the Castles of <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Langtoun,</hi> and had them ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to his mercy.</p>
            <p>When the accident of Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey</hi> was noised at the
Court of <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> is recorded to have said he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
looked for better at the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that the
Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> should have deputed men of their own nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to have governed them, and not a stranger, being a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
delighting in Misgovernment, ever well pleased at the
Falls and tragical ends of their Rulers, and joying to see
any hard hap happen to them they deem happy.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Dunkell</hi> who had accompanied the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to <hi>France,</hi> used such diligence at the Court, that he was
imployed to be the first Messenger to the Countrey of the
great promises and many Ceremonies of the <hi>French,</hi> at the
confirmation of the League, with their protestations for the
preserving and maintaining the Liberties of the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> against all who would essay to impair them. Not long
after arrived the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> and an Herauld with Letters
from Kiug <hi>Francis</hi> and the Governour, amplifying and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a larger gloss on the same. But when by other Letters
the Queen and Nobles had received certain intelligence that
King <hi>Francis</hi> and the King of <hi>England</hi> had composed their
Quarrels, entred in a new band of Amity, a defensive League
being p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssed between them, <hi>Tournay</hi> rendred to the <hi>French,</hi>
promises upon either sidesolemnly made for a Match to be
between the Daulphine of <hi>France,</hi> eldest son to King <hi>Francis,</hi>
and the eldest daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> when age
should enable them for marriage; and that in the large Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Peace, not one word was set down for the quietness
and help of those who for the quarrel of <hi>France</hi> hast lost their
King, and endangered their whole Kingdom; no care had
of their welfare and prosperity, they stormed not a little,
and thought their lives and travels evil imployed. Then with
as great hast as such a matter required they dispatched Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
back again to the Governor blotted with complaints and
expostulations. The year following to excuse his oversight,
the <hi>French</hi> King sent a <hi>Reason</hi> why he had not made mention of
the <hi>Scotish</hi> nation in his league with <hi>England,</hi> He had studied to
give satisfaction to some of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nobility (obliquely
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51978:99"/>
touching the Duke of <hi>Albany)</hi> whole minds he knew to be
altogether averse from any peace or Truce with the <hi>English</hi>
nation; whose undaunted Spirits and great courages were
only bent to revenge ther deaths of their King, Kinsmen and
Compatriots. This evasion not giving satisfaction to the best
advised of the Council, the <hi>French</hi> King interposed his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
with King <hi>Henry</hi> to have a cessation of arms for as
short a time as he could devise. V V herupon <hi>Clarencieux</hi> and
onela <hi>Fiot,</hi> comming to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the one from the king of
<hi>England,</hi> the other from the <hi>French</hi> King, a Truce was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
between the two Kingdoms for one year and a whole
day. The reason of this Truce was thought mostly to be for
that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the next Summer, were to
have an interview, and with all Princely courtesies entertain
each other.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom began to be sensible of the absence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
factions increasing, the Commons suffering dayly
outrages, the Nobility and Gentry deciding their Rights by
their Swords. The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Rothsay</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lindsay</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
which should be Sheriff of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> with tumultuary
arms invade each other, and hardly by the Deputies were
restrain'd, till the one was committed to the Castle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi>
and the other to the Castle of <hi>Dumbartoun, Robert Blackadour</hi>
Priour of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> with fix of his Domestick Servants, is

that the plague was in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> being transported to
the Castle of <hi>Dalkieth</hi> by the Convoy of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi>
who was then Provost of the Town: it being the season
when the Townsmen make election of their Magistrates for
the year following; when the Earl was returned and sought
to enter the Town, he found the Gates shut upon him by
the Citizens, who alleged he came to invade their liberties
in the free choise of their Magistrates: the tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the most part of the night, and the next morning early
the people dividing infactions, and skirmishing in the streets,
a Deacon of the <hi>Crafts</hi> is killed by the faction of the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
which alienated the minds of the Townsmen altogether

of <hi>Arran</hi> supported and sided those who had any discontent

of <hi>Farnhast, Sir James Hamilton</hi> the natural Son of the Earl of
<hi>Arran</hi> assisted the Laird of <hi>Farnhast;</hi> and besides those who out
of good will, friendship, kinred, vassalage, did follow him,
he gathered fourty Souldiers such as were found upon the
Borders, men living upon Spoil and rapine, to be of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Laird of <hi>Cesfoord</hi> (then Warden of the Marches)
who with his Counsel and Force sided the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> at

him, and his fourty Hirelings abandoning him in

brought to make use of his spurs towards the Castle of <hi>Hume,</hi>
where after a long chase he got Sanctuary. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Laird of <hi>Farnehast</hi> held a Court in the Town of <hi>Ied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi>
as Baily to the Earl of <hi>Augus,</hi> and the Earl himself
kept his Court three miles distant in <hi>Ied-ward</hi> Forrest. In
the moneth of <hi>May</hi> after, certain Noblemen assembled at
<hi>Edenburgh</hi> to accommodate all quarrels, and make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> and <hi>Hamiltons.</hi> Many Lords
of the West here meet, attending the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> the
Earls of <hi>Lennox, Eglintoun, Cassiles,</hi> the Lords <hi>Ross, Simple,</hi>
the <hi>Bishop of Galloway, Abbot of Pasley.</hi> The <hi>provost</hi> of the
Town of <hi>Edenburgh Archembald Dowglas of Kilspyndie,</hi> Uncle
or Couses Germain to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> yielded up his
place to <hi>Robert Logan</hi> Laird of <hi>Restlerig.</hi> The Lords of the
West by the advice of <hi>Iames Beatoun</hi> Chancelour (in whose
House they often assembled) laid a plot to surprize the Earl
of <hi>Angus,</hi> then attended but by some few of his Friends and as
it were solitary. They thought him to great and insolent a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
to whose power never one of theirs alone, was equal in all
points, and they had many things to chalenge him upon when
the Governor should return. The Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> forewarned
of their intention, imployed the Bishop of <hi>Dunkell</hi> his Uncle
to offer them what honourable satisfaction they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
All that he propounded being rejected by implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men, and finding the only way to be freed of violence,
to be violence, and that danger could not be avoyded but
by a greater danger, with an hundred hardy resolute men
armed with long Spears and Pikes, which the Citizens as he
traversed the Streets, out of Windows furnished him, he
invested a part of the Town, and barricadoed some Lanes
with Carts and other impediments which the time did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.
The adverse party trusting go their number, and the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51978:100"/>
supply of the Citizens (who calling to mind the slaughter of
their Deacon, shew them small favour) disdaining the Earl
should thus muster on the Streets, in great fury invade
him. Whilst the bickering continued, and the Town is in
a Tumult, <hi>William Dowglas</hi> brother to the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Sir
<hi>David Hume of Wedderburn, George Hume</hi> brother to the late
Lord, with many others by blood and Friendship tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
enter by violence the East Gate of the <hi>Town</hi> (the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
making small resistance) force their passage through
the throngs, seek the Earls enemies, find them, scoure the
streets of them. The Master of <hi>Montgomery</hi> eldest Sonne to
the Earl of <hi>Eglintoun,</hi> Sir <hi>Patrick Hamiltun,</hi> Brother to the
Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> with almost fourscour more are left dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place. The Earl himself findeth an escape and place
of retreat through a Marsh upon the North side of the Town;
The Chancelour and his retinue took Sanctuary in the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minican</hi>
Fryers; the tumult by the slaughter of some, and
flight of others appeased, the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> now freed of
danger, licensed all who pleased without further pursuit
peaceably to leave the Town of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and return to
their own Houses. Some daies after the <hi>Humes</hi> well banded
and backed with many Nobles and Gentlemen of their linage
by the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> consent, took the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> and his
brothers heads from the place where they had been fixt, and
with the funeral Rites of those times interr'd them in the
<hi>Black-Fryers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> having angled the peoples hearts by his
Magnificence, Wisdom, Courage and Liberality, his Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
began to bear greatest sway in the Kingdom. For the
continuance of which, the King of <hi>England</hi> dealt most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
with the <hi>French</hi> King to keep the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> still
in <hi>France</hi> with him. But the <hi>French</hi> had contrary designs. And
when the Duke understood the great discords of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> persons of Faction being advanced to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
dangerous immunities being granted to the Commons,
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> beginning to be tyred of their Peace,
and preparing for a new war: to curb the <hi>Scottish</hi> Factions,
keep the Nation in quietness in it self, by giving the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
other work abroad, whilst common danger should
break of particular discords. Notwithstanding of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Ships which lay in wait to take him, after he had been
about five years in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>November</hi> he arrived on the
west coasts of <hi>Scotland</hi> at a place named <hi>Garloch.</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
comming to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> set himself to amend the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities
committed in his absence; the Magistrates of the
Town are deposed, because in the late uproar they had been
evil seconds to the Lords of the west, when they went to

in <hi>February</hi> to be tryed, and to answer for offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

to seek a Pardon: which was obtained for them, but
with the condition that they should leave the Countrey, and
stay in <hi>France</hi> one whole year, which they obeyed. Others
have recorded they were surprized in the night, and in <hi>French</hi>
Ships conveyed privately away. <hi>Mr. Gaven Dowglas</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Dunkell,</hi> in the absence of his Nephew, finding the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
violent in the chase of the Faction of the <hi>Dowglasses,</hi>
fled privately to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> where he gave infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
to King <hi>Henry</hi> against him. <hi>He alone had taken to him
the custody of the young King, the sequel w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ereof he much feared;
he was an irreconciliable enemy to the whole Family of the</hi> Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses.
<hi>The principal cause of his comming to</hi> Scotland <hi>was to
engage the Nation in a War against</hi> England, <hi>that the</hi> English
<hi>Should not assist the Emperour against the</hi> French <hi>King, and make
his Nation slaves to</hi> France.</p>
            <p>This Bishop shortly after dyed at <hi>London,</hi> and was bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>savoy</hi> Church: having been a man noble, valiant,
learned, and an excellent Poet, as his works, yet extant, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> upon such informations sent <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieux</hi>
(King of Arms) to <hi>Scotland</hi> to require the Duke to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Country, according to the Articles agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>French</hi> King and him in their last truce.</p>
            <p>It belonged (<hi>said Clarencieux</hi>) to his Master to tender the life,
wellfare, honour, fortunes of his Nephew, of none of which he
could be assured so long as the Duke ruled and stayed in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
It was against all reason, and unbeseeming, the man should be sole
Guardian to a King, who was the next heir to the Crown: how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
might he be tempted by opportunity to commit the like unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cruelty which some have done in the like case both in England
and other parts of <hi>Europe?</hi> if he loved his Nation and Prince
(as he gave out) he required him to leave the Country, which if he
yield not unto, but obstinately continued in a re resolution to stay, he
denounced from his Master present war. <hi>He farther complained,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Governour answered</hi> Clarencieux, That what the Kings
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> agreed upon in their Treaties of Peace was
to him uncertain, but of this he was most certain, That neither the
King of <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>France</hi> had power to banish him (a Forainer
over whom their authority did not reach) his native country, like
over like having no jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>As concerning the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was yet young in years
he reverenced him as his soveraign Lord, and would keep and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
both him and his Kingdome according to his Conscience, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and bound duty; that there were ever more men in the world
who desired to be Kings, than there were Kingdomes to be bestowed
upon them, of which number he was none, having ever preferred a
mean estate justly enjoyed, before a Kingdome evil acquired. For
the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> he had used all Courtesies towards him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of his evil demerits, not for his own sake (he did confess)
but for the Queens sake, whom he honoured and respected as the
Mother of his Prince, and towards whom he should continue his
observance. That the King of <hi>England</hi> needed not misdoubt he
would attempt any thing should derogate from the honour of his
sister, that complements of meer curtesie in <hi>France,</hi> might be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
sometimes by <hi>English</hi> Ladies to be solicitations and suits of
Love.</p>
            <p>For the War, with which in case of his Stay, he threatned his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he would use his best endeavours to set his in a posture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>When this answer was reported to King <hi>Henry,</hi> he gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great Army to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> and essay if by their
own dangers the <hi>Scots</hi> people could be moved to abandon
and disclaim the Dukes authority. Seven great Ships came
to <hi>Inche-keeth</hi> and spoiled the adjacent Coasts: all the <hi>Scots</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> which did then inhabite <hi>London,</hi> and other places
of <hi>England,</hi> were put to their fines, and commanded to go
off the Countrey.</p>
            <p>In compensation and for equal amends, the <hi>French</hi> King
seized all <hi>English</hi> mens goods in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> imprisoned the
persons, and retained the money to be paid for the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Tournay.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> making incursions
on the Borders, burned the one half of <hi>Kelso,</hi> and plundered
the other.</p>
            <p>At this time the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth came to <hi>England,</hi>
and stirred King <hi>Henry</hi> to take arms against the <hi>French</hi> Kings
and the <hi>French</hi> had sent Embassadours to <hi>Scotland</hi> intreating
and conjuring the <hi>Scots</hi> by their old and new League to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
in arms and invade <hi>England.</hi> The Governour assembled
the three Estates at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which together condescended
to the raising of an Army to resist the incursions of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:51978:102"/>
and defend the Kingdom, to encourage every man for
fighting, the Wards of those which should fall in this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
were freely remitted and discharged by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
and pensions designed to the Widdows and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of those who dyed in this service. This Empyrick balm
could the <hi>French</hi> apply to cure the wounds of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> advancing (as was reported) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the west Borders, an Army was far gathered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
on <hi>Rosline-moor,</hi> which after, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
given, marched to <hi>Annandale</hi> and forwards, came to
the <hi>Esk,</hi> a River running in the Irish Seas neer <hi>Carlile;</hi> the
Governour delighted with the Seat and standing of the place,
caused dig Trenches, and by the advice of certain <hi>French</hi>
Gunners placed some Field Pieces, and small Ordinance for
defence of them, and spread there his Pavilions. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
of <hi>Carlile</hi> terrified at the sudden approach of so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
an Army, offer many presents for the safety of their Town,
whch he rejected. The English Army not minding to invade
the Scots so long as they kept themselves on their own
ground and advanced not, the Governour endeavoured to
make the <hi>Scots</hi> spoil the Countrey by incursions, but he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them slack and unwilling to obey and follow him, most
part refusing to go upon <hi>English</hi> Ground, amongst whom
<hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was the chief and first man. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
finding his command neglected, and some Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
dissenting from what he most intended, commeth
back to the place where they made their stand, and desires a
reason of their stay. They told him, they had determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to defend their own countrey, not invade <hi>England.</hi> That
it neither consisted with the weal of the Common-wealth,
nor as matters went at that time, had they sufficient forces to
make invasive War: That the Governour did not instigate
them to invade <hi>England</hi> for the love he carryed to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but for a benefit to the <hi>French,</hi> by diverting the war prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the <hi>English</hi> against them. That by invading they might
make themselves a prey to their enemies; they were Men and
not Angels; it was enough for them whilst their King was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
age to defend his Kingdom from the violence of Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Put the case they werein one battel victorious, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the slaughter and loss of their Nobles and Gentry in that
purchase, they might be overthrown in a second fight, and
then to what would the King the Country be reduced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their
last King might serve them for a pattern, the Revenge of
whose death should be delayed till he himself were of years to
undertake it.</p>
            <p>The Governour brought to an exigent, said they should
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51978:102"/>
have propounded these difficulties before they took Arms,
and on the place of Battel. Temerity misbecame Noblemen
in action, but especially in matters of War, in which a man
cannot err twice. At the convention of the three Estates
when war was in deliberation, they should have inquired
for the causes of it; he was not to bring them upon the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of war without their own consent. The <hi>English</hi> had
made many incussions upon their Countrey, burning and
ravaging: who stand only upon defence, stand upon no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
a better defence of their own Countrey could not be
found than by invading the Countrey of their Enemies. They
should not be dejected for that accident at <hi>Flowden,</hi> since it
was not the fault of the Souldier, but the Treason of their
Chamberlain who had suffered for it. That the glory of the
Nation should raise their courages, and inflame their bosoms
with a desire of revenge: The Kings honour and their piety
towards the Ghosts of their Compatriots, crav'd no less from
them. That if they would not invade <hi>England,</hi> at least, for
their Reputation and Fame with the World, they would
pitch there a short time their Tents, and try if the <hi>English</hi>
would hazard to assail them. That it would be an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
branding their honour, if timorously in a suddennesse
they show their backs to their enemies, and dared them not
in the face by some daies stay.</p>
            <p>The Queen, though absent, had thus perswaded the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
and having understood the Governour to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now flexible, she dispatched a Post to him, requesting
he would be pleased with a Truce for some Moneths, and
that he would commune with the Warden of the <hi>English</hi>
Marches, whom she should move to come to his Tent and
treat with him. The Governour finding he stood not well
assured of some of his Army, and knowing what a cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
task it was to withstand the violence of their desires,
determined to follow their own current: seemed well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to hearken to their opinion. Hereupon the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi>
Warden of the West Marches came unto the Governours
Camp the eleventh of <hi>September</hi> (and, as some have recorded,
the Queen also) where a Cessation of Arms was agreed unto
for some daies, in which time the Queen and the Governour
should send Embassadours to treat for a Peace with King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and shortly after Embassadours were directed to the
Court of <hi>England,</hi> but returned without any good don, King
<hi>Henry</hi> demanding extraordinary and harmful conditions to
the Realm of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The year 1522. <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> Arch-Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi>
dyed, and <hi>Iames Beatoun</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Glasgow</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
of the Kingdom came in his place of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51978:103"/>
Arch-Bishop rick of <hi>Glasgow</hi> was conferred upon <hi>Gaven Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar</hi>
whom the King after advanced to be Chancellor of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Governour resenting highly the slighting of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
by the King of <hi>England,</hi> but more the contempt
and scorn of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nobility in refusing to follow him,
in <hi>October</hi> by the West Seas past over to <hi>France,</hi> promising
that if a peace in this mean time were not concluded with
<hi>England,</hi> he would the next Summer bring such War-like
Briggades of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> that he should not stand
much in need of his own Countreymen, who had continued
so refractory and backward to his designs. He demanded
from King <hi>Francis</hi> five thousand <hi>German</hi> Horsemen, and ten
thousand foot to be transported to <hi>Scotland:</hi> which with the
<hi>Scots</hi> who would accompany him, he thought sufficient to
continue a War with <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> could not spare
so many men, having Wars both with the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the
<hi>English,</hi> but they gave him three thousand Pikes, and one
thousand Launces. The Governour intending to return to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> receiving intelligence that the Ports towards the
coasts of <hi>France</hi> were watched by the <hi>English</hi> to intrap him in
his passage, bestowed his Ships so covertly here and there
in small companies to avoid all suspition of any purpose he
had to stir that year, as that thereupon the <hi>English</hi> Fleet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> which had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and waited his comming forth, untill the Midst of
<hi>August,</hi> brake up and bestowed themselves in convenient
Ports against the next spring. The Duke then watching
opportunity, and readily gathering together his dispersed
Ships, to the number of some fifty Sail, imbarked his men
at <hi>Brest</hi> in <hi>Bretaign</hi> the one and twenty of <hi>September,</hi> and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at <hi>Kirkowbry,</hi> or the Isle of <hi>Arran,</hi> in the West of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
In his company was <hi>Richard de la Pool</hi> who had been banished
<hi>England,</hi> and to his power faithfully assisted the Governour.
He arrived the same time that <hi>Ied-brough</hi> was burnt by the
<hi>English;</hi> for <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> high Admiral of <hi>England,</hi>
the Marquess of <hi>Dorset</hi> and his Brother, with a competent

            <p>At his comming the Duke assembled the Lords at <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
where they agreed that an Army should forth with be
gathered, and the 28. of <hi>October</hi> was appointed for their
meeting at <hi>Dowglas-dale.</hi> At the day prefixt the Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and convoying some Artillery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the water under the command of <hi>David Car</hi> of <hi>Farnehast,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:51978:103"/>
on the last of <hi>October</hi> they besieged the Castle of <hi>Wark,</hi> which
was defended by <hi>Edward Lile</hi> or <hi>Lisle.</hi> The Assailants upon
the outmost Ward continuing their Battery entred by main
force the second Ward, but being there repulsed and beaten
back, a great Tempest arising, and fearing the swelling of
the River of <hi>Tweed</hi> might cut them off from their Army on
the other side, they turned back and repassed the Water; the
Report of the Earl of <hi>Surreys</hi> forces come to rescue the Castle
and lying at <hi>Anwick,</hi> and also perplexed them not a little; the
Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> at his approach finding the Enemy retired to
the other side of the River, the Castle safe, and having no
Commission to pass the <hi>English</hi> marches, of to invade <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
made mo further pursuit. In the mean time the Queen
who had ever sought to make firm friendship with her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and break the amity of <hi>France,</hi> sent to him to yield to
a cessation of War, hoping in that time to work some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
between the two Nations. Whereunto the King
consenting, the Governour finding the <hi>Scottish</hi> Lords averse
to his intentions, that he was this time served as he had been
before (they refusing still to enter upon <hi>England</hi>) and that
striving would but the more chafe them, also condescended.
Thus a Truce was promised, and faithful peace concluded
till the last of <hi>November,</hi> being the Feast of <hi>St. Andrews;</hi> the
Win<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er past without any invasion of the <hi>English</hi> on <hi>Scotland,</hi>
or the <hi>Scots</hi> on <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the time of this Truce many serious consultations
were amongst the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> whither it were more fit
to continue this War, of give it over. Many of them held it
unreasonable that for the onely pleasure of the <hi>French</hi> King
the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> should suffer any more damage by the
continuing of so needless a War, and that the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany</hi>
was alwaies set to perform what the <hi>French</hi> desired, not
what was expedieut for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation, nor what was in
their possibility to accomplish. Wherefore they wished that
their young King now having attained some years of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and passing the age of a Child, might bear some away
in the Government of the Realm. Some argued that a King
sooner than the Sons of Noblemen went out of the bondage
of Tutelage, and enjoyed greater immunities, his age often
being re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>koned from the time of his conception. That the
administration and charge of the Kingdom should early be
given him, that he might with his years grow in the art of
Governing; Since we find the same to be usual in the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of other arts and Sciences. Others entertained other
thoughts, That to a child who could not by the weakness
of his judgement discern Right from Wrong, the Helm of
State should not be trusted, and that the Peers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51978:104"/>
might be challeng'd of dotage by their Neighbor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
for giving to a Child the Sword of Justice, which he
might thrust in their own entrails one day, or wound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the bosom of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>The Governour finding the Lords divided amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their reasons averse to his intentions, and that not
onely the people, but the Souldiery were weary of him, and
had bent their affections upon their young King, foolishly
preferring the ignorance and simplicity of a child to his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
experience, and long practice of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> requested
them to give him leave to return to <hi>France,</hi> and to forgive
him any errour he had committed, which he protested was
of ignorance not of malice. Having from men distasted with
him, without any opposition, obtained what he required, far
from any outward shew of inward discontentment, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting
himself at the ingratitude of some whom he had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to Honors, he came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where after some days
stay with the King, when he had given him such instructions
of State, as he was able to understand (for he was but then
in the thirteenth year of his Age) with many tokens of love,
and demonstrations of sincere affection he took his leave of
him: and his Ships attending his passage on the West, with
a great retinue of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> he held his way towards
them, and recommended himself to the Sea in the Spring
time, now the third time for <hi>France,</hi> after which he return'd
not at all into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was a Prince adorned with many Virtues, Active,
Couragious, Resolute, and knew how to use men as they
are.</p>
            <p>If he had not been opposed by the Queen and Nobility, he
was likely to have lost himself and the whole Kingdom, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
the death of his Cousen.</p>
            <p>His courteous nature went above his ambition; he could as
well lay down his Honours, as he had modestly, when they
were laid upon him, received them.</p>
            <p>Before the Rumor of the Duke of <hi>Albanies</hi> taking the Seas
was spread abroad, the King of <hi>England</hi> by secret Letters had
required the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who then an Exile staid in <hi>France,</hi>
to come to him; after the receit of which, with a short-leave
taking he left <hi>France,</hi> where he had staid almost three years,
commeth to <hi>England;</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> had brought him to believe,
<hi>That the Duke had determined to extirpate his whole Linnage: To
prevent which he made him offer of Men and Ammunition to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by his faction at home, and his assistance, to
send the Duke over Seas; which if he had staied, the Earl was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
powerful enough to have accomplished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> being in <hi>France,</hi> the Queen with the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51978:104"/>

whom she moved to leave <hi>Sterlin</hi> and come to <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> the
third day after he had made his entry in the Town she lodg'd
with him in the <hi>Maiden Castle,</hi> and it seized on, armed with
authority, she doubted not to make the Countrey yeild her
all obedience. That the Supream Magistrate of the Town
should not oppose her Designs, he is put from his Office,

            <p>To give the fairer lustre to her Actions, a Parlament is
called at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> that what she did, might consist with
Law.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> understood the Duke had left <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to exclude and bar him all regress, he sent one <hi>Magnus,</hi> a
great Oratour, but greater by the renown of his skill in the
Laws, with <hi>Roger Ratcliff,</hi> his Embassadours, to try how the
<hi>Scots,</hi> amidst unnecessary turmoils, would rellish a Truce and

and discords between the two Nations upon the Duke;
The Nobles tyred with their tedious Wars, beginning to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
a Heaven of rest, cheerfully accept of this Embassie, and
agree unto a Truce for one whole year. To confirm which
they condescend Commissioners shall be dispatched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

who shall treat not only for a Truce, but for a firm and
lasting Peace between the two Nations, and unite the two
Crowns in bands of Amity, as well as they were united in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of blood.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> his enemy abandoning the Kingdom,
after honourable entertainment of the King of <hi>England,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
promises to befriend him, and blandishments at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting,

the first faction by his presence find their power
diminisht, the other by his counterpoise and assistance have
new hopes of arising; both factions disliked that <hi>Angus</hi> should
arise to the first place, and suspected he would not be content
with the second; they loved to have him an equal, not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme.</p>
            <p>Private jarrs smothered and interests delayed, matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>England</hi> requiring a hasty and present discharge,

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51978:105"/>
The Bishop had a speech, the Sum of which was,</p>
            <p>That dissention and hatred taken away between the two Nations,
a faithful Peace might be agreed unto and confirmed, their Discords
turned into Vnion, their Rancour into Love; which to bring to pass
and make durable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the only apparent and probable means, was to
bestow the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> the Kings daughter, upon <hi>James</hi> the young
King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> with great joy applauded to what was said:
And King <hi>Henry</hi> appointed certain Commissioners to treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that purpose in private. These when they had met to
advance the Union of the Kingdomes, desired these Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>First, That the <hi>Scotish</hi> Nation giving over, and fairly forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the League they had with <hi>France,</hi> should enter in a new League
with them, upon the same conditions and terms which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their League with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, That the young King of <hi>Scotland</hi> till by age he was able
for marriage, should be brought up at the Court of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Embassadours of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had answered, <hi>That
these conditions were above their Commission, to which they could
not well answer,</hi> and desired a time to acquaint the <hi>Council</hi> of
<hi>Scotland</hi> with them; it was condescended unto. Thus two
of them remaining at <hi>London</hi> the Earl of <hi>Cassiles,</hi> returned to
<hi>Scotland</hi> to bring back an answer.</p>
            <p>When the day in which the Parlament should have been
held was come, the Queen and they who were of her faction,
as the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>Arran, Murray, Eglintoun,</hi> fearing the Earl of
<hi>Angus</hi> might turn the wavering peoples affection, and move
them to some Revolt, which might hinder their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or terrify the Commissioners by the frequent conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Friends and Followers, constraining their voices,
and restraining their freedom of speech: Or that they had a
plot to surprize some of the contrary Faction, and by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Parlament commit them in that place, caused a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
to be made, <hi>That none of the three Estates should sit

            <p>Time urging resolution, the Lords of Parlament direct the
Earl of <hi>Cassiles</hi> again to the Court of <hi>England</hi> to declare their
resolution concerning the marriage of the King and the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing

            <p>The news of the overthrow of the <hi>French</hi> Army, and the

to the Court of <hi>England</hi> before the Arrival of the Earl of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siles,</hi>
King <hi>Henry</hi> told the Scotish Embassadours in plain terms,
<hi>He could not determine any thing concerning the Marriage of his
Daughter, without acquainting the Emperour her neerest Kinsman

the Queen with the Gift, or seeking the consent of the
other Rulers: at this the Queen turned so displeased, that
abandoning the King to the Pleasure of the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi>
She with her Followers retired to <hi>Sterlin.</hi> By this unconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
retreat the Earl administred all alone, leaning to the
greatness of his own power, that some might have thought
the Queen set her Game to make up his. All favours and
punishments pass by him, All Offices and Places of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are distributed to his favourites; He made <hi>Archembald

Chamberlain; the Abbacies of <hi>Coldingham</hi> and <hi>Holy-rood-house</hi>
were in his Brothers hands, neither temporal nor ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Dignity escapt him; his greatness instantly procureth him

            <p>
               <hi>The Arch-Bishop of</hi> Saint Andrews, <hi>the Earls of</hi> Arran,
Arguyl, Murray, <hi>who were of the Queens faction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lay a plot
to accuse</hi> Angus <hi>of high Treason. They challange him,</hi> that
he kept the King against his will, insolently restrained his Liberty,
and that contrary to the order established by the Estates, which was
that the custody of his person should every four Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ths by turns
be allotted to the Governours of the Countrey in a Circle; That he
could not dispose of any thing of moment alone, the contrary of all
which he had usurped; whereupon they charge him to dismiss the
King, and restore him to them, and the other Counsellours equall in
Government with him, under the pain he should be reputed a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and no loyall Subject, for this invassalling his Prince to his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> himself to this answered not, but Sir
<hi>George</hi> his Brother moved the King to give the answer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>His Mother and those other Ruler's should not be thus solicitous
for him; for with none more cheerfully, willingly and contentedly
could he live and spend his time than with the Earl of</hi> Angus, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could he leave the company of one so highly favored of his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and so well meriting of himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For all this answer he had secretly sent Letters to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and those of the adverse party, intreating,</hi> They would
remove him from the Earl, and not suffer him any longer to remain
under him imperious Government, and if it could not be otherways
done, to accomplish it by main force of arms, if they had any pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or if any Sparks of duty remained unquenched in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, if they dared Enterprize ought for a Royal, though
now thralled, Supplyant, or obey the Command of a King in Prison;
that the answer which he sent before unto them and his Mother was
by constraint and compulsion drawn from him, and far from his
Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:51978:106"/>Upon this advertisement the Queen and they of her Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and with great expedition marched towards
<hi>Edenburgh</hi> to seperate the King from the Earl his Guardian;
Who, resolved to repel force by force, with the Townsmen
of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> many friends and adherents, and the King,
though against his will, marched out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fight of these Rebels. When the Leader of the Queens
forces understood the King in person was in the adverse Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
either dazled with the splendour of the presence of a
King, or fearing if they joined in battel, the person of their
Prince might be endangered, or that they found themselves
not strong enough in number and arms for a Conflict, they
retired back again to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where they disbanded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
everyman to his own dwelling place: The Queen
with the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> went to <hi>Murray</hi>-land, the Earls of
<hi>Arran</hi> and <hi>Arguyl</hi> to the West, the Arch-bishop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi>
to <hi>Dumfermling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Faction dissipated, the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> remained more
stable, and assured of his Guardianship, and now he findeth
no Competitour.</p>
            <p>The want of the great Seal being a hinderance to many of
his projects, and he disdaining to be a suiter to his enemie; for
dispatch of publick affairs, caused the King send a Letter for
it, and the Arch-bishop with all respect sent it immediately
to the Earl: with whom to be equal he took himself to new
Meditations.</p>
            <p>The Queen many waies provokt by her Husband the Earl
of <hi>Angus,</hi> and lastly by detaining her Son Against his will and
contrary to the publick course agreed upon, the Arch-bishop
perswaded her <hi>To intend a process of Divorcement against him,
and dissolve her marriage; this might produce some great effect, at
least it could not but diminish the Earls reputation among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
The Queen and the Earl many times in private between
themselves agreed upon a seperation, disliking each others
conditions; for it was fatal to her as to her Brother <hi>King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
to delight in change of Wedlock, and be jealous of her
Matches. The Earl is therefore cited before the Arch-bishop
of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> to hear the sentence pronounced according to
the Laws of the Church in those times; at the day appointed
he appeareth. The Queen alledged, <hi>He had been betroathed,
given his faith and promise of marriage to a noble woman of the
Kingdom (a daughter of</hi> Traquare) <hi>before the marrying of her,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d so by reason of that Precontract he could not be her lawful hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
The Earl confesseth; The Arch-bishop pronounceth
the sentence of Divoncement, but with this Reservation
and Restraint, <hi>That the Child come of the Queen and the Earl
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51978:107"/>
the time of their marriage by the ignorance of the Mother (the
Queen) should not suffer any loss, damage or disadvantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> resented highly this Divorcement,
endeavour'd by his Letters to hinder it; for he thought some
things tolerable in men, which were in competent and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in women, and after never carried such respect to his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
as he had done before. Of these she made little reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for after the sentence given, she married <hi>Henry Stuart,</hi>
Son to the Lord <hi>Eavendale,</hi> whom K. <hi>Iames</hi> to do honor to his
Mother, promoted to be Lord <hi>Meffan,</hi> and General of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery.</p>
            <p>Whilst the King remained a shadow to the Earls Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amidst so many distractions, discords and jars of the
Grandees, the Court turned solitary and unfrequented by
any Noblemen, save these of the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> own faction, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> shewed himself most indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
For he for his own ends attending the Court, in a
short time so framed himself to the Kings humours, that he
delighted alone in his conversation, and often hid none of
his inward thoughts and secret intentions from him. Among
others he many times importuned him to give him a sound
advice how he might de delivered form the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> of
whose bondage he had been long weary, whose rule over him
was turned now into tyranny, his ambition having mounted
to that height that he was not content to command and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but to thrall and keep under his Soveraign Lord
the King himself, that he effects of his Governing were
the dispersing of his Nobles, and banishing of his mother
from him.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who by his familiarity with the King
was become suspitious of <hi>Angus,</hi> and had an intention to
tumble out a man hated of his Prince, establish himself in
his place, and rule the young King alone, aggravating his
and the Countreys miseries, told him, after much intreaty,
The Lord of <hi>Balclough</hi> was the only person to be employ'd in
such a service; a man of unlimitted desires, displeased,
strong in power, mightlly hated, and who had inve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erate
hatred against the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> who wanted nothing but
opportunity to execute his rancour: If this conceived ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit
had not a desired success, then he himself would by
main force either win his Prince, or loose his life in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
The Laird of <hi>Balclough</hi> secretly advertised of the
Kings intention giveth way to much oppression and many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
on the borders, the redress of which required the
presence of the Prince. Complaints are given against them,
and the King to do justice accompanied with the Earls of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
Lennox,</hi> Lords <hi>Hume, Flamin, Areskin, Cesfoord, Farne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hast,</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:51978:107"/>
and others commeth to <hi>Ied brough.</hi> But when they had
staied there some daies, small redress was of wrongs, no
justice executed, the chief men of the Borders not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Delinquents of their Names, to answer according
to law as was the antient custom. Thus as they came they
were returning, when at <hi>Melrose</hi> as they hoverd at the passage
of a Bridge over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> certain companies of men in arms
appeared on the Descents of <hi>Hellidon</hi> Hill: which being come
with in distance of discerning were known to be commanded
by the Laird of <hi>Balclough,</hi> and number'd a thousand all bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
and broken men. The Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> not a little mov'd
at so sudden an apparition, by an Herauld craveth to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their intentions, and how in such a hostile manner they
dared come so near the Kings person, withall charging them
under pain of high Treason to retire. The Laird of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloughs</hi>
answer was, he came to do the King service, invite him
to his house, show him what forces he was able to raise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Borders when necessity should require his service and
assistance. That he would not obey a charge contrary to
the Kings mind, of which he was conscious, and herewith
he marched forwards. Presently the Earl alighting on foot,
leaving the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Lords <hi>Areskin, Maxwell,</hi> Sir <hi>George
Dowglas Ninian Creightoun</hi> with the King as Spectators of the
Game, with the Lord <hi>Flammin</hi> and other his Friends, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall'd
his Men for the Charge, which was given with a great
shout and clamor of these Borderers. The Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> Lards
of <hi>Farnehast</hi> and <hi>Cesfoord</hi> had taken their leave of the King
who gladly dismist them, but upon advertisement of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fray, being not far of they return in hast with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Launces, in good time for the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> and falling
upon one of the Wings of <hi>Balcloughs</hi> troups force them to
yield ground, and some to turn their backs, upon which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
foloweth the Chase. <hi>Cesfoord</hi> and <hi>Farnehast;</hi> eagerly
persewing. Here at the descent of a little Hill, by the blow
of a Launce which a Domestick of <hi>Balcloughs</hi> threw from his
Arm, the Laird of <hi>Cesfoord</hi> if slain, and by his death the
Chase left off to be follow'd, and a long deadly fewd between
the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Cars</hi> was begun, fourscore Borderers were kill'd
in this bickering assisting <hi>Balclough,</hi> himself was wounded
with many of his friends, the Earl of <hi>Anguss</hi> lost not a few
besides the Laird of <hi>Cesfoord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> after this road of <hi>Melross</hi> perceiving his

and fellow-governour in distribution of Causualities and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51978:108"/>
ruling the Countrey. When the King had considered how

success, he began to essay the third by the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi>
whom challenging of his promise he desired to gather an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and joining his Forces with the Queens to restore him to

inviting them to assist and side with his cause. One

valour he had lately been so far obliged. He sendeth Letters
to the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> and the Gentlemen of the name of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi>
regretting the estate of the Common-wealth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
their speedy aid. That in so perilous time setting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all particular Respects and Quarrels, they would have a
care of the Common good of the Countrey. If the Earl of
<hi>Lennox</hi> should carry the King from him, and remained Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
of the Field, he would not stay there, his next mark
would be the <hi>Hamiltouns,</hi> whom he was in the way to put
from all title to the Crown, the report going already that
the King would intail it to him out of his own favour, and
had designed him Heir to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> he having no
children of his own. That the King had a magnetical affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards him, which, if Fortune favoured him with a
Victory, would increase, now meritting which before was
but meer favour. The custody of a young King was not for
a man of so short experience. The <hi>Hamiltouns</hi> finding that
man their Suppliant who late was their Competitor, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to live in a trouble State, and be Copartners of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and mannaging the affairs of the Kingdom, which
was promised them in their new band of Friendship, laying
aside all former discontent and grudge accept the Quarrel,
and assemble their Forces at <hi>Lynlithgow.</hi> To this Town the
Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was advancing, and he being the Sisters Son
of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> by Gentlemen well affected towards
him, and of his kinred, they intreat him to turn back, and
not to try the hazard of a battel for a conquest; he could not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51978:108"/>
long enjoy the Government of a young Prince, whom a
little more time would make Governour of himself, and
who (perhaps) would reaward his service with disgrace; It
being ordinarily seen that great obligations to Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
rather their hatred than love, whilst it is more easie to
pay men by contempt than benefits: that if he came forwards,
no interest of blood would save him from their just and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
stopping of his passage and enterprize. The Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi>
answered, it was no time then in the eye of the world to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
so just a quarrel, that shame wounded deeper than death,
which he would rather imbrace than not see his Prince at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh.</hi>
And finding the Bridge over the <hi>Avan</hi> possest by
the enemy, passed his Companies over the River <hi>Et</hi> near the
antient Monastery <hi>Immanuel;</hi> the Maister of <hi>Kill-mayers</hi>
guideth the Vantguard, consisting of Westland men; the
Earl of <hi>Cassiles</hi> and himself the main Battel, many of which
were high-land men, being of all (as some write) ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> having essayed in vain to bring the
King to the Field with the power of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> leaving that
Charge to his Brother Sir <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Archembald Dowglas</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost
of the Town, accompanied with the <hi>Humes</hi> and <hi>Carres,</hi>
being of all two thousand, marketh a speedy march towards
<hi>Lynlithgow.</hi> But the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> spurr'd by the ambition
and youthful heat of his Son Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun,</hi> had begun
the fight before be could appear; for a long time it is valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fought, victory inclining to neither side, till a great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
arose seconded by the appearance of fresh Troops of
enemies, the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> and their Friends, at which alarum
many of the High-land and West-land men turned their
backs; the rest by the advantage of the place sustain the Fight.</p>
            <p>The King, after much loytering and many delaies (having
heard the Armies were near joining) and much solicitation
of Sir <hi>George Dowglas,</hi> issueth out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> at a slow
march. But when at <hi>Corstorphine</hi> Hills he was awaken'd with
the noyse of the great Ordinance, he urgeth his Followers
to make all haste to come to the fight. It was reported Sir
<hi>George Dowglas</hi> drove his Horse, in a great rage gave him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
words, which he never after forgot. Being half way
he is advertised that the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> highland-men were
fled, and by all appearance the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was Master of
the Field. This news perplexed him not a little, but making
the best of that worst, he dispatch'd all his domestick Servants
with <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> of <hi>Largo,</hi> to save so many as they could in
the Chase, especially the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> whose life he now
tendereth as his Crown. But this Earl after he had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Laird of <hi>Pardowye,</hi> in cold blood was unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51978:109"/>
slain by Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun,</hi> who either killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the face all that came under the dint of his Sword in
the Rout.</p>
            <p>They found the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> mourning over his Corps,
over which he spred his cloak; the Laird of <hi>Howstoun</hi> lay
dead by him, the Master of <hi>Killmayers</hi> sore wounded at their
comming, maintained the fight, and was by them with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
saved, with so many others as either the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or their power could reskew. This Conflict hapened
in <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the victorious Earls had rested their wounded Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and refreshed them selves in <hi>Lithgow,</hi> they accompany
the King to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and immediately march through <hi>Fyffe</hi> in
quest of those who had been the cause of taking arms against
them, of which number the Queen was; but the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> was the most eminent, who, as before
he had seconded <hi>Arran</hi> to surprize <hi>Angus,</hi> so now he
had stirred <hi>Lennox</hi> to the overthrow of them both. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Arch-bishop was not to be found (for he (as some
record) was turned a true Pastour, and in Shepheards weeds
kept sheep on some Hill) they spoiled the Abbacy of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermling,</hi>
and Castle of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> defacing all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and carryed away the Moveables and stuff in them.
The Queen with her husband <hi>Henry, Stuart,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> his
brother, betook them to the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which the
Lords at their return besieged. The Mother hearing her Son
was amongst the Besiegers in person, obtaining favour for
her husband and his Brother, caused the Gates to be cast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
But for their safety such who loved them, advised the
King to commit them to that place during his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Now the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arran</hi> summoned all who had
born Arms against the King to appear in judgement, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
according to the Law as Traytors. Some compounded
for Sums of money, others became Dependers of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arran: Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassiles</hi> being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
and compearing, <hi>Hugh Kennedy</hi> his Kinsman answer'd
the indictment, that he came not against the King but to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the King, for proof of which he offered to produce the
Kings own Letter. Though the Earl of <hi>Cassiles</hi> escaped the
danger of the Law he did not the fury of the Revenge, was
taken about some disparaging words; for as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
home, he was surprized in the way and killed; Some
write by the Sheriff of <hi>Aire,</hi> but by the direction of Sir <hi>Iames
Hamiltoun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time the Arch-bishop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and other
Church-men in revenge of the spoiling of his Houses, and
persuing himself, for questions of Religion, burn the Earl of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51978:109"/>
               <hi>Arrans</hi> brothers Son Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> and banish Mr.
<hi>Patricks</hi> brother <hi>Iames</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Lithgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, mens wrath by time diminishing and their
bloud growing colder, the Arch-bishop having bestowed on
the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> his Brother, and other their
Friends, some Church benefices and many Leases of Tyths,
was reconciled unto them, and with appearance of great
friendship they mutually entertained and feasted each others
at the <hi>Christ-Mass</hi> in the City of <hi>S. Andrews.</hi> But small confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
could be long among reconciled enemies.</p>
            <p>Now went every thing as the earl of <hi>Angus</hi> could have
wished, he was not only entire and familiar with the Kings
person, but with his Office; some of his enemies were dead,
others overthrown in open Field, with the rest he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.
No faction for power or richess was equal to his;
Nor remained there any Castle Fortress not ceised on by
him, and garrisoned with his Friends and Followers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Castle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> a part of the Queens Dowry, which
being desolate by her Miseries, and only haunted by some
of her poorest and meanest Servants, was neglected by the
Earl, which in him was a great errour, the fitness of the place
for a revolution and change of Court considered. Many
daies the Earl had not seen his own dwelling Places, nor
thought upon his private affairs, being carryed away by the
storms of Court, now he thinketh he may securely pass to
<hi>Lothian,</hi> whilst at <hi>Faulkland</hi> the King shall be safely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by his Brother Sir <hi>George, Archembald</hi> his Uncle, and
<hi>Iames</hi> of the <hi>Parkhead</hi> Captain of the Guards; having ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
entreated their attendance on the King, he crosseth
the <hi>Forth,</hi> with resolution soon to return. His departing
was not so concealed, but the Arch-bishop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi>
had knowledge of it, and he inviteth <hi>Sir George to see him in
his City of</hi> St. Andrews, <hi>to receive the Leases of the Tyths promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
all now perfected, valid, and according to Law sufficient.</hi>
Whilst Sir <hi>George</hi> is here detained, <hi>Archembald</hi> the Treasurer
by other Letters, for matters of love, is inticed to <hi>Dundee;</hi>
But nothing could make the Captain of the Guards leave
his Charge. The King amidst his solitary Walks in his Park
of <hi>Faulkland</hi> considering of what a tedious Train he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and how suddenly occasion might turn her bald
scalp, if presently he took not hold of her, resolveth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
by Stratagem, what the Factions of his Nobles
could not perform by force. It is delightful to understand
every particular circumstance in the progress of the actions
of Princes. Upon this resolution he directeth <hi>the Forrester of
the Park to give advertisement to such Gentlemen about, who kept
Hounds, the next morning to attend him, for he would early have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51978:110"/>
his Game.</hi> He suppeth sooner than his custom was, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Captain of the Guards with more than usual ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and representations of the next mornings, sport,
withall <hi>inviting him to go to his rest, the Night being short about
the Summer solstice.</hi> The Waiters all shifted and the Court
husht, shutting his Chamber door, in the apparel of one of
his Grooms, unperceiv'd he passed the Guard to the Stable;
where with two who attended him, with spair Horses he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where by the Queens intelligence he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
in the Castle.</p>
            <p>When the certainty of this escape was noised abroad,
many Noblemen repair to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> some by Letters sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, others at the rumour of his evasion, that in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time he found him safe and far from any danger again
to be surprized, the Earls of <hi>Arguyl, Atholl, Glencarn, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth,

But the Earl of <hi>Arguyl and</hi> Lord <hi>Hume</hi> accepted that

            <p>Now are the Offices and Lands of the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> disposed

a certain time to treat a peace, and if it were possible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> with the King. Five yerrs truce was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
upon; but for the <hi>Dowglasses,</hi> the King would hearken
to no offers; onely <hi>Alexander Drummond</hi> by the intercession
of <hi>Robert Bartoun,</hi> and the Embassadours, had liberty to
return home. When the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and the
Earl of <hi>Murrey,</hi> who had full power to conclude a Truce,
had met the other Commissioners upon the Borders, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
great men and ranck Ryders there, put all in such a
confusion by urging difficulties, that they parted without
agreeing unto any articles or certain conclusions: which the
King took in so evil a part, that divining from what head this
interruption sprung, he committed sundry Noblemen to the
Castle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> till they gave hostages, and secured the
borders from invasion or being invaded. In the Moneth of
<hi>Iune</hi> following with a great power he visited these bounds,
executing Justice upon all Oppressours, Theeves and Out-Laws.
In <hi>Ewsdale</hi> eight and fourty notorious Riders are
hung on growing Trees, the most famous of which was <hi>Iohn
Arm-strong;</hi> others be brought with him to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for
more publick execution and example, as <hi>William Cockburn</hi>
of <hi>Henderland, Adam Scot</hi> of <hi>Tushelaw,</hi> named King of
Theeves.</p>
            <p>The year 1530. the King instituted the College of Justice;
before it was ambulatory, removing from place to place by
Circuits; Suits of Law were peremptorly decided by Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
Sheriffs, and other Judges; when any great and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cause offered it self, it was adjudged Soveraignly by the
Kings Council, which gave free audience to all the Subjects.
The power and privileges of this College was immediately
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irmed by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh.</p>
            <p>In this Court are fifteen Judges ordinary, eight of them
being spiritual persons, of the which the most antient is
President, and seven Temporal men: The Chancellour of
the Realm when he is present is above the President. There
are also four Counsellours extraordinary, removable at the
Princes pleasure.</p>
            <p>This institution is after that <hi>Order</hi> of Justice which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
in <hi>Paris,</hi> first instituted by <hi>Philip the fourth,</hi> the
<hi>French King</hi> the year 1286.</p>
            <p>The King about this time storeth his <hi>Arsenals</hi> with all sort
of <hi>Arms;</hi> the Castles of <hi>Edenburgh, Sterlin, Dumbartoun,
and Blackness,</hi> are repaired and furnisht with Ordnance and
Ammunition.</p>

is sent to the Borders; who when his solicitation for resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Earl, at the <hi>Scothish</hi> Court had taken no effect, yea had
been scorned, after he had staied at <hi>Berwick</hi> with the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
Souldiers, and some selected companies out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
and <hi>Westmerland</hi> maketh a Road into <hi>Scotland;
Coldingham, Dunglas,</hi> and adjacent Villages they burn, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
the Countrey towards <hi>Dunce.</hi> Some Scottish Ships and
Vessels were also at this time taken by Sea. When a reason
was sought of this invasion in a cessation of Arms, and calm
of Truce; <hi>They require the</hi> Dowglasses <hi>may be restored totheir
antient inheritances, and whatsoever had been withheld from
them, and that</hi> Cannabiem <hi>(a poor Abbacy) be rendred to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
as appertaining of old to the Crown of</hi> England. The Earl
of <hi>Murray</hi> being declared Lieutenant maketh head against
them: but the <hi>English</hi> dayly increasing in number, and his
companies not being suffcient to make good against so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and large in cursions, the power of <hi>Scotland</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
four Quarters every one of which for the durance of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
daies by turns taketh the defence of the Countrey. The
<hi>English</hi> finding by this intercourse of new Souldiers the War
to be prolonged, would have gladly accepted of Peace, but
they disdained to sue for it to the <hi>Scots:</hi> it was thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
that the <hi>French,</hi> a Friend then to both, should be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
to reconcile them, whereupon, after an Ambassador
had come from <hi>France,</hi> Commissioners first meet at <hi>Newcastle</hi>
and after at <hi>London, Iames Colvil</hi> of Easter <hi>Weyms, Adam Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburn</hi>
of <hi>Redhall, William Stuart</hi> Bishop of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>Kinloss.</hi> These conclude a Peace <hi>To continue between
the two Realms, during the two Princes lives, and one year after
the decease of him who should first depart this life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time the secrets of the Ecclesiastical Doctrine
and Authority beginning to be laid open to the view of the
World, the politick Government of Kingdomes began to
suffer in the alteration and discovery. The Lady <hi>Katherine</hi>
daughter to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Isabella,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and Sister to the Mother of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour, had
been married to <hi>Arthur</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> eldest Sonne to
<hi>Henry</hi> the seventh King of <hi>England,</hi> he dying, by the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the Second, her Father in Law gave
her again in Marriage to <hi>Henry</hi> his other Son the Brother of
<hi>Arthur.</hi> This Queen though fruitful of children, and often a
Mother, brought none forth that long enjoyed life, and came
to any perfection of growth, except one onely Daughter
<hi>Mary.</hi> Her Husband either out of spleen against the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Charles,</hi> or desire of male children, or other Causes
known to himself, <hi>pretended great scruples in his conscience,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51978:112"/>
would make himself and the world believe, that his marriage was
not lawfull.</hi> After deliberation with his Churchmen, whom
he constrained to be of his mind, he kept not longer compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            </p>
            <p>Then the Pope with his whole Cardinals gave out their
Sentence, That it was not lawful for him by his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to seperate himself from his wife; that his marriage
with <hi>Katharine</hi> was most lawful, not to be questioned, and
that under pain of Excommunication he should adhere unto
her.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> well experienced in the great affairs of the
World, considering how the threatnings and thunders of
the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> even in these antient and innocent
times when they were believed and reverenced, in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
produced never great effects, thought them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in a time when Doctrine was publisht to the World,
embraced and believed of numbers, by which they were
contemned and scorned: upon this and other grounds he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to obey, and the Pope continneth his menacing.</p>
            <p>This disorder and boldness of the King of <hi>England</hi> moved
the Emperour and the Pope to try if they could win the King
of <hi>Scotland</hi> to arise in arms against his Vncle King <hi>Henry.</hi>
The Emperour essayeth it under pretence of other business

which, <hi>Germany</hi> being all of one mind and undistracted, he
could never have brought to pass] he compelleth the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> to condescent to a general Council or Assembly of the
Clergy of <hi>Europe,</hi> the only and soveraign remedie to cure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
minds, and accord different opinions: but he knew
well that by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> men would be delegated
to this meeting, turbulent, and so far from pacifying tumults
began, that instead of Water they would apply Oyl and
Wood to these flames, turn opinions before disputable, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciliable,
and leave matters worse than they found them.
Having implored the aid and assistance of the Potentates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him to the setting forward of so pious and holy a work,
he sendeth <hi>Goddes callo Errico</hi> (a <hi>Sicilian</hi>) for greater secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

            </p>
            <p>This Embassadour for a token of that affection the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
his Master carryed to the person and virtues of King
<hi>Iames,</hi> presenteth him with the Order of the Golden-fleece
1534. with solemn Protestations for the observing of these
antient Leagues and Confederacies contracted between the
Princes his Masters Predeceslours and the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
to continue ever amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His other instructions were</hi> Plaints of the wrongs done to
his Aunt <hi>Katharine,</hi> most injustly repudiate and forsaken by a
King forsaken of God and abhorred of men. The marriage of
<hi>Ann Bullen</hi> should wound deeply King <hi>James,</hi> it being likely by
her Succession he should be barred of his Right to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The Emperour by his Ambassadour expostulating the wrongs
of his Aunt, had gained nothing, but that for his sake shee was
the worse entertained. To make more strong and lasting the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
friendship with King <hi>James,</hi> he (if he pleased) would make
him an offer and give him the choice of three Ladies, three <hi>Maries,</hi>
all of the Imperial Stem: <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> the Emperours Sister,
the Window of <hi>Lovis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary; Mary of</hi> Portugall, the
Daughter of his Sister <hi>Eleonara</hi> of <hi>Austria: Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Katharine</hi> and King <hi>Henry.</hi> And would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the performance of this last, either by consent of her Father,
or by main force. The greatest but last of his instructions was
that to suppress the Heresies of the time he would concur with the
Emperour for the convocating a General Council, and obviate the
calamities then the threatning the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>The King with great cheerfulness and many thanks, that
the Emperour entertained him with such respect, and held
him worthy so fair and Royal Allyance, and the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of affairs of such importance and moment, received
this Embassage.</p>
            <p>For the Council, providing it were a general Council lawfully
convocated by the Emperour and Christian Kings, as the first Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
were wont, free and holy (as nothing is more holy than a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
convocation of Christians) the most charitable and quiet of the
Clergy, and such who would pacifie matters, not the most zealous

it, being premonisht of the time and place, he would apply his
will unto his, assist him, thither send his best Oratours and most
convenient Church-men. That if a true Council could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
every Prince should reform the Errors of Doctrine and faults
of the Clergy within his own Dominions.</p>
            <p>The Proceedings of his Vncle were grievous unto him, being a
man altogether thralled to his own opinions. For the Good of the
Christian Religion and Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> it were expedient that
all her Princes were united together in amity and love, and their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51978:113"/>
Arms directed against the common enemy the <hi>Turk.</hi> For himself
he would be Mediatour to reconcile the Emperour and his Vncle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to recall him to the love of his Wife, nor by any perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to be induced to condescend to ought prejudicial to Queen
<hi>Katharine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three Ladies were every one in the superlative worthy, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for that great reason of uniting the
Isle of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> but she was not in her own power, nor in
the power of the Emperour, that he could bestow her upon whom
he pleased. That to ravish her out of the hands of her Father would
be, beside the danger of the Enterprize, a breach of Divine and
humane Lawes.</p>
            <p>It was not safe for <hi>Paris</hi> that he preferred one of the three God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desses
to the other two, for prizing those three (that the Emperour
might know how dearly he respected and earnestly affected his affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity)
there remained a fourth Lady neer in blood to the Emperour,
Isabella Daughter of <hi>Christian</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
the Emperours own Sister, whom, besides her matchless vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
for the vicinity of the Nation to his, and the conformity of
their harmless humours, he made choice to be Queen of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Dominions.</p>
            <p>Godscallo <hi>answered this last,</hi> That a match with Lady <hi>Isabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
of <hi>Denmark</hi> could not with the Emperours credit be brought to
pass, because she was promished already to another, <hi>Frederick</hi>
Count Palatine, and the marriage might be accomplished before
news came to the Emperour of the Kings election.</p>
            <p>This choice of the Kings was but an evasion, for Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Areskin</hi> of <hi>Brichen</hi> Secretarie, and <hi>David Beatoun</hi> Abbot
of <hi>Arbroth,</hi> under pretence of renewing the League between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> long before had been directed to <hi>France</hi>
about a Marriage with the eldest Daughter of King <hi>Francis,</hi>
which <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> projected when the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Kingdoms was renewed at <hi>Rochell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had now renounced all obedience
from the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thorough his whole Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
abrogated his authority, and <hi>Paul</hi> the third after his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the Papacy, set forwards by the Emperour and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
who thought either to recover <hi>England</hi> or burnt it up
by a Foreign or civil war, never left thundering against him.
But after <hi>Iohn Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> was beheaded (a man
imprisoned for adhering to the Pope, then for his persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that the king might carry him greater respect,
made Cardinal) the whole Conclave stir the Pope against
<hi>King Henry.</hi> And full of Grief and rage remonstrate what
danger would follow their Order if this Example unpunisht
should have way. They maintained the Papal power against
all Princes, which now for fear of their Lives they would be

forced to forsake, or to proceed with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thus to give satisfaction to his Court, he formed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
against King <hi>Henry</hi> and a most severe sentence, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from the publication of it during his pleasure; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
sending many copies of it to those Princes he thought
could be useful to his Designs when occassion should serve,
and he proceed with a constant rumor of the Bull shortly to
be put in execution and publisht.</p>
            <p>Amongst many interested in wrongs by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
considering there was none comparable to the Nation
and King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he directeth hither <hi>Iohn Antonio Come

               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:51978:114"/>The King kindly entertaining the Legate, answered the
Pope with much regret for the estate and stubbornness of the
King of <hi>England.</hi> Who would not be struck with Pitty that
a King who late amongst Christian Princes was honoured
with the title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> should be obnoxious
to so many crimes, that now amongst Princes he could scarce
be reputed a Christian? This compassion was common to
him with others, but he by a necessity of Nature, and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of blood felt a more piercing sorrow; he should leave
no means untryed to recal his Uncle to the obedience of the
Church: and though by his Embassadours, he had once or
twice went about the same, but in vain, he would study a
way how face to face he might give him his best counsel, and
remonstrate how much good he would do the Christian
World and himself by returning again to the Chruch. Mean
while he requested him not to be heaady, forward nor rash in
executing the Sentence against his Uncle, which would but
obdure him in his seperation.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> not having lost all hopes of Uncle, directeth

spoyled the Coasts of</hi> Orknay <hi>and the adjacent Islands: with a
Request that King</hi> Henry <hi>would not succour the</hi> Lubeckers <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

made such hasty journeys that he prevented the News of his
comming, and at unawares found the King at <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The
Substance of his embassage was, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland</hi> might have an interview at <hi>York,</hi> at which mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be declared Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
and General Lieutenant of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> That
his Master having instructions of the Alliances offered him
by neighbour Princes, did offer to his own and his Counsels,
judgement if they could find a more fit, than to contract a
marriage with his Daughter, which might be easily perfected
if his Master and King <hi>Iames</hi> could condescend upon some
few points.</p>

               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51978:114"/>
               <hi>When the King had taken these Propositions into delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the Church-men suspecting if this meeting and match
had way, the King would embrace the opinions of the new
Reformers, set all their wirs to overthrow it. The neerest
Successors to the Crown, covering their claim and interest,
argued,</hi> That to marry the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England</hi> who for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years would not be mariagable was not a right way to continue
his race by procreation of children, and that his impatience of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
alone, would not be much abated by marying a Child. That
King <hi>Henry</hi> projected this mariage to no other end than to hinder
him from better Allyances, or to facilitate an entry to the kingdom.
That when a Prince would take advantage of any neighbor Prince,
it was more safely done by alliance than open force. That it was
more safely King <hi>Henry,</hi> being a wary Prince, never meant to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his Daughter at all as long as himself lived, but to keep her at
Home with him, bearing many Princes in hand to save him from
Dangers both at home and abroad: which counsel was practised
lately by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most oppose neither to the meeting of the two Kings, nor
to the Alliance, but to the place of their meeting, which
seemed unto them of no small importance being in the heart
of <hi>England,</hi> and amidst the most martial people of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>They require the two Kings might have their interview at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi>
this place, when they meet, being most commodious for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
all necessaries by Ships; That the number of their Trayn
should be agreed upon, as one thousand, which none of th, two
Kings should exceed. That the time should be at the Feast of Saint
<hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel between the Harvest and the Winter, which
would hast the consummation of the Ceremonies, and not suffer the
Kings to prolong time, but invite their return to their own chief and
principal Cities. <hi>When it was declared to the</hi> Lord Howard, <hi>that
the consent of the Nobles of the Kingdom obtained, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
at the Feast of</hi> Michaelmas at Newcastle <hi>might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
unto; he would neither accept of the place nor
time,</hi> His Master having already (as matter he had never put in
question) made great preparations for this interview at <hi>York,</hi> that
he would think his offers slighted and an affront put upon him, if
any excuses were alleged to the contrary: <hi>Thus with some bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadoes
to the Council he departed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King to give satisfaction to his Uncle of his Councils
proceedings with the Lord</hi> Howard, <hi>sendeth after him Sir</hi>
Adam Otterburn of Red-hall, <hi>who laieth the fault of his not
appearing upon the Lord</hi> Howard, <hi>complaining,</hi> That
he menaced the Counsellours, and would have forced their votes;
that he was a great Friend to Sir <hi>George Dowglasse</hi> and other
Rebels, who convoyed him to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and accompanyed him
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51978:115"/>
back again. It was against the credit and honour of free born Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be threatned, what was friendly begun should friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
and end: Princes should not be constrained, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which were not of Debt but benevolence.</p>
            <p>Amidst these importunities and solicitations King <hi>Iames</hi>
with five well manned Ships taketh the Seas, giving out a
Voyage for <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> record it was his first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to come to them: but it is more likely this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from Policy of State, to try the affections and demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the great ones of his kingdome in his absence, rather
than any intended voyage towards Forainers. For with this
Fleet he arriveth at <hi>Orkenay,</hi> there in some Forts placeth gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,

he sent for Hostages to the Castles of <hi>Dumbartoun</hi> and <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
And when by the skill of one <hi>Alexander Lyndsay</hi> his

he was driven by storms to take Land at <hi>Saint Ninians</hi> neer
<hi>Whitehorn</hi> in <hi>Galloway.</hi> This Voyage bread great fear in those
Islanders and Savages, and brought long Peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to those Countreys thereafter. At his Return to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
for <hi>Disorders</hi> committed or surmised in his absence,

without either the command or tollerance of these
Superiours.</p>
            <p>The remote High-lands and Borderers made peaceable by
the incarcerations of the Chiefs of the Clannes and Families
there commanding, he may when occasion is offered in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
visite any neighbour Prince or State. To second his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Embassadours in their suit in <hi>France</hi> he had sent the

and King <hi>Francis</hi> in regard of the indisposition of
his Daughter <hi>Magdalen,</hi> had made an offer to them of his

            <p>The Kings mind having been long troubled with youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thoughts by the many matches offered him; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
marriages contracted and trusted to the eyes of others,

wished the same: Whilst he is on the Ocean, the Winds

contrarying his course, a violent Tempest separating his
Ships, the Pilote asketh him to what Coast he should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

him, command the Pilote to turn sails again for <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and not struggle with the pittiless Element for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which might be delayed, and a little time could not
turn worse: so when the King awoke, he found himself
neer his own Harbours upon the <hi>Forth,</hi> and was so highly
displeased with the Authors of his return that he never
pardoned them: the fault was laid on Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun,</hi>
and to stir him more against this Man, there wanted not

            <p>The season thereafter being more fit for Navigation, he

Short a time was more beloved of her Husband, nor sooner
made conquest of the hearts of her Subjects: Nor was their
greater hopes conceived of any alliance than of this, nor
greater joy did ever arise for those hopes, but as in the life
of man there is ever remaining more of bitter than sweet: so
were these contentments but Shadows, matched with the
real Sorrow that the death of that young Lady brought forth.
For she lived not many weeks after her Arrivall in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
when of a Feaver, which she contracted in <hi>Iune,</hi> she departed

Whilst they traffique this Marriage, many false accusations
(as Plots laid against his person) are intended one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the Court, amongst which two are remarkable for
their notable calumny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> eldest Son to the Lord <hi>Forbess,</hi> a young Gentleman
chief of his name, hardy and valorous, but evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and therefore easily suspect to be capable of sin, had for a
Servant or companion, and ordinary sharer of his pleasures,
one named <hi>Strachan,</hi> a man come of the dreg of the people,
and perfectly wicked. This man after much familiarity,
and some fecret service and attendance, to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iate his insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
desire, desired earnestly something from the Master of
<hi>Forbess</hi> which he passionately refused to give him, upon
which, carryed away with rage and malice, he not onely
renounced his friendship and service, but betook himself to
the Service of his Enemy the Earl of <hi>Huntley:</hi> by whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
he forgeth a malitious Plot to overthrow him. To
compass their design they accuse the Master of <hi>Forbess</hi> to
have had once an intention and Mind to kill the King, that
the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> might be restored to their wonted honors and
antient possessions. By price and prayers witnesses are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to prove this against him, and convict him, or at the
least to leave him suspected and taxed with this Treason.
Though this crime was not sufficiently and clearly proved,
yet was the Master of <hi>Forbess</hi> indicted, and convicted by an
Assize, for having conspired the Kings death, for the which
he was beheaded and quarter'd, and his Quarters set aloft
upon the Gates of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gentlemans death proveth how dangerous the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and company of the wicked is to any; for ascending the
fatal scaffold, he justifyed his innocency of what was laid to
his Charge, but confessed the guilt of the Laird of <hi>Drummes</hi>
bloud by the justice of God brought him to that end. His
Father the Lord <hi>Forbess</hi> was upon suspi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion kept long after in
the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The King when he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
what was past, testifyed he was grieved at the death of
this Nobleman; for he banished <hi>Strachan,</hi> because he had so
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51978:117"/>
long concealed the Treason of <hi>Forbess,</hi> silence in a matter
importing no less than the life of a Prince, being reckoned
equal to the Treason, he made his second brother one of his
Domesticks, restoring him to the estate which was forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>This thunderclap was immediately followed by another,
for the quality of the person, and strangeness of the crime
deplorable, but more for the horrour and terrour of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
            <p>

and an old Priest, were brought to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> committed,
and accused that they should have poisoned the King. Their
accuser was <hi>William Lyon</hi> a kinsman of the late Lord <hi>Glammes.</hi>
This treason had no probability of truth among such who
knew the accused, being persons who lived far from the
Court in their solitary mansions, seldom or never almost see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King. Nevertheless their accusations were believed,
and strict command given to the Judges to dispatch their
process.</p>
            <p>William Lyon <hi>aggravating the case represented to the King</hi>

nor by open force, now set on work his last engines to come to his
end, though it were with the life of his soveraign; That in so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and dangerous a plot he could not use but his neerest kindred;

               </gap>ex and other qualities making her less suspect to have access to

her life, and suffering her to escape, he should afford her time, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and power to execute what she but now (perhaps) had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>The King, not knowing the mans particular hatred against
this Lady (for some write, <hi>He did inform against her in revenge
that she refused to marry him, giving her self to another)</hi> suffred
the <hi>Process</hi> to be concluded.</p>
            <p>Some of the Judges would have referred her to the Kings
clemency till a farther tryall of the Witnesses might be had,
upon whose testimony the <hi>Process</hi> did depend, it being a
safer way in Judgement to absolve the guilty, than condemn
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51978:117"/>
the innocent. But the most part gave her over to the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers;
the better part of which being in voices fewer, the
greater, who neither respecting conscience within them, nor
shame with the present age and posterity, nor the supreme
justice of Heaven, find this poor Lady guilty, and she is
condemned to be burnt alive. Her sentence was executed
the fifth day after the beheading of the Master of <hi>Forbess</hi> on
the Castle hill of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in sight of her Husband. who
either out of Revenge or Fear, after this tragical end of his
Lady, seeking to save himself by escape out of the Prison,
whilst he came over the Wall by the shortness of the Cable
was dashed against the Rock, and found dead. Though
the tender years of the Lord <hi>Glammes,</hi> her son, proved his
innocency, he remained prisoner in the Castle till after the
Kings death. The old Priest, when after torture, nothing
could be proved against was set at liberty; <hi>William Lyon</hi> the
author of this calumny, was banished the Countrey, which
justifyed the Ladies integrity, and verifyed than however

day, armed from head to foot, like antient Palladines, and
after many enterchanged blows to the disadvantage of their
Casks, Corslets and Vantbraces, when the one was become

blowes, and the other (who was short sighted) had broken
his ponderous Sword, the King, by Heraulds, caused sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them, with disadvantage to neither of these Champions,
and the verity which was found, was, that they dared both

of the Common-wealth do now require it. Nor ever in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of advice and consultation, can we embrace and follow what
is most reasonable, and what according to Laws, Iustice, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
should be, but what necessity driveth us unto, and what is most
convenient for the present time to be, and what we may well and
fairly accomplish and bring to pass.</p>
            <p>The Estate of your Kingdome is troubled with diversity of
opinions concerning Religion; It is to be wished that the one
onely true Religion were in the hearts of all your Subjects,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51978:118"/>
[since diversity of opinions of Religion and heres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
punishment of God Almighty upon men for their horrible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and roaring sins. And when Men forsake his fear and
true obedience, God abandoneth them to their own opinions and
fantasies in Religion; out of which arise Partialities, Factions,
Divisions, Strife, intestine Discords, which burst forth into
civil war, and in short time bring Kingdoms and Common-wealths
to their last periods] But matters arising to such a height and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
as by all appearance, they are like to advance in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the number of the Sectaries dayly increasing, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
my thoughts to your Majesty, The preservation of the
People being the Supream and principal law which God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath enjoyned to all Princes.</p>
            <p>I hold it more expedient to give place to the exercise of both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
than under pretence and shadow of them to suffer the
common Peace of your Subjects to be torn in pieces. What can
wisdom (Sir) advise you to do with these Separatists? Either
they must be tolerated for a time, or they must altogether be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and that by death or banishment.</p>
            <p>So soon as a Prince beginneth to spoil, ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sh, kill, burn his
people, for matters abstract from sense and altogether spiritual,
he becometh as it were a Plague unto them. It is an Errour of
State in a Prince, for an opinion of Piety to condemn to death
the adherers to new doctrine. For, the constancy and patience
of those who voluntarily suffer all temporall miseries and death it
self for matters of faith, stirr up and invite numbers who at first
and before they had suffered were ignorant of their faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
not only to favour their cause but to embrace their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Pitty and commiseration opening the Gates. Thus their
belief spreadeth it self abroad, and their Number dayly encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.</p>
            <p>It is no less errour of State to banish them. Banished Men
are so many Enemies abroad, ready upon all occasions to invade
their native Countrey, to trouble the peace and tranquility of your
Kingdome.</p>
            <p>To take Arms against Sectaries and Separatists will be a great
Enterprize, a matter hard and of many dangers; Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be preached by arms; the first Christians detested that form
of procceedings; force and compulsion may bring forth Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
not true Christians. If there be any Heresie amongst
your people, this wound is in the Soul; our Souls being Spiritual
Substances upon which fire and iron cannot work, They must
be overcome by spirituall Armes; Love the men and pitty their
errours.</p>
            <p>Who can lay upon a man a necessity to believe that which he will
not believe, or what he will believe, or doth believe, not to believe.
No Prince hath such Power over the Souls and thoughts of men,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51978:119"/>
as he hath over their bodies. Now to ruin and extirpate all those
Sectaries, what will it prove else than to cut off one of your arms,
to the great prejudice of your Kingdom and weakning of the State?
they dayly increasing in number, and no man being so miserable
and mean, but he is a member of the State. The more easie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and nobler way were to tolerate both Religions, and grant a
place to two Churches in the Kingdom, till it shall please Almighty
God to return the minds of your Subjects, and turn them all of one
will and opinion: Be content to keep that which ye may, sir, Since
ye cannot that which ye would.</p>
            <p>It is a false and erroneous opinion, That a Kingdom cannot
subsist which tolerateth two Religions: Diversitie of Religion shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not up Society, nor barreth civil conversation among men; a
little time will make persons of different Religions contract such
acquaintance, custome, familiarity together, that they will be
intermixt in one City, family, yea marriage Bed, State and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
having nothing common.</p>
            <p>Why (I pray) may not two Religions be suffered in a State (till
by some sweet and easie means they may be reduced to a right Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
since in the Church (which should be union it self, and of which
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church much vaunteth) almost infinit Sects and kinds
of Monks are suffered: differing in their Laws, Rules of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Fashions of living, Dyet, Apparel, maintenance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of perfection, and who sequester themselves from our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
union. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had its extension, not by simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
and likeness of Religion. Different Religions, providing
they enterprize nor practise nothing against the Politick Laws of
the Kingdom may be tolerated in a State.</p>
            <p>The Murthers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Massacres, Battels, which arise and are belike
dayly to encrease amongst Christians, all which are undertaken for
Religion, are a thousand times more execrable, and be more open,
plain, flat impiety, than this Liberty of diversity of Religions,
with a quiet peace, can be unjust.</p>
            <p>For as much as the greatest part of those who flesh themselves in
blood and slaughter, and overturn by Arms the peace of their
Neighbours (whom they should love as themselves) spoiling and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging
like famished Lyons, sacrifice their souls to the infernal
powers, without further hopes or means of their ever recovering
and comming back, when those others are in some way of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>In seeking liberty of Religion, these men seek not to believe any
thing that may come in their Brains; but to use Religion according
to the first Christian institutions, serving God and obeying the
Laws under which they were born.</p>
            <p>That Maxime so often repeated amongst the Church-men of
<hi>Rome,</hi> That the chase and following of Hereticks is more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
than that of Infidels, is well applyed for the inlarging and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51978:119"/>
increasing the Dominions, Soveraignity and power of the <hi>Pope,</hi>
but not for the amplifying and extending of the <hi>Christian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the Weal and Benefit of the <hi>Christian</hi> Common-Wealth.</p>
            <p>Kingdomes and Soveraignityes should not be governed by the
Lawes and Interests of Priests and Church men, but according
to the exigency, need, and as the case requireth of the Publick Weal,
which often is necessitated to pass and tolerate some defects and
faults. It is the duty of all Christian Princes to endeavour and
take pains that their Subjects embrace the true faith, as that sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably,
and in even parts they observe all Gods commandments,
and not more one commandment than another.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding when a vice cannot be exstirpate and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
without the ruin of the State, it would appear to humane judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that it should be suffered. Neither is there a greater obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
bond, necessity of Law, to punish Hereticks more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators,
which yet for the peace and tranquillity of the State are
tolerated and past over. Neither can a greater inconviency and harm
follow if we shall suffer men to live in our Common-wealth who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
not, nor embrace not all our opinions. In an Estate many
things are for the time tolerated, because they cannot without
the total ruine of the State be suddenly Amended and Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>These men are of that same nature and condition of which we
are; they worship, as we do, one God, they believe those very same
holy records; We both aym at Salvation; We both fear to offend
God; We both set before us our happiness: The difference between
them and us hangeth upon this one point, that they having found
abuses in our Church, require a reformation. Now shall it be said for
that we run divers waies to one end, understand not rightly others
language; we shall pursue others with Fire and Sword, &amp; exstirpate
others from the face of the Earth? God is not in the bitter division
and alienation of affections, nor the raging flames of sedition, nor
in the Tempests of the turbulent Whirl-winds of contradictions and
disputations, but in the calm and gentle breathings of Peace and
Concord: If any wander out of the Highway, we bring him to it
again; If any be in darkness, we shew him light and kill him not;
In Musical Instruments if a string jar and be out of tune, we do
not frettingly break it, but leasurely veer it about to a Concord:
and shall we be so Churlish, cruel, uncharitable, so wedded to our
own superstitious opinions, that we will barbarously banish, kill,
burn those whom by love and sweetness we might readily winn and
recal again?</p>
            <p>Let us win and merit of these men by reason, Let them be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a free Councel; it may be they shall not be proved Heretecks,
neither that they maintain opinions condemned by the antient
Councils. Let their Religion be compared and paralell'd with
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51978:120"/>
the Religion of the first Age of the Church.</p>
            <p>Shall we hold this People worse than the Jews, which yet have
their Synagogues at <hi>Rome</hi> it self? Let them receive instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from a free and lawfull Council, and forsake their errors,
when they shall be clearly and fairly demonstrated unto them.
Heresie is an errour in the fundamental grounds of Religion,

            <p>That which they believe is not evil, but to some it will appear they
believe not enough, and that there is in them rather a defect of good
than any habit of evil. Other points when they shall be consider'd,
shall be found to consist in external ceremonies of the Church, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in substance of doctrine, or what is essential to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
These men should be judg'd before condemn'd, and they should

               </gap>ind it is not our religions, but our private intrests and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which troubleth us and the State.</p>
            <p>The King followed not this opinion, but gave himself o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the counsel and Government of the Prelates. They
remonstrate to him, that he should not rashly alter approv'd
and long received customes; that there was nothing more
dangerous in Government, than to abase the authority of
antient Laws. Let him well consider and set before his eyes
the malice of Man, who ever when he is drawn off one course
of evil precipitateth himself in a worse; It was less evil in
State to tolerate disorders known, unto which usual and
accustomed remedies might be applyed, than by altering
and changing foundations to give way to new, to find out
Remedies to which, would take and consume a whole age.
That this would be a way, not only to take away the abuses,
but even the good uses of every thing, and put in hazard all
matters and main points concerning Religion. They desired
him to consider how there were two sorts of persons affecting
these new opinions and studying Novations. The multitude
or common people, and some of the Nobility and Gentry. It
was likely the common people might be deceiv'd; and to give
them satisfaction, and appease them, by granting them a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
or change in religion, would not be a means to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate
and instruct them, but to bring in a popular licence.
If he should suffer them to misbelieve, distrust, call in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
points of Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or search or find out more light, they
would immediately thereafter presume to make Laws and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Government, by degrees restraining the Soveraign
authority, and after they had examined, sifted narrowly, and
discust Ecclesiastical authority, they would essay to correct
and find the difficulties of the Temporall. That it was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51978:120"/>
more easie to oppose and resist the first demands of the
multitude, than pleasing them in a part, after bound and
limit their desires and petitions. As to the great Men of his
Nobility and Gentry he might be assured they had not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and piety for their ends, but to impatronize and lay
hold on the Church Rents, and Ecclesiastical goods. To
turn absolute and free men, acknowledging neither Church
nor King. To this end many reserved themselves, and kept
close their opinions, attending the change: which once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
their faces would turn all one way. Which immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
evils, if the King would prevent, there was no other
means than to use his authority and power, whilst the most
and greatest part of his Kingdom yet obey'd him. That cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in this was most necessary before their number increas'd,
and er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they discover'd that universal commodity, which
would follow the imbracing of these new opinions. It was
safer to compose these Tumults by his absolute command and
authority, and if this produced not the wished effect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it by arms, than to give reins to a popular licence, and
the ambition of great Men.</p>
            <p>After this counsel had prevailed, most rigorous inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are established, and punishments denounced against all
who professed opinions differing to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon some out of a muffled zeal of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to revenge their particular quarrels, most to possesse
moveables and lands, pursue many to judgment. Of which
some are executed by fire, others banished, many imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
amongst which was the famous Poet and Historian
<hi>George Buchanan,</hi> who whilst his Keepers slept, escaped by a
Window of the Prison the Muses holding the Cable; the
more frequent the publick executions were and banishments,
the greater number embraced the opinions of them which
suffered.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> having understood that the <hi>Pope,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
out the confirming of a Peace between the Emperour
and the <hi>French</hi> King, had a meeting with them at <hi>Nice</hi> (a
maritime Town upon the confines of <hi>Provence)</hi> and assuring
himself that matters there would be both consulted upon, and
determined to his prejudice, sendeth again to his Nephew
the King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he would come and see him at <hi>York,</hi>
for now he had more vehemently irritated the Pope, having
condemned as Rebels, and confiscated the goods of all who
maintained Papal authority; and raised from their Tomb
the Bones of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> (commonly named Saint <hi>Thomas</hi>
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> canoniz'd by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, for
being kill'd for the maintenance of the liberties of the <hi>Church
1171.</hi> to whom there was yearly a Festival Day kept
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51978:121"/>
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) and by the hands of a common Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
caused burn in ashes and throw them in the River.
The revealing of which to the world was a secret more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to the Pontificial State, than any stumbled upon
heretofore, or opened up. Upon this the Sentence of Ex-communication,
some years deferred, was pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. By which he was deprived of his Kingdom,
and those who adhered to him, declared uncapable of what
they possessed. His Subjects were dispensed from their
Oath of Allegiance, and discharged to obey him. Strangers
were inhibited traffick with his Kingdom. All Christians
charged to arise in arms against him. The Estates, goods
and persons of such Subjects as followed him, given over to
be a prey and spoil to any would invade them.</p>
            <p>It was time for him to look to himself. Such of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as loved peace, and the Weal of the two Kingdoms, stirr'd
King <hi>Iames</hi> to this interview, especially they who favour'd
the reformed Religion; assuring him King <hi>Henry</hi> was dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with all demonstrations of good will, that his person
would be far from any danger. And if by this conference
they should join in bands of Amity, a great benefit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Country and posterity would redound. Why would
King <hi>Henry</hi> in the face of the World and Neighbour Princes,
brand so his Reputation, as to break the Laws of Hospitality,
wrong a Prince whom he had invited to come and see him?
Why would he violate those of consanguinity attempting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his own Nephew? The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth had
been his Guest, and after Royal entertainment, was friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dismissed. He met with <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King at
<hi>Bullen;</hi> which meeting seemed rather of Brothers come to
counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
some marriage Pomp, than contending Neighbours.
If <hi>King Henry</hi> had born any discontent against his Nephew,
he might long ere now have satisfyed his ambi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, and at
more easie rate, when the King his father with most of the
Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> receiv'd that fatal overthrow
by the Hills of <hi>Flowden</hi> and <hi>Banks</hi> of <hi>Till;</hi> the
refusing of an
interview might divide the King and his Vncle upon which
might follow some unnatural War.</p>
            <p>Upon the other part the Church-men set all their Power to
hinder this interview, perswading themselves it would give
a terrible blow to their Estates or Religion. The principal
cause (say they) why the King of <hi>England</hi> is so passionately
earnest to have this meeting, is to perswade his Nephew to
conform Church-matters in <hi>Scotland</hi> to those already begun
in <hi>England;</hi> to abolish the Popes authority, to drive Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
persons from their Lands, Rents, Houses; invest the
jewels and ornaments of the Churches. Which counsel and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51978:121"/>
example if King <hi>Iames</hi> should follow, he would hazard or
lose the friendship he had with the Pope, Emperour and
<hi>French</hi> King, his best confederates, abandoned of which he
and his Kingdom would be left a Prey to the tyranny of his
Uncle; if <hi>Henry</hi> kept no faith to God, Men had no reason
to trust unto him. That this Interview was to intrap his
person; He being the man whom the Pope and Emperour
had designed to set upon his Throne, and revenge their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels;
That it was grosly to err, to he carried away with a
shadow and appearance and leave a Substance, to trust at
once his Crown, person and liberty to an Enemy. And sith
examples move more than precepts, let him think upon the
hazard of King James the first, eighteen years Prisoner, and
after sold to his Subjects; <hi>Malcolm</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Kings of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> He should remember (if yet he were therein to
be instructed) that Princes serve themselves with occasions
over their Neighbours, that they have greater care to satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fy
their ambition, than fear of shame for doing of wrongs
with the present times or posterity. That their Oaths were
no longer kept than they observed their advantages. That
after he falleth in his hands, he ought to follow his manners,
Religion, forsaking and giving over his own natural dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
manners and freedom, have no other affections nor
motions than his. For who commeth under the roof of a
Tyrant turneth slave, though he was a free man ere he did
enter. That this meeting with the body, would endanger
the Soul and infect it with his errours, corrupting it with
false opinions grounded upon a liberty to live to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ensuality
and <hi>Epicurean</hi> pleasure. If upon the slighting of this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,
King <hi>Henry</hi> should denounce war against King <hi>Iames</hi>
and invade his Countrey, they in his just defence should
furnish moneys to entertain an Army and overturn his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
For the present necessity they offer to pay to him
fyfty thousand Crowns yearly; and in any hazard of the
Estate voluntarily to contribute all their rents and revenues,
providing it would please his Majesty to suffer justice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
against those who scandalously had sequestred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the holy Church, and to the contempt of his
Laws publiquely made profession of the opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of <hi>Luther.</hi>
That the goods of all who should be convict of Heresie
(which they esteemed to no less than an hundred thousand
Crowns of yearly Rent) should be brought to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
and their lands annext to the Crown. To this effect
they intreat his Majesty to give them sufficient Judges truly
Catholick and full of zeal and severity.</p>
            <p>After long reasoning upon both sides it was agreed, the
King should not altogether refuse to meet his Vncle, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51978:122"/>
to the first to offer propunded to this Emb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Inter-view. The meeting to be at <hi>New castle,</hi> one
thousand at the most in train with either King, the time to
be the Feast of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel.</p>
            <p>These Conditions not being embraced by King <hi>Henry,</hi>
would if not abolish totally, at the least prolong the time of
this meeting; the King of <hi>England</hi> thinketh his Nephew too
imperious to assume the Injunction of the whole circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their meeting, but rather than his suit should take no
effect, accepteth both of the Place and number of the Train:
and that the might have some point yeelded unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the time may be the first of <hi>August.</hi> These Conditions
being almost agreed upon, three or four hundreth <hi>Riddes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
and <hi>Tinedale</hi> men, with other Borderers, break upon
<hi>Liddesdale,</hi> and therewith large incursions kill and forrage.
This during the Treaty falling miserably forth, so much
irritated King <hi>Iames</hi> that, accepting the offers of his Clergy,
he gave over inwardly all intentions of any inter-view: By
prolonging time labouring to winde himself out of the
Maze. Hereupon he sendeth Letters full of excuses for his
stay; representing his many grievances and wrongs suffer'd;
and the seeds of discord began now to be sowen amongst
them. To light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lord Inquisitor) for embracing his Brothers opinions, had
been persued so by the Church-men that he was constrain'd
to forsake his own Countrey, and some yeers wander as a

his Cousin. For if he were so burnt up with zeal, that he
spar'd not his own blood in the quarrell of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith,
what Heretick could pass unpunisht? Besides the investing
himself in the Sherifs Office and Lands (which he never
minded to restore) he had a Picque against him, for that
whilst he sate Judge in <hi>Lithgow,</hi> he pronounced a sentence
by which he was interested in some petty gain.</p>
            <p>The Sheriff falling so far short of his expectation, that he
findeth himself the first subject of his Cousins justice, and
highly resenting his Kinsmans cruelty, whom he knew under

to prevent his mischief. He had sometime been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

and ayrie brags had not escaped his observation; some alike
in kindred, to them both were emissaries suborned, to mark

to every Informer against a man in State and Office, he should
never have an end; for thus no man is so innocent who may
not be detracted and calumniated. Sir <hi>Iames</hi> was known to
be a man rash and insolent in words, his brains having been a
little giddy (like one looking from a great height) by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
in honours and place in Court; but sincere in the
service of his Prince and loyal. If he was arrogant in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of termes, that was to acquire some more credit with
the Commons, that he might doe better service to his
Prince.</p>
            <p>They who committed Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun,</hi> knowing the
King facile and easie to be wrought upon by the Clergy, some
of them too, professing or giving way to the reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
resolve (if he should escape free of this accusation)
that an imminent ruin hung over their persons and estates.
Necessity and fear combining the distracted powers of their
minds, they come prostrate before the King, beseech him not
so much to look to the quality and circumstances of the
crime, as to the evil inclination of the man, who, powerful,
factious, and naturally vindicative, would never forgive nor
forget the danger he was driven unto; that His Majesty
would consider his pass'd life, terrible and cruel against all
whome he could over-reach; That to give him liberty, and
relieve him of his imprisonment, before the crimes of which
he was accus'd were clearly proved, or not, would be their,
and the accusers overthrow; whom they esteemed loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and except upon evident probabilities, and never given
informations against him. That he was a man perfectly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the People, and a more acceptable sacrifice could not
be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffer'd unto their fury if he prov'd guilty. At their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
the King gave the Judges full power to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and administer justice according to their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and the Laws of the Kingdom. The pannall being
found guilty of such points of the Inditement as was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, was condemned to die, and thereafter accordingly
beheaded, his Quarters being set aloft on the Town gates his
Lands annex'd to the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:51978:123"/>The Crimes of which he was found guilty (as from those
who lived near that time have by tradition been received)
were, he had intelligence with the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses,</hi>
whom he laboured to have restored, though with
the Kings, death, he had a plot to have broken up the Kings
Chamber-doors, and killed him, divolving the title of the
Crown, or at least Government of the Kingdom to his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Being ditected to have repared a Castle in Bute, and to
this effect receiving three thousand Crowns in <hi>April,</hi> he went
not thither, attending some change in the State, which was
to be accomplished by treason against the Kings person. He
kept still with him men of disperate minds and fortunes who
at his direction durst enterprize any mischief.</p>
            <p>Where he had repaired some of the Kings houses, he had
placed a Statue resembling himself, or which to some he had
named his Statue (what Mole-hills are turned into Mountains
when a Prince will pry into the actions of a disgraced Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject?)
above the Kings arms. He had detracted from his
Master, naming him the king of Clowns and Priests, and
Scourge of the antient Nobility; He had laboured to hinder
the Kings marriage at his being in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these points the people (who rejoiced in his ruin) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he had slain cruelly the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> at the battell of
<hi>Lithgow.</hi> after he was Prisoner to <hi>Purdowye;</hi> he had way<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>laid
<hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Cassiles</hi> who was killed by his direction and
Counsel.</p>
            <p>This back-blow of Fortune proveth, that it is dangerous
once highly to offend a Prince, and after remain in his service;
for Princes put old offences up as neglected, and when the
occasion serveth them, surprize long after the Delinquents
for some faults of which they are scarce guilty.</p>
            <p>Sundry of the Nobility, appall'd at this sudden fall of Sir
<hi>Iames Hamiltoun</hi> (for though they loved not the Man, they
hated the example of such strict Justice) left the Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring
to their own dwelling Houses: which made the King
suspitious of them, and believe they favoured the reformed
Religion, and preferred the friendship of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to his. Neither was he herein far Mistaken: for some
feared not to send him word, that they had learned the
Church-men had set him on work to extirpate his antient
Nobility, as if it were an easie matter to create as many out
of the Gentry, in whom (being his own Creatures) he might
have great confidence than any made by his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.</p>
            <p>After this he turned so retired, sullen and melancholly,
that every thing displeased him, and he became even insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
to himself, not suffering his Domestick Servants
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51978:124"/>
to use their ordinary disport and recreations neer him. And
as all day he proj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted and figured to himself new cares to
perplex himself, some of which might fall forth, others
could never come to pass; So in the night time the objects
of his dayly projects working upon his fantasie, limmed
their dark shadows of displeasures, which gave him terrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

affright in his sleep. Amongst many of which, two are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
as notable; one in the History of the Church, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common; both seem to have been forged by the Men
of those times, who thought fictions as powerful to breed
an opinion in discontented minds as verities, and they may
challenge a place in the poetical part of History. As he lay
in the Pallace of <hi>Lithgow</hi> about the midst of the night, he
leaped out of his Bed, calleth for Lights, commandeth his
Servants to search <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> his Justice Clark, who (he
said) stood by his Bed-side accompanied with hideous weights
cursing the time that ever he had served him; for by too great
obedience to him, he was by the justice of God condemned
to everlasting torments.</p>
            <p>Whilst they about him labour to cure his wounded Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
news came that <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> about that same hour
of the Night was departed to the other World at <hi>Edenburgh</hi>
and with no better Devotion than he was represented to the
King.</p>
            <p>After Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun</hi> had ended his part of this Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedy
of life, he seemed to the King to have returned on the
Stage, and in a ghastly manner with a naked Sword in his
hands, he thought he parted both his arms from him, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising
him he would come again shortly, and be more fully
revenged, till which occasion he should suffer these wounds.
The next day after this vision (which is recorded to have
been the seaventh of <hi>August)</hi> word came that both his Sonns
were deceased and that almost in one hour. <hi>Iames</hi> the Prince
(then one year old) at St. <hi>Andrews, Arthur</hi> one moneth old

            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> finding himself disappointed by his
Nephew of their meeting, and understanding it to have been
occasiond by the Rhetorick and liberality of the Churchmen:
having many of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> of his faction (whose
innocency interpreted his Religion to be the reformed,
though indeed it was of his own stamp, for he abolished
the Pope but not Popacy) by making prizes of <hi>Scottish</hi> Ships

Souldiers upon land beginneth the prologue of an unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>King <hi>Henry not only</hi> refuseth render the Ships, or give a

They had many daies suffered famine, and all necessities of
War; their vigour and courage was spent; that the <hi>English</hi>
fought far off, and they at home. There wanted not matter
to answer, but a man to deliver the King an answer; generally
they refuse to fight. To defend the person of their Prince,
the State and Countrey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would hazard their their lives,
and if they had any thing more dear. If the enemy would
stay on Scotish ground, they would do their uttermost to

turned it self into true fortitude, and men in good Order
retiring would not be too neer followed, that even flying
enemies should have Bridges of Gold. Now if they were to
charge the Enemy they would not have the Kings presence,
a man young, rash, valorous, upon whose life, not onely
the glory of the Battel, but the life of the Common-wealth
depended, his two Sons being Lately departed. For if the
fortune of War brought a period to his life, the Crown
would remain at the mercy of the Victor; that the Kings
glory was not little that he had in so short a time with so

two valiant Captains.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotish</hi> Lords beholding the <hi>English,</hi> range themselves
in a Battallion, desire to know the Kings Lieutenant General,

to take him to his Charge. Presently <hi>Oliver Saintclair</hi> upon

the Commission read in which he is designed Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,

Olivant, Gray, Robert Areskin</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Areskin,
Oliver Saintclain;</hi> The Lairds of <hi>Craggy, Aytoun, Langtoun,
Ormestoun, Waughtoun,</hi> many of the Kings Domestick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were taken Prisoners, brought to <hi>London,</hi> and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there till after the Kings death.</p>
            <p>The certainty of this voluntary defeat comming to the
King at <hi>Loch-Maban</hi> (or <hi>Carlawfroke</hi> as others) so astonished
all the powers of his mind that he neither had counsel nor
resolution what to follow, neither remembring his own
valour, nor the number of his Subjects yet flourishing; he
remained as one distracted, and abandonned of all hopes.
The Plot of the Nobles at <hi>Falla Moor</hi> against his Servants,
the refusing to give battel on <hi>English</hi> ground, made him
apprehend that the whole body of his Nobility had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
his overthrow.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall and Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> comming to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi>
he also returned; all so cast down that they were ashamed
to come within sight of each other some daies.</p>
            <p>After which, in a retired manner, he passed to <hi>Fyffe,</hi> and
from <hi>Hall-yards</hi> to <hi>Faulkland,</hi> where he gave himself over
to Sorrow. No man had access unto him, no, not his own
Domesticks. Now are his thoughts busied with revenge,
now with rage against his scornful Nobility: long watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
continuall cares, and passions, abstinence from food,
and recreation, had so extenuated his body, that pierced
with grief, anguish, impatience, despair, he remained fixt
to his bed.</p>
            <p>In these Trances Letters come from <hi>Lithgow</hi> to him, That
the Queen was delivered of a Daughter the eight of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi>
When he heard it was a Daughter was born, he
is said to have turned his face from them that read the
Letters, and sighing a farewell to the World, it will end
as it began (saies he) the Crown came by a woman, and it
will with one go; many miseries approach this poor
Kingdome; King <hi>Henry</hi> will either make it his by Armes or
Marriage.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall put in his hands some blanck Papers,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51978:127"/>
of which they composed a Letter Will, which whether he
subscribed or not, is uncertain. After which he said not
many words which could be understood, but mused on the
discomfiture of his Servants at the <hi>Solloway-Moss.</hi> In which
fits he left this world the thirteenth of <hi>December 1542.</hi> the
three and thirtieth year of his age and two and thirty of his
Reign.</p>
            <p>Some record he was troubled by an unkindly medicine,
aud that the Cardinal was conscious to it, but upon far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures:
for the event proved that his death was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ruine of the Cardinall, but of the whole Church-men
of the Kingdom, and frame of the Roman Religion. His
body was conveyed from <hi>Faulkland</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
Earls of <hi>Arran, Arguil, Rothess, Marshal,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
it; and in <hi>Ianuary</hi> buried in the Abby Church of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-rood-hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> near the body of <hi>Magdalen</hi> his first Queen. He
left behind him many natural children; of his Marriages
only one daughter, five daies old at his death, the Heir of his
Kingdom and misfortunes.</p>
            <p>This King was of a well made body and excellent mind,
if it had been carefully polisht; he was of a middle stature;
Nature had given him strength and ability equal to any; but
by exercise he had so confirmed it, that he was able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any travel, and practice all feats of Arms, as his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on Malefactors proved; for he was ordinary thought
the first of his Troups who persued them, and the last that
left the chase, being daring and forward. In his private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
he was attentive and liberal, yet spared his Treasure
that he should not want, and when occasion required, caring
for no charges. Never man did entertain Soveraignity more
familiarly, being of easie access to the meaner sort as to the
great. He was studious of all good arts, natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ally given to
Poesie, as many of his verses yet extant testifie. He was of
as great sorbriety as of little continency; he was a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
of learned men. The poor men loved him, the great
feared him; he made the rushy bushes keep the heards of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel;
he was thankful towards his Friends, dangerous towards
his Enemies. He infinitely obliged his people by establishing
a Justice Court among them, and bringing all sorts of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
from neighbor nations home. By the <hi>Germans</hi> he found
the Gold Mines of <hi>Crawfoord</hi> Moor, being unknown to this
part of the world before him, out of which he extracted trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
He left his Arsenals furnisht with all sorts of arms and
furniture for War. Now as in pictures not only the light but
the shadow is observable, let us look upon him in all his um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages.
This Prince in his long persuit of the <hi>Dowglasses</hi> seems
to have had a strange humour, that he could never forgive;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51978:127"/>
And most of his miseries may be traced to this <hi>Source;</hi> these
he would have extirpate, and the King of <hi>England</hi> could not
forsake a man who was his brother-in-law, and had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
obsequious to him: Seeking only that he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stord
to his own, out of which he was cast, not by any treason
or aspiring to the Crown, but of an ambition he had to be
near the King, and equal to any Subject: his own worth,
kinred and followers animating him thereunto; having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Kings Mother and one of the greatest Kings Sister of
those times.</p>
            <p>The burning alive of the Lady <hi>Glames,</hi> beheading of the
Master of <hi>Forbess,</hi> and after him Sir <hi>Iames Hamiltoun,</hi> turned
many of his Nobles from him, and made the Commons
detract him. For though they delight sometimes to have
great men made equal to them, when they find not evident
proofs and sound grounds of their sufferings and executions,
they abhor the Actors. Princes should remember that as the
people are their Subjects, so are they the Subjects of time and
providence.</p>
            <p>This humour of revenge made many believe if he had
not been prevented by death, many Scaffolds had been
embrued for <hi>Falla-moor</hi> Plot, and <hi>Solloway-Moss.</hi> The
Lord <hi>Maxwel,</hi> who had studied the Character of the King,
at that Road vowed (when he might have escaped among
his known Borderers) he would rather be the KING
of <hi>Englands</hi> Prisoner, and see him at <hi>London,</hi> than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home, and be shamefully hanged at the Cross of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He studied very much the overthrow of his antient No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
not considering that the titles of Crowns in Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kingdomes belong only to Kings for that they are the
most Antient Noblemen, and also first of the Primitive
Bloud.</p>
            <p>In his last years he was altogether governed by Romish
Prelates, dangerous Pilots in the Ocean of a troubled
State; that Body in which one humour signorizeth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
last long, and a Prince perisheth when he is governed
by onely one sort of men. Neither was he ruled so much
by them out of great zeal to Religion (being a Prince alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
given to his own pleasures) as that he found
them counterpoise the Nobility, whilest he swayed the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc.</p>
            <p>His death proveth his Mind to have been raised to the
highest strain, and above mediocrity; for he could die,
but could not disgest a disaster. He seemeth to have
had too much confidence in himself, and that he forgot the
conditions of Mortality. Whilest he suffered himself
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51978:128"/>
to be carryed away by the current of grief, and swallowed
up in the gulf of despair.</p>
            <p>All his faults are but as some few Warts in a most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and beautifull Face. He was very much beholding
to the excellent Poets of his time, whose commendation
shall serve him for an Epitaph. <hi>Ariosto,</hi> who knew him
onely by fame, in the person of <hi>Zerbino,</hi> whom he nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>So happie is a Prince when he cherisheth and is intertain'd
by the rare spirits of his time, that even when his Treasures,
Pompe, State, Followers, Diadems, and all externall Glory
leave him, the sweet incense of his Fame in the Temple of
Honour, persumeth his Altars. A Prince's name is surer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and more deeply ingraven in Paper, than in all the
rusting Medalles, blasted arches, entombed Tombes (which
may serve to any as well as to him) raised with such loss of
time, vaine labours of Artizans, vast expence, to be the sport
of the Windes, Raines, Tempests, Thunder, Earthquakes, or
if they shunne all these, of superstition, faction and civil
Broyles.</p>

as horrible an Vncle, as <hi>Nero</hi> was a son. A while after

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to a King than to suffer
Majesty, and that sacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
which a Subject oweth
him to be violated, and his
Fame and Reputation lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by other mens boldness,
whose presumption may lead
them forwards not onely to
dally with his Person, but
with his Crown. But his ears
are so often guarded by these
men, that he never heareth verities till he hath granted
what he cannot well amend, and his wounds be incurable.
If a Prince hold any thing dear it should be the Right and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51978:130"/>
Title of his Crown, which concerneth not onely himself but
his Posterity, out of which a small Jewel taken away, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it the less Radiant; And to all Subjects that should be
as Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> not to be approached. In every case we
should take greater heed to what in it is hurtful, than to what
is in it profitable; for what profit and commoditie any thing
carrieth with it, easily presenteth it self unto us; but any
one point which may hurt us, unless it be observed and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
taken away, may overthrow and bring to nought all
that hath been rightly intended.</p>
               <p>The restoring of the Earl of <hi>Monteeth</hi> in blood, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his descent and title to the Earldome of <hi>Strathern</hi> is
thought to be disadvantageous to the King's Majesty, and
that a more dangerous blow could not be given to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
himself. We may easily conjecture of things to
come and imagine them by those of the like nature which
have proceeded. The Stage of the World is the same still,
though in times the Actors be changed, and come about
again.</p>
               <p>For the Kings Majesty, it would be considered if <hi>Henry</hi> the
sixth King of <hi>England</hi> would, if it had been in his power, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
the approbation restoring in bloud and allowing of
the descent and title of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who openly
in Parlament thereafter made claim for the Crown, as in his
own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight, laying down thus his title.</p>
               <p>The son of <hi>Ann Mortimer</hi> who came of <hi>Philipe</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and sole heir of <hi>Leonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son to
King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, is to be preferred by very good right
in Succession of the Kingdom before the children of <hi>Iohn</hi>
of <hi>Gaunt</hi> the fourth Son of the said <hi>Edward</hi> the third: but
<hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> is come of <hi>Philipe</hi> the Daughter and
sole Heir of <hi>Leonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son to K. <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, then to be preferred before the children of the
fourth Son who was <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like reason may be alleged in the Title of the Earl of
<hi>Strathern.</hi> The children of a first marriage by the common
Law are to be preferred in the Succession before the children
of the second marriage; for the marrying of <hi>Elizabeth Moor</hi>
did but legitimate and make her children to succeed after the
children of the first marriage.</p>
               <p>As for the authority of a Parliament, it would be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
whether or not the Authority of a Parlament may
confer and entail a Crown from the lawful Heir thereof, to
the next apparent heirs. Or if an Oath given unto a King by
mans Law should be performed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it tendeth to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Truth and Right which stand by the Law of
God. Then if one Parlament hath power to entail a Crown,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51978:130"/>
whither may not another Parliament upon the like conside
rations restore the same to the righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s heirs.</p>
               <p>But the Subject resigneth all his right to his King. It would
be considered whether a Subject may safely capitulate with
his Prince, that is to say, give over and quit-claim all right
and title which he hath to his Soveraigns Crown, his Right
being sufficient, and if by his capitulation his heirs be bound,
and if it be honourable for a Prince to accept his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The trouble which <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> raised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is yet
recent to the Readers of Histories.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that his Father <hi>Iohn Baliol</hi> had resigned
unto <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> all the right and title which he
or any other of his had, or thereafter might have to the
Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> concerning any interest or claim which
might be avouched for any cause or consideration: He, <hi>anno
1355.</hi> gave to <hi>Edward</hi> the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> a full resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his pretended Right of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
As before, being assisted by the said King and the confeder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> in a Parlament holden at <hi>Perth,</hi>
where he had been confirmed King of <hi>Scotland</hi> by the three
Estates.</p>
               <p>It would be considered if the Pope, the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>
or <hi>France</hi> after some revolutions of years, seeking to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Estate and peace of this Isle, should entertain and
maintain one of the Heirs of the Earls of <hi>Strathern</hi> (as <hi>Queen
Elizabeth</hi> did <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the Prior of <hi>Crato,</hi> who claimed
the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> to reclaim whose Kingdome She
sent the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Drake</hi>) or should marry
one of them to their neerest Kinswomen, and send him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with power to claim his Title to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
as King <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth of <hi>Scotland</hi> practised upon <hi>Perkin
Warbeck</hi> naming himself <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York;</hi> to whom
he gave in marriage Lady <hi>Katharine Gordoun</hi> Daughter to
the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> and thereafter with all his forces, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
his said Ally in his Title invaded <hi>England.</hi> It would be
considered whether they had a fair bridge to come over to
this Isle.</p>
               <p>It would likewife be considered if the Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi>
though a mean Subject, these two hundred years, having
been debarred from all title to the Crown, and now by the
indulgency and exceeding favour of the Prince, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his descent in bloud and served Heir to his great
Progenitors, and indirectly as by appendices to the Crown,
if either out of displeasure, or for want of means to main<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tain
their estates, he or his should sell and dispose their
Rights and Titles of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to some migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51978:131"/>
and Foreign Prince, such as is (perhaps this day the King
of <hi>Sweden)</hi> who wanteth nothing but a title to invade a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
not knowing whither to discharge his victorions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It would be considered if that title disposed to that
Priuce were sufficient to make him King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Or if
establi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hing his right upon fair conditions, such as is liberty
of conscience, absolution and freedom from all taxes
and subsidies, the transferring of Ward lands into fewd,
the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> might give him their Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagiance;
or if he might redact the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to
give him satisfaction and compound for his right of the
Crown of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would to these be considered, If times should turn away
the minds of Subjects from their Prince, by superstition, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and absolute Rebellion, as what may not befall an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
ever wavering Nation? to an <hi>Aristocratie, Oligarchy,
Democratie,</hi> or absolute <hi>Anarchy.</hi> If the Rebellious subjects
and abused Populace might not make advantage of such
Men, who draw their titles from <hi>Evanders</hi> mother to trouble
the present times.</p>
               <p>That nothing could be more dangerous to the Nobleman
himself than this service, may be understood by the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clouis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> having understood that a Nobleman

Rocks (now by the chearing Rayes of your Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
taking not only motion but life) had with her Castle,
Temples and Houses, moved towards you, and besought
you to acknowledge her yours, and her indwellers your

the words of other nations far go beyond and surpass the

               <p>IN a time when men for reading of Papers concerning
State are challenged, it must be a great hazard to write
them, and a greater to send them from home, and the most
to send them to one so near the Helm as is your Lordship,
who the next day (perhaps) may put in the Princes hands
what is sent him. And then, though what is set down may
be free of great faults, yet must it pass and be understood as
it pleaseth the Prince to construe it. But what <hi>Marius Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
said to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> may be said to King <hi>Charles; Caesar,
qui apud te audent dicere, magnitudinem tuam ignorant; qui non

What a noise hath been raised in this Countrey by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
a piece of writing, supposed to be derogatory to
the Honour of the Kings Majesty! No times have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such men. Wise men keep their thoughts locked up
in the Cabinets of their Brests, and suffer the faults of times
patiently, Fools rail, cry out, but amend nothing. What
ever advise hath been given for the putting of Libellers to
the extremity of Law, I would say (withall humble respect
to grave Statesmen) that in a matter of a Calumnie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
with Subjects, a Prince can do nothing more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itting

them, as belonging nothing to him; and that twere better
to neglect, than be too curious in searching after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
So <hi>Theodosius, Honorius Arcadius</hi> were wont to say,
if any Man speak ill of the Emperour, if he do it of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it is to contemned; if of madness, to be pittyed; if
of injury, to be remitted. And <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great used

               <p>If these Papers for the Kings honour were not to be seen

why were they not suppressed and hidden? but is this the
way to suppress and hide them? to imprison, arraign, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
execute the persons near whom they are found? or is
it not rather to turn them a piece of the Story of the Time

What gained Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the twenty three of her
Reign, by cutting off the hands of <hi>Stubbes</hi> and <hi>Page</hi> on a
Scaffold for writing that Book against her marriage with the
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> save that out of horror of that new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practised
punishment, the people acknowledged her to be the
right and not uncertain daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight,
and she began to be feared, where before she was beloved of
her Subjects? whom a people fear they hate, and whom
they hate they wish taken way. A Prince should be more
violent in revenging other mens quarrels than his own. That
unfortunate Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the
third, could make good use, against the Succession of the
Race of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, in his Speech to the Commons of
of <hi>London,</hi> by remembring them of the strange proceedings
of King <hi>Edward</hi> against a Merchant named <hi>Burdet:</hi> who
dwelling at the sign of the Crown, and having said to his
Son, that after his death he would make him Heritor of the
Crown, meaning his own house, was for this Tale in four
hours after quartered, which blot is eternally fixed to that
Prince.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the third, who had ever
known than Pasquil against three of his Courtiers, <hi>Louell,
Ratcliff,</hi> and <hi>Catsby,</hi>

If his tyranny had not been mightily extended against that
poor Gentleman <hi>Collingburn</hi> the Maker of it? Ye will say, it
is in a Princes power to suppress such Papers by Authority;
That is the only way to make all men seek them, and being
found highly prize them. <hi>Tacitus</hi> telleth us of certain verses
of <hi>Fabricius Veiento</hi> against Church-men and Senatours,
which were condemned to be burut; as long as the reading
and finding of them was dangerous, they were much sought
for, and with danger read: but being afterwards licentiate
to be read, and the liberty of having them obtained, they
were forgotten and no man cared for them.</p>
               <p>No Prince, how great soever, can oblish Pens, nor will
the Memorials of ages be extinguished by present power; the
posterity rendering to every one, his due honour and blame.
It is true that great men should direct their great care to Fame
and hold nothing more dear unto them; and he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempneth
it, neglecteth those actions by which it is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
But it is pitty men should be more careful and studious
of fame for times to come, in which they are not, than of
honesty in the present time in which they live.</p>

Sometimes it is great wisdom in a Prince not to reject and
disdain them who freely tell him his duty, and open to him
his misdemeanours to the Common-wealth, and the surmis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and umbrages of his people and Council for the amending
disorders, and bettering the form of his Government. As
if a man should tell King <hi>Charls,</hi> That there is none in all
his Kingdoms here can reckon himself Lord of his own goods
amongst so many taxes and taillages, so much pilling and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
So that substance is dayly plucked and pilled from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men to be lashed out amongst unthrifts, that as <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi>
writes of the great plague in his time at <hi>Athens,</hi> Men
seeing no hope of safety spent all they had in one night: So
the uncertainty of enjoying and holding what they have for
the present drawes the thrifty and unthrifty to one end, for
no man being sure of Lands, less of moneyes, every man is
turned in a desperate carlessness of his estate.</p>
               <p>As to tell him also about this Subject who is the subject of
this Letter, the People say, Kings seeking Treason shall find
Land, and seeking Land shall find Treason. The denyal of
a Princes desire was the destruction of an innocent <hi>Naboth;</hi>
the voice of the people should not be kept up from the ears of
a Prince.</p>
               <p>As to unfold to a King, if Usury be not lawful at all (for
it is against Nature that money should beget money, and not
tolerate by the Mosaical Law, and in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> cap. 18. v. 13.
it is reckoned amongst the roaring sins, such as are Adulterie
and bloudshed) it being a sin in the persons of subjects, it is
a greater sin in the person of a Prince; for any sin is greater in
the person of a Prince, then in the persons of subjects: As sin
was worse and greater in Angels than men. Nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to a Prince which is not joined with honor; and the
State of Kings unless it stand in purenes and fidelity, it cannot
subsist in power.</p>
               <p>As to tell King <hi>Charles,</hi> what a strange thing it is so swear
a man for the true value of his own Substance. Since the
valuing of Subjects Lands and Rents, Rents were never
less, nor the Lands worse; a secret scourge of God having
followed it, the Countrey scarce affording bread to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
of it.</p>
               <p>Remember <hi>Davids</hi> numbring the people. In the times
of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>Regnante Cardin, Volseio,</hi> this was
held uncouth, strange and terrible; and no wonder if men

so innocently good: who preferreth peace before war, rest

If they contain mixed truths and apparences, they may be
neglected; If they admit no interpretation, but true and
flat railing, then is a Princes patience to be tryed, and the
Libel to be scorned. If they propound novelty and causes
of sedition upon apparent grounds, they are to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by good reason to be overthrown. If they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by way of Supplications for redressing of errours in
the State, it is a question whether they be Libels or not. That
Supplication of <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi>
the sixth of <hi>England</hi> against the Cardinal of <hi>Winchester</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>York</hi> may have place amongst Libels; for the
King is taxed there of notable dotage. As that by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the Cardinal, he had set at Liberty the King of <hi>Scots,</hi>
suffered his Jewels and houshold-stuff to be sold, granted
the Cardinal a Charter of Pardon for taking up his Rents,
which were sufficient to have maintained the wars in <hi>France</hi>
many years. The setting of the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
against the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the great friend of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
and many other points. Yet this being done by way of
Supplication, for redress of wrongs in the State, he was not
threatned for (perhaps) verity, but remitted to the Council,
and what for fear, and what for favor (saith the <hi>English</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
the whole matter was winked at touching the Duke, and

               <p>These who set their Prince on work to follow and persue
such an idle piece of Paper, if they had fair Judges, and
powerful enemies neer the Court, may themselves be
brought within compass of that same punishment, which
they would have laid upon others; as <hi>Perillus</hi> was brought
to take an Essay of his own brazen Bull: for no better are
they which relate, divulgate and are occasioners to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Libels published, than they which write them. And
these men have done what in them lay to make that Paper
publike, and have recorded in the <hi>Annals</hi> of this Kingdom
to all ages, what should have been smothered in the darkest
pits of Oblivion. They have often assembled the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Subjects to the great charges and vain attendance of
many Noblemen and Barons to see their passions put forward.
They have busied the Prince to condemn others by power
(a Minister of their attempts) and not purge himself to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
for such a Paper should have been answered by a
Pen, not by an Ax. There is no Prince living, no, nor dead,
but Subjects have and do both write and speak of after their
fantasies. <hi>Augustus</hi> in a Letter to <hi>Tiberius, Noli in hac re in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagere

not what, nor how to help <hi>Domitian</hi> to kill gnats with his
Dagger; having won points and conclusions heretofore in
the State beyond their hopes, they begin to foster great and

               <p>IT is more praise worthy in Noble and excellent things to
know something, though little, than in mean and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matters to have a perfect knowledge. Amongst all those
rare Ornaments of the mind of Man, <hi>Poesie</hi> hath had a most
eminent place, and been in high esteem, not only at one
time, and in one Climate, but during all times and through
those parts of the world where any ray of humanity and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
hath shined. So that she hath not unworthily deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the name of the Mistress of humane life, the height of
Eloquence, the quintessence of knowledge, the loud Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of Fame, the language of the Gods. There is not any
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51978:141"/>
thing endureth longer: <hi>Homers Troy</hi> hath outlived many
Republikes, and both the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchies;
she subsisteth by her self; and after one demeaner and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
her beauty appeareth to all ages. In vain have some
men of late (Transformers of every thing) consulted upon
her Reformation, and endeavoured to abstract her to <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical
Ideas,</hi> and <hi>Scolastical Quiddities,</hi> denuding her of her
own habits, and those Ornaments with which she hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mused
the world some thousand years. <hi>Poesie</hi> is not a thing
that is yet in the finding and search, or which may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
found out, being already condescended upon by all
Nations, and as it were established <hi>jure Gentium,</hi> amongst
<hi>Greeks, Romans, Italians, French, Spaniards.</hi> Neither do I
think that a good Piece of <hi>Poesie,</hi> which <hi>Homer, Virgil, Ovid,
Petrarch, Bartas, Ronsard, Boscan, Garcilasso</hi> (if they were
alive) and had that language, could not understand, and
reach the sense of the writer. Suppose these men could
find out some other new <hi>Idea</hi> like <hi>Poesie,</hi> it should be held as
if Nature should bring forth some new <hi>Animal,</hi> neither Man,
Horse, Lyon, Dog, but which had some Members of all,
if they had been proportionably and by right Symetry set
together. What is not like the Antients and conform to
those Rules which hath been agreed unto by all times, may
(indeed) be something like unto <hi>Poesie,</hi> but is no more <hi>Poesie</hi>
than a Monster is a man. Monsters breed admiration at the
first, but have ever some strange loathsomness in them at
last. I deny not but a <hi>Mulet</hi> is more profitable than some Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
yet is it neither Horse nor Ass, and yet it is but a Mulet.
There is a Taile told of a poor miserable Fellow accused of
Bestiality; and he at his <hi>Arraignment</hi> confessed, That it was
not out of any evil intention he had done it, but onely to
procreat a Monster, with which (having nothing to sustain
his life) he might win his bread going about the Countrey.
For the like cause it may be thoright these men found out
their new <hi>Poesie</hi> differing from the Matters, Manners, Rules
of former ages; either they did not see the way of <hi>Poesie</hi> or
were affraid to enter it. The verses of <hi>Camillus Quernus</hi> as
they are imitated by <hi>Strada</hi> seem very plausible and to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to some, but how far they are off right <hi>Poesie</hi> children
may guess. These mens new conceptions approach neerer
his, than to the Majesty and Statelinefs of the great Poets.
The contempt and undervaluing of verses hath made men
spare their travel in adorning them; but <hi>Poesie,</hi> as it hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercom
ignorance, at last will overcom envy and comtempt.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>MY silence this time past proceeded no waies of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness
of you, but from my many new cares, and
sorrows. The loss of so many friends this season hath estran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me from my self, and turned my mirth into mourning;
what civil arms and discord have performed in other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of <hi>Europe,</hi> a still mortality hath done in this. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Funerals these many years have not been seen as in this
one. There are few bands of kinred, societies, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
friendship, which by death are not broken here, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect of Age, vigour, ranck, quality; and justly this
mortality might claim the name of Pestilence, if the Dead
were deprived of customary burial. Well have some Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Divines guessed that this year should be the great
Judgement. What is recorded of the years 100. and 120.
that Church yards were not ample enough to contain the
dead bodies, but that new ground was digged up, is true in
this; and what of the year 1348. that the third of mankind
was sweeped from the Earth: we may say that though this
Countrey hath not lost the third, yet that the Almighty
providence hath taken away the tenth part of the People.
This is (perhaps) a part of that Judgement which the late
blazing lights of Heaven did signifie unto us, the defects of
the Sun, besides the malignant influences of other <hi>Caelestial</hi>
Bodies. This one year is enought to make men hereafter,
if not altogether believe, yet fear <hi>Astrological</hi> Predictions,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51978:142"/>
which though they fail in particulars, yet strangely hold true
in some generals. Heavens I hope shall preserve you <hi>ad mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora
et meliora tempora;</hi> to be a witness and Recorder of
their Just Proceedings on this Globe of the Earth, for the
Good of your self, your Friends, and all that love you.</p>

               <p>IF wishes could have place or prevail, I wish ye could be
moved to separate your self from the frequent conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and company of that envious Gentleman, otherwise
keep your self so close and secret in your demeanour, that
of your chief and most Soveraign actions he be altogether
ignorant. All other evils may be remedied, envy excepted;
which, though they have the worst that are affected with
it, yet as a plague it doth hurt to all who approach it. Give
me an ambitious man, though he were of a more transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
conceit than Pride her self, If I render him imagined
honour, praise him, use him with all due respects, I shall
in a little time turn him my friend. Place me with a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouret,</hi>
if I cope not with him, if I praise him in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his Mistress, he will be ready to perform like du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to me. If I shall converse with an avaritious, a little
gain will win him to me: onely the envious with nothing
is satisfied nor appeased, no drug can cure that plague, if
thou wouldest amend it, it must be with thine own life.
There remaineth no way to make him thine, save by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miserable, that thus he may pitty thee. The envious doth
not mark and observe any good in another, but fifteth onely
imperfections, and setting a part conditions and qualities,
which are praise-worthy in person, turneth his eyes to those
few blemishes which may be reprehended and amended.
Each other Vice seemeth humane: Envy the Vice and Sin
of Divels. A strange gangren of a perverse mind, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
happiness should turn it miserable.</p>

               <p>IT is much argued amongst those men, who will have a
reason of every thing, why good men ordinarily are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
of Fortune, and many evils arise to preferments.
The first answer is, that lewd, bold men have strong fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies,
and attempt upon many divers matters, which good
men by their bashfulnesse and towardnesse never essay to
reach. The next answer is, That lewd men suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51978:143"/>
to be guided by nature, or the starry influences, or
rather (being Fools) give themselves over (like Beasts) to be
carried by their appetites, and the virtuous are led by reason
which often contrachecketh it self, and by long meditation
and advise what to do, leaveth off all doing: and suffereth
others in the interim to carry the Garland; ye have spent
now many years at Court, and yet that Clock which hath
strock ten to others, is still pointing at one or two to you.
Have you not yet taken a distasting and Saciety of that old
Mistress of yours the Court? her long delay in preferring
you tells you are too honest. Me thinks ye should have a
desire to recreate your self at last in your native Countrie
with the remembrances of passed Contentments at Court, as
your Kinsemen here have a longing after so long a time to see
you, and unanimously now salute you.</p>

               <p>THis is no small Miserie of us Islanders that, as exiled,

                  </hi> Judgement: If it shall be my
good fortune to arrive in your Island, prepare no
Games of strength for our recreation, and after a saciety
of discourse and reading, let us not trouble our selves with
any sedentary pastimes; the Dies are for the end of a Drum
amongst Souldiers, the Tables for Goutish and apoplectick
persons to make them move their joints; the Cards for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to observe their discretion. But if we shall have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of change of thoughts, let us not refuse the Chesse, the
onely Princely Game (next Government) in the World, yea
the true Image and Pourtraict of it, and training of Kings.
Here is a King defended, by a Lady, two Bishops, two
Knights, at the end of the Lists, with two Rooks, Fortres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51978:144"/>
or Castles. Before those to prepare and make plain the
passages, march eight Pawns, <hi>Enfantes perdues</hi> exposed to
all desperate Services, every one standing for their <hi>Monarch.</hi>
The Deviser of this would represent unto us a game of State.
First for the Bishops; that nearest to Kings should be Eccle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
siastical grave Men, who by oblique, traverse and mystical
wayes (such is their passage) should effectuate their Masters
designs and safety. Though the Knights be not alwaies
nearest to the Kings, it falleth forth that even as the Knights
at Game of Chesse by their leap, giving an Escheke to their
Kings, the Kings are constrained to change places, from
which by covering and overshadowing themselves with
some other piece, in any other eschekes they may escape
free and exempted. So there is no danger in the State a
King should so much fear as the revolt of his Nobles. For
the Towers or Castles named Rooks, these are the walled
Towns, which serve for a Refuge for the conservation of the
Kingdom. Here is a King resembled who marcheth but one
pace, whilst all the other Pieces of the Chesse boord put
themselves now on the offensive, then on the defensive, for
his safety. To teach Kings that it is not for them upon whose
life the peace and happiness of the whole subjects rely, to
expose themselves every shock and hazard of battel, as a
Captain. Sith for the safety of the King, he may make
an extraordinary leap from his own station to the station of
the Rook or Tower, as to a Fortesse holdable and impreg
nable against the greatest assaults of his Enemies. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of the Lady is considerable, she may sometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
on the waies of the Bishops, then on those of the
Rooks or Towers, only she is hindred and inhibited from the
leap skip bound of the Knights, as a thing undecent:
Though <hi>Plato</hi> in his Republick permitteth women to fight.
The Game is concluded with the Mate of the King, that is
a fool or madman in the <hi>Italian.</hi> If the other pieces keep
not themselves, they may, as dead, be taken and removed
off the Chesse hyphen boord, but the King by loss of men loseth not
the victory, he may by a hazard carry it with the meansest
of his pieces, as his Army is wisely and warily conducted.
The King receiveth not that disgrace in imagination as that
they dream of his taking, but is enough that they bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him such confusion and disarray, that blocked up and
denuded of all support he cannot march to any Hold or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which brought to pass, we tell he is mated, that is,
either madman or fool. To signifie what disafter so ever
befall a King we should not attempt on his person. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
even in the midst and throng of all his best pieces the
mating of the King is the conclusion of the Game; which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51978:144"/>
shews us that on the preservation or overthrow of our King
the overthrow or preservation of our State dependeth.
The recompence of the Pawns is not be forgotten. When
they can win and ascend the furthest part of the Chesse-bord
on the Sunney side, as the first which mount a breach, in
this case they are surrogated in those void Rooms of the
pieces of honour, which because they suffered themselves
to be taken, were removed off the Boord, which in effect
is to represent the punishment and guerdon due in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
to good or evil actions. The Game ended, Kings,
Queens, Bishops, Knights, Pawns, peslemelled are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
thrown in the box, the conclusion of all earthly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and greatness. If <hi>Hieronymus Vida</hi> can be found with
<hi>Baptista Marini</hi> his <hi>Adone,</hi> we shall not spare some houres of
the night and day at their Chesse, for I affect that above the
other; and here have we plaied without a Chess-boord on
paper for a preamble to our meeting.</p>

               <p>I Never found any greater folly in the actions of Men than
to see some busie themselves to understand the accidents
to come of their lives; This knowledge of things to come
not revealed to us, is no ways needful for us. Wheresoever
this superstition is once received, Men are driven, and, as it
were haunted with Furies, and are deprived of all calmness,
quietness and rest. I never knew any who had recourse to those unlawful curiosities who liv'd the ordinary age of man.
God omnipotent removing his Grace from them giveth them
over to fall under the Fate of their own fears. By the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and violent desire of him who inquireth to know these
things, <hi>Astrological</hi> Predictions come to pass, not by the nature
of the things themselves, which are fortuital events, and have
no natural causes, being voluntary. The mistakings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
of these Predictions, should make us contemn
them, <hi>Astrologi fingunt non docent.</hi> The truth of <hi>Astrological
Predictions</hi> is not to be refer'd to the constellations of heaven,

and others take life. Eternal things are raised far above this

where every thing that taketh life must rott, the Stage of
Fortune and Change, onely glorious in the unconstancy
and varying alterations of it, which though many seem
yet to abide one, and being a certain entire one, are ever
many. The never agreeing bodies of the Elemental Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

too great neerness unto us) to participate of our changes,
never seeing us twice with that same face, now looking

there was a time in the which thou waste not? and so that
thou art not as old as that enlifening Planet of time? for
not to have been a thousand years before this moment, is
as much to be deplored as not to live a thousand after
it, the effect of them both being one: that will be after
us which long long before we were, was. Ous Childrens
children have that same reason to murmur that they were
not young men in our daies, which we have to complain that
we shall not be old in theirs. The Violets have their time,

rising from the mixture of the four Elements, which are
the Ingredients of our bodie, can not ever endure; the
contrariety of their qualities (as a consuming Rust in the

If there be a saciety in life, then must there be a sweetnesse
in Death? The Earth were not ample enough to contain
her off-spring if none dyed: in two or three Ages (without
death) what an unpleasant and lamentable Spectacle, were
the most flourishing Cities? for what should there be to be
seen in them, save bodies languishing and courbing again
into the Earth? pale disfigured faces, Skelitons instead of
men? and what to be heard, but the exclamations of the
young, complaints of the old, with the pittiful cries of sick
and pining persons? there is almost no infirmity worse than
age.</p>
            <p>If there be any evil in death; it would appear to be
that pain and torment, which we apprehend to aris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51978:152"/>
the breaking of those strait bands which keep the Soul and
body together; which, sith not without great struggling
and motion, seemes to prove it self vehement and most
extreme. The senses are the only cause of pain, but before
the last Trances of Death, they are so brought under that
they have no (or very little) strength, and their strength
lessening, the strength of pain too must be lessened. How
should we doubt, but the weakness of sense lesseneth pain,
sith we know that weakened and maimed parts which re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive
not nourishment, are a great deal less sensible, than
the other parts of the body; And see that old decrepit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
leave this world almost without pain, as in a sleep? If
bodies of the most sound and wholesome constitution be
these which most vehemently feel pain? it must then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that they of a distemperate and craisie constitution,
have least feeling of pain, and by this reason all weak and
sick bodies should not much feel pain, for if they were not
dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpered and evil complexioned, they would not be sick.
That the Sight, Hearing, Taste, Smelling leave us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pain, and unawares, we are undoubtedly assured, and
why should we not think the same of the Feeling? That
which is capable of feeling, are the vital Spirits, which in
a man in a perfit health are spread and extended through
the whole body, and hence is it that the whole Body is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble
of pain; but in dying bodies we see that by pauses
and degrees the parts which are furthest removed from the
heart, become cold, and being deprived of natural heat,
all the pain which they feel, is that they do feel no pain.
Now, even as before the sick are aware, the vital spirits have
withdrawn themselves from the whole extension of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to succour the heart (like distressed Citizens which
finding their walls battered down, fly to the defence of

sensible touch: As the flame, the oyl failing, leaveth the
wick, or as light the Air, which it doth invest. As to the
shrinking motions, and convulsions of sinews and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which appear to witness great pain, let one represent
to himself the strings of an high tuned Lute, which break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

the Body, and the form separated from the Matter of it,
cannot ever so continue, but is inclined and disposed to
be reunited thereinto: What can let and hinder this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but that some time it be accomplished, and obtaining
the expected end, rejoin it self again unto the Body?
The Soul separate hath a desire, because it hath a will, and
knowes it shall by this re-union receive perfection: too
as the matter is disposed, and inclineth to its form when
it is without it, so would it seem that the Form should
be towards its matter in the absence of it. How, is not the
Soul the form of the body, sith by it, it is, and is the
beginning and cause of all the actions and functions of it.
For, though in excellency it passe every other form, yet
doth not that excellency take from it the nature of a form?
If the abiding of the Soul from the body be violent, then
can it not be everlasting, but have a regress: How is not
such an estate of being and abiding not violent to the
Soul, if it be natural to it, to be in matter, and (separate)

doth find that death (sith it is in a moment of Time) is but
a short, nay, sweet sigh; and is not worthy the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance compared with the smallest dramm of the infinite

not subject to any corruption or change, for it is above all
motion, and solid turneth not; in quantity greatest, for, if

Glory to behold the thousand thousand part, the most pure
Intelligencies are fully satiate, and with wonder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

all that may be known or understood. Here doth the Will

Time (which is the measure of Endurance) did never enter
in this shining Eternity. Ambition, Disdain, Malice,
Difference of Opinions, cannot approach this place,
and resembling those foggy Mists, which cover those
Lists of Sublunary things. All pleasure paragon'd with what
is here is pain, all Mirth mourning, all Beauty deformity.
Here one daies abiding, is above the continuing in the
most fortunate estate on the Earth many years, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to countervail the extreamest torments of Life. But,
although this bliss of <hi>Souls</hi> be great, and their joies many, yet
shal they admit addition, and bee more ful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
at that long wished and general meeting with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Amongst all the wonders of the great Creator, not one
appeareth to be more wounderful (replied I) than that our
Bodies should arise, having suffered so many changes, and
nature denying a return from privation to a Habit.</p>
            <p>Such power (said he) being above all that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Man can conceave, may well work such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
For if Mans Vnderstanding could comprehend all
the secrets and counsels of that Eternal Majesty, it must of
necessity be equal unto it. The Author of Nature is not
thralled to the Lawes of Nature, but worketh with them
or contrary to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it pleaseth him: What he hath a
will to do, he hath a power to perform. To that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which brought all this <hi>All</hi> from nought, to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in one instant any substance which ever was into it,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51978:158"/>
unto what it was once, should not be thought impossible;
for who can do more can do less, and his power is no less
after that which was by him brought forth is deca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed and
vanished, than it was before it was produced; being neither
restrained to certain limits, or instruments, or to any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
and definite manner of working; where the power
is without restraint, the work admitteth no other limits,
than the Workers will. This world is as a Cabinet to God,
in which the small things (however to us hid and secret) are
nothing less kept than the great. For, as he was wife and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful
to creat, so doth his knowledge comprehend his own
Creation; yea every change and varity in it, of which it is
the very Source. Not any Atom of the scatter'd Dust of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
though daily flowing under new forms, is to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known:
and his knowledge doth distinguish and discern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what once his power shall waken and raise up. Why may
not the Arts-Master of the world, like a Molder, what he
hath framed in divers shapes, confound in one mass, and then
severally fashion them out of the same? Can the Spargirick
by his Art restore for a space to the dry and withered Rose,
the natural purple and bluth; and cannot the Almighty r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ise
and refine the body of man, after never so many alterations
on the Earth? Reason her self finds it more possible for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
power to cast out from it self a finit world, and restore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing in it; though decaied and dissolved, to what it was
first; than for man, a finit piece of reasonable misery, to
change the form of matter made to his hand; the power of
God never brought forth all that it can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then were it
bounded, and no more infinit. That time doth approach (O
hast ye times away) in which the dead shall live, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
be changed, and of all actions the Guerdon is at hand;
then shall there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and place shall be altered, motion yielding unto rest, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world of an age eternal and unchangeable shall arise;
which when he had said (me thought) he vanished, and I
all astonished did awake.</p>
