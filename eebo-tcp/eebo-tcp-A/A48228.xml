         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO THE
Authors of the Anſwers to the Caſe of the
Allegiance due to Sovereign Princes,
ſtated and reſolved.</head>
            <byline>By Dr. WILLIAM SHERLOCK.</byline>
            <byline>By a Gentleman of the Communion of the Church of England.</byline>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have with a little commotion of mind (as who is able to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
a Stoical Apathie in great Provocations) obſerved all your
motions for the two laſt Years; And although I did not expect
any great degrees of temper from ſuch Men when they had got
the Reins looſe and the Bit between the Teeth; yet I thought at laſt
the meer ſhame of ſaying the ſame things ſo often over and over
again, would have put a ſtop to your Career. But, alas, nothing
will ſatisfie ſome Men who having been a long time reſtrained from
venting their beloved Principles, think they can never take liberty
enough when they once have it.</p>
            <p>The Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or thoſe of the Profeſſors
of that Religion which is by Law eſtabliſhed, have ever been thought
ſo advantageous to Government in general, and to our Monarchy in
particular, that the late King, when he diſclaimed her Communion,
gave that for his reaſon why he would Protect and Defend her and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104342:2"/>
her Children; and it had been well for him if he had not been put
upon other Methods by deſigning Men.</p>
            <p>Their preſent Majeſties have however made the ſame Profeſſion,
and that not only verbally, but in their Coronation Oath have given
us the moſt Sacred Aſſurances, that they will preſerve that Proteſtant
Religion which is by Law Eſtabliſhed. Others are indeed by Law
tolerated, but ſtill that is the Religion that is Sworn to be preſerved,
protected, and defended, whilſt all the reſt are only allowed a bare
Indemnity.</p>
            <p>Why then muſt every one that has ſooner or later ſubmitted to
their Majeſties, and have heartily and ſincerely taken the Oaths of
Allegiance to them, be pelted by a parcel of Pamphleteers, only for
Aſſigning ſuch Reaſons for it as are conſiſtent with the Doctrines of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Practice of the Primitive Church in
the like Circumſtances? There has ſcarce appeared one Piece that
was written by thoſe of our Communion for the ſatisfaction of the
<hi>Non-ſwearers,</hi> but there has preſently been publiſhed a ſwarm of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
and malicious Pamphlets againſt it, written no doubt by Their
Majeſties ſpecial Friends, for they all pretend to be zealous <hi>Williamites,</hi>
great promoters of the late Revolution, the firſt that were in Arms
againſt the late King. Ay, and it may be if the truth were examined,
and they would but vouchſafe to ſet their Names to their Books, we
might find them as buſily Plotting againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second, as <hi>James</hi> the Second; and againſt him too in the
<hi>Monmouth</hi> Invaſion, as well as in the late Revolution.</p>
            <p>Well, but the late good Service has attoned for all their former
Crimes, and they have not only merited a Pardon for all that is paſt,
but a Reward too, and much good may it do them, I neither envy
their good Fortunes, nor would purchaſe the beſt of them at the
ſame Price, and with the ſame Hazards; ſo that they need never
fear I will be their Rival.</p>
            <p>But what need is there of all this? Is the late Revolution here in
<hi>England</hi> of that nature, that thoſe that have complied with it may
juſtifie their ſo doing upon the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or
is it not? If we can juſtifie it upon our own Principles, why are they
offended? If we cannot, what harm have we done them? Is any Man
diſcontented that the number of his Friends and Aſſiſtants are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by Men of various Intereſts and Principles, who have the ſame
great deſign to carry on that he had? Are not all the Princes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
at this time united againſt <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Principles and Intereſts in other things?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104342:2"/>
But then if it is not juſtifiable upon the Principles of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> but we muſt renounce our Principles before we can become
the Loyal Subjects of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearers</hi>
pretend, and theſe <hi>Williamites</hi> back them in; then is the late
Revolution condemned not only by the <hi>Non-ſwearers,</hi> but by the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamites</hi>
alſo; For if it is innocent it may be juſtified by our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and if it is not, their Principles will no more juſtifie it than ours
will. And I am ſure it is not for their Majeſties Intereſt to have the
World think they have done that which cannot be juſtified upon the
Principles of that Church which they have ſworn to defend, and of
which they profeſs themſelves to be. And which is more, of that
Church which is the greateſt part of the Nation, and of which the
far greateſt part of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry, Sword-men, and Crown-men</hi> of
the Nation profeſs themſelves Members; all which are by theſe
Men declared Rebels and Traitors by their own Principles, if what
they ſay is true.</p>
            <p>Here is a Myſtery at the bottom of all this, and it is not impoſſible
to ſet it in ſo good a Light that no Man will wonder at it, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it will not be my good fortune to do it, but however I will try
if I can; and if I offend them by it, the care is before-hand taken,
and I am reſolved not to be over-much concerned, tho' I expect a
ſwarm of venomous Inſects about my Ears for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When this Revolution was began in</hi> Holland, <hi>it was the great care
of theſe Gentlemen to win over the Church of</hi> England <hi>men by all
the Arts of Wheadle and Courtſhip that was poſſible, and the Advice
then was</hi> inſtead of remembring or upbraiding them with the oppoſition
and rancour which they expreſſed againſt our Perſons, Principles, and Ways,
let there be no Language heard from us but what may declare the Joy we
have in our ſelves for their Converſion, and the intire Truſt and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
we put in them. <hi>And a little after;</hi> It were the height of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
as well as the moſt prodigious Folly, to imagine that the Conformiſts
have abandon'd all Fidelity to God, and cast off all care of themſelves,
and their Country, upon a mistaken judgment of being Loyal and Obedient
to the King. They know as well as any, that the giving to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the
things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> lays them under no Obligation of ſurrendring unto
him the things that are Gods; nor of ſacrificing unto the Will of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
the Priviledges reſerved unto the People, by the Fundamental Rules of
the Conſtitution, and by the Statutes of the Realm. And they underſtand
as well as others, that the Laws of the Land are the only Meaſures of the
Princes Authority, and of the Subjects Fealty; and where they give him no
right to Command, they lay them under no tye to Obey. The ill effects of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104342:3"/>
Animoſities amongſt Proteſtants, <hi>pag. 16. Thus ſweetly the</hi> Syrens <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
us then; And becauſe what they ſaid was true, we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe it was ſincere, if we had not known the nature of the
Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo ſoon as ever the Work was done, and the late King was
ſhipp'd for <hi>France,</hi> all this Courtſhip was out of Doors: theſe Church
of <hi>England</hi> Men, theſe Conformiſts, were the Men of Arbitrary
Principles, the Men that had endangered the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi>
and the Proteſtant Religion, by their Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi>
or <hi>Non-reſiſtance;</hi> and all that they had ſaid before was now forgot:
and tho' the Papiſts were pardon'd, and the old Parliament Rebels
rewarded, there was no quarter to be allowed to the Surrenders of
Charters, the Oppoſers of the Bill of Excluſion, the Defeaters of the
<hi>Monmouth</hi> Invaſion.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> the Epiſcopal Party ſate ſtill and would have no hand
in the Revolution, and we ſee what followed, and tho' they have
ſince made dreadful Complaints, and expreſſed a great reſentment
of their Folly in ſuffering this Bleſſing to be ſtollen from them, yet
they have not yet been able to obtain a place for Repentance, tho'
they have ſought it with Tears. In <hi>England</hi> it was otherwiſe, we
were in expectation of a Parliament before the Revolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and the Members in all places were fixed, and it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of a ſudden to change them; and this caſe would admit of
no delay, ſo that moſt of the Members were Church of <hi>England</hi>
Men, and there was no helping it. This was a great Obſtacle to
the Deſigns of theſe Men, and have embittered all their Joys, and
made them ſo uneaſie and diſſatisfied that they can hardly reliſh
what they have got, becauſe they had not all they expected.</p>
            <p>They were very zealous to have got the Act for taking the Oaths to
Their Majeſties limitted to a very ſhort time, that Men having but
a little time to bethink them, might more generally have refuſed
them, as they did in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but the ſix Months that was allowed
(much againſt their wills) was ſo well imployed, that the Number
of the <hi>Non-ſwearers</hi> was very ſmall in compariſon, and if theſe very
Men had not made it their buſineſs to traduce all that took the Oaths
as <hi>Apoſtates, time-ſervers, and perjured Men;</hi> perhaps it would have
been much leſs than it was.</p>
            <p>And whereas the great Objection againſt taking the Oaths was
raiſed from the <hi>Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience, or Non reſiſtance,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
endeavoured the Reconciling the taking of the Oaths with that
Doctrine, was ſure to have all theſe zealous <hi>Williamites</hi> (as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104342:3"/>
themſelves) on his Neck, as well as the <hi>Non-ſwearers,</hi> and there
was nothing in the World they deſired ſo much as to have it thought
that whoever took the Oath to their Majeſties, did <hi>ipſo facto</hi> renounce
that Doctrine, as Impious and Heretical.</p>
            <p>There were ſome few that did not take the Oaths till the ſix
Months were almoſt expired; others did not take them till the next
ſix Months were almoſt out; and ſome few have taken them ſince,
as they were able to ſatisfie themſelves. Now all theſe have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
to the utmoſt degree by all the Party; and every Man that
takes the Oath raiſeth a new Clamour; ſo that it is apparent to all
the World, ſome Men fear nothing more than that there ſhould be
no <hi>Non-ſwearers.</hi> That is, they are afraid that all the Nation ſhould
unite in Their Majeſties Intereſt.</p>
            <p>There were ſome few that took the Oaths before they were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
to keep their Places, and have ſince ſcandalouſly diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the reſt, as far as they durſt; and this they took up as another
opportunity to defame all the reſt. And if any Man appeared againſt
them, preſently he was a ſwearing <hi>Jacobite;</hi> nay, we are made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
all the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men that have taken the Oaths are
in their Hearts <hi>Jacobites,</hi> which is now the ſcoulding term for the
title of <hi>Papiſt in Maſquerade,</hi> is now ſuperanuated and grown out of
Faſhion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> the <hi>Hobbiſts,</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth-men</hi> are all joyned in
one cry againſt the <hi>Innocent Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance,</hi> for very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ends I confeſs, but with equal noiſe and boldneſs; and Men
value themſelves very much if they have had the good fortune ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have been tainted with this dangerous Doctrine, eſpecially if
they were ſuch as have ever lived in the Communion of the Church
of <hi>England.</hi> Nay, he that was a <hi>Trimmer</hi> in the times of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, concerned in the <hi>Whig Plot,</hi> or the <hi>Monmouth</hi> Invaſion, the
Act of Excluſion, or the 41 Rebellion, thinks it is a matter of great
Reputation, or good Qualification, to recommend him to the eſteem
of all <hi>ſober Men;</hi> whilſt he that was true to the Princes that have
Reigned over us, durſt not once mention his Loyalty upon pain of
being thought unworthy of all Truſt or Regard.</p>
            <p>Now what is the meaning of all this? why all this pains to run
down a Doctrine that never did nor can do any harm, but when it
is abuſed by ill Men to ill purpoſes? And yet it never did them any
ſervice neither that moſt pretended to uſe it, to our damage. Are
they afraid our preſent King or Queen will make uſe of it to the
Ruine of thoſe Liberties they have ſo lately Eſtabliſhed by Act of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104342:4"/>
Parliament? No, this is certainly none of their fears; but theſe
Men have ſomething elſe in Proſpect. The Monarchy, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
both in Church and State, are not yet in the condition and
ſtate they would bring them: they well foreſee that if Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
ſhould be once ſettled in the ſame degree of Power and Majeſty
with their Predeceſſors, and that be backed by the whole Church of
<hi>England,</hi> ſupported and confirmed by the old Loyal Doctrine, and
bound upon the Conſciences of Men as it was before; when ever
they ſhall have occaſion to repeat their old Contrivances for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
or Unſettling it, here will be a powerful and a numerous
Party ready formed to oppoſe them, and therefore now whilſt the
Crown is ingaged in a Dangerous and Expenſive War, they are to
make uſe of the opportunity at home to make a ſtrong Party to deal
with it ſo ſoon as the times will permit them.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe there is no Man that is in his right Wits, but muſt ſee
that it is Their Majeſties Intereſt that all their Proteſtant Subjects
ſhould Unite as one Man in their Intereſt and Service. This was
made the great reaſon of the Tolerating the Diſſenters, and this has
ever been the Aim and Deſign of all wiſe Princes and States; and
our Enemies have ſhewn us how much they fear it, by their reſtleſs
endeavours to Divide and Diſunite us at home, which they ſeem to
depend more upon than upon any Forces they can ſend againſt us;
and the Proſpect of this was the thing that finally prevailed upon
<hi>James</hi> the Second to leave the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> that we <hi>might fall into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;</hi>
ſo that upon the matter, all the World has declared that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
and Diviſion at home is beneficial to our Enemies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to us.</p>
            <p>Well, then if it be ſo neceſſary we ſhould Unite, upon what terms
ſhall we do it? Renounce the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Obedience, the Title of King <hi>James</hi> both before and after his
Deſertion, and all the Merits of your Church of <hi>England</hi> Loyalty in
ſtanding by the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the worſt of times, and then
we ſhall Unite. Your humble Servant Gentlemen; Will nothing
leſs do? Are theſe terms to be impoſed by a tolerated Party, on
that which bleſſed be God is yet by Law Eſtabliſhed? I hope we may
Unite upon much eaſier terms than theſe; if we may not, ſome body
is to blame, and in due time will wiſh they had been wiſer.</p>
            <p>For my part, I believe our now moſt Gracious Sovereigns King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> are both <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> as Lawful King and
Queen of <hi>England,</hi> by an Hereditary Right which commenced from
the time the late King <hi>James</hi> left the Throne, tho' it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104342:4"/>
till the Twelfth of <hi>February</hi> following, as ever ſate upon the
Throne. But then I neither can nor ever will renounce the Doctrine
of Paſſive Obedience or Non-reſiſtance rightly underſtood, nor can
I yield that King <hi>James</hi> did forfeit his Crown, or that I was abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from my Allegiance before he wilfully threw it up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
the Nation; but I believe I am not equally bound to ſtand
by a Prince that Governed at the rate he did, as I ſhould have been
to ſtand by one that Governed according to his Laws and his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
Oath. So that no Man in the Nation is or poſſibly can be
better ſatisfied in Their Majeſties Title and Government than I am;
no Man was ſooner ſatisfied than I was, no Man has more Heartily
ſerved them than I have done, nor more diſintereſſedly, for I have
got nothing by the change, but I have loſt much.</p>
            <p>But then, after all my Principles are the ſame they were, my Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance
has deſcended in the ſame manner to King <hi>William</hi> and
Queen <hi>Mary</hi> as it did to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second and <hi>James</hi> the Second,
not altered in the leaſt in the degree or reaſon of it. They were in
their times the Miniſters of God, and the lawful and undoubted So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and ſo are theſe: The ſame God that
ſet up <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and <hi>James</hi> the Second, when ſo great a
part of the Nation did what they could to have the firſt of them <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,</hi>
and the ſecond <hi>Excluded;</hi> the ſame God, I ſay, has by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſet King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> upon the Throne; and by
his Grace I will bear the ſame Faith and Allegiance to them as I did
to the former; and for the ſame cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now if ſome Men are not ſo well ſatisfied as I am, but think they
are ſtill bound to perſiſt in their Allegiance to the late King, becauſe
he is not dead, nor has yet made a formal ſurrender of his Crown to
Their now Majeſties, what is this to me? muſt I renounce my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
becauſe others that have imbraced the ſame Principles are not
of the ſame Mind that I am? Or ſhall we of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
that have heartily and ſincerely ſworn Allegiance to King <hi>William</hi>
and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and defended them with our Lives and Fortunes;
ſhall we, I ſay, be Rejected, Traduced, Libelled in Print, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we perſiſted in our Allegiance to King <hi>James;</hi> not only as
long as he uſed us well, but as long as he would ſtay? Surely they
that gave ſuch Teſtimony of their Loyalty to one Prince, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a little Regard and Protection from another who ſucceeds in
the ſame Right. Their now Majeſties are of our own Religion, they
were our Deliverers out of a moſt uncomfortable ſtate, the hopes we
had that they ſhould one day be ſo was our greateſt Comfort in all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104342:5"/>
our Diſtreſſes; and they have accordingly delivered us ſooner than
we did expect, or perhaps durſt wiſh. And now after all this, what
reaſon is there that any body ſhould ſuſpect, that we that were ever
Loyal to all their Predeceſſors, ſhould after all the Aſſurances that
one Man can poſſibly give another, be ſtill falſe diſſembling Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and Traytors to God and them: And in the mean time,
others that have been Diſloyal to all their Predeceſſors, that have
been Plotting and Contriving the Ruine of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchy for
above Fifty Years together, ſhould engroſs all the Loyalty from us!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> If you are offended with this plain dealing, you can
thank no body but your ſelves; you have endeavoured to ſatisfie
your Party by your Arguments, ſuch as they are, and altho' I could
not approve of them, yet I never ſet Pen to Paper againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſeemed to be well meant for Their Majeſties Service, and
if they did not ſatisfie me, yet they might pleaſe ſome others; and
provided Men were brought over to Their Majeſties Service, I was
contented. But, on the other ſide, when I produced my Arguments,
I had preſently a parcel of your ſnarling Vermin at my Heels, which
I deſpiſed. And when the learned Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> came forth upon
the ſame Charitable Deſign, you treated him ten times worſe than
you did me; and becauſe I perceive he has not thought fit to give
you any Anſwer, I have ſent this ſhort Letter to let you know, that
if the Coaſt is clear, and I may have the liberty of the Preſs as well
as you, I will, one after another, ſend every one of you my Remarks
and Objections againſt what you have written againſt that great
good Man. And in the mean time I am,</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
