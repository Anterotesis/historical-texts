            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHO he was that ſent you the firſt Queſtions about Infant-Baptiſm, I know not; whether he was an Antipedo-Baptiſt, or a Pedo-Baptiſt, is a Queſtion: but your calling upon all who had any Doubts about it, to ſend in their Objections, argues a great degree of Confidence of your Ability, of doing more than all before: For 'tis ſtrange you ſhould attempt to call for all our Objections, when it appears you intended to write but one half Sheet of Paper in Anſwer to them; as if you could do that in a few Lines, which others, as learned as your ſelves, could never yet do in great Volumes; this ſavours (as ſome judg) of great Pride, and caſts much Contempt upon you, and leſſens your Reputation among wiſe Men who are for Pedo-Baptiſm, as well as others. And yet after all the great and mighty noiſe, you have not ſo much as in the leaſt touched the chief Queſtions, which, to my knowledg, were ſent you near a Fortnight before your ſaid <hi>Mercury</hi> came forth. And therefore to ſhew how diſinge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ous you have been herein, I thought it might not be amiſs to ſpend a few ſpare hours upon your <hi>Mercury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The firſt Queſtion you pretend to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is this, <hi>i. e. Whether Baptiſm</hi> (<hi>as it is</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95726:3"/>
               <hi>commonly taught) is the proper and natural Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of Circumciſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> As to what you ſpeak of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Nations, Linguiſms, and of Men being ignorant of Radixes, or Original Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications in Langages, ſeems remote to the buſineſs, and ſerves for little elſe than to blot Paper, or rather to darken Counſel: Certainly the Ordinance of Baptiſm, one of the two great Sacraments of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth not lie ſo obſcure in God's Word, either what it is, or who are the proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof, that Men muſt be at a loſs about it, unleſs they underſtand the Radixes, or original Significations of Languages. But to proceed, you would, it ſeems, have Baptiſm to be the proper Antitype of Circumciſion in ſome reſpect, and not in others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the Cuſtoms of the Jews in proſelyting the Gentiles into their Religion: ſo far you ſay indeed Circumciſion was not a Type, but a continuance of a Cuſtom. Now how abſurd and ridiculous that is which you affirm upon this account, may appear to all. Will you aſſert and ſtand by it, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was a Jewiſh Cuſtom, and ſo no pure Goſpel-Inſtitution? Doubtleſs, if ſo, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees might have ſoon given our Saviour a ready Anſwer to his great Queſtion, <hi>viz. The Baptiſm of</hi> John, <hi>whether is it from Heaven, or of Men?</hi> Mat. 21. 25. Certainly there was no Baptiſm of this nature of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, before <hi>John</hi> received it from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But, ſay you, <hi>If</hi> John <hi>Baptiſt undertook any now way of proſelyting the Jews into the Goſpel, they had not only ſtruggled with the Oppoſition of his new Doctrine, but alſo of his new Practice; therefore</hi> (ſay you) <hi>it was that this Cuſtom was continued, and had the Super-addition of the full force of Baptiſm,</hi> viz. <hi>a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> As you confeſs his Doctrine was new, ſo was his Baptiſm no doubt; for, as our Annotators obſerve, his Baptiſm was part of his Doctrine. Pray, what was the Doctrine he preach'd? was it not Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins? <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rk</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 4. Moreover, we do not read they were more diſpleaſed with his new Doctrine, than with his new Practice.</p>
            <p>2. But what Authority have you to affirm, Goſpel-Baptiſm was but the continuance of a Jewiſh Cuſtom, or was a Legal Rite, or rather indeed a human Tradition? for 'tis evident the Jews were not required, or commanded of God to baptize their Proſelytes, or others; for Circumciſion was the only Rite by which Proſelytes (who were Males) were added to the Jewiſh Church, as we find God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abraham.</hi> And if Baptiſm had been ſo frequently practiſed amongſt the Jews, as you aſſert, wherefore did the Phariſees ſay to <hi>John, Why doſt thou baptize, if thou art not that Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias? <hi>John</hi> 1. 25. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Baptiſm is directly called a Principle of the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. which Doctrine our Saviour ſaith he received from his Father. If it be a Principle of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, it follows undeniably, he inſtituted it, and gave it forth. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if Baptiſm was practiſed all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, I argue, Either they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it as a Moſaical Rite, or elſe as a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own: not, ſay I, as a Moſaical Rite, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> never commanded them ſo to do; for he ſpeaks nothing of it, and yet declared all things God commanded him; and did every thing according to the Pattern ſhewed him in the Mount. And if it was a human Jewiſh Tradition, what is become of one of the great Sacraments of the New Teſtament? Muſt it be look'd upon from henceforth to be nothing elſe than the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a Jewiſh Tradition taken out of their fabulous and erronious <hi>Talmud?</hi> What kind of poiſonous Stuff is this you trouble the World with? What tho the Jews, who had made the Commandments of God void through their Traditions, did practiſe ſome ſuch thing; Muſt you affirm Goſpel-Baptiſm in its Riſe and Original ſprung from their Cuſtom? And becauſe they baptized Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes both Men, Women and Children, muſt Chriſtians do ſo too? Sure the Cuſtom of the Romiſh Church in baptizing of Infants, as a human Tradition, is every way of as good
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95726:3"/>
Authority to warrant us ſo to do, as the Cuſtom of the unbelieving Jews. But pray take what a Learned Pedo-Baptiſt, and a Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this vain Conceit; 'tis Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſiones in lib. Novi Teſtamenti,</hi> pag. 313. <q>
                  <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cum videam ſummi ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii viros in his temporibus ex Rabbinis funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta petere veritatis,</hi> &amp;c. But when I ſee in theſe times ſome Men of the greateſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fetch the Foundation of Truth from the Rabbins, I cannot but ſtick at it: for whence was the <hi>Talmud</hi> ſent to us, (they are the words (ſaith he) of <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Synagoga Judaica</hi>) that we ſhould give ſo, much Credit thereto, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Moſaick Law either was or ought to be underſtood therefrom, much leſs the Goſpel, to which they are profeſſed Enemies? The <hi>Talmud</hi> is called a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Errors, and the foundation of Jewiſh Fables; it was perfected and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for Authentick five hundred Years after Chriſt, and out of it <hi>Maimonides</hi> drew his Doctrine, as all the reſt of them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot acquieſce in ſuch Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</q>—<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> either anſwer no more Queſtions about Religion, or take more heed to what you ſay: for your pleading for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, from ſuch grounds, all may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive tends to caſt an Odium and Contempt on the Chriſtian Religion. Therefore I infer, your Proof for this Practice from the Cuſtom amongſt the Jews about baptizing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes both Men, Women and Children, proves nothing; you were better, for the Authority of it, to urge the Decrees of Popes and General Councils; a Popiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation is as good as a Jewiſh one.</p>
            <p>But however, you do allow that our bleſſed Saviour did add ſomething to this pretended Jewiſh Cuſtom, and hath not only put it <hi>in full force, but alſo made it a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant; and this, ſay you, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengthened by ſeveral undeniable Texts of Scripture, which Anabaptiſts themſelves can never get clear of; and ask them, they muſt either be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or give ſuch a Paraphraſe as we do.</hi> The Texts are theſe: Firſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt. Buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond, that of baptizing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Red-Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. The laſt is the ſaving of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family in the Ark, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. But is it ſo indeed? did our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in inſtituting Goſpel-Baptiſm do no more than put a Jewiſh Cuſtom to be in full force, and make it a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant? Were you not learned and ingenious Men, I ſhould not ſo much admire at your Notions.</p>
            <p>2. But the Truth is, in the ſecond place, if you had not told us in your next words, to what purpoſe you mention thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we ſhould have been at a great loſs about it, or not well have underſtood your Intention; but you, like the ingenious Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſoon inform us, and tell us what 'tis—<hi>i. e.</hi> you tell us, you urge not theſe things to prove any thing elſe, but the Parallel betwixt Circumciſion and Baptiſm, or to ſpeak (ſay you) more properly, the neceſſary continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the old Manner amongſt the Jews of continuing their way of proſelyting the Heathen.</p>
            <p>3. Was it neceſſary then, that a human Tradition of the Jews ſhould be continued? I am ſure the Apoſtle tells you that Chriſt nailed all the Jewiſh Ceremonies of the Moſaical Law to the Croſs, and that they all ceaſed when the Antitype was come; and beſure had the Baptiſm you ſpeak of been indeed a Moſaical Rite, I mean appointed or commanded of God, it had vaniſhed with its Fellows: But 'tis hard Chriſt ſhould abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all Legal Cuſtoms, or Ceremonial Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and yet confirm, with ſome addition, a Cuſtom of the Jews own inventing.</p>
            <p>4. You do not ſeem to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your twofold Anſwer to the Queſtion; I thought you had brought thoſe Scriptures to prove Baptiſm the proper Antitype of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; but you urge the former old
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95726:4"/>
Cuſtom again, ſo that here's no Scripture nor Argument brought by you to prove the thing in hand. As touching what you ſay of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel betwixt Circumciſion and Baptiſm ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing; if in ſome things there ſhould be a Parallel, it doth not follow therefore Baptiſm was the Antitype of Circumciſion. What tho Circumciſion was the initiating Ordinance of the Male Children into the Jewiſh Church, and Baptiſm is that initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ordinance into the Goſpel-Church; this doth not prove the one the Type of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>5. But pray, what is it that the Anabaptiſts can never get clear of, or being ask'd the Expoſition, they muſt be ſilent, or give ſuch a Paraphraſe as you do? I muſt tell you, I know no Text more full for our practice of baptizing Believers, than that in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. We ſay from thence, that the proper Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of Circumciſion in the Fleſh, is the Circumciſion of the Heart, and therefore not Baptiſm; tho 'tis granted by us, that in Baptiſm there is a Repreſentation of the new Birth, and Mortification of Sin, which Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was the expreſs Type of: And this cannot weaken nor ſilence us, but rather ſtrengthen our hands. All that can well be inferred from this Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. where the Apoſtle mentions Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> Where Baptiſm is adminiſtred upon a proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it repreſents the Spiritual and Myſtical Circumciſion of the Heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the Soul is dead to Sin, or that he hath <hi>put off the Body of Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt;</hi> which may refer to the Power of his Death in the Effects thereof, by the effectual Sin-killing Operations of the holy Spirit on the Heart. And as we being dead to Sin, we are alſo buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, both in the Sign, <hi>i. e.</hi> covered all over in the Water, which reſembles in a lively Figure his Burial, and alſo in Signification, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Power and bleſſed Effects of his Death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the Death of the old Man, or that Body of Sin in us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now if this be not your Paraphraſe on this Text, we cannot help it. I know many Learned Men who own Pedo-Baptiſm, ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe; nor is there any reaſon for you to ſay we muſt be ſilent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if we knew not what to ſay to this Text: But what is this for Infant-Baptiſm, or to prove Baptiſm the Antitype of Circumciſion? Doth Sprinkling repreſent a Burial? doth the Sign or Figure of Chriſt's Burial appear in ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a little Water on the Face, and as it is done to Infant, in whom Faith and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not wrought? what doth there appear in Signification? Doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſay, that <hi>Baptiſm is the outward Sign of an inward ſpiritual Grace?</hi> ſure that is but a mock-Baptiſm, where there is neither the Sign or Figure of Chriſt's Death and Burial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor that inward Work wrought upon the Perſon baptized, which is ſignified, or ought to be ſignified thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Perſon is dead to Sin, and raiſed up by the Faith of the Operation of God to walk in newneſs of Life.</p>
            <p>But alas, this it ſeems is not the thing; 'tis not ſo much to prove Baptiſm to be the Antitype of Circumciſion, as 'tis to prove Baptiſm to be the continuation of a Jewiſh Cuſtom: <hi>for to ſpeak more properly,</hi> you intimate, that to this purpoſe, you mention theſe things. Sure all underſtanding Men, as well Pedo-Baptiſts as others, muſt needs loath your Notion; but I know you are not alone here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, there are ſome others who have aſſerted the ſame thing; which perhaps incouraged you thus to write: But to correct your Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſilence you and them too, conſider what I and the fore-mentioned Gentleman have ſaid. Is it not enough that Infant-Baptiſm ſhould be built upon no better a Foundation than the Tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Gentile Church, and the Decrees of Popes and General Councils, but that it muſt alſo be grounded on the erronious Cuſtoms of the Jewiſh <hi>Talmud?</hi> But to proceed, that

If Circumciſion muſt be a Type of Baptiſm, he hath ſhewed how, and how not, if it be ſo taken; but the truth is, all Types ceaſe when the Antitype is come, the one muſt give way to the other; but Circumciſion did continue in full force ſome Years after Baptiſm was in full force; for Circumciſion ended not till Chriſt nailed it to his Croſs; therefore it could not be the Type of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: and how a Shadow or Sign ſhould be the proper Antitype of a Shadow I ſee not.

they affirmed ſhe had like Power to change the Subject, and inſtead of Believers, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize Infants who have no Underſtanding. Pray what Precept of the Moſaical Law lay ſo dark or obſcure, that it could not be proved without Conſequences? Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> make every Law, Precept or Command plain, that he that runs might read it? and yet Chriſt is ſaid to exceed <hi>Moſes,</hi> being faithful as a Son over his own Houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. Thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences you have drawn, all impartial Men may ſee prove nothing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, what you ſpeak about thoſe great Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, as if they could not be proved without Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, muſt not by any means be allowed; nor can I take it to be true. Cannot we find the Doctrine of the Trinity in the Scripture, and that Chriſt is God and the ſecond Perſon, and that he was born of the Virgin, without Conſequences? Is it Wiſdom in you in ſuch a corrupt Age as this is, to lay down ſuch Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Were thoſe things the Matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between you and me, you ſhould hear what poſitive and plain Scripture. Proof might (as you know hath often already) be brought upon that account. But to paſs by this, I affirm the Baptiſm of Believers lies plain in God's Word, but Infant-Baptiſm is not to be found therein.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>Why was not Chriſt baptized before he was thirty Years old?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You anſwer, From the ſame Reaſon that the Jailor, the Eunuch, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were not, <hi>viz.</hi> there is no adhering to a Doctrine before it is inſtituted or preached; but, ſay you, Infant Baptiſm was much before our Saviour's time, as amongſt thoſe of riper Years ſince, and that, you ſay, is Proof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> It can't be Proof enough to anſwer the Queſtion, and as to prove Infant-Baptiſm it utterly fails; but if Infant-Baptiſm was much before our Saviour's time as an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, there was no Want of an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution when he was a Babe; and therefore your Reaſon why he deferred his Baptiſm is gone. Was it in being long before, and yet not inſtituted or appointed by <hi>Jehovah?</hi> Do you not herein implicitly confeſs that Cuſtom amongſt the Jews was humane? Nor will it ſerve your turn to ſay, it was inſtituted a-new as a Goſpel-Ordinance, becauſe you affirm Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm under the Goſpel was the Continuation of that old Cuſtom, with the <hi>Super-addition of the full Force of Baptiſm,</hi> viz. <hi>a Conſignation or Seal of the Covenant.</hi> Do you not intimate it was not inſtituted anew, but rather a Cuſtom continued? upon which you (with that Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſome others before you) ſeem to lay the great Streſs of your Infants Baptiſm. And if ſome Additions were made to the old Cuſtom, why might there not be ſome Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutions alſo? and if it were a-new inſtituted, it is all one as if it had never been in being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for the Right any have to Baptiſm and manner of Adminiſtration, and all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to it, muſt of neceſſity wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the new Inſtitution or Law of Chriſt: If therefore Goſpel-Baptiſm wholly depends on the new Inſtitution, then the old Cuſtom is gone for ever (had it been a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Rite) like a Legacy bequeathed in a Will, made void by the Teſtator's laſt Will and Teſtament; though ſome part of the ſame thing may be repeated in the laſt Will, that was in the firſt, yet the laſt muſt decide the Controverſy: but in Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament, Infant-Baptiſm is not to be found, nor was it indeed an Ordinance or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God before Chriſt's time. See my Anſwer about this in Anſwer to the firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>2. Certainly had it been the Will of God, Children ſhould have been baptized as ſuch, Chriſt had been baptized when in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; no doubt God who is a free Agent could not want an Adminiſtrator; he could have ſent <hi>John</hi> into the World ſooner, or have commiſſionated ſome other Perſon to have done it. But ſince the Holy Ghoſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel relates the time of his Baptiſm, and that it was not till he was about thirty Years old, it clearly ſhews us that adult Perſons ought to be admitted to that Ordinance only, and not

Babes: By which Example of his he hath ſtrengthned his Commiſſion, or at leaſt wiſe ſhewed the Congruity or ſweet Agreement there is between this Precept and his own Practice.</p>

            <p>You anſwer, Our Church denies not the latter, (that is, Dipping) but looks upon it as a clear Repreſentation of our Saviour's deſcending into the Grave, abiding there, and riſing up again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </gap> is dipping, and ſprinkling ſprinkling, which Act will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be baptizing whilſt the World ſtands. You ſay well, dipping or burying the Body in the Water, is a clear and lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt. And hence 'tis ſaid, that ſuch who are indeed baptized, <hi>are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm.</hi> To which you might have added, 'tis alſo a Sign of our being dead to Sin, and of our <hi>being raiſed up with Chriſt by the Faith of the Operation of God, to walk in newneſs of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence I infer, Infants ought not to be baptized, becauſe there doth not, cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them that glorious internal Work of the Spirit which ought to be ſignified thereby; and as they for this reaſon cannot be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Subjects of Baptiſm: So likewiſe it cannot be done by Sprinkling, becauſe that Act cannot repreſent thoſe Signs and Goſpel-Myſteries, which the Law-giver intended ſhould be held forth in that holy Adminiſtration.</p>

            <q>
               <p>Whether Infants have Faith or no, is a Queſtion (ſaith he) to be diſputed by Perſons that care not how much they ſay, and how little they prove.</p>
               <p>1. Perſonal and actual Faith they have none, for they have no Acts of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and beſides, how can any Man know that they have, ſince he never ſaw any Sign of it, neither was he told ſo by any that could tell?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95726:8"/>2. Some ſay they have imputative Faith, but then ſo let the Sacrament be too; that is, if they have the Parents Faith, or the Churches, then ſo let Baptiſm be imputed alſo by derivation from them: and as in their Mothers Womb, and while they hung on their Mothers-Breaſts, they live upon their Mothers Nouriſhment; ſo they may upon the Baptiſm of their Parents, or their Mother the Church: for since Faith is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the ſuſception of Baptiſm, and they themſelves confeſs it, by ſtriving to find out new kinds of Faith to daub the matter up; ſuch as the Faith, ſuch muſt be the Sacrament: for there is no Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an actual Sacrament and an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Faith, this being in immediate and neceſſary order to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat. And whatſoever can be ſaid to take from the Neceſſity of actual Faith, all that and much more may be ſaid to excuſe from the actual ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptiſm.

                  </gap> and his; and yet there is a third Device which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches, and that is, that Infants have habitual Faith, but who told them ſo? how can they prove it? what Revelation or Reaſon teaches any ſuch thing? are they by this Habit ſo much as diſpoſed to an actual Belief without a new Maſter? Can an Infant ſent into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>I Humbly conceive, that no Man knoweth what is a Duty but by the Scriptures: And ſince Pedo-Baptiſm cannot be proved by the Word of God, as every Man may know, and is generally acknowledged by the moſt Learned Aſſertors of that Practice; it therefore plainly followeth, in my Judgment, that Infant-Baptiſm is no Ordinance of God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but an Innovation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I therefore feriouſly query;</hi>

            </opener>
            <p>JUST as my Anſwer to your firſt <hi>Mercury</hi> about Infant-Baptiſm was finiſhed, and almoſt printed off, your ſecond Paper on the ſame Subject came to my Hand: And tho I was not concerned in the Paper cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Animadverſions on your other Mercury;</hi> yet, till a further Anſwer is prepared, I ſhall make ſome Reflections upon what you have ſaid in your pretended <hi>Reply</hi> to that Gentleman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sirs,</hi> You go too faſt to conclude, you by that Paper underſtand wherein our ſtrength lies, as (by this time) you may perceive, nor don't conclude you have it all yet.</p>
            <p>2. What you ſay about your pretended Proof of Infant-Baptiſm, from that unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tradition or Cuſtom among the Jews of proſelyting whole Families to the Jewiſh Religion by Baptiſm, you may ſee fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before I ſaw your laſt <hi>Mercury.</hi> Have you proved that Cuſtom among them was <hi>Jure Divino?</hi> or, if ſo, that it remained and was continued by Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> What you have ſaid about Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, being the proper Antitype of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, is alſo anſwered: Nor does what you ſpeak of Types and Antitypes, not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every thing, help you. Have not we ſhewed that the proper Antitype of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the Fleſh is that of the Heart?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> As to your Logical Argument, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> viz. An Ordinance once enjoined, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, is always in force; but the Ordinance of Childrens incovenanting, was once in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament enjoined, and was never repealed.</hi> Ergo).</p>
            <p>We anſwer, If the Ordinance of Children incovenanting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the Law, was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that Ordinance is repealed; Is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Circumciſion repealed?</p>
            <p>2. If you ſay notwithſtanding, Children of the Fleſh, or the natural Seed, being once in the Covenant, and never caſt out, (by reaſon that Law or Covenant, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenanting being not repealed) is always in force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. That the Old or firſt Covenant, for their incovenanting is repealed is plain; he <hi>took away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Alſo 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Hagar</hi> and her Son are caſt our, <hi>viz.</hi> the legal Covenant, and fleſhly Seed, and no new Law is added to bring them into the Goſpel-Church by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>i. e.</hi> the fleſhly or natural Seed, as ſuch. <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the Root of the Trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> Your citing <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. to ſhew what Baptiſm ſeals to Infants, proves nothing. We deny not, but all who are actually in the New Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith ingra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted into Chriſt, have right to Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Salvation; and that that Covenant ſecures and preſerves them to Eternal Life; therefore the Children of Believers as ſuch, are not in it: And if they are no otherwiſe in it than conditionally, that is, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ask you what Priviledg that is, more than what the Children of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Infidels have? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if they believe and repent, ſhall they not have the ſame Bleſſings &amp; Priviledges of the Covenant alſo? As to the Adult Profeſſors, we ſay, if they fall finally away, it ſhews they never indeed were in the Covenant of Grace. As to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult true Believers, the Holy Spirit ſeals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Salvation to them, and they ſhall be ſaved: a ſign of what is actually in them, is held forth in Baptiſm, there being nothing ſignified by that Ordinance as to a Death unto Sin, but what they experienced wrought on
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95726:12"/>
their Souls before Baptized; tho, 'tis true, they thereby, for the time to come, covenant to walk in newneſs of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly;</hi> As touching the great Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. where you urge Baptizing goes before Teaching, we have fully anſwered you in the precedent <hi>Reply;</hi> we prove, there is a Teaching goes before Baptiſm, and yet alſo a Teaching after. Why do you attempt to blind the Eyes of the unwary Reader?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly;</hi> To what purpoſe do you mention <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter? do we deny but that the Parents Faith and Prayer, may procure out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings, nay, and ſpiritual Ones too; and as much perhaps for their poor carnal Neighbours and Friends? <hi>My Servant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall pray for you.</hi> The fervent Prayer of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Man availeth much, but it doth not give Right to their Friends or Children to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly;</hi> As to your Syriac Tranſlation, that the Jaylor and all the Sons of his Houſe were Baptized: I argue, All his Sons, no doubt, were grown up to Age, becauſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>he believed, with all his Houſe.</hi> If he had Sons grown up, and yet did not believe, then, by your Argument, Unbelievers may be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; but to this ſee our Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly;</hi> As to your proof from that Paſſage, <hi>i. e. Suffer little Children to come unto me.</hi> Take the words definitely or indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it proves nothing for you; for Chriſt Baptized no Child, for with his own Hands he Baptized no Perſon at all; <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1, 2. 'twas to lay his Hands upon them, not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them. Moreover, I have before told you, thoſe little Ones <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 42. were Adult, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little Ones that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in me:</hi> I affirm, our Saviour ſpeaks only of ſuch little Ones as were grown up to ſuch Age, as in very deed did believe in him, and not Babes of two or ten day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> old. But, you ſay, we would have no Children proſelyted, but ſuch as <hi>Timothy,</hi> &amp;c. To which you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That according to the Original, thoſe Children that did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which word we have ſhewed ſignifies any common coming, (and may be ſuch who come in their Parents Arms). Let Babes come to Chriſt this way or that, he baptized none of them: I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as well, becauſe little Children come or were brought to Chriſt, and of ſuch are the Kingdom of Heaven; therefore they may partake of the Lord's Supper, as you infer they may be Baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly;</hi> Tho the Goſpel did not ſpread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſure you conclude all were to be baptized in all Nations whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Goſpel did come, or was preached; or elſe, as we ſay, none in thoſe Nations, but ſuch who were made Diſciples, <hi>i. e.</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent: for if but ſome in thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here the Goſpel comes, were to be Baptized, and not all, and yet more ought ſo to be; then ſuch who are diſcipled firſt: Pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are they, or how ſhall we know them to be included in the Commiſſion? For, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, If we have it not here, where have we it? this being the great Rule or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church for this Rite, unto which we ought to adhere in this Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly;</hi> What ſignifies what ſome of the Ancient Fathers believed, <hi>i. e. That Federal Holineſs of Parents made Children Candidates for Baptiſm?</hi> They ſaid, other things too that you decry as well as we, many Errors being early let into the Church: Beſides, we have <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or one Father againſt another, which is ground enough to believe you abuſe <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or to doubt of the truth of your Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly;</hi> You <hi>ask whether Children have not as much right to their Baptiſm as that of Adult Females? for 'tis no where ſaid, ſhe that believeth, and is baptized; where have we one Inſtance of Female-Baptiſm?</hi>

            <p>But tho Children loſe no ſpiritual Right by Chriſt's coming, yet they may loſe ſome Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Rites. As Miniſters Sons now are not born to the Miniſtry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Furthermore; becauſe Believers are made holy by the Operations of the Spirit, are all their Children made holy in like manner alſo? Bluſh for Chriſt's ſake! The Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> Sirs, only <hi>comes upon the Gentiles through Faith,</hi> not by natural Generation, as you imagine: As the Bleſſing runs to the Parents, <hi>viz.</hi> through Faith, ſo to their Children; they muſt believe alſo if they would be the Children of the Promiſe, or Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>ult.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If none are to be baptized by the Authority of the great Commiſſion of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. but ſuch who are firſt made Diſciples by being taught; than Infants, who are not capable to be taught, ought not to be baptized.

But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm was never inſtituted, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or appointed of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Major;</hi> If one thing ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed as an Ordinance without an Inſtitution or Command of God, another thing may alſo; ſo any Innovation may be let into the Church.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Minor;</hi> If there is an Inſtitution for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis either contained in the great Commiſſion, <hi>Matth. 28. Mark</hi> 16. or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe. But 'tis not to be found in the Commiſſion, nor any where elſe. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> none will deny.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. None are to be baptized by virtue of the Commiſſion, but ſuch who are diſcipled by the Word, as I ſaid before, and ſo the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to baptize all Nations, and Infants are part of Nations, therefore are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. I anſwer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3.

            <p>Beſides that, Teaching (by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Commiſſion) muſt go before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, we have proved; which generally all Learned Men do aſſert: if the Inſtitution is to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 8, 10, 16 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and 'tis alſo aſſerted by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> What is required of Perſons to be baptized? that's the Queſtion. The Anſwer is, Repentance, whereby they forſake Sin; and Faith, whereby they ſtedfaſtly believe the Promiſe of God made to them in that Sacrament.</p>

That Practice that tends not to the Glory of God, nor to the Profit of the Child, when done, nor in after-times when grown up, but may prove hurtful and of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nature to him, cannot be a Truth of God. But the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm tends not to the Glory of God, nor to the Profit of the Child when baptized, nor in after-times when grown up, but may prove hurtful and of a dangerous Nature to him. <hi>Ergo.</hi> See <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. where <hi>Moſes</hi> told <hi>Aaron,</hi> becauſe his Sons had done that which God commanded them not, that <hi>God would be ſanctified by all that drew near unto him;</hi> intimating, that ſuch who did that which God commanded not, did not ſanctify or glorify God therein. Can God be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Man's Diſobedience, or by adding to his Word; by doing that which God hath not required? <hi>Matth. 16. 9. In vain do you worſhip me, teaching for Doctrine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men:</hi> and that that Practice
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95726:15"/>
doth profit the Child, none can prove from God's Word: And in after-times when grown up, it may cauſe the Perſon to think he was thereby made a Chriſtian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and brought into the Covenant of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grace, and had it ſealed to him, nay, thereby regenerated, for ſo theſe Gentlemen in their Mercury, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 26. plainly intimate, and that Infants are thereby ingrafted alſo into Chriſt's Church. Sure all underſtanding Men know Baptiſm of Believers is not called Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only metonymically, it being a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Regeneration. But they ignorantly affirm alſo, that Infants <hi>then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> have a federal Holineſs; as if this imagined Holineſs comes in by the Child's Covenant in Baptiſm, which may prove hurtful and dangerous to them, and cauſe them to think Baptiſm confers Grace, which is a great Error. <q>How can Water, ſaith Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> an external thing, work upon the Soul phyſically? Nor can it, ſaith he, be proved, that ever the Spirit of God is tied by any Promiſe, to apply himſelf to the Soul in a gracious Operation, when Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is applied to the Body: If it were ſo, then all that were baptized were regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, then all that were baptized ſhould be ſaved, or elſe the Doctrine of Perſeverance falls to the Ground. Some indeed, ſays he, ſay, that Regeration is conferred in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm upon the Elect, and exerts it ſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Converſion. But how ſo active a Principle as a ſpiritual Life ſhould lie dead and aſleep ſo many Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived.</q> On <hi>Regen.</hi> p. 75.</p>

If the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, that Faith and Repentance are required of all that ought to be baptized, and in ſo ſaying, ſpeak truly, and yet Infants can't perform thoſe things; then Infants ought not to be baptized. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſays, that Faith and Repentance are required of all ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſpeak truly, and yet Infants cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be baptized.</p>

If Infant-Baptiſm was an Inſtitution of Chriſt, the Pedo-Baptiſts could not be at a loſs about the Grounds of the Right Infants have to Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Pedo-Baptiſts are at a great Loſs, and differ exceedingly about the Grounds of the Right Infants have to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis no Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As touching the <hi>Major,</hi> I argue thus; That which is an Inſtitution of Chriſt, the Holy Scripture doth ſhew, as well the End and Ground of the Ordinance, as the Subject and Manner of it. But the Scripture ſpeaks nothing of the End or Ground of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Baptiſm, or for what reaſon they ought to be baptized. <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis no Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable; Some affirm, as we have ſhewed, <hi>p.</hi> 15. it was to take away Original Sin. Some ſay it is their Right by the Covenant, they being the Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Others ſay, Infants have Faith, and therefore have a Right. Others ſay, They

have a Right by the Faith of their Sureties. Some ground their Right from an Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tradition; others upon the Authority of Scripture. Some ſay, All Children of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians ought to be baptized; others ſay, None but the Children of true Believers have a Right to it. Sure, if it was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt, his Word would ſoon end this Controverſy.</p>

If the Children of believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as ſuch, are not the natural nor ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they can have no Right to Baptiſm, or Church-Memberſhip, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of any Covenant-tranſaction God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi> But the Children of believing Gentiles, as ſuch, are not the natural nor ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham.

If no Parents, at any time or times, have been by God the Father, Jeſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, either commended for baptizing of their Children, or reproved for neglecting to baptize them; then Infant-Baptiſm is no Ordinance of God. But no Parents at any time or times have been by God commended for baptizing of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>&amp;c.

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear, becauſe there is no Scripture-ground for it, no Command nor Example for ſuch a Practice in God's Word. And if without Scripture-Authority the Church hath Power to do one thing, ſhe may do another, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

But the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm reflects on the Honour, Care and Faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and renders him leſs faithful than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and a great Ordinance, (nay, Sacrament) of the New Teſtament, to lie more dark and obſcure than any Precept under the Old Teſtament. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm cannot be of God.</p>

I am ſure a Man may read the Scripture a hundred times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and never be thereby convinced; he ought to baptize his Children, tho it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to convince Men of all other Duties.</p>
            <p>Now can this be a Truth, ſince Chriſt who was more faithful than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and delivered every thing plainly from the Father? <hi>Moſes</hi> left nothing dark as to matter of Duty, tho the Precepts and external Rites of his Law were numerous, two or three hundred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, yet none were at a loſs, or had need to ſay, Is this a Truth or an Ordinance, or not? for he that runs may read it.</p>
            <p>And ſhall one poſitive Precept given forth by Chriſt, who appointed ſo few in the New Teſtament, be ſo obſcure, as alſo the ground and end of it, that Men ſhould be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Proofs of it, together with the end and ground thereof?
