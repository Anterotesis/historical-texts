            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As for my ſelf, my Lord, I have had nothing but Affronts and Afflictions, and your Lordſhip hath vouchſafed to ſtoop to ſhare with me in them; and ſince your Lordſhip hath been pleaſed to own me in my Sorrows and Cares, I am thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to Addreſs my ſelf to your Honour for your Patronage and Protection. This Book, my Lord, is another demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rome</hi>'s deteſtable Practices, under which we muſt again groan, if we do not with one Conſent oppoſe <hi>Popery,</hi> to cut it off Root and Branch, and uſe all lawful means to prevent its introduction into this our native Country. We have again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the Contrivances of the <hi>Romiſh Intereſt</hi> againſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Liberties, therefore, my Lord, I humbly conceive, That thoſe that appear for a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> are for <hi>Popery</hi> by wholeſale, let their Pretences be what they will againſt it by retail, and would at once betray our Land to <hi>Rome</hi>'s Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Witchcrafts, and are content for the Guſt of a ſweet Morſel to ſell all, even God, their King, Religion, and every thing that may conduce to the Peace, Welfare and Advantage of King and Kingdom: all which appears by their ſlighting, nay oppoſing the kindneſs of God our Saviour in this great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their intended Malice againſt us, and by their fawning and flattering with <hi>Jeſebel,</hi> whoſe Whoredoms and Witchcrafts are many: they incourage and abet the deviliſh Intereſts both of

               <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to the great Confuſion of Prince and People, by which means the Goſpel of our Lord Chriſt is more affronted in the Houſes of thoſe that profeſs and call themſelves Chriſtians, than by the Congregation of thoſe Blaſphemers, who from a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Ignorance do with the loudeſt Calumnies reproach it. Theſe, my Lord, are the Traytors whom Judgment doth follow in this World, and Eternal vengeance in the next. My Lord, I am ſure your good Lordſhip hath not been unacquainted how the People have been deceived by theſe falſe Prophets, therefore once more I pray your Lordſhip ſtill to continue your Zeal and Affection to the Proteſtant Cauſe, and the Intereſt of your Country, in which Harveſt your Lordſhip heretofore hath been and now appears to be a true labourer, not only in Word, but by your Lordſhip's Care, Diligence and unwearied Activity.</p>
            <p>To this end God Almighty bleſs your Lordſhip with all Bleſſings both of Heaven and Earth, Body and Soul, ſo that both King and Kingdom may joy and rejoyce in you. I ſhall ſay no more, but proteſt I will in all good Conſcience do my part; I will appear more Loyal to my Prince than thoſe who by their accuſtomed Oaths ſay they are ſo, and will from my Heart, and with all the skill I have, oppoſe this <hi>Romiſh</hi> Dragon, and all its Votaries.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Exorciſm or Conjuration of the Holy Water, which is mingled together with Water and Salt, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak firſt of all to the Salt, which can neither ſpeak, nor hear, nor have any ſenſe in it, on this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I conjure thee, thou Creature of Salt, by the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> living God, by the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> true God, by the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> holy God, even by the God which through <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet commanded thee to be caſt into the Water, that the barrenneſs of the Water might be healed; to the intent that thou maiſt be made a conjured or bewitched Salt unto the ſalvation of them that believe: and that unto all ſuch as receive thee thou maiſt be health of ſoul and body: and that from out of the place wherein thou ſhalt be ſprinkled, may flee away and depart all phantaſie and wickedneſs or craftineſs of the Devils ſubtilty, and every unclean ſpirit may give place, being conjured by him who ſhall come to judge both the quick and the dead, and the World through fire.</hi> Amen.</q>
               <p>To ſpeak nothing of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Exorciſms or Conjurations, which they moſt wickedly uſe in charming the good Creatures of God, againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the holy Ghoſt, perſuading the ſimple Multitude, that through theſe Benedictions, Croſſings, Conjurings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they be holier than when God at the beginning made them, notwithſtanding <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth, <hi>That God beheld all the things that he had made, and they were excellently good.</hi> What Chriſtian heart can ſuffer ſuch and ſo great Blaſphemies, that that Virtue and Power ſhould be attributed to a Creature without life, which is only due to the only begotten Son of the living God? Is Salt now through their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings become of ſuch force, might, and ſtrength, that it brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that believe, and health both of body and ſoul? St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is Salvation in none other but in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Neither is there any Name under heaven given unto Men wherein they may be ſaved, but only the Name of Jeſus. Is not Chriſt called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a Saviour,</hi> at the appointment of God the Father, to declare, That he alone ſaveth his People from their ſins? Doth not all the Scripture teſtifie, That by Chriſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56275:4"/>
only and alone we are juſtified and ſaved, yea, and made inheritors of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory? Why then do the blaſphemous <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſteal away the glory of our Salvation from Chriſt, and give it to Creatures? Is Chriſt's ear ſo ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that it can no more hear? Is Chriſt's hand ſo ſhortned, that it can no more help? <hi>Ah curſed is that Man that putteth his truſt in any Creature, and ſuffereth his heart to depart from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, They give ſuch virtue to their bewitched Salt, that it is able to drive away Devils and unclean Spirits, whereſoever and whenſoever it be ſprinkled. O blaſphemous Prieſts! When Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples into the World to Preach the Goſpel, he ſaid, <hi>that they ſhould caſt out Devils by his Name,</hi> that is to ſay, by his power and might. He ſaith not by the ſprinkling of holy Water. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth us to put on the ſhield of Faith, and with that to quench the fiery darts of Satan: ſo likewiſe doth St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Be ye ſober and watch, for your adverſary the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour, whom ſee that ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with a ſtrong faith.</hi> In the Hiſtory of the Goſpel we read, that Chriſt drove away the Devil with the word of God. And in another place of the Goſpel he ſpeaketh of a certain kind of Devils which are not caſt out but by Prayer and Faſting. Thus are we taught in the Word of God, that by the Name of Chriſt, by Faith, by the holy Scripture, by Prayer and Faſting, the Devil is expell'd and put out: But that he is driven away by holy Water, we find in no place.</p>
               <p>And in the Prayer that followeth, the Popiſh Conjurer deſireth of God, that the conjured and bewitched Salt may be unto all ſuch as receive it, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind and body, ſo that whatſoever ſhall be touched or ſprinkled by it, may be void of all uncleanneſs, and of every aſſault of ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p>Here ſingeth the conjuring <hi>Papiſt</hi> one and the ſame ſong; as before, ſo likewiſe here he goeth about to bring ſalvation both of mind and body to the People from his bewitched Salt, when, as we have heard, all ſalvation cometh from God alone, through faith in the blood of Chriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>By grace are you ſaved through faith, yea and that not of your ſelves.</hi> It is the gift of God, and cometh not of works, becauſe no man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
               <p>If ſalvation come not unto us through thoſe good Works which we work at the appointment of God, but is the free gift of God alone, as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith alſo in another place, <hi>Everlaſting life is the gift God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> With what face than do our Popiſh ſacrificers attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the virtue of ſalvation to a beggerly Ceremony, invented by the idle brain of ſome enemy of God, and no where commanded, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the holy Scripture, as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel, <hi>They worſhip me in vain, teaching Doctrins which are the Commandments of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas the Maſs-monger prayeth, <hi>That whatſoever be touched or ſprinkled by it may be void of all uncleanneſs:</hi> we ſhall underſtand, that it is God alone, which through Faith purifieth and cleanſeth us both in body and ſoul. Therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth unto God, ſaying, <hi>A clean heart create thou in me, O God, and a right ſpirit renew thou in my innermoſt parts.</hi> And God himſelf by the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I will pour upon you clean water, and ye ſhall be cleanſed from all your iniquities, yea from all your Idols will I cleanſe you: And I will give you a new heart and put a new ſpirit in you,</hi> &amp;c. This
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56275:4"/>
clean Water which God promiſeth here to pour upon his People, is not the conjured Water of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſeaſoned with Salt, but it is the holy Ghoſt which by Faith is received of the true Chriſtians. And are not theſe the words of bleſſed St. <hi>Luke, By faith hath he purified and cleanſed their hearts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the avoiding of every aſſault of ſpiritual wickedneſs, whereby is underſtood the work of Satan and of his infernal Army imployed unto the deſtruction of the faithful: We have before heard, that neither Salt nor Water, nor any thing of like condition, altho' never ſo much bleſſed, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, exorciſed, conjured and bewitched, is of ſuch force, that they may be able to reſiſt, and ſo quench the fiery darts of Satan. By the Name of Chriſt, by Faith, by the Word of God, by Prayer, and Faſting, is this brought to paſs, ſo that by this means we obtain and get glorious Victories over all Spiritual Wickedneſs, as it is written, <hi>O Hell, I will be thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: O Hell, where is thy victory?</hi> God be thanked which hath given us the Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, As they handle the Salt, ſo do they likewiſe the Water: They bleſs, they ſanctifie, they exorciſe, they conjure, they charge, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, they charm, they bewitch the Water, ſpeaking unto it as a thing having life, on this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I conjure thee, thou Creature of Water, in the Name of God the Father Almighty <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, and in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> his Son our Lord, and in the virtue of <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> the holy Ghoſt, that thou be a conjured Water, to expel all Power of the Enemy, and that thou maiſt be able to root out and utterly to diſplace the Enemy himſelf with his Apoſtatick Angels, by the virtue of the ſame our Lord Jeſu Chriſt, who ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead, and the World, thro' fire.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>As before in the Conjuration of the Salt, the Exorciſt and Conjurer went about by charming, to make it of ſufficient virtue to expel and drive away Satan and all his Miniſters, ſo likewiſe doth he here in the exorciſing of the Water. But how wickedly and fooliſhly he doth this, we have before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently heard.</p>
               <p>In the Prayer unto God, that followeth immediately after, the Conjurer is more mad, and as one out of his wits, he prayeth God, that his bewitched Water may be of ſuch virtue and ſtrength, that whatſoever this Water ſhall ſprinkle in houſes or places of the faithful, may be void of all uncleanneſs, and delivered from harm. That no noiſom ſpirit remain there, nor no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt air, but that they may avoid all the laying in wait of the privy Enemy: and that if there be any thing that is contrary to the health and quietneſs of the Inhabitants, it may, through the ſprinkling of this Water, depart away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Prayer which he maketh after he hath mingled the Water and Salt together, he beſeecheth God, that whereſoever this Water thus conjured be ſprinkled, all noiſomneſs of the unclean ſpirit may be caſt out, and the terror of the venimous ſerpent expelled far away, and the preſence of the holy Ghoſt may vouchſafe to be preſent.</p>
               <p>And in the next Prayer following, he deſireth of God, that he will grant by the ſprinkling of this bewitched Water, health of mind, ſafety of body, conſervation of health, ſecurity of hope, and ſtrength of faith.</p>
               <p>Who ſeeth not how this Popiſh Exorciſt and wicked Conjurer goeth about by this heatheniſh Ceremony to obſcure the glory of Chriſt and his death,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56275:5"/>
while he goeth about to attribute that to the idle invention of Man, which is only given to the faithful of God alone, through the Lord Chriſt his dearly beloved and only begotten Son. For what can Chriſt bring unto us, but free deliverance from Satan and his Miniſters, freedom from all ſin and uncleanneſs, health of body and mind, quietneſs of Conſcience, ſecurity of hope, ſtrength of faith, and in fine, everlaſting Life? All theſe things bring the bewitched Water, by the Doctrin of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to them that be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it. And is this any other thing than to make Chriſt <hi>Jack out of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and to place a new Saviour in his ſtead? Wo unto thee thou Pope and thou Devil: Ah thou Antichriſt, who in thy Antichriſtian Doctrin teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Captives and Bond-ſlaves to ſeek ſalvation in this thy beggarly Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and to ſay theſe words, when they take this thy conjured and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Water, <hi>Aqua benedicta ſit mihi Salus &amp; Vita:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>This bleſſed</hi> (or rather bewitched) <hi>Water be unto me Salvation and Life.</hi> O blaſphemy paſſing all blaſphemies! Water utterly abuſed to bring Salvation and everlaſting Life! O damnable Doctrin! Salvation cometh by none but by him alone who is the Saviour of the World, even the Lord Jeſus, who only and alone ſaveth his People from their ſins: as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is Salvation in none other but in the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Neither is there any other Name given unto Men, wherein they may be ſaved, but only the Name of the Lord Jeſus. And as concerning everlaſting Life, ſaith not the Lord Chriſt of himſelf in this manner? <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, although he were dead, yet ſhall he live, and every one that liveth and believeth in me, he ſhall never die.</hi> Again he ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</hi> Likewiſe ſaith St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> of this Chriſt the Lord, <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God hath everlaſting life, but he that believeth not on the Son of God hath not life, but the wrath and vengeance of God abideth upon him.</hi> He ſaith not, He that ſprinkleth himſelf with holy Water hath everlaſting Life, but he that believeth on the Son of God hath everlaſting Life. Neither ſaith he, He that ſprinkleth not himſelf with holy Water hath not Life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him: but he ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not on the Son of God hath not life,</hi> &amp;c. And St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>This is the true God, and everlaſting life.</hi> And are not theſe the words of bleſſed St. <hi>Paul, Everlaſting life is the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> He ſaith not, Through the ſprinkling of holy Water.</p>
               <p>Hence it evidently appears how greatly the wicked <hi>Papiſts</hi> in times paſt, (and ſtill do in ſome places) have abuſed the ſimple Chriſtians, while by this and ſuch other like Ceremonies, they have taught the People to ſeek Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of Body and Soul, Victory over Satan, and all his infernal Army, quietneſs of Conſcience, freedom from all Sin and Uncleanneſs, ſecurity of Hope, corroboration and ſtrength of Faith, and, in fine, what not? Is not this to deny the Lord that bought them? Is not this to make Merchandiſe of the People? Is not this to tread the blood of Chriſt under foot, and to count it of no force? God deſtroy thee and thy Kingdom, O Antichriſt, that the glory alone may be the Lord's. But let us behold more of their <hi>wicked Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms and Conjurations.</hi>

               <head>Of HOLY BREAD.</head>
               <p>AS the <hi>Papiſts</hi> teach their Captives to ſeek ſalvation both of body and ſoul in their conjured Water, ſo likewiſe do they in their bewitched Bread: for in the Exorciſing or Conjuring thereof they uſe theſe words:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Bleſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> thou O Lord this Creature of Bread, as thou didſt bleſs the five Loaves in the Wilderneſs, that as many as taſt of it may receive health both of Body and Soul.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Here have we the very ſame ſour and ſtinking leaven of the Papiſtical Phariſees that we had before. The crafty Conjurer and ſubtle Sorcerer, to cloak his wicked doings, putteth Chriſt in remembrance how he bleſſed five Loaves in the wilderneſs, when he fed five Thouſand People, as we read in the Goſpel. And he meaneth by bleſſing, nothing elſe than the wagging of the two fore-fingers of the right hand, as the manner of the Popiſh Biſhops is to bleſs the People, and to make them never the better. But Chriſt's bleſſing was Prayer and Thankſgiving to his heavenly Father for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which he bountifully doth daily beſtow upon his Creatures, but eſpecially upon Mankind.</p>
               <p>And methinks that the Prayer of the Popiſh Prieſt is very large, in that he deſireth of God, that as many as taſt of that conjured Bread may receive health both of Body and Soul. What if <hi>Mag Pie,</hi> or <hi>Jack Daw,</hi> or <hi>Philip Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> ſhould chance to eat of it, as it may happen (hath it not been known that the little god of the Altar hath been eaten and devoured of <hi>Mother Mouſe</hi> and <hi>Will. Worm)</hi> ſhould they alſo, through the taſting and eating thereof, receive health and ſalvation both of body and ſoul? A foul and a great overſight. The almighty God ordained this his Creature of Bread for the ſuſtentation and preſervation of the body, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> utterly abuſing it, tranſpoſe it unto the ſalvation both of body and ſoul, and teach us to ſeek health both of body and mind in this beggarly Ceremony, being an idle invention of their moſt idle brain: When we are ſufficiently taught in the holy Scriptures, That all our Salvation cometh from God, through Faith in Chriſt, and not from holy Bread and holy Water.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have another Bleſſing of Bread, which is this:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O Lord, holy Father, almighty eternal God, vouchſafe <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to bleſs this Bread with thy holy ſpiritual Benediction, that unto all thoſe which receive it, it may be ſalvation of mind and body, and a ſafeguard againſt all Diſeaſes, and all laying wait of the Enemy.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>In this Prayer we have not only, that the Popiſh holy Bread bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mind and body unto all thoſe which receive it, but alſo that it is a ſafeguard againſt all Diſeaſes, and a defence againſt all layings in wait of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Will any Man be free from the Pox, the Piles, a Feaver, or any other kind of Diſeaſe? let him eat holy Bread, and by the Doctrin of the Pope, he ſhall be free from all evil Maladies. If this were true, as it is moſt falſe, it were a very ready way and of little charge to cure Diſeaſes: And by this means
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56275:6"/>
alſo ſhould we not only chaſe away all Infirmities out of the Country, but alſo be free from the torments of Chyrurgions, and the heavy Counſels of Phyſicians, and from the Charges of them both. This is therefore a falſe fancy of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to teach the ſimple and ignorant People to believe, that by eating this their Bread, they ſhall be free from all Diſeaſes. Hence it hath come to paſs in times paſt, that many would carry home part of the holy Bread in their Napkin, and put it in their Pottage, believing that that part of the holy Bread which they did eat dry in the Church, ſhould ſtand inſtead of their Table Bread all the week after, if they ſhould chance to die. Again, that that part which they carried home, and did put in their Pottage, ſhould preſerve them from all Sickneſs and Diſeaſes. O blindneſs, rather worthy to be lamented than to be laughed at! And whereas they attribute to their holy Bread power to deliver the receivers thereof from all lying in wait of the Enemies, who knoweth not what a ſlender defence a morſel of bread is againſt our Enemies, whether we reſpect the ſpiritual or the corporal? Satan is a mighty Prince, and in working miſchief is more ſubtle and more crafty than to be reſiſted with a morſel of bread. The ſame may we ſay of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily adverſaries. A Man of credit, dead ſome years ſince, ſaith, That when he was a Child, he knew certain old women in his Country which always carried about them certain pieces of holy Bread in the Ears of their Caps, being certainly perſuaded, and aſſuredly believing, that carying that Bread about with them, they ſhould eaſily avoid the danger of evil Spirits, and be free from the wicked Arts of their Enemies, ſo that no harm ſhould chance to them that day, neither ſpiritually nor corporally. The younger ſort of Women and Maids, for the like purpoſes, carried the holy Bread about their Necks, with St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel ſown in a piece of Silk or Velvet, hanging upon St. <hi>Audries</hi> Lace, which, as they ſaid, was very profitable for the pain in the Throat, and a preſent Remedy againſt the Chin-Cough. Thus the ſubtle <hi>Papiſts</hi> deceived the ſimple People, and made them plain ridden fools. But let us behold more of their Conjurations.</p>

               <head>Of HOLY CANDLES.</head>
               <p>IN the hallowing of Candles, upon <hi>Candlemas-day,</hi> the Prieſt being arraied with his Prieſtly Apparel, and turning himſelf to the South, among other things, in his firſt Prayer deſireth God, that his Candles which he hath there in hand, may receive ſuch a ſtrength and bleſſing, through the token of the holy Croſs, that in what place ſoever they be lighted or ſet, the Devil may avoid out of thoſe habitations, and tremble for fear, and fly away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and preſume no more to diſquiet them that ſerve him. Is not this a wonderful Prayer, and well framed according to the Will of God? Is not this a new kind of ſaving health, that Candles bleſſed of a Popiſh Prieſt, without the Commandment of God, being lighted or ſet in a place ſhould drive away the Devil, and make him to tremble for fear, as one altogether diſcouraged or diſmaied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, and that by vertue of the ſign of the Croſs? If the Croſs whereon Chriſt died were then preſent, it could give no ſuch ſtrength as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> require, much leſs can the Sign thereof. The Devil feareth as much the Sign of the Croſs, as he feareth the turning the Weathercock of <hi>Paul</hi>'s when the wind bloweth. The Name of Chriſt, and conſtant Faith in the ſame, expelleth Satan, and not the Sign of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56275:6"/>
Croſs. Afterward, in the ſame Prayer, he beſeecheth God, That he will ſend down his holy Angel <hi>Raphael,</hi> that he which plucked out and put away from <hi>Tobias</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> the peſtilent and noiſom Devil which troubled them, may by the ſanctification and hallowing of the Candles, tread Satan down, and chace him away out of all the Houſes of them that honour God; out of the Churches, out of the Manſions, out of the Beds, out of the Refectories, and out of all places wherein ſuch as ſerve God do dwell and reſt, do ſleep and watch, do walk and ſtand: and that that malignant Spirit may no more be bold to trouble or to make them afraid whom thou haſt defended with the holy Unction of thy holy Chriſm.</p>
               <p>Here this bleſſer and ſanctifier prayeth God to ſend down the Angel <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> to diſpatch the Devil out of the way, that he trouble us no more; not conſidering whether God hath in the mean ſeaſon appointed him to any other ſervice. The Angels are not appointed by God to wait upon Candles at the requeſt of ſinful men, but are ordained of God to attend upon his elect and choſen People: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth.</p>
               <p>And it is not a little to be marvelled at, that the Popiſh Prieſt is ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſhame, that he would have the Angel of God do all theſe things through the hallowing and ſanctification of the Candle, as though there were more virtue and ſtrength in a Wax Candle than in an Angel of God, which by the power of God hath not only expelled many Devils, but hath alſo in one night ſlain many thouſands of People. But the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are like to an Ape, which liketh no kind of Beaſts but her own Whelps, thinking them moſt fair, moſt well-favoured, moſt amiable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who knoweth not what deformed things they are? After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner play the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they like no kind of Juſtification and Sanctification that God hath appointed in his holy Word: but whatſoever they deviſe of their own-authority, without the authority of God's Word, that they extol and magnifie above the Stars: That juſtifieth, that ſanctifieth, that ſaveth. And to bring this thing to paſs, they abuſe the good Creatures of God, by taking upon them to make them more holy and better than ever God made them: which is an Antichriſtian preſumption.</p>
               <p>After theſe things, as a man out of his wits, the Popiſh bleſſer turneth him to the Candles, and ſaith:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I bleſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> thee, O thou Creature of Wax, in the Name of the holy Trinity, that thou be in all places a chacing away of the Devil, and an utter deſtruction and rooting out of all his Companions,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Here doth the Popiſh Prieſt attribute Power to the Wax for to chace away the Devil and all his Companions. But I marvel why the Hemp, whereof the Wiek is made, is not alſo ſpoken unto and bleſs'd, as well as the Wax, ſeeing that that alſo is part of the Candle? It is to be thought that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> had rather twice deal with Wax than once with Hemp, for fear of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In the ſecond Prayer, after that the Prieſt himſelf hath bleſſed the Candles, as a man remembring his duty, he beſeecheth God, That he alſo will vouchſafe to bleſs thoſe Candles, prepared unto the uſes of Men, and health of Bodies and Souls, as well on the Land as in the Waters, yea, and that by the invocation of his holy Name, and by the interceſſion of his holy Mother, and by the Prayers of all the Saints. To make this Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe ſaleworthy, he is not content with his own bleſſing of the Candles,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56275:7"/>
but he alſo prayeth God to put to his bleſſing, that they may bring unto men health both of body and ſoul, not only upon the Land but alſo upon the Water; that is to ſay, in every place, that the ſanctified Candle may be known to be a perfect Saviour in all places univerſally. O abomination! O blaſphemy! The mean to bring this matter to paſs, he allegeth to be the invocation of God's moſt holy Name, as the Charmers, Conjurers and Witches do likewiſe. But leſt that the invocation of God's moſt holy Name ſhould not ſeem to ſuffice in this behalf, as though there were an inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the ſame, he ſtraightway ſubjoineth and addeth the interceſſion of our Lady, and the Prayers of all the Saints in Heaven. But where hath the <hi>Papiſt</hi> learned in God's Book the Interceſſion of Saints? Or where hath he any Scripture to ſhew that they Pray either for us or for the Candles. God alone is to be invocated and called upon in the Name of our only alone Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, yea, and that according to his Will, and not after the fooliſh fancies of Men. And as God alone is to be called upon in ſpirit and truth, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he alone heareth our Prayers, and granteth our Petitions. All other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and Interceſſions are but the idle inventions of Men, ſprung up of a blind Zeal, without authority of God's Word, and to ſay truth, meer Idolatry. After theſe, and ſuch like Benedictions and Prayers, the Candles are ſprinkled with holy Water, and incenſed, that nothing ſhould want unto the perfect ſalvation of them. But whether this be falſe Worſhiping, or Conjuring, or Idolatry, or Superſtition, or Fooliſhneſs, to incenſe dead Creatures, and to make ſweet Perfumes to them that ſmell nothing, let others judge. All theſe things I am ſure are but apiſh toies, deviſed only to blear the ſimple peoples eyes, and to keep them ſtill in blindneſs, that they being occupied about ſuch trifles may have no leiſure to ſpy out the jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> God confound Antichriſt, with his whole Generation. Theſe things being diſpatched, the Candles are lighted, and every man taking his Candle, and the Prieſt his, with merry ſinging of <hi>Lumen ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velationem gentium,</hi> and <hi>Nunc Dimittis ſervum tuum, domine.</hi> Then the Prieſt holds up his Candle, and all the People their Candles, and about the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard they go, the Prior of <hi>Prickelingham</hi> and his Covent, meerly ſinging and talking, as merry as Pope <hi>John</hi> with all his College of Cardinals. After Even-ſong, the ſame day, diſtribution is made of the Prieſt's Candle, by the Prieſt to the People, every one taking their Portion in a fair Napkin, as a Relique and Jewel, ſo holy, ſo precious, and of ſo incomparable virtue, that they think themſelves unworthy to touch it with their bare hands. Theſe pieces of the Candle they bear home, and lay up daintily in their Coffers.</p>
               <p>If any Thunder or Lightning, or any other grievous Tempeſt ariſe, then ſtraightway they light their Candles, with this faith and perſuaſion, That that Candle being once lighted, driveth away the Devil, quieteth the Tempeſts, and bringeth health and ſafegard to ſo many as are in the houſe.</p>
               <p>Again, When any ſick perſon is like to depart, then this Candle is alſo lighted, and the ſick man bleſſed therewith, with this belief, That if he be bleſſed with that holy Candle before he depart, he ſhall be free from all the Aſſaults of the Devil, and the ſooner, come unto everlaſting joy.</p>

Secondly, the Palms with the Flowers that ſhall ſerve for the Clerks, ſhall be laid aſide upon the Altar, as for perſons of a greater dignity, and more excellency than the common ſort of People. Thirdly, as touching the other Palms and Flowers, which ſhall ſerve for the Laity, they ſhall be laid on the ſtep of the Altar on the South-ſide. All theſe things ſet in moſt comely order, at laſt the Sorcerer falleth to his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſaith,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I conjure thee, thou Creature of Flowers and Branches, in the Name <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> of God the Father Almighty, and in the Name <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> of Jeſus Chriſt his Son our Lord, and in the virtue <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> of the holy Ghoſt.

Through him that ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead, and the World by fire.</hi> Amen.</q>
               <p>As we have before heard in the Conjurations of Salt and Water, how buſie the ſacrificing Sorcerer was to diſpatch the Devil and all his power out of the aforeſaid Salt and Water, through his wicked and diveliſh Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even ſo playeth he now with the poor Boughs and ſilly Flowers. <hi>I conjure thee,</hi> ſaith he. But, I beſeech you, where ever did Chriſt ordain the Miniſters of the New Teſtament <hi>Conjurers?</hi> Antichriſt indeed hath his Conjurers, Sorcerers, Charmers, Witches, South-ſayers, Enchanters, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Chriſt in his Miniſtry knoweth no ſuch. Therefore whereas the Popiſh Prieſts take upon them to Conjure, they ſhew themſelves to be not the Miniſters of Chriſt, but the Bond-ſlaves of Antichriſt. But what fault find they in the Branches and Flowers, which are the good, fair, ſweet, and pleaſant Creatures of God, that they muſt be conjured? We ſee in them the great Power and mighty Work of God. Theſe Boughs which not long before ſeemed to be dead, are now green and flouriſhing. The Flowers which of late were not, are now moſt goodly and pleaſant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. Beholding them we are forced to praiſe God in his Creatures: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we ſee any imperfection in thoſe Creatures, that they ſhould need ſuch Conjurations. Hath the Devil entred into the Branches and Flowers ſince they were brought into the Popiſh Temples? For before they were good and undefiled, and needed no ſuch Conjurations and Charms. But what conjure they? the Devil and all his power out of the Flowers and Branches. But the holy Scripture ſaith, <hi>God beheld all things that he had made, and they were exceeding good.</hi> Flowers, Boughs, Branches, are the Creatures of God, therefore are they good: If good, what place hath the Devil in them? Can that which is good, and the Devil, dwell together?

But it is to be thought that whatſoever thing it be, although never ſo good, that cometh into the Popiſh Prieſts hands, it is ſtraightways defiled, or elſe they would never uſe ſuch Benedictions, Conſecrations, Sanctifications, Conjurations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by whoſe power do they conjure the Devil and all his Hoſt out of theſe Branches and Flowers? Becauſe they will make fair work and praiſe-worthy in the eyes of the ſimple, they conjure the Devil, not in their own name (for that might ſeem too great a preſumption) but in the Name of God the Father, and in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, and in the virtue of the holy Ghoſt. And in thus doing they ſhew themſelves right Conjurers and Sorcerers: For of all ſuch, that is the property. They muſt blaſphemouſly abuſe the Name of God, while they apply it to ſuch Incantations. The Name of God is with all reverence to be called on in things lawful, and not in things unlawful. And ſuch things are to be required of God as he commandeth us to ask, and not ſuch as we, after our fleſhly imagination, fancy. God likewiſe is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with ſuch Works as he hath preſcribed, and not with ſuch doings as blind Zeal deviſeth: As it is written, That I command thee, that do thou only, neither put thou any thing thereto, not yet pluck ought therefro. Again, Ye ſhall not do every one of you what you think good, but what I command you, that ſhall ye do. Now where hath God at any time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Miniſters to conjure the Devil and all his Army out of Salt, out of Water, out of Boughs, out of Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or where hath he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that ſuch Works ſhould be done in his Name? O Antichriſtian Arts!</p>
               <p>After the Conjuration of the Flowers and Branches, the Prieſt falleth to Prayer, yea and that without <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> but only with <hi>Oremus,</hi> and entreateth God, that it will pleaſe him, ſeeing the Devil and all his Hoſt is conjured out, to bleſs and ſanctifie theſe Flowers, branches, ſlips of Palms, or boughs of Trees, which they offer before the preſence of his glory, that the devout people bearing them in their hands, may merit and deſerve to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the grace of his Benediction.</p>
               <p>The Conjurer, after that he hath conjured the Devil out of thoſe Flowers and branches, deſireth God to ſanctifie them, and to make them holy, as though the Workmanſhip of God expreſſed in them before, were unholy and imperfect, when, notwithſtanding we have before ſaid, that all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God are exceeding good, and therefore conſequently good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their kind. He ſaith moreover, That they offer theſe Flowers and branches before the preſence of God's glory. But I would fain know where God hath commanded in the New Teſtament, that ſuch things ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto him? To offer the ſacrifice of praiſe, and to offer our bodies a lively and acceptable ſacrifice unto God, we are taught in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but to offer to God Boughs, Branches and Flowers, that we read not. Verily to offer up theſe things in ſacrifice to God, is none other thing than to ſet up an Idol of our own making, and to bring ſtrange fire before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God.</p>
               <p>But to what end would this crafty Conjurer have God to ſanctifie theſe flowers and branches? Verily, that the people bearing them in their hands may merit and deſerve to obtain the Grace of God's benediction. Behold this Antichriſt, whereas before he ſo vilely judged of theſe branches and flowers, that he thought them to be altogether unholy and unclean, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56275:8"/>
therefore he fell to the conjuring of the Devil and all his Army out of them, now he eſteemeth them to be of ſo great price, that the carrying them about in peoples hands, deſerveth the Grace of God's benediction, that is to ſay, God's favour, remiſſion of ſins, quietneſs of Conſcience, and in fine, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life. O new kind of meriting! Is the wrath of God, kindled againſt ſin, waxen ſo cold, that the carrying about of a few flowers and branches is able to quench it? Is remiſſion of Sins, quietneſs of Conſcience, everlaſting Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo ſlender gifts, and of no price, that they may eaſily be obtained with carrying about a few Palmes or Willow-branches? If great Oxen, fat Calves, mighty Bullocks, young Doves, tender Chickens, being ſacrificed and offered up unto God, if Incenſe and other ſweet perfumes offered unto the Almighty God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which notwithſtanding were done of the People of God at God's appointment) could not bring theſe heavenly benefits to Mankind, is it to be thought that the bearing of a few flowers and boughs in mens hands, which are now conjured and turned to a ſuperſtitious uſe, not commanded of God, but invented of Man, is able to bring this to paſs? No Ceremony commanded and ordained of God is able to juſtifie Man; and ſhall Ceremonies deviſed by Man work Juſtification? Nay, moreover, no Work that God hath commanded in his Moral Law, otherwiſe called <hi>The Ten Commandments of Almighty God,</hi> is able to juſtifie the doer thereof: For no man doeth the works of the Law with ſuch perfection as the Law requireth, for as much as the Law is ſpiritual and we are carnal, as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Moſes gave you a Law, and none of you all fulfilleth it;</hi> And ſhall works done at the preſcription and appointment of man, bring to paſs a matter ſo weighty and of ſo great importance? Verily our works, even our beſt works, are ſo imperfect and ſo eſtranged from all true righteouſneſs, that they are not without a cauſe reſembled by the Prophet to a menſtruous Cloth. <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, O Lord,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, for no man that liveth ſhall be found righteous in thy ſight.</hi> Again, <hi>If thou, O Lord, ſhalt narrowly look upon our wickedneſſes, O Lord, who is able to abide it?</hi> Are not theſe the words of the <hi>Apoſtle?</hi> If Righteouſneſs come by Works, then died Chriſt in vain. He ſpeaketh not of Popiſh and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Works, but of Works commanded of God. And he ſaith plainly, That thoſe Works do not juſtifie, that is to ſay, do not bring God's favour, remiſſion of ſins, the gift of the holy Ghoſt, quietneſs of Conſcience, and everlaſting Life to the doers of them, of their own dignity and worthineſs, of their own perfection and holineſs: but they be freely given to us of God the Father, for his dear Son's ſake, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, through faith in his blood. So that every one of us may worthily ſay with St. <hi>Paul, God forbid I ſhould rejoyce in any thing but in the Croſs,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Paſſion and Death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Where is Merit and Deſert now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> brag we ſhall obtain by carrying about their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Flowers and Branches. The Death of Chriſt is the alone Merit of the faithful: whereof God alone for his mercy ſake make us all partakers, and ſhortly confound the Kingdom of Antichriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond Prayer, which orderly followeth, the ſorcering <hi>Papiſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth God, That all they which ſhall bear thoſe Branches of <hi>Palm</hi> and other Trees, may be repleniſhed with the gift of his Benediction.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, God hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſing through Chriſt: and not by bearing of <hi>Palms.</hi> For he is the bleſſed ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in whom all Nations of the earth are bleſſed, that is to ſay, favoured
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56275:9"/>
of God. Whoſoever therefore will get the bleſſing of God, he muſt ſeek it in Chriſt, and not in bearing of <hi>Palms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third Prayer he beſeecheth once again Almighty God, to take ſo much pains as to bleſs thoſe branches of <hi>Palms</hi> and other Trees, that into what place ſoever they be brought, all the Inhabitants of the ſame place may obtain his bleſſing, ſo as all ſickneſs being chaſed away, his right hand may defend them whom it hath redeemed.</p>
               <p>In this Prayer the ſacrificing <hi>Papiſt</hi> doth not only crave of God, through theſe branches and flowers, his bleſſing, but alſo, that all the Inhabitants of thoſe houſes into which thoſe branches and flowers ſhall be brought, may be free from all ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, and preſerved in health. And here this marked Merchant marvelouſly ſetteth forth his Merchandiſe, as things, of great price and dignity, of much virtue and force, profitable not only for the ſalvation of the ſoul, but alſo for the health of the body. And here is the matter that maketh their Merchandiſe ſo plauſible, ſo acceptable, and ſo greatly to be deſired, chaſing away of diſeaſes, and who deſireth not health of body, eſpecially when it coſts nothing? As though he ſhould ſay, Ye Ideots and leud People, Why do ye conſume and waſt your ſelves, your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, your ſubſtance, in running hither and thither for the ſafegard and health of your body? Make haſte and come hither. Here is preſent remedy againſt ſickneſs, and a moſt precious preſervative of health. Take theſe <hi>Palms,</hi> bear them in your hands, wear them on your Caps, pin them up at your Bed's-head, and my body for yours, health and wealth enough. And verily this was the dotage of the ſimple people in times paſt, through the falſe perſuaſion of theſe Popiſh Hypocrites, even to look for all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities appertaining to the body or ſoul, through the virtue of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>Palms.</hi> And therefore on <hi>Palm-ſunday</hi> they did not only moſt joyfully carry them about in Proceſſion, but alſo at the time of the Goſpel they made of the Bark of thoſe Boughs certain knots, which they did always carry about with them either in their Boſoms, or elſe in their Caps. And of the very Wood they made Croſſes, and ſome uſed to pin them upon their Caps, ſome to ſet them at their Bed's-head, with this faith and perſuaſion, That by the virtue of thoſe Knots and Croſſes they ſhould be preſerved from all evil, and obtain all good things. Their Houſes ſhould be free from burning and ſpoiling. They themſelves ſhould dwell ſafely and ſleep ſweetly, free from all Diſeaſes, free from Thunder and Lightning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to whom is it unknown, That every good and perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights. To this heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore muſt we reſort, when we lack any good thing appertaining ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſoul or body, and not unto the hallowed Flowers and <hi>Palms,</hi> or unto Knots and Croſſes made of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Prayer the Sorcerer hath theſe words:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vouchſafe to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and ſanctifie theſe Branches of</hi> Palms, <hi>and other Trees and Flowers, that whoſoever in the ſervice of thy virtue ſhall take any thing thereof, being ſanctified with the Benediction of Heaven, may deſerve to enjoy Remiſſion of Sins, and the Rewards of everlaſting Life.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Here we ſee to what point at the laſt the Conjurer is come with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſtuff. Verily even to this end, That ſo many as take and carry about any portion of thoſe Branches and Flowers, may deſerve to enjoy Remiſſion of Sins, and the Rewards of everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56275:9"/>What will ye have more? Ye have here remiſſion of Sins, ye have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life: Is there any other thing behind? O blaſphemous <hi>Papiſts!</hi> We are taught in the holy Scripture to ſeek remiſſion of ſins, not from Palms and Flowers, but from the hands of our heavenly Father, through faith in the blood of Chriſt. And as touching everlaſting Life, it is the frank and free gift of God to the faithful, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, as the Apoſtle ſaith. But Antichriſt goeth on ſtill to be Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>After theſe things, the branches and flowers are ſprinkled with holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and incenſed ſolemnly, becauſe they ſhould be holy and holy again. This thing done, the Prieſt and all the People take the Palms and boughs in their hands, and away they go together for company about the Church-yard. This Proceſſion is ſo full of myſteries, that not one <hi>Papiſt</hi> of a thouſand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Palm-ſunday</hi> the flies are more affraid than they are all the year after. But the Idolatry that is committed afterward with the Rood at their return into the Church, is moſt damnable, God deſtroy all Idols with their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

               <p>HEre followeth more work for the Tinker. Now muſt he fall in hand with hallowing of the Fire. For although the Fire by nature is of all the four Elements moſt ſubtil, pure, and moſt eſtranged from corruption, yet when it comes into the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hands, it is not ſo pure, but it muſt be made more pure, not ſo holy and good, but it muſt be made more holy and good. Therefore muſt he fall in hand with this matter alſo, yea and that on this manner:</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, The Fire once made, the Prieſt muſt ſtand by the Fire, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf Eaſtward. Secondly, The Deacon muſt ſtand on the Prieſts left hand, and the Subdeacon on the left hand of the Deacon. Thirdly, One Taper-bearer muſt ſtand againſt the Prieſt, and at the right hand of the Taper-bearer there muſt ſtand a Child, holding the Book near to the Prieſt. Fourthly, Another Taper-bearer muſt ſtand behind the Prieſt, and at the right hand of the ſame Taper-bearer muſt he ſtand that carrieth the holy Water near unto the Prieſt. Fifthly, In the laſt place, behind all, on the Weſt-ſide, muſt he ſtand that beareth the long Staff with the Taper. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Beſide the Fire, namely on the South-ſide, muſt he ſtand that ſhall caſt Incenſe, to take fire into the Cenſer after benediction. Seventhly, All theſe Miniſters being turned toward the Prieſt, the Quire in the mean ſeaſon ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about, namely on the North-ſide, there ſhall follow a bleſſing of the Fire ſolemnly, the Prieſt ſaying thus: <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> and <hi>Oremus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among all other things in the bleſſing and hallowing of the Fire, the Popiſh Prieſt hath theſe words:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O Lord, holy Father, Almighty and everlaſting God, in thy Name, and thy Son's, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſts, We <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſs this Fire, and <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> ſanctifie it with the Wax, and all the nouriſhments of the ſame, and we mark it with the Sign <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> of the Croſs of thy moſt high Son Chriſt Jeſus, that whether it be kindled within or without, not only that which now it kindleth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56275:10"/>
and ſets on fire, but that it may alſo kindle, make warm, or lighten, all things neceſſary for the uſe of men, and that all things which ſhall be kindled or made warm of this Fire, may be <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſſed and profitable to the health of all men,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Here we ſee of what great virtue this Fire which the <hi>Papiſt</hi> hath now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, ſanctified, and bleſſed, is. Verily of ſo great force, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be kindled or made warm by this Fire, ſhould ſtraightway be profitable to the health of all men, that is to ſay, drive away all corrupt, peſtiferous, and evil Airs, and preſerve the health of all them that receive any heat by it. O the marvelous ſtrength of this ſanctified Fire! Hence it was, that in times paſt, ſo ſoon as the Paſchal was lighted, every Woman of the Pariſh ſhould ſtrive who might come firſt to the Fire, and carry home ſome part of it, and kindle their Wood with it, and ſo ſmoak and ſmother every part of the Houſe therewith, with this faith and perſuaſion, That this perfuming of their Houſe with the ſmoak of this Fire, did not only drive away all wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and peſtiferous Airs out of their Houſes, with all kind of Diſeaſes, but alſo bring aſſurance of health to all the Inhabitants of the ſame for all the year after. O vain Faith! O fooliſh Peſuaſion.</p>
               <p>In another Prayer the Popiſh Prieſt beſeecheth God, That into whatſoever place this bleſſed and hallowed Fire be brought, it may expel the wickedneſs of the Devils deceit, and make the power of God's Majeſty to be preſent, even Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Is not the virtue, power, and force of this Fire wonderful and marvelous? It doth not only drive away the Devil, but it alſo bringeth Chriſt unto us. But as touching the Devil, we have before heard, That it is neither Salt, Water, Bread, Candles, Boughs, Palms, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that can drive him away, but only the Name of Chriſt, Faith, Prayer, God's Word, and Faſting. And as concerning Chriſt, no man can come by him, but only through the ſingular benefit and unſpeakable Gift of God, as our Saviour Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>No man cometh unto me, except my Father, which ſent me, draw him.</hi> Fooliſh therefore, vain and ſuperſtitious is the Doctrin of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> concerning this their ſanctified and hallowed Fire.</p>

               <p>THeſe Aſhes, whereof we muſt now entreat, are made of the hallowed Palms of the year paſt: And the Maſs-book ſaith, That upon <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> when the Prieſt hath abſolved the People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then muſt there be made a Bleſſing of the Aſhes (without <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> and without <hi>Oremus)</hi> by the Prieſt, being turned toward the Eaſt, and ſtanding in the midſt of the Quire, before the Altar. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> uſe ſaith, That the Prieſt ſhall ſay <hi>Dominus vobiſcum,</hi> and <hi>Oremus</hi> alſo: ſo little do the holy Fathers agree among themſelves.</p>
               <p>After that the Popiſh Prieſt hath ſet himſelf in a comely order for the diſpatching of this matter, he beginneth on this manner, and ſaith, as we read in the <hi>Roman Manuale,</hi> otherwiſe called the <hi>Benedictionale.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O Almighty and everlaſting God, ſpare them that fear, be merciful to them that make ſupplication, and vouchſafe cross; to ſend thy holy Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56275:10"/>
which may bleſs <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and ſanctifie theſe Aſhes, that they may be an whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Remedy to all that weekly call upon thy holy Name, and accuſe themſelves for the Conſcience of their Sins, and lament their wickedneſs before the ſight of thy divine Clemency, or that meekly and humbly deſire thy moſt excellent Majeſty: And grant through the invocation of thy holy Name, that ſo many as ſhall ſprinkle theſe Aſhes upon them for the redemption of their ſins, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive health of Body and ſafegard of Soul.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>In this Petition the Prieſt requireth of God, That he will ſend down his holy Angel from Heaven to bleſs and ſanctifie thoſe Aſhes, miſtruſting, as it may ſeem, his own bleſſing and ſanctifying, as a thing of no great force and virtue. But I believe, that he may pray to God for this matter twice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be granted him once. Where hath this <hi>Papiſt</hi> learned, That the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Angels is to hallow Aſhes? The holy Scriptures teſtifie, That Angels, at the appointment of God, have many times come down from Heaven to the conſolation and comfort of God's Elect and choſen People: but that they at any time came down to hallow Aſhes, that is in no place read. And how dare the <hi>Papiſt</hi> ask that of God, for which he hath not one jot nor one tittle in the holy Scripture? We are taught to ask according to the Will of God, and not againſt the Will of God. That is the Will of God, which he hath manifeſted, declared and opened in his Word. All other things are fancies, dreams and idle imaginations of men. And as they are asked without, yea contrary to the will of God, ſo are they never granted of God. And thus may we well think of this Petition of the Prieſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he asketh, That God would ſend down his holy Angel from Heaven to bleſs and ſanctifie the Aſhes. Without doubt a worſhipfull office, more meet for the Angel of Antichriſt than for the Angel of Chriſt. The Office of Gods Angel and Ambaſſador is, to execute Gods Will, to do Gods meſſage to ſuch as he ſendeth them, to take care of Gods Elect, to defend him from the violence of Satan, to preſerve them in the obedience of Gods Will, to nouriſh Concord, Peace, Amitie, Virtues, good Studies, Arts, Policy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in fine, at the day of Judgment to gather together Gods Elect into that Heavenly Kingdom, and to commit the Reprobate unto Everlaſting Fire. Of this we read in the holy Scripture; but that it is their Office to bleſs and hallow Aſhes, that read we not. Therefore as the Popiſh Sacrificer doth evil to put the Angels of God to ſuch an Office as is not allotted unto them by the holy Scripture; ſo likewiſe do they wickedly require ſuch a thing of God as is contrary to his Bleſſed Will. God hath appointed his Angels to ſerve him, and to attend upon his elect and choſen People for their Safeguard, and not to ſanctifie and hallow Aſhes.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee to what end this Papiſt would have Gods holy Angel come down from Heaven and hallow theſe Aſhes: verily ſaith he, That they may be an wholſom remedy to all that meekly call upon thy holy name, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves for the conſcience of their ſins, and lament their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>What wicked Doctrine is this of the Devil and the Pope, to teach that their abuſed Aſhes ſhould be not only a remedy, but alſo an wholſom reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſuch as have offended? The holy Scripture teacheth far otherwiſe: That plainly declareth, that when we have ſinned againſt the Lord our God, the next and beſt remedy is to turn again unto him whom we have offended: to repent us of our former wikedneſs, to crave mercy at our Heavenly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56275:11"/>
Fathers hand, in the name of our only Mediator Chriſt Jeſus: To believe that our ſins ſhall be forgiven us, if we ask in Faith: and in fine, to take upon us a new life, and above all things to take heed that we fall no more into a lewd life, leſt the laſt be worſt than the firſt, and ſo this common Proverb be verified of us, The Sow being waſhed is returned to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire, and the Dog unto his vomit.</p>
               <p>But afterward, the Papiſt maketh it more plain, and deſireth of God, that ſo many as ſhall ſprinkle thoſe Aſhes upon them for the redemption of their ſins, may receive health of Body and Safeguard of Souls. Here is a plain Doctrine of the Papiſts, That by ſprinkling thoſe Aſhes upon them, they believe to have redemption of their ſins. What is Blaſphemy if this be not Blaſphemy? What is it to work ignominy and diſhonour to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud of Chriſt, if this be not? Who denieth the Lord that bought them, if the Papiſts do it not? Is it come to paſs now, that Aſhes work the redemption of our ſins? We hitherto believed that Chriſt alone hath wrought our Redemption by his Paſſion and Death. For ſo are we taught in the Word of God. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, died for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtification.</hi> Again there is one God and one Mediator, the man Chriſt Jeſus, which gave himſelf a Ranſom for all. Likewiſe ſaith St. <hi>John, The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt purgeth us from all ſin.</hi> Alſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>Chriſt hath loved us and waſhed us from our ſins by his Bloud, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God his Father: To him be praiſe and rule for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p>And as concerning health of Body and ſafeguard of Soul, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they come not from Aſhes, but from the Mighty God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh, as we have before heard. Of him therefore muſt we ask whatſoever good thing we intend to obtain.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall note alſo, that in the prayer which followeth, it is plainly declared, That the Popes Captains ſuffer the Aſhes to be laid upon their heads, to this end, That by that means they may deſerve to have forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins: when notwithſtanding we have before abundantly heard, that forgivneſs of ſins cometh only from God, through Faith in the name of his Son Chriſt, and not by reaſon of any work, although com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law of God, much leſs by any ceremony invented by man, as it is written. <hi>Be it known to you, (ye men and Brethren) that through this man (Chriſt) is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins: and that by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which we could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. Again, <hi>Why tempt ye God that ye would put a Yoke on the Diſciples necks, which neither our Fathers nor we we were able to bear. But we believe that through the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. And in the Service after <hi>Salisbury</hi> uſe, (as they term it) we read theſe words. <hi>Grant that through the Invocation of thy holy name, all they that bear theſe Aſhes upon their heads for the obtaining of thy mercy, may merit of thee to receive forgivneſs of all their Treſpaſſes.</hi> Are not theſe words all one in effect with the other which we heard before? Verily there is neither barrel better herring. Whether uſe we follow, both rob Chriſt of his glory.</p>
               <p>After theſe benedictions and ſanctifications, theſe Aſhes muſt be ſprinkled with Holy-Water to make up the matter. Which thing diſpatched, certain Anthems muſt be ſung, and in the mean ſeaſon the Aſhes muſt be received of ſo many as are preſent. Firſt of all, the Prieſt that ſhall ſay Maſs muſt

have the Aſhes laid upon his head by another Prieſt, if he be preſent. But if there be no more Prieſts, then muſt he kneel down meekly before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and lay Aſhes upon his own head. Afterward muſt the other Miniſters come, if any be preſent, and kneeling down before the Altar, receive Aſhes of the Prieſt. They being ſerved, the Brethren and Siſters ſhall come <hi>bini &amp; bini,</hi> two and two together, like Fryers of one Cloyſter, and meekly kneeling upon their marrow bones before the Altar, receive Aſhes in like manner of the Prieſt. And in diſtributing theſe Aſhes, the Prieſt muſt ſay to every one of them on this wiſe, <hi>Memento homo quod cinis es,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> (here muſt the Prieſt make a Croſs with the Aſhes upon the top of the Crown, if he be a Man, but if a Woman, upon her forehead) <hi>&amp; in cinerem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteris.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>Remember man that thou art Aſhes, and into Aſhes thou ſhalt return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Aſhes in times paſt, through the wicked Doctrine of the moſt wicked Papiſts, have been counted of the common People to be of ſo great virtue, that the receiving of them brought unto them Gods favour, and a worthy preparation unto the forgiveneſs of their ſins. And contrariwiſe, that without them, neither Confeſſion, Contrition, Pennance, Abſolution, Faſting, Prayer, nor any other good work profited them any thing at all. O lamentable blindneſs!</p>

               <head>Of hallowing Incenſe, Myrrhe, and other Perfumes.</head>
               <p>NOw that we have paſſed over Salt, Water, Bread, Candles, Boughs, Flower, Fire, and Aſhes, we are at laſt come to our Perfumes, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Myrrhe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither are they ſo ſweet, nor their ſavours ſo pleaſant, but that the Papiſts find fault in them; ſo that they alſo have need of their Exorciſms, Conjurations, Sanctifications, Benedictions, Croſſings and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Therefore in falling in hand with that matter, the Popiſh Prieſt beginneth to Conjure in this manner, ſpeaking to the Devil as one not unacquainted with his doings.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I Conjure thee, thou moſt unclean Spirit, and every phantaſy of the Enemy, in the Name of God the Father Almighty, and in the name of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, and in the virtue of the Holy Ghoſt, That thou with all thy falſe Subtilty and Wickedneſs, go forth and depart from this Creature of Perfume or Incenſe, that this Creature may be Sanctified <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that all they which taſte, touch, or ſmell it, may enjoy the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and help of the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that whereſoever this Incenſe or Perfume ſhall be, thou in no wiſe be bold to approach near there, nor preſume to trouble: But what foul Spirit ſoever thou art, thou with all thy crafty falſhood flee and dapart far from thence, being ſtraitly charged by the name and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God the Father Almighty, and of his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who in the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead, and thee thou traiterous Offendor, and the World through Fire.</hi> Amen.</q>
               <p>Here is much work and little help. The poor Devil is here ſo handled and ſo ſtraightly Conjured, that he knoweth not whither to turn him. Firſt of all this Conjurer rateth him beyond all meaſure, and calleth him moſt unclean Spirit, foul Spirit, and traiterous Offendor, and chargeth him
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56275:12"/>
not in the name of <hi>Robinhood</hi> or little <hi>John,</hi> nor yet in the name of Fryer <hi>Tuck</hi> and maid <hi>Marion,</hi> but in the name of God the Father Almighty, and in the name of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, and in the vertue of the Holy Ghoſt, That he with all his falſe Subtilty and Wickedneſs, and with all his crafty Falſhood, depart from that creature of Incenſe or Perfume.</p>
               <p>There is no remedy, but the Devil muſt now needs trudge, being ſo ſtraitly Conjured. But it is marvellous that ſuch Perfumes ſhould make ſo ſweet ſavours, if the Devil were in them, as the Popiſh Conjurer fancieth. If one Devil be in ſo little portion of Incenſe, what a number of Devils be there in all the Apothecaries Shops that are in <hi>Bucklersbury,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where? I wonder how they can ſleep in the night ſeaſon, having ſo many Devils in their Houſes. If the Doctrine of the Papiſts be true, it were high time, yea, and more than time, that theſe Conjuring Prieſts were ſent for, and ſet a work to Conjure ſuch unclean and foul Spirits; yea, and ſuch traiterous Offenders, leſt they make havock of all Apothecaries and Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers Houſes, and all others alſo whereſoever any Incenſe, myrrhe or any other Perfume is. If Incenſe were poſſeſſed with the Devil, as the Papiſts teach, I much marvel that the Holy Ghoſt would by the mouth of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> compare Prayer unto it. Again, if Incenſe were poſſeſſed with ſo foul and unclean Spirits, it is much to be marvelled that it ſhould have ſo ſweet a ſavour, ſeeing the Devil corrupteth all things that he poſſeſſeth. But let us conſider why this Papiſt taketh ſo great pains to Conjure the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil out of the Incenſe. Some urgent, grave, weighty, and neceſſary cauſe moveth him thus to do, otherwiſe he would never be ſo earneſt in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Forſooth Sir, and it pleaſe you, The cauſe that moveth him to take all theſe pains in Conjuring and diſpatching the Devil is, that this Creature of Perfume or Incenſe may be ſanctified in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; yea, and that unto this end, That all they who taſte, touch, or ſmell it, may enjoy the virtue and help of the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this Incenſe or Perfume ſhall be, the Devil in no wiſe may be bold to approach near, nor preſume to make any hurly burly; but that he with all his crafty Falſhood fly and depart far from thence. O notable Virtues! O wonderful Works! Of this Exorciſm we learn, that ſo many as taſte, touch, or ſmell of this Perfume or Incenſe, do enjoy the virtue and help of the Holy Ghoſt. To taſte, that is to ſay, to eat of Incenſe or any other Perfume, is rare; but to touch or to ſmell thereof, is daily and common. But that this ſhould bring the virtue and help of the Holy Ghoſt, is of all things moſt rare, and almoſt incredible. To have the Holy Ghoſt is the meer and only gift of God, as he himſelf teſtifieth by the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Daughters ſhall Propheſie.</hi> Again he ſaith, <hi>I will pour clear Water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean, yea, from all your uncleanneſs, and from all your Idols ſhall I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put into you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will give my Spirit among you, and cauſe you to walk in my Commandments, to keep my Laws and fulfil them.</hi> And our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil can give good Gifts to your Children, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Ghoſt to them that ask it of him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>I will pray my Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the World cannot receive; for it ſeeth him not, neither hath it known him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56275:12"/>Here have we in manifeſt and plain words, that the Holy Ghoſt is the gift of God only, and that it cometh not unto us by Conjured Incenſe and and other bewitched Perfumes, but by Prayer alone, which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the mean to obtain his bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p>Moreover in this Exorciſm or Conjuration, the Exorciſt or Conjurer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth ſo much to theſe bewitched Perfumes, that they be able, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be kindled or ſet on Fire, to drive away the Devil with all his Craft and Falſhood. This is an old jugling of the Papiſts, ſo to eſteem their Sorceries, that they may be able to move Mountains, yea, to drive Devils away. But we have before heard, that the Devil is more mighty and of greater force and ſtrength, than that the ſmoak of a little Incenſe can be able to drive him away. We have heard alſo, that by Faith, Prayer, Faſting, and by the Word of God, Satan is expelled and put out, and not by dumb Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. For this purpoſe, ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> hath the Son of God appeared, even to diſſolve, looſen, break, and deſtroy the works of the Devil.</p>
               <p>In the Prayers that follow, the Sorcerer prayeth God that the Incenſe may be to his Servants or Handmaids a Defence and Safeguard, that the Enemy the Devil enter not into their bowels, nor have any entrance or ſeat in them. Again, That all Diſeaſes and deceits of the Devil, feeling the ſavour of this Incenſe, may flee away, ſo that the People be not hurt through the biting of the old Serpent, but that it may expel and drive away all phantaſtical aſſaults of unclean Spirits, and expel all Infirmities, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Diſeaſes: and in fine, health being reſtored, ſmell to the Lord our God a moſt pleaſant odour with perpetual ſweetneſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſing always one manner of ſong, that which only is due to the Creator, they attribute to Creatures, after they have once exorciſed, conjured or bewitched them. But we have before abundantly heard, That no man can be delivered from the aſſaults of Satan and other wicked Spirits, and from ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, nor obtain any health, but only by the power of Almighty God, as it is written, <hi>Neither Herb nor Emplaiſter hath healed them, O Lord, but thy Word, which healeth all things.</hi> And whereas they will have their Perfumes to be a ſweet ſavour in the Noſtrils of God, we know that there is nothing that ſmelleth ſweetly before God but the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt's death: As the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt loved us, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us an Offring and a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſavour unto God.</hi> Again, <hi>By Chriſt do we offer up Sacrifice of praiſe always to God;</hi> that is to ſay, the fruit of thoſe lips which confeſs his Name.</p>
               <p>After theſe ſolemn Prayers, the Exorciſt, devoutly looking upon his new bewitched ſtuff, ſpeaketh on this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>The bleſſing <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> of God Almighty <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> the Father <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, the Son <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, and the holy Ghoſt, deſcend and come down upon this Creature of Incenſe, Myrrh and Perfume, and abide upon it alway.</hi> Amen.</q>
               <p>Theſe things diſpatched, he putteth ſome of the new Perfumes in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, ſo that now by the vertue hereof, the Devil trudgeth with all his craft and falſhood: All diſeaſes flee away, health cometh, and all good things beſides. O the wonderful power of theſe Perfumes! Yea, O Antichriſt, who ſo wickedly abuſeſt the good Creatures of God!</p>

               <p>He ought rather to have deſired God to pour his bleſſing upon the People, than upon the Eggs, which are Creatures without all ſenſe and feeling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all life and motion.

And although the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have forbidden them to be eaten of the faithful, certain times of the year, as a kind of meat unlawful, yet we know, that to the pure all things are pure, and that nothing is to be caſt away that is received with thankſgiving: For it is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer.

And as St.</hi> John <hi>drinking poyſon out of the Cup was not hurt; ſo they that drink this day of this Cup, in the honor of Thee and bleſſed St.</hi> John, <hi>may be delivered through the merits of the ſame St.</hi> John, <hi>from all ſickneſs and poyſon, and be abſolved both in Body and Soul from all faults.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The Papiſt in this his Prayer, Conjureth God to bleſs and ſanctifie his Cup of Wine by the words of the holy Goſpel, and by the merits of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, as though God were ſo indebted and bound unto them, that he could do no otherwiſe than grant his requeſt. But as touching the words of the Goſpel; Where have the Papiſts learned thus to abuſe them? Where have they read that the words of the Goſpel ſhould help unto the hallowing and ſanctifying of Wine? The Papiſts play here with this piece of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, as the ſimple People in the time of darkneſs were wont to do with hanging St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, as they call it, about their necks upon St. <hi>Audries</hi> lace, thinking themſelves ſafe from all danger, both Bodily and Ghoſtly, and free from all Devils and wicked Spirits. But this is to abuſe, and not to uſe the words of the Goſpel. The Goſpel is a joyful Meſſage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained moſt preſent conſolation and ready comfort for all Sinners that repent in Faith, freely offered of God the Father for his Son Chriſts ſake, to all that believe and embrace it. And this Goſpel helpeth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is read, but becauſe it is believed; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is the power of God, to ſave ſo many as believe:</hi> For Man and his Salvation was the Goſpel written, and not for Wine and for Wines ſatisfaction: As St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are written that ye might believe that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God: and that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have Life through his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56275:15"/>And as concerning the merits of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist; Where have the Papiſts learned to lay them before the Majeſty of God, as things of ſuch purity and excellency, that for the worthineſs of them, he is bound to grant their deſire, ſeeing it is written, That all our righteouſneſſes are as a menſtruous Cloth? Seeing alſo that before God, not the Angels in Heaven are clean; much leſs man, who is Earth, Aſhes, Duſt and Dung. What St. <hi>John</hi> thought of his merits, may eaſily be perceived by theſe words. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us: But if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. If we ſay we have no ſin, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here St. <hi>John</hi> putteth himſelf in the number of Sinners; ſo far is he from cracking and boaſting of his good deeds and merits. And in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous. And He it is that obtaineth mercy for our ſins.</hi> Here St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe layeth not forth his own merits and deſerts before the Judgment Seat of God, but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that pure and undefiled Lamb, that taketh away the ſins of the World. For whoſe ſake alſo God is well pleaſed with man. The merits both of St. <hi>John</hi> and of all the Saints, are the mercies of God, as it is written, which crowneth in mercy and loving kindneſs. <hi>When ye have done</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>all that ye ought to do, ſay, we are unprofitable Servants,</hi> there is no difference, <hi>all have ſinned and want the Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the Papiſt prayeth, That ſo many as drink of that hallowed Wine, may be bleſſed, defended, delivered from all ſickneſs and poyſon, and in fine, be abſolved both in Body and Soul from all ſins and faults; yea, and that by the merits of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt. Of St. <hi>Johns</hi> merits we have before heard. But that the hallowed Wine ſhould give to ſo many as drink of it, Gods bleſſing, Gods defence, deliverance from all ſickneſs and poyſon, and at the laſt abſolution from all ſins and faults, it is more than any man may be bold juſtly to look for at a Cup of Wine. It is God that bleſſeth and defendeth us his People. It is God that delivereth his Servants from all evil and noiſom things. It is God that forgiveth ſin, and ſaveth both Body and Soul: as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Salvation cometh from the Lord, and his bleſſing is upon his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this new ſanctified Wine being drunk in the honor of St. <hi>John</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt, be of ſuch force and ſtrength, that it ſaveth the drinkers thereof from poyſoning, How cometh it to paſs, that that Wine which is Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate in the Blood of Chriſt, yea, which is the natural Blood of Chriſt, as the Papiſt teach, could not keep and defend Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> the third of that name, from poyſoning, which as Chronicles record, was poyſoned at Maſs by drinking that myſtical Wine out of the Chalice?</p>
               <p>And as touching the abſolution of ſins, I marvel greatly that the Papiſts would ſo overſhoot themſelves, that they would deſire of God, that ſo many as drink of that Wine, might be abſolved and delivered from all their ſins. Verily this thing doth not a little diminiſh their Authority. If men might be abſolved from their ſins by drinking a Cup of Wine, what ſhould be come then of <hi>Ego abſolvo te?</hi> Then alſo were all the confeſſional pens diſpatched and gone; yea, then ſhould the holy Fathers Indulgences and Pardons <hi>a paena &amp; a culpa toties quoties,</hi> be utterly neglected and nothing at all regarded. I wonder they were ſo uncircumſpect in this matter, where
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56275:15"/>
moſt circumſpection ought to have been had. But this we know and are fully perſwaded, that neither drinking of the hallowed Wine, nor the Pope himſelf can forgive us our ſins, but God alone, as it is written, <hi>No man can forgive ſins but God alone.</hi> And as God himſelf ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>I am he; yea, I am he indeed which putteth away thy ſins, and that for my own ſake, and I will remember thy wickedneſs no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another Prayer, the ſanctifying Papiſt beſeecheth God <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to bleſs this Creature of Wine, that whoſoever taſtes of it may obtain Everlaſting Life, through the interceſſion of St. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we may ſay to the Papiſts, as the Fletcher ſaith to his bolt, Flie and be nought. Here is <hi>de malo inpejus, venite adoremus,</hi> as <hi>Skelton</hi> ſaith, It was very nought that we heard before in hallowing the Wine, but this of all nought, is moſt nought. For now we are come to this point, that the drinking of this hallowed Wine bringeth Everlaſting Life; when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Everlaſting Life is the Gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</hi> Again, <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. For I am the Reſurrection and Life. He that believeth on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, and whoſoever liveth and believeth on me ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then died Chriſt in vain.</hi> What is meant by Righteouſneſs in this place, but the grace, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and mercy of God, remiſſion of ſins, the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, quietneſs of Conſcience, and in fine, Everlaſting Life? Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>None of all theſe things come by the Law;</hi> that is to ſay, by thoſe works of the Law, which not man but God hath preſcribed and appointed. For if they did, it ſhould truly follow that Chriſt died in vain. But Chriſt died not in vain, therefore Righteouſneſs and Everlaſting Life cometh not by works, as it is written, <hi>No Fleſh ſhall be juſtified by the Works of the Law.</hi> If therefore our Juſtification and Salvation come not by thoſe works which God hath appointed, ſhall we obtain ſo noble and excellent benefits at the hand of God through drinking of Wine, lately bleſſed by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed Papiſt? Everlaſting Life is the gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Moreover, This ſacrificing Sorcerer deſireth of God, that theſe things may be brought to paſs ſo much the ſooner, through the interceſſion of St. <hi>John.</hi> A new kind of Interceſſion. Is it to be thought that St. <hi>John</hi> being now a glorified Saint in Heaven, and following the Lamb whither-ſoever he goeth, hath ſo much idle leiſure, as to attend upon ſuch trifling ſuits and requeſts? What other thing were it, to crave of God, that all ſuch as drink of that new hallowed Wine, might obtain Everlaſting Life by the means thereof; than to ſpit in Chriſts face, to ſet Chriſt at nought, to contemn and utterly deſpiſe the ineſtimable merits of his Paſſion and Death, and in all points to deny him to be a Saviour? For whoſoever ſeeketh any part of his Salvation at any Creature, either in Heaven or in Earth, except only at the hand of Chriſt, he hath utterly forſaken the Lord Jeſu, and his ſaving health. Far therefore be it from ſo holy an Apoſtle to attempt ſuch wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Papiſts make him an Interceſſor unto God, I know not for what trifles, we ſhall underſtand that we are not taught by any part or parcel of the holy Scripture, that the Saints departed do make any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56275:16"/>
interceſſion for us that live in this World. Neither is it probable by the Word of God, that they either pray for us, or that they hear our prayers, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou art our Father. For</hi> Abraham <hi>knoweth us not, neither is</hi> Iſrael <hi>acquainted with us. But thou Lord art our Father and Redeemer, and thy name is everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we will obtain any thing at the hand of God, St. <hi>John</hi> ſetteth not forth himſelf, nor any of his fellow Apoſtles, no nor yet the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be our Mediator, Advocate, or Interceſſor unto God the Father; but he appointeth Jeſus Chriſt, who for his dignity and Righteouſneſs is found alone worthy to offer up our prayers before the Throne of Gods Majeſty. He alone is our Mediator, He alone is our Advocate, He alone is our Interceſſor, as the holy Scripture abundantly teſtifieth. Whatſoever we ask of God the Father in the name of this our Mediator, Advocate, and Interceſſor, ſo that it be agreeable to the will of God, we may be ſure to obtain it, as that ſelf truth teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he ſhall give it you. Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After divers other vain words, which I gladly paſs over, the Popiſh Sanctifier concludeth with theſe words,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>And the bleſſing of God Almighty, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> the Father and <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> the Son and <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> the Holy Ghoſt, deſcend and come down upon this Creature of Wine, that it may be to ſo many as take of it a remedy againſt all peril of Body and Soul, and a foretaſting to Everlaſting Life.</hi> Amen.</q>
               <p>What an wholſom Concluſion this is, who ſeeth not? But what care the Papiſts what they ſay, ſo that it may advance their own idle inventions, although it obſcure the Glory of God and Merits of Chriſts death never ſo greatly? The defence both of Body and Soul againſt all evil cometh from God alone, and not from an hallowed Cup of Wine. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, is my ſtony rock and my defence, my Saviour, my God, and my might, in whom I will truſt, my Buckler, the horn alſo of my Salvation, and my refuge. I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praiſed, ſo ſhall I be ſafe from mine Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as touching Everlaſting Life, we have before heard that it is the free gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. To have a foretaſting of this Everlaſting Life, there is no other way but by Faith only: as it is written, <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath Everlaſting Life, but he that believeth not on the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi>

               <p>IN the Benediction of Cheeſe and Butter, the Sanctifier uſeth theſe words,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vouchſafe O Lord God Almighty, <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to bleſs and <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> ſanctifie theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, (Cheeſe and Butter) which thou haſt vouchſafed to bring out of the fat of Beaſts; and grant, we beſeech thee, that ſo many of thy faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as ſhall eat thereof, may be repleniſhed with all Heavenly benediction, and with the holineſs of thy Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56275:16"/>At the beginning God bleſſed all his Creatures, and beholding them, he ſaw that they were wonderfully good. This his bleſſing abideth ſtill upon his Creatures ſo firm and conſtant, that they need no mans bleſſing, much leſs a Papiſts. And theſe things which he hath prepared to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the faithful with thankſgiving, he hath already ſo ſanctified and made pure by his Word, that they have no need of a new ſanctification. Notwithſtanding the Papiſts after their old manner, go forth to abuſe the good Creatures of God, and to think thoſe unclean which God hath puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and therefore they new bleſs and ſanctifie them. Moreover, they deſire of God, that ſo many as eat of this their hallowed Cheeſe and Butter, may be filled with all Heavenly bleſſing, and with the holineſs of Gods grace. Great muſt the virtue of this hallowed Cheeſe and Butter be, ſeeing it bringeth to the Eaters thereof, abundance of all Heavenly bleſſing, and the holineſs of Gods grace. But the Papiſts may ask theſe things twice of God, before they obtain them once. All Heavenly bleſſing and the grace of God, comes not by eating ſanctified Cheeſe and Butter, but they be freely given of God to the faithful, for his Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake, as is above ſaid.</p>

               <head>The hallowing of new baken Bread that lately came out of the Oven.</head>
               <p>IN hallowing the new baken Bread, the Papiſts uſe theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O Lord holy Father, Almighty everlaſting God, vouchſafe <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> to bleſs this Bread with thy holy and Spiritual benediction, that it may be to all men health of mind and Body, and a defence againſt all Diſeaſes, and againſt all the crafty aſſaults of their Enemies.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>As in all other his benedictions, ſo likewiſe in this, the ſacrificing Papiſt beggeth of God, that he will vouchſafe to bleſs the new Bread; yea, and that unto this end, that it may be unto all men (he meaneth ſo many as ſhall eat of it) health of mind and Body, and a defence againſt all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and againſt all the crafty aſſaults of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>Here the Papiſt layeth on load, and beggeth much, becauſe he may ſeem to obtain ſomewhat. But if this his requeſt were granted of God, (as it is moſt certainly denied) then ſhould we neither have need of the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Phyſician for the health of the Body, nor yet of the Spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, that is to ſay Chriſt, for the Salvation of the Soul. For both theſe things are gotten by eating this new ſanctified Bread. But how falſe and ſlight Merchandize theſe falſe Merchants bring forth and utter to the ſimple Idiots and unlearned People, the learned know. For as touching the health of the body, who knoweth not, that although the ſick Perſon have his gorge crammed full of this hallowed new baken Bread, yet is he never the nearer to health, but remaineth ſtill ſick and diſeaſed? And as touching the health and ſalvation of the Soul, to whom is it unknown that Chriſt alone is the Author thereof? <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name</hi> (ſaid the Angel to <hi>Joſeph) Jeſus, that is to ſay, a Saviour. For he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins.</hi> Likewiſe ſaith St. <hi>Peter, There is Salvation in none other. Neither is there any other name given to men under Heaven, wherein they muſt be</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56275:17"/>
ſaved. And our Saviour Chriſt himſelf ſaith by the Prophet, <hi>I am the Lord, there is no Saviour beſides me. A God that ſaveth, there is none but I alone.</hi> Vain therefore is the ſalvation that is looked for through Popiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And curſed is he that maketh fleſh his arm, and ſuffereth his heart to depart and go away from the Lord. For the Lord ſhall deſtroy all them that run a whore-hunting from God after vile and ſtrange Idols, which are nothing elſe than the idle inventions of idle and wicked men.</p>
               <p>Again, As concerning defence againſt all Diſeaſes, and againſt all the crafty aſſaults of our Enemies, either corporal or ſpiritual, we are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that it cometh only from God. He only with his mighty hand and outſtretched arm defendeth his People from all evils both bodily and ghoſtly. And as he defendeth us from all ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, and all other misfortunes, ſo likewiſe doth he only preſerve and keep us from all ſuch as go about to moleſt and trouble us either in body or in ſoul. So far is it off that theſe benefits come unto us from a piece of new baken Bread, ſanctified by a Popiſh Prieſt, Antichriſt's Chaplain.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN hallowing and bleſsing Fleſh, the Popiſh Prieſt uſeth divers Prayers. In the firſt he hath theſe words:</p>

                  <hi>We beſeech thee, that thou wilt vouchſafe to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſs and to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> ſanctifie this Fleſh: that it may be to all that eat of it ſtrength of body and pureneſs of mind.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>In the ſecond Prayer he ſayeth thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vouchſafe, O Lord God Almighty, to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſs and to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> ſanctifie theſe Creatures of clean Fleſh, that whoſoever among thy faithful People ſhall eat them, may be repleniſhed with all heavenly benediction and healthful grace.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>In the third Prayer he hath theſe words:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>We meekly beſeech thee, that thou wilt vouchſafe to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſs and to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie this Fleſh of four-footed Beaſts and Birds, that it may be to all us that receive it, the bleſſing of the ſoul and the defence of the body, and a moſt ſure ſtabliſhment to all the bowels.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>In the fourth Prayer he ſpeaketh on this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>We humbly beſeech thee, O Almighty God, That thou wilt vouchſafe to bleſs and ſanctifie <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> theſe Creatures which are the Fleſh of clean Birds, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall eat of them, may he repleniſhed with the abundance of thy bleſſing, and deſerve to come unto the paſtures of everlaſting life.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>In the firſt of theſe Prayers, after the Maſsing-Prieſt hath beſeeched God to bleſs and ſanctifie that Fleſh there preſent, as though the bleſsing he gave to all his Creatures at the beginning were now worn out, or elſe ſo old that it needeth to be renewed, he deſireth alſo, That it may be to all that eat of it, ſtrength of body and pureneſs of mind.</p>
               <p>The Meat received and well digeſted of an hungry ſtomach, bringeth, through God's bleſsing, to the body of the eater ſtrength, no man doubteth, but that it bringeth pureneſs of mind to ſuch as eat it, is very ſtrange, nay
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56275:17"/>
it is directly againſt the Word of God. In the Old Law the <hi>Jews</hi> at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God did both offer and eat divers kinds of Beaſts and Fowls: yet read we not, that they were made holy and purified thereby.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Noah</hi> after the Floud built an Altar unto the Lord, and took of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beaſt, and of every clean Fowl, and offered Sacrifices on the Altar, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That the Lord ſmelled a ſweet savour.</hi> It is not said, That the offering of that Fleſh purified and cleanſed the minds of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Meats are ordained of God not to purifie the mind, but to comfort and cheriſh the body. The minds and hearts of the faithful are purified by Faith, and not by corruptible Meats, which periſh and come to nought. Spiritual Diſeaſes are cured with Spiritual Medicines, and not with groſs and outward Emplaiſters. The evil and wicked affections of the mind are more privy and ſubtil Diſeaſes than can be healed with eating a piece of fleſh. Vain therefore is this their Prayer unto God in this behalf. The holy Apoſtle ſaith, That ſuch Offerings as were offered in the old Law at the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, could not purifie the Conſciences of men, but of neceſſity it behoved Chriſt to offer himſelf a ſweet ſmelling sacrifice, that by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof, both body and ſoul of the faithful believer might be purged and purified. And is it to be thought that fleſh eaten is able to cleanſe the minds of the eaters! O new Divinity!</p>
               <p>In the ſecond part he deſireth God, That whoſoever among the faithful people ſhall eat thoſe Creatures of clean fleſh, may be repleniſhed with all heavenly benediction and healthful grace.</p>
               <p>To be repleniſhed and filled with all heavenly benediction and healthful grace, cometh not by eating of fleſh, although never ſo clean, and never ſo oft purified, cleanſed, ſanctified, bleſſed and hallowed of the Popiſh Prieſt. Theſe benefits are obtained only at the hand of God, through faith in the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is to ſay, Chriſt, in whom all Nations are bleſſed: as we have before heard.</p>
               <p>In the third Prayer he humbly beſeecheth God to bleſs and ſanctifie the fleſh of four-footed Beaſts and Birds, that it may be to all them that receive it, the bleſſing of the ſoul, and the defence of the body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What bleſſing the ſoul hath (I ſpeak of the inward Man, of the ſpirit which is born only of God) or can have by eating fleſh, I ſee not. But that the ſoul is many times accombred through the abuſe of fleſh, ſuperfluity, banqueting, ſurfeting and rioting, daily experience doth ſufficiently declare. In conſideration whereof, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> giving himſelf to abſtinence, ſaith, <hi>I chaſtise my body, and bring it unto bondage.</hi> If the holy Apoſtle had known that he might have received the bleſsing of the ſoul by eating, he would not have given himſelf ſo much to abſtinence and faſting. <hi>Meats are ordained,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, for the belly,</hi> (he ſaith not for the ſoul) <hi>and the belly for meats, but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them.</hi> Again he ſaith, <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.

For who knoweth not, That good meat is a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt hunger, and againſt certain diſeaſes of the body? But if he meaneth any other defence, that by eating that hallowed meat he ſhould be defended from his Enemies, either bodily or ghoſtly, he utterly deceiveth both himſelf and the people. For this defence cometh to the faithful from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56275:18"/>
God alone, who hath numbred all the hairs of their heads, keepeth all their bones, ſo that none of them ſhall be broken, and ſendeth his Angel to pitch his Tent in the midſt of them that fear him, that he may deliver them from all danger and peril, and defend them againſt all their Enemies.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Prayer, the Sacrificer goeth forth to diſcloſe and utter his madneſs, and beſeecheth God, that whoſoever ſhall eat the Fleſh of the clean Birds there ſanctified and bleſſed, may be repleniſhed with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his bleſſing, and deſerve to come unto the Paſtures of everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Meat maketh us not acceptable to God. Neither if we eat, are we the better, nor if we eat not, are we the worſe. Again, The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but Righteouſneſs and Peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. As the meat that entreth into the mouth, doth not defile a man; ſo likewiſe doth it not ſanctifie nor juſtifie man; ſo far is it from repleniſhing and filling us with the abundance of Gods bleſſing.</p>
               <p>And as touching that they which eat of this hallowed Fleſh, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſerve to come unto the Paſtures of Everlaſting Life: Who ſeeth not that this is a new kind of Divinity? Where was it ever read or heard before, that men by eating Fleſh hallowed of a Papiſt, ſhould deſerve to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Everlaſting Life? Verily if this Doctrine were true, it were a very eaſie thing to enter into Heaven. We ſhould not need to Pray, nor Faſt, nor give Alms, nor to do any other good work, but only to eat and drink, and to be merry, according to the old ſaying, <hi>Dum ſumus in mundo, vivamus corde jucundo.</hi> But our Saviour Chriſt teaches us far otherwiſe, ſaying, <hi>Enter in at the ſtrait Gate: for wide is the Gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat. But ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That by many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of merits and deſerts we have before ſpoken. And as touching Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, we are taught by the holy Apoſtle, that it is the free gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom be glory for ever.</p>

He muſt alſo have one with him that ſhall bear the Tar-box, otherwiſe called the Chriſmatory, wrapped in a Towel; another to carry the Cenſer; a third to bear the Ship; and two more to carry the two Candleſticks burning, to light him that he ſtumble not by the way, beſides the whole Quire. All theſe being ſet in a moſt ſeemly order, they take their Journey out of the Chancel unto the Font, merrily ſinging the <hi>Kyrie,</hi> and calling upon a number of Saints; as Angels and Archangels, Patriarches and Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, Martyrs, Widows and Virgins, with all the company both of he Saints and ſhe Saints, with <hi>Omnes

Among all, that he will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to keep the Apoſtolick Lord, (that is to ſay the Pope) and all the Eccleſiaſtical Degree in holy Religion. They pray alſo for the Biſhop of the Dioceſs: But as touching either King or Queen, they are paſt over with ſilence. Theſe things diſpatched out of the way with a <hi>Pater noſter</hi> and a <hi>Credo;</hi> the Prieſt falleth in hand with the conſecration or hallowing of the Maſs, and deſireth God to command, that all unclean Spirits may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of that Water, and that all the wickedneſs of the Devils deceit may ſtand far off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That it may be an holy and an innocent Creature, free from all invaſion of the Enemy, and purged through the departure of all wickedneſs.

               <p>Here muſt the Prieſt make the third Croſs in the Water, after the manner before appointed. Then goeth he forth again to ſpeak to the Water on this wiſe,</p>

               <p>When he hath once done the Conſecration and Bleſſing of the Font, he is commanded to put Oyl into the Water, making a <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> of the Oyl with the Bullion which is in the Veſſel of the Oyl, otherwiſe call'd the Chrifmatory, ſaying on this manner:</p>

               </q>
               <p>This thing being diſpatched out of the way, the Prieſt muſt put Cream into the Font, making a croſs of the Cream with the Bullion that is in the Veſſel of Cream, and ſay,</p>
               <q>

               <p>Theſe things thus finiſhed, the Prieſt with all his Trinkets and Complices muſt return into the Quire, merrily ſinging <hi>Rex Sanctorum,</hi> &amp;c. Then alſo for joy and glee muſt all the Bells be rung that are either in the Steeple, Church, or Chancel. And thus endeth the ſanctifying and hallowing of the Font according to the Pope's appointment.</p>
               <p>Here hath been much ado about a thing of nothing, I mean about the Conſecration of the Font. But what needeth all this reckoning? To what end hath the Popiſh Prieſt been ſo buſie with his Exorciſms and Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with his Sanctifications and Conſecrations, with his Bleſſings and Croſſings, with his Gapings and Breathings, with his Oylings and Creamings? To make the Water more holy? But who can make the Water more holy than God himſelf hath already made it? To make the Sacrament of the more efficacy, virtue and ſtrength? But Chriſt inſtituting the holy Myſtery of Baptiſm, maketh no mention of all theſe trifling Ceremonies, which without all doubt he would have done, if he had thought them neceſſary for the due adminiſtration of Baptiſm. When <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> baptiſed in the Wilderneſs, he uſed ſimple and natural Water, without bleſſing or croſſing. So likewiſe did the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as <hi>Philip,</hi> when he baptiſed the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, and others. Many years alſo after Chriſt's aſcenſion the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Chriſt's Church baptiſed with Water ſimply, without any addition of ſuch Conſecrations and Bleſſings. The more ſimple and the nearer to Chriſt's Inſtitution their Adminiſtration of the Sacrament was, the better was it allowed of all true Chriſtians. They knew not this pomp, this pride, this magnificence, and this ſolemnity that is now uſed in Popiſh Churches. The Devil and the Pope, that Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> invented all thoſe trifles, and thruſt them into the Church of Chriſt, unto the great obſcuring and utter defacing of the purity of Chriſt's holy and bleſſed Myſteries. And notwithſtanding, into ſuch ignorance and blindneſs are both the Prieſts and People come, through the wicked traditions of men, that if any of the leaſt of theſe frivolous Ceremonies be left out, they think the Baptiſm to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56275:19"/>
worth, and the Children not to be chriſtned. O lamentable blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! But let all true Chriſtians perſuade themſelves, that pure and ſimple Water, coupled with the Word, maketh the Sacrament of Baptiſm ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and perfect, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, The Word is joyned to the Element, and thereof is made a Sacrament.</p>
               <p>As touching the Conſecrations, Bleſſings, Croſſings, Gapings, Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Oylings, Creamings, Perfumings, and ſuch other trifling Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they are the drouſie dreams and fooliſh fancies of Hypocrites, and therefore not to be regarded nor frequented, but rather to be neglected and omitted, as things nothing appertaining unto the ſubſtance and matter of Baptiſm. But let us conſider certain things uſed of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of their Font.</p>
               <p>Firſt the Prieſt deſireth God to command, that all unclean Spirits may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of that Water, and that all the wickedneſs of the Devils deceit may ſtand far off, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no Creature that ever God made, be it never ſo pure and clean, but if it come once into the hands of theſe ſacrificing <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it is ſtraight-ways not only unpure and unclean, but alſo full of Devils and wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. When notwithſtanding God at the beginning pronounced the Water, as all his other Creatures, to be very good, and no evil in them: yea, the Lord our God ſo eſteemeth this Creature of Water, that by it he hath not only wrought many wonderful Miracles, but alſo in his holy Scriptures compareth his holy and bleſſed Spirit to this Element of Water. One alſo of the principal and chief Myſteries which he hath left to his holy Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for their comfort, and to expreſs therein his ſingular good will toward them, is ſet forth in Water, as an Element moſt apt to ſet forth our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and New Birth in Chriſt. But the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as we have before heard, find fault not only with the Water, but with Salt, Bread, Wax, Fire, and what not? But this their doing is well known to be nothing elſe than plain jugling. St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> knew no Devil nor evil Spirit in the Water when he baptized in the Wilderneſs. Chriſt's Apoſtles judged the Water pure and clean and the good Creature of God when they baptized. <hi>Philip</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Eunuch uſed the Water that was next at hand. If Chriſt had known the Devil to be in the Element of Water, he would never have made it a Sacrament of Regeneration. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo greatly eſteem this Myſtery of Baptiſm, which partly conſiſts of Water and partly of the Word, that he calleth it the Fountain of the new Birth, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt. And in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he hath theſe words; <hi>Chriſt loved the Congregation and gave himſelf for it to ſanctifie it, and cleanſed it in the Fountain of Water, through the Word, to make it unto himſelf a glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blame.</hi> Doth not our Saviour Chriſt ſay plainly, <hi>That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> If Devils or wicked Spirits had been in the Water, as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> dream, the holy Ghoſt would never have beautified this Element of Water with ſuch praiſes and commendations in the holy Scriptures. And who knoweth not that of all the four Elements none is more neceſſary than Water, neither have we any in more uſe. God give us grace to uſe this and all other Creatures unto his glory with thankſgiving. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us ſee to what end the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would have the Devil and all wicked Spirits driven out of the Water. It is forſooth, that it may be an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56275:20"/>
holy and an innocent Creature, free from all invaſion of the Enemy, and purged from all wickedneſs. And that it be a living Fountain, a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that regenerateth and begetteth a-new, a purifying Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Creature of Water is already Holy, ſanctified of him who is Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf; and therefore hath no need of the Popiſh ſanctifications and hallowings. It is alſo of it ſelf innocent and harmleſs, created of God for the uſe and commodity both of Man and Beaſt, as all other Creatures of God are. If at any time we be plagued either with Water or Fire, or with any other Creature of God; the fault is not in thoſe good and innocent Creatures of God, but in our ſelves, who through our manifold wickedneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God unto anger; as we may ſee in the Hiſtories of the Flood, and of the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whereas they deſire of God that it may be a living Fountain, a Water that regenerateth and begetteth a-new, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we grant that Baptiſm is an holy Sacrament; but that the outward Water giveth life, begetteth a-new, and purifieth the heart, we utterly deny; It being not in the power of a lifeleſs Element to do this. It is the work of the Holy Ghoſt alone: as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth and maketh alive.</hi> When Chriſt talked with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of our regeneration and new birth, he made mention not only of Water, but of the Spirit alſo: to declare that the chief worker of our regeneration and new birth, is the Holy Ghoſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe Grace and ſecret Inſpiration, the outward waſhing profiteth nothing. <hi>Judas Iſcariot, Simon Magus, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> with divers others, were Baptized with the outward Baptiſm of Water, and yet are they now damned Souls in Hell Fire. They had the Water, but they had not the Spirit. Their Bodies were outwardly waſhed, but their Souls were not cleanſed by the Holy Ghoſt; their hypocriſie ſo deſerving. Now if the Water of Baptiſm by it ſelf were of ſuch virtue and power, that it could give life, purifie and beget a-new; then ſhould all falſe Chriſtians and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites become the Children of God, and Heirs to Everlaſting Glory. But it is truly ſaid of St. <hi>Paul, They that are led with the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi> If any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. Though the bleſſed Apoſtle calleth Baptiſm the Fountain of the new birth, yet, he immediately addeth the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring hereby, That although Baptiſm be the Fountain of the new birth, that ſo many as be waſhed with that Water, have put off <hi>Adam</hi> and be born a-new in Chriſt; yet, that our renovation cometh by the Holy Ghoſt. He alone quickneth and maketh us alive in Chriſt Jeſus. He alone regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth and begetteth us a-new. Without this outward waſhing many have been and are daily ſaved; but without the inward waſhing of the Holy Ghoſt no man can be ſaved. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Not to the Water therefore, ought the Papiſts to attribute the virtue and power of making alive in Chriſt, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating, purifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe Office alone it is to work all theſe good things in the hearts of Gods Elect and choſen People.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Whereas the Prieſt turneth him to the Water and ſaith, <hi>I bleſs thee thou Creature of Water, by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, &amp;c. Yea, I bleſs thee by Jeſus Chriſt, his only Son our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Who ſeeth not his madneſs? Will any man count him ſober or in his right mind, that ſhall ſpeak to a thing without life? This do the Popiſh Prieſts in the preſence of God, his bleſſed Angels, and of his holy Congregation. If
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56275:20"/>
this ſtuff had been ſpoken in a known tongue, as it was uttered in a ſtrange Language, the People many years ago would have hiſſed thoſe Antichriſtian Sacrificers out of their Temples, and not have ſuffered themſelves to be deluded and mocked by them. But what needeth this Popiſh Prieſt to bleſs the Water by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, and by Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, ſeeing that the bleſſed Trinity ſo many hundred years paſt, hath already ſufficiently and abundantly bleſſed the Waters? O the vain dreams of men!</p>
               <p>After theſe things, the Prieſt in a Prayer whiſpered out by him, deſireth God to bleſs thoſe Waters with his mouth. Verily, this is a new kind of bleſſing, as bleſſing is commonly taken among us. Men uſe, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves alſo uſe to bleſs with their fingers and not with their mouth. When the ſimple People ſee a Biſhop riding gorgeouſly upon his Mule, more like to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> than to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> they uſe to cry out, My Lord, your bleſſing; My Lord, your bleſſing for St. <hi>Charity:</hi> thinking to receive ſome great benefit by that means, both to their Body and Soul; when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in my Countrey, the Biſhops bleſſing would not go for Horſe meat. Doth the Biſhop gape upon them? or rather doth he lift up his hand and ſo bleſs them? But wherefore would the Prieſt have God to bleſs thoſe Waters? Verily, that beſides the natural cleanſing which they ſhew in waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bodies, they may alſo be of ſtrength to purifie the Minds.</p>
               <p>That the natural property of Water is to cleanſe the Body and all outward things, no man that hath reaſon will deny. But that Water, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much Conſecrated, Sanctified and Bleſſed, purifieth the mind, Soul, Spirit or inward Man, neither reaſon nor Scripture doth allow. For what is it to purifie the mind, but to forgive ſins, to give the Holy Ghoſt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff new and ſpiritual motions, to alter the whole man, and to be cloathed with Holineſs, Righteouſneſs and Truth? This is not the work of any man in Earth, nor yet of any Angel in Heaven; much leſs of a Creature that is without all ſenſe and feeling. If the Water ſanctified by Man, purifieth the mind, much more ſhould the Man that ſanctifieth the Water do the ſame. But Man doeth it not, neither is it done by the Water. It is God alone by his holy Spirit, that purifieth the mind, and ſearcheth the reins and hearts. Man is the Miniſter, Water the thing miniſtred, but God is he that worketh all: as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Paul planteth, Apollo watereth, but God giveth the encreaſe.</hi> Therefore neither he that planteth, nor he that watereth, is any thing worth, but God which giveth the increaſe. It is truly ſaid of St. <hi>Cyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Whether</hi> Judas <hi>or</hi> Paul <hi>Baptizeth, Chriſt waſheth and putteth away the ſin.</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, <hi>To forgive ſins in Baptiſm, and to give the Holy Ghoſt, is the Office of God alone.</hi> If therefore God giveth the effect of health, there is no glory of man in this behalf. For we know that the Holy Ghoſt is given of God, without impoſition or laying on of hands, and that he who was not Baptized, obtained remiſſion of ſins. Hereto agreeth the ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> As concerning the viſible Miniſtery, both good and bad do Baptize; but he doth inwardly Baptize by them, whoſe both the viſible Baptiſm and inviſible grace is. Therefore both good and bad may Baptize, but none can waſh and purifie the Conſcience, but he only who is always good. Hence it follows that the Papiſts teach falſe Doctrine, when they hold that the Sacraments give grace, purifie the mind, waſh the Conſcience, and change the whole man. Indeed the Sacraments repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and preach theſe things to the outward man, but it is God alone that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56275:21"/>
giveth theſe things by his holy Spirit, that he which rejoyceth might rejoyce in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the fooliſh Ceremonies which the Popiſh Prieſt uſeth in the Conſecration of the Font; as making Croſſes, dropping Candle into the Font, dividing the Water with Candle, putting Oyl and Cream into the Water, breathing into the Font, and ſuch like beggerly Trifles, they are more worthy to be derided than confuted, being indeed nothing elſe than childiſh Plays and apiſh Toys. Thus much concerning the Popiſh conſecrations of the Font.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Then let holy Water be ſprinkled upon the Ring, and all is well. Who can otherwiſe than laugh at the folly of theſe fooliſh Papiſts, who not being content to ſhew their fondneſs in certain trifling matters, muſt deſire God to ſend his bleſſing on a poor Ring? What kind of Prayers are theſe unto God? Are they worthy of Gods Majeſty? Is this to ask according to the will of God? God ought not to be called upon in vain and trifling matters, but in grave and weighty Cauſes, in affairs that appertain unto his glory, and to the ſalvation of our Souls. The very Heathen in times paſt would have been aſhamed to offer up their Prayers to their falſe Gods, for ſuch fooliſh and childiſh things. And to ſay the truth, this kind of praying is nothing elſe than a plain mocking of God. The Papiſts might with as good a Conſcience pray to God, to make the weathercock of <hi>Pauls</hi> a Preacher; for this Prayer would pleaſe God aſſoon as the other. But let us ſee to what end the Papiſt deſireth God to ſend his bleſſing upon the Ring: It is, ſaith he, That ſhe which ſhall wear it may be armed with the virtue of Heavenly defence, and that it may profit her to eternal ſalvation. Here be two goodly matters if they might be obtained. But where hath God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the wearing of a Ring hallowed by a Popiſh Prieſt, ſhould bring to the wearer, the vertue of Heavenly defence and everlaſting ſalvation? What if an Heathen Woman and an Idolatreſs ſhould wear this ſanctified Ring, ſhould ſhe alſo enjoy theſe two Commodities? For the words are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>That ſhe which ſhall wear it, &amp;c.</hi> But to be ſhort, we ſhall note that the vertue of Heavenly defence cometh not by the wearing of a Ring, but by the mighty protection of God; wherewith, both by his Grace and Spirit,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56275:21"/>
and by the Miniſtery of his Angels he defended his Elect and choſen People, as it is written, <hi>The poor crieth, and the Lord heareth him, and delivereth him out of all his troubles. The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his Tent round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as touching eternal Salvation, who knoweth not that it is the free gift of God, given to the faithful for Chriſt Jeſus ſake? Therefore to aſcribe theſe heavenly Treaſures to the wearing of a poor Ring, doth not a little obſcure the Grace of God, and the Merits of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion.</p>

               <head>The Hallowing of the Pilgrims <hi>Wallet</hi> and <hi>Staff.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Pilgrims that intend to go on, Pilgrimage either to St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compoſtella,</hi> or to any other Saints, muſt firſt of all be bleſſed of the Prieſt in this manner:</p>
               <p>Firſt the Pilgrims muſt come devoutly unto the Church, and make their Confeſſion humbly to the Prieſt, and gladly receive of him Penance and Abſolution. Afterward they ſhall come into the Chancel, reverently proſtrating themſelves, and lying flat upon the ground before the Altar. Then the Prieſt ſhall ſay theſe <hi>Pſalms, Miſerere, Deus miſereatur, Qui habitat, Nunc dimittis,</hi> with <hi>Kyrie eleyſon, Chriſte eleyſon, Kyrie eleyſon, Pater noſter, Ave,</hi> &amp;c. After theſe things ſhall follow the hallowing of the Pilgrims Wallet and Staff.</p>
               <p>In the hallowing of this Staff, amongſt many other words, the Popiſh Prieſt hath theſe:</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>O Lord Jeſu Chriſt, we humbly call upon thee that thou wilt vouchſafe to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> bleſs this Wallet and Staff, that whoſoever for the love of thy Name doth endeavour himſelf to take the ſame by his ſide as an Armour of humility, and to hang it about their necks, or to carry it in their hands, and ſo going on Pilgrimage (having meek Devotion for a Companion of their Journey) to ſeek the helps of Saints, they being preſerved with the defence of thy right hand, may merit to come to the joys of the eternal viſion.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Here is more work for the Tinker. A new Maſter, a new, and hang up the old, as the Porters cry in <hi>Sturbridge</hi>-Fair. Here is a ſudden fall even out of the Hall into the Kitchin, as they uſe to ſay. Our Papiſt is ſuddenly come from his golden Rings to Scrips, Wallets, and Staves, and now he ſanctifieth and bleſſeth them, yea and that ſo much the more, becauſe they are but vile Pedlary Ware, and ſerve only for <hi>Rome</hi>-runners, and Pilgrimage-gadders. In this his Conſecration he humbly beſeecheth God to bleſs the Wallet and the Staff. Without doubt God is not a little bound to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</hi> For as they are buſie-bodies themſelves, ſo will they not ſuffer God to be unoccupied. The <hi>Epicures</hi> fain that God is idle in Heaven, and taketh no care of his Creatures, but ſuffereth all things to go which way they will: Fortune, and not God's Providence, bearing rule. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> therefore, as it may ſeem, fearing that God ſhould fall into idleneſs and forget his Creatures, appoint him to work: But, what work I pray ye? Verily to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and bleſs Water, Salt, Bread, Candles, Palms, Fire, Aſhes, Incenſe, Paſcal, Paſcal Lamb, Eggs, Herbs, Milk, Honey, Apples, Wine, Cheeſe, Butter, new baken Bread, Fleſh, Font, and I know not how many things beſides. And now at the laſt they appoint him to conſecrate, bleſs, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56275:22"/>
ſanctifie vile beggerly Wallets and Staves for <hi>Rome</hi>-runners and Pilgrimage-gadders. Is not God much bound to theſe <hi>Papiſts</hi> that appoint him ſo vile an Office? And is not God worthy to tender theſe their requeſts? And are not theſe requeſts of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> meet to be granted?</p>
               <p>But let us ſee why the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are ſo deſirous that God ſhould bleſs theſe Wallets and Scrips, theſe Staves and Sticks. Becauſe, ſay they, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever endeavours to take the ſame Wallet and Staff by his ſide, or to hang it about his neck, or to carry it in his hand, and ſo go on Pilgrimage to ſeek the helps of Saints, may merit to come to the joys of the eternal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Is not here a good work in hand think you? Ought not God even of duty to put to his helping hand, and to put this good deed forward? An idle, lend, laſie Lubber is determined to wander and gad abroad with his Wallet and Staff, and to live of the ſweat of folks hands, and God muſt be a Cloak of his idleneſs. Is it not well appointed? Why do they not alſo appoint God to bleſs the Pilgrims Breeches, Hoſe, Shoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For he hath as much need of all theſe things in his Journey, as of the Wallet and the Staff, except he hath made a vow to go his Pilgrimage breechleſs and bare-arſed, bare-legged and bare-footed, as many do. And what other thing is it to go on Pilgrimage to ſeek the helps of Saints, than to play the Idolaters, and to run away from God, that fountain and well-ſpring of all goodneſs, and to commit Whoredom, I mean Idolatry, with Creatures, which of themſelves were never able to help themſelves, and to beg of them that they cannot give? Is it any other thing to ſeek the help of Saints, than to diſtruſt God, and to think him either not to have a will, or elſe not to have power to help? For if they believed ſufficient ability in God for to help, and a will agreable to the ſame, they would never run a whoring from God, and follow ſtrange Lovers. And who knoweth whether all they to whom theſe Idolaters run on Pilgrimage, be Saints in Heaven, or rather many of them Devils in Hell. Again, If they be able to help their Clients, why do they not ſhow their power univerſally, as well as in one place, but rather compel men to take many weary Journeys upon them to ſeek their helps, and to forſake Country, Father, Mother, Friends, Wife, Children, Houſe, Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Saint which is not able to help in all places alike, is able to help in none. Therefore they that ſeek the helps of Saints more in one place than in another, do nothing elſe but deceive themſelves, and walk the ways of wearineſs and wickedneſs. When the Saints themſelves lived in this World, they by no means could abide that any glory or honour ſhould be aſcribed to them, but with heart and voice they cried unto God, and ſaid, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give the glory.</hi> And as they themſelves did not truſt in their own righteouſneſs, but in the Merits of Chriſt's Death only, ſo likewiſe taught they all other ſo to do. And is it to be thought that they are now become ſo ambitious and deſirous of vain glory, that being glorified in Heaven, and free from all mortal affections, and following the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, they ſhould now arrogate and challenge to themſelves the Office and Power of God. Theſe Pilgrimage-gadders therefore and <hi>Rome</hi>-runners in running hither and thither to ſeek the helps of Saints, do not only provoke the hot wrath and great indignation of God againſt them, but alſo deſerve no thanks at all of the Saints, whoſe honour they ſeem greatly to ſeek. It were much better for them to tarry at home, to labour according to their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56275:22"/>
Vocation, and in their neceſſities to call upon God, who according to his promiſe both will and can help, deſiring God to give them grace to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and practiſe in their converſation and living in the virtuous and godly manners which the true Saints of God expreſſed and ſhewed when they lived in this World: and alſo to ſet continually before their eyes, that in this World they have no dwelling City, but are here as Strangers and Pilgrims, and that therefore they ought to make preparation for the World to come, that whenſoever the good Man of the houſe cometh, he may find them watching.</p>
               <p>Now after that the Prieſt hath hallowed the Wallet and the Staff, he muſt ſprinkle them both with holy Water, and put the Wallet about the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim's Neck, ſaying,</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, take this Wallet, the Habit of thy Pilgrimage, that being well chaſtned and ſaved, thou mayeſt deſerve to come to the places of the Saints, thither as thou deſireſt to go, and that when thy Journey is done, thou mayeſt return, unto us ſafe and ſound.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Behold with what Solemnity this Wallet is put on: even in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as though ſome great Miracle ſhould be wrought. As in many other things, ſo likewiſe in this, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do utterly abuſe the Name of the Lord Chriſt. The Name of Chriſt ought with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to be named, yea and that not in trifles, but in ſerious, weighty, and neceſſary matters. And whereas they make the Wallet to be the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Pilgrim, and that he ſhould be known by that Wallet to be a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim: I ſay plainly, that by this Argument, all Beggers ſhould be Pilgrims, for they alſo wear Wallets, and whitherſoever they go they ſhall go on Pilgrimage, by reaſon of their Wallet, ſeeing that the Wallet is the Habit of a Pilgrim.</p>
               <p>This Wallet is put on about the Pilgrim's Neck, to this end, as it may ſeem, not only that by it he ſhould be known to be a Pilgrim, but alſo that by the virtue thereof he may merit and deſerve to come to the places of the Saints, whither he intendeth to go. Such Saints, ſuch Reliques. Such Works, ſuch Merits. Such Lettice, ſuch Lips. Such Carpenter, ſuch Chips. Verily as the Dignity of the Wallet is nothing worth, ſo likewiſe the Pilgrim meriteth nothing by his Pilgrimage, but the wrath and vengeance of God, for as much as he forſaking the Lord his God, who is preſent in all places with his moſt preſent help, hunteth after Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and at their hands ſeeketh all good things both for Body and Soul, when all good and perfect gifts come down from God alone, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>After that the Wallet is moſt Solemnly thus put on about the Pilgrim's Neck, then muſt the Prieſt alſo deliver to him a Staff, ſaying on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unto him;</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Take this Staff to hold thee by in thy Journey and Travel of thy Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, that thou mayeſt be able to overcome all the rabbles of the Enemies, and come without fear to the places of the Saints, whither thou deſireſt to go, and that when the courſe of obedience is finiſhed, thou mayeſt return to us again with joy.</hi>

This ſhall come to paſs, if we will endeavour our ſelves to caſt away all confidence in Creatures, repoſe all our affiance in the Lord our God, earneſtly call upon his holy Name, and train our Lives according to his bleſſed Word and Ordinance, as God himſelf ſaith, <hi>O that my People would have hearkned unto me!
