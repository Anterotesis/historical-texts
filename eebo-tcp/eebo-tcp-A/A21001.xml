            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20975:6"/>
looke of thine angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when casting thine eye vpon us, thou percest the very bottome of our hearts, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerest the secrets of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure consciences? our abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sinnes will draw downe thy iust anger vpon our heads, and thy inkindeled wrath will throw vs head-long at once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gulphe of paine, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and misery. Before then that thy fury doth arise against mee, and that thou commest with a iust disdaine to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw &amp; destroy me, harken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the humble groning which my heart, possessed with feare, doth present vnto thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this weake and panting voyce which with tears, cryeth

thus vnto thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mercy, mercy ô Lord, alas my God what dost thou? wilt thou make proofe of thy strength on my weakenesse? dost thou thinke that I present my selfe before thee to wrastle against thy power? it is thy cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency ô Lord which I run vnto. I place my selfe vnder thy wing to the end it may defend mee from the rigor of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which I haue to much deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20975:7"/>
that all my bones are bruzed and broken.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And my poore body is not onely thus cruelly aflicted, but likewise my miserable soule is wholy dipped in sorrow: this soule, ô Lord, which did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with her voyce to glorifie the author of her life, is beaten downe, and desolate, without strength, and courage; and as the fearefull Doue hideth her selfe at the voyce of thunder in some little hollow place, euen so she perceauing thy fearefull indignation doth seeke out the most obscure darkenesse for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.

of pitty where-with thou canst blot out, not onely my sinnes, but those of the whole world. I feele my soule to sticke fast in a foule and deepe bogge of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity: she sinketh, she stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out her hand vnto thee ô Lord: alasse draw her forth of it, &amp; bring her into the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Saue her ô Lord, for she coniures thee by thine infinite goodnesse and vnspeakeable mercy. It is most true that she deserues it not, and ought not to hope for helpe from him, whome shee hath so carelesly forsaken, against whose honor she hath so wickedly conspired: The reward of her offence ought not to be mercy, but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eternall death.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20975:8"/>
5. But ô Lord who is it that in the middest of hell; in the bottomlese pit of death, shall sing thy praises, and sound forth thy name? there is the dwelling place of sorrow, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heard but howlings, there is nothing seene but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thy prayse on the contrarie consisteth in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of thy infinite meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, goodnesse and mercy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And thenbehold on the one side humble penitence which intercedeth for me, and which hath sworne not to leaue mee vntill it hath reconciled me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. And on the other, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble praier which importunes thee for me, and hath sworne not to let thee rest till it hath

reconciled me vnto thee. Alas ô Lord, thou hast so oftentimes seene my teares, and heard my lamentations. That I doe daily at the remembrance of mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences wash my face with my teares, I cause my bed to swim in the water with streameth from mine eyes: what is it which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth mee to doe so? is it not ô Lord penitence which I religiously obserue?</p>
               <p n="7">7. I looke downe-ward, and tremble with feare at the aspect of thine angry countenance. I doe patiently endure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of mine enemies, and take their reproches in good worth, as the iust punishment of their offences. I walke in their sight with sackcloth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20975:9"/>
with ashes on my head, and confession in my mouth, I pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate my selfe at the feete of thine Altars; I make leane with scourges of affliction the flesh which deliuered ouer my body vnto sinne: but my torments serue for matter of laughter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that hate mee, who swarme about mee to traduce me by scoffes and derision.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But now that thou doost shew mercy vnto me, I will bid them stand backe, stand backe ô yee children of iniquity, yee shall no more laugh at my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: the Lord hath heard my prayer, my teares haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his wrath, and loe I enioy the frute of his holy fauor. The brightnesse of his goodnesse

hath shined vpon me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the mists wherin my head was wrapped are on a sodaine scattered and vanished away.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I had skarce opened my lips to inuoke his ayde; my heart did skarcely dispose it selfe to craue his pardon, when as I felt his grace to bee shed vpon me, to comfort and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my languishing soule, euen as an hot bath doth the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a poore Pilgrime tired with trauell: oh incredible clemency! how comes it to passe O Lord that thou art so ready to forgiue? I ranne on to offend thee, and thou came'st flying to giue me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I haue employed all the dayes of my life to seeeke both

So as now I triumphe ouer my sinne, which followes the tropheis of my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, the which hath found fauour in thy fight. And in this manner my hope (which mine offences had almost smothered) is reuiued more then before, &amp; doth promise me not onely the Empires of the world, which houer where the Lord encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them, but openeth the highest heauens vnto me, and assureth mee after an happie

They shall blush for shame, and shall by greatly troubled in their mindes: they shall retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues all confounded and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonished: For he whome they thought to destroy, is raised higher then euer he was. Alas they mocked mine ashes, they iested at my fasts, they flouted my teares, and whilest by absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence I tamed my flesh, the true enemy to my soule, they did swimme in worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: but loe, the arme of God was ready to thunder on their insolency. ô my God,

For, alas! what can become of him whom thou causest to endure the iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for his sinnes? an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of miseries enuirons him, pouerty assailes him, sicknesse afflicts him, famine oppresseth him, and death it selfe, which he thinketh to bee the hauen of this tempestuous nauigation, is the bottomlesse pit to draw him into eternall torments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thrice and foure times happy then are they of whom God demandeth none account of their actions, but is satisfied so that they humble themselues before him, acknowledging their infirmity, and opening
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20975:12"/>
vnto him the depths of their hearts: For his mercy is to bee called vpon by true confession, and sincerity of conscience: hee that will be heard, must humble himselfe before him. As hee which goeth to a fountaine, puts downe the mouth of his vessell before hee can fill it with liqour, in like manner it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth him to cast himselfe down before his creator, which will draw and taste of the water of this sacred fountaine, from whence distilleth the humour, which alone can cleanse and purge our consciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I did thinke sometimes, oh my God, to hide my faults from thee, &amp; haue said vnto my selfe; How can hee tell, or not, what I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20975:12"/>
haue done? In this manner my sinne waxed old in my bones, and like the sores of a sick man, who is ashamed and dares not shew his disease to the surgeon; they doe increase and waxe worse, till the whole body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: in like manner the sinnes which I haue hidden from thee, haue wholy infected me.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But at the last thou hast in such sort, day and night, layde thy heauy hand vppon mee, and hast caused mee to taste so many kindes of misfortunes, betwixt which my soule liueth without rest, quelled with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual pricking in my conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which pierceth the very bottom of my heart, as I haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged my falt, the which I now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20975:13"/>
carry in my hand. Take notice of it ô my GOD, but not in thine anger: for the streaming teares which haue quenched with weeping the light of mine eyes, ought likwise also to haue extinguished the heate of thy iust indignation. And then, am I not the worke of thine hands, and that which is more, the liuely image of thy diuinity? who is hee so transported with choller, which will breake in peeces the workmanship which hee hath so much delighted to polish and bring to perfection, because it is a little foule and slubberd? This image is loden with filthinesse I confesse, but is it not much better to clense &amp; burnish it then to destroy it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20975:13"/>
and tread it vnder foote?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Teach me then my God, what satisfaction I am to make, for I haue now discouered vnto thee all those faults which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did conceale. The feare which possessed me then, when I hid my selfe from thee, now when I lay my selfe open vnto thee, is turned into hope of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor and pardon. And now I cast my selfe into thine armes, as my surest refuge, with the selfe same countenance, as the poore patient, who shewing his wound to the Surgeon, lookes attentiuely vpon him, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endureth the search and lancing, for the desire and hope which hee hath to bee healed. But that which giueth me most
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20975:14"/>
hope of health, is, that those vices wherein I delighted heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, doe now make mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraide to behold them, as the meates where-with a man is stuffed in health doe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make him sicke at the heart. That which made mee fierce, doth now make mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed, when I consider the danger of death, wherevnto my pride had exposed my poore soule. I thanke that day which first gaue mee the light to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my fault. I did on that day, my GOD, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a singular testimony of thy goodnesse towards mee, let it please thee then, that the pleasure which I haue recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in displeasing my selfe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20975:14"/>
may continue with me as long as that which I tooke in my vices: For if I can take as great contentment in my peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, as I haue taken in my sinne, my happinesse shall bee equall to that of thine Angels, and by my humilation before thee, I shall see my selfe exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the highest toppe of thy fauour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Who doubteth ô Lord that thou wilt not receiue mee to mercy? thou whose meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and benignity, is not only vnspeakable but incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible? I did no sooner thinke of returning vnto thee, but thou diddest meete mee. I did no sooner say that I would confesse my misdeeds; but thou
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20975:15"/>
diddest grant mee pardon. I did no sooner know what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment belonged to my sinne, but thou forgauest it. I tooke the roddes in hand to chastice my flesh, and thou tookest them from mee. To bee short, I thought that thou wouldest haue proclaimed war against mee, and thou offeredst mee a charitable reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Oh how much more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ô Lord doost thou pardon then punish? Can a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more louingly receiue his Childe which beggeth his pardon, then thou hast recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mee, when I did cast my selfe at thy feete? Mine heart also leapeth for ioy, and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with an holy heat to praise
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20975:15"/>
thy name; it reioyceth in the fauor which thou hast shewed it, accusing none but it selfe for what is past, and cryeth out, it is I which willed it, it is I which haue done it, it is I which tooke pleasure therein: but my God was mercifull vnto mee,</p>
               <p n="7">7. How could he haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me his mercy, seeing Christ Iesus is my Aduocate, and thy Saints, whose prayer is so deere vnto him, haue prayed, doe pray, and will continually pray vnto him for mee? They are those who make intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for mee; who procure his fauour for mee; who implore his goodnesse, for in those prayers which they powre out for thy vniuersall Church
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20975:16"/>
I hope to haue my part? They haue need alas to intercede for mee, seeing that the impiety of my heart hath in such sort blinded mine vnderstanding by her euill thoughts, as my soule could not looke vp towards heauen, to lift vp her hand to him, who onely can and will saue it: what remained for mee more, but that those whom thou drawest neere to thy selfe, and whom thou hast receiued into the sacred consistory of thine eternity, should beseech thee to haue pitty vppon mee? Vpon me, who (a cheife enemy to my selfe) haue neuer, could, nor would haue prayed vnto thee for mine offence. I doe now then comfort my selfe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20975:16"/>
for that thou hast opened mine eyes to see the lothsomnesse of my conscience, for that thou hast mollified my heart to make true contrition to lodge therin. If it hath not beene so soone as it shold, it hath not at the least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise beene so late, but thou hast vouchsafed to receiue mee as thou art wont to doe those who let slippe no time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For those which make haste to sinne, and do willingly neglect repentance, when they perceiue their faults, and haue meanes to doe it, deferring till their liues end, to craue thy mercy &amp; louing kindnesse, and to make a deluge of their eyes, they are in great danger
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20975:17"/>
of deceiuing themselues, and true repentance cannot after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enter into their hardned hearts; their sorrow will be like that of desperate people, and thy mercy prooue deafe to their too late repentance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But I runne in time to thee as vnto the refuge and end of my hopes, to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in tribulation which hath enuironed mee in the same manner as the feare of death sezeth vpon him that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to some shamefull punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Cause mee then now to taste the pleasure which that man feeleth in his heart who is freed from Irons, deliuered out of prison, and defended from the punishment, wherein his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20975:17"/>
enemy hath a long time held him captiue. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, let the enemy of my soule blush for shame when hee shall perceiue mee so deuoutly to craue the assistance of my God, who with the onely twinckling of his eye, can deliuer me from the voluntary bondage which I vowed to damnable voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, at such time as I drank the sweet honney of delicious pleasures which it presented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee with a deceitfull hand in the loathsome cuppe of this world.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Alas! when I call to minde the time that thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thus returne vnto mee, and when with that eye of mercy thou madest a signe vnto me of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20975:18"/>
pardon mercy, and saluation, it seemeth vnto mee that I doe verily behold a cleere sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine to arise amiddest the stormes and tempests of the sea, who by little and little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the clowdes bringeth back a cleere and calme season, and vniteth the raging waues of the water. Euery houre I seeme to vnderstand that sweet and gracious word, when thou diddest say; Feare no more, for behold my spirit shall direct thy pathes, and shall not lose the sight of thee, thou shalt walke now vnder his conduct, who bringeth in pure &amp; cleane soules into my glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So soone as I heard this word, I fixed mine eyes on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20975:18"/>
my guide, like the attentiue Pilot on the shining starre that directeth the course of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation. O God! how sweet shall that rest bee which I shall enioy, after that I haue walked in those wayes which thou hast taught mee; I which went astray out of the path which leadeth to thy holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle? I was already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the thick forrest of this world, where such doe easily loose them selues, who to enioy tho pleasure and sweetnesse of the shades, doe flye from tho light of the day, which should direct them in their iourney: for soone dooth the fearfull face of night afright them, and deliuers them for a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20975:19"/>
prey vnto wilde beasts that cruelly teare &amp; deuoure them. I did already wander in this Labyrinth, and I was hopelesse to get forth of it, but that thou diddest put the thred into my hand, which brought mee out of this dangerous prison.</p>
               <p>Be hold I am now at liberty, to doe homage and seruice vnto that GOD which did deliuer mee, to present vnto him his image pure and vndefiled, and to acknowledge all those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors, which it hath pleased him to bestow on mee, to proceed from his onely goodnesse. Hee hath not onely heard mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his other creatures, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mee the vse of diuine reason, but hee hath likewise
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20975:19"/>
among men lifted mee vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a throne of honor and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, so that there was nothing left to perfect my happinesse, but onely to bee able to know it: and after that I had forgotten my selfe he did enlighten me by his holy light, and gaue mee time and will to bewaile my life past, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend in time to come.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Doe then like mee that are my friends, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in time to his mercy, for he himselfe calleth you into the way of saluation: and bee not like to the stubborne Mule which kicketh against the spur, hee wanteth reason, knowledge and iudgement.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For a bit is put into his

mouth, and he doth continually feele the spurre in his side. In like manner, if at the first war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which the Lord giues you, to returne into his wayes, you doe not obey his will, hee will raine vppon you showers of calamities, which will make you more miserable then mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. You see the starres which twinckle in the firmament, the sand which lyeth on the Sea shoare, but neither hath the sea so much sand, nor the heauens so many starres, as there are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments prepared for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate. Their miserie hangs ouer their head, misfortunes follow them at euery steppe, vntill they haue throwne them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20975:20"/>
head-long into that gulph, the onely thought whereof is fearefull to all those which do remember it, whose easiest places of retreate are full of cryes, groanings, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: Where paine is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, griese without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, repentance without mercy, where death is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, the body liuing but to dye, and the soule to suffer; where the soule feeles nothing but her sinne, and the body but his punishment. On the contrary, those which couer themselues with the Lords fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, which make his mercy their buckler, who haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope but in his goodnesse, who follow his comandements

and are iealous of his will and pleasure, what felicitie is there but they may attaine to? what precious thing is there in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but shall bee opened vnto them? They shall sitte side by side with their God, and beeing enuironed with glory, so much happinesse shall be heaped vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as the soule of man is not able to conceiue the least part thereof, much lesse can my barren tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I will then reioyce ô my God in the hope of such and so many benefits as thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruest in heauen to crowne the iust withall. Vnto this ioy I inuite you all which trust to the wordes of our Sauiour,

which loue iustice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, there doth the reward of your labours attend you, there you shall be placed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory, there shall you exchange the sharpe thornes of this world, for flourishing Lillies of all eternity; Oh then shall the sweate of your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons finde most sweete rest.

glory. What day can now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please mee in this world? who shall hinder and stay me from entring into the howse of the Lord, for to liue in his seruice? vpon what day of my life shall I ceasse from bewailing those sinnes which kept me forth of his fauor? vnite then in me, ô my God these two contrary passions, ioy and repentance, to the end that like as the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, who hath lost his way in a desert, reioyceth when hee beholds the dawning of the day, and yet for all that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget the obscure darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse out of the which hee is yet scarce come, nor lay aside his feare of so troublesome a night: euen so haue I alwayes

abhorred my sinnes past, and haue neuerthelesse a certaine and liuely hope to enioy that eternall happinesse which thou hast purchased for vs by the price of the bloud of thy deere Sonne Iesus Christ. Alas! how great is this loue, when the Maister spareth not the life of his childe to redeeme his seruant?

they being secured against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, doe wallow in their filthy pleasures and rase out, as much as in them is, the marke of diuinity which thou hast imprinted in their soules, and shut their eyes at the hope of saluation, which shineth on them out of thy word.</p>

It is true that I met with thine angrie countenance in the day of thy wrath: thou hast laide on mee the arme of thy vengeance, it hath crusht mee to peeces: I was glorious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and behold I am now cast downe to the ground.

Euen as wee see the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a body to decrease by little and little, when as the sunne stands right ouer it, and at last becometh a small point; in like manner, so soone as thy wrath did ascend ouer mee ô Lord, my life, my wealth, and my greatnesse did consume away by little and little: in such sort as I seeme like to the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red haye, without sap and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is gathered for the fodder of cattell, and so many faire, sweet, and odoriferous flowers

But shall I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire? not so, my God, for thy power is infinite, and lasteth for euer, thy mercy is immense, which spreds it selfe ouer all those which trust in thee.

               <p n="18">18. But what is the cause ô Lord that thou hast so highly exalted the throne of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?

Alas! not so my God: Thou hast lifted vp thy selfe in an eminent place, to the end that all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth may see and acknowledge thee; to haue recourse to thy grace &amp; mercy,

for thou wilt be alwayes ready to come at the humble sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of thy seruants, and thou wilt neuer scorne their pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full requests. Behold they are all set in order like poore gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley slaues condemned to the chaine, which waite for the arriuall of some King to set them at liberty on the day of his coronation.

If thou estrange thy selfe from mee neuer so little, my soule will vanish away, in the same maner as would my body, by the losse of my soule: For
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20975:77"/>
thou ô Lord art more the soule of my soule, then my soule is the life of my body. I do very well know, that in mee thou shalt finde a dwelling place, in no sort worthy thy diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, yet for all that, disdaine not to enter into mee; where thou commest, all magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence abounds, and where thou art, there is alwaies honor enough: Thou doest not ô Lord honor thy selfe by visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, but thou thereby doest honor vnto mee thy poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, wherefore shouldest thou leaue the brightnesse of the heauens, and the glistering of the starres, to come downe here on earth to so dishonorable a subiect? But as I thinke thou
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20975:78"/>
dooest it to giue warning to thine Angels not to growe proud in their magnificence, in regarde they are thy creatures, and that thou art able to make the basest dweller vpon earth as glorious as they. That is the reason why thou descendest from heauen, to shew mercy vpon vs, and bearing a part in our misery, thou commest to re-establish vs in our ancient perfection. And because we, as much as in vs was, haue defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the image of the diuinity, which thou hadst imprinted in vs, thou of thine especiall grace commest to renew those beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and sparkes of our first nature. It is thou then which art not onely content to bee
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20975:78"/>
our Creator, but our redeemer likewise, and as thou art our father, in like manner it pleaseth thee to bee our protector and defender. When all the world forsooke vs, thou stretchedst out thine armes vnto vs, and diddest receiue vs vnder the wings of thy clemencie.</p>
               <p n="16">16. I stood in great neede thereof, for I knew no more whether to goe. My father and mother had forsaken mee, that father I say, who had tenderly fed and brought mee vp did abhorre mee, when hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that I delighted wholy in thee, and that I had left the vanities of this world. They beheld mee with sorrow, and accounted mee for a lost child.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20975:79"/>
The kinde embraces of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren were conuerted into disdaine, the sweet friendship of my sisters changed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and the louing wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of my friends turned into derision. Whether now should I make retreate? If my deerest friends vse mee in this manner, what will mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe, whose mouth is all bitternesse and tongue poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whose actions and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exercises, are wrongs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches? But when I am most of all forsaken, then art thou neerest vnto mee, then doest thou most fauourably embrace mee, and most liberally pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vpon mine head the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of thy mercy.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:20975:79"/>
17. Now seeing it pleaseth thee in this aboundant manner to bestow thy grace vpon mee, to the end I may be able to keep it, teach mee how I ought to serue thee. Learne mee thy law, and how to direct my paths, to walke alwayes aright in this narrow thornie way, which should conduct mee to the hauen of health. For ô Lord, I haue left long since that easie beaten way strewed with earthly pleasures, and which leadeth those that follow it to destruction and damnation. Shew mee then my God, thy way, for vnder such a guide I shall neuer goe astray, shew it I say, vnto me ô Lord, for if I stray neuer so little, I am vndone,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20975:80"/>
mine enemies watch to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise mee, and to finde matter to dishonor mee, and thy selfe likewise, because they know I serue thee truely and faithfully.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Giue mee not ouer then into their hands, to do with me after their hearts desire, for they would soone depriue mee both of life and honour. They haue already laide their plotte, inuented a thousand accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, practised a world of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, but their lyes returne vppon themselues, and beare witnesse against them. False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood cannot bee hidden, shee lyeth open, and truth pierceth it thorow on all sides. It is compounded of peeces ill ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20975:80"/>
together, which fall a sunder at the first blowe they receiue, and beeing opposed against innocencie, it melts away like Snowe before the sunne.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But if as they desir, they should heape slanders vpon me, and smother me vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of their wrongs, I would not for all that be discouraged. I haue not put my trust ó Lord in the richesse and honours of this world, they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the portion of the wicked, they are for the most part the rewardes of their perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious wickednesse and deceits: this marchandize is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought with none other money. All my trust and hope
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20975:81"/>
ô Lord is in thee, the world is not able to containe it, the fruit of my labours dooth not grow in the land of the dead, it is in the land of the liuing that I waite to gather them, there doe I hope to see my wealth, nay rather thine, ó my GOD. Other men looke for the fruite after the blossome, but I expect it after the fall of the leafe. After that the leafe of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shall bee fallen, I hope that my soule shall flourish with new fruite, and shall bee cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the eternall verdure of immortallity.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Bee patient then my soule, and beare thy selfe vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, redouble thy courage, and waite till my GOD come

towards thee. Bee not asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht at the prosperitie of the wicked, feare thou not though they doe oppresse good men: And because thou seest ó Lord, that I am not strong enough of my selfe, assist and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proppe mee, least that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the wicked cause mee to remooue foorth of the place where thou diddest set mee; second my feruent zeale, to the end that hauing fought valiantly in the assault which the wicked make vppon mee, I may stand ready when thou shalt open the gate, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred in triumph with thee, I may sitte at thy feete at such time, when thou shalt iudge the quick and the dead.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20975:82"/>
Then wee shall see the great difference betwixt their liues and ours, and what reward at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them: they haue had their wealth in this world, it shall bee said vnto them, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence, for you stand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted in a great summe, thinke vppon yeelding an account of the goods which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your keeping, and pay the arrerage for the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending of them.

All things haue their appointed houre, and all the actions of men are disposed by times and seasons, change serueth for rest, and rest refresheth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary labour of liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: nothing can continue at one staye without relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet for all that, heerein this rule faileth, for I ô my God, doe and will continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blesse thy name: the sunne rising shall finde mee praysing

thy name; the sunne setting shall leaue mee praysing thy name, I will thereby beginne the moneths and the yeares, and thereby I will finish them: ô eternitie, I haue no feeling of thee in this world, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this will of mine, which is euer ready perpetually to praise and glorifie thy name ô my God. My body consumeth with age, and my strength fades away, but my soule, obstinate against eorruptible humanity, dooth not onely last, but encreaseth dayly in this holy affection. If I thinke to take my rest, my heart giueth spurres to my thoughts. If I thinke to bee silent, my soule breakes forth betwixt my lips,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20975:84"/>
and by maine force formeth a voyce which prononnceth the glory of my LORD. What makes thee ô my soule so feruent in the praises of my God? I see wel that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, that thou hast drawne thine essence from him, and waitest by him to be glorified, what vsury doest thou offer him? Thou presentest him with a parcell of his praises, and thou in the meane time expectest to be made partaker of the rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his glory. For from him only thou art to hope for al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The heauens shall passe away, &amp; shall weare like an old garment, &amp; it shall be changed, but God shal remain to triumph
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20975:84"/>
ouer the ruines of the world. Peaceable and meeke people shal be on euery side about him; they shall heare the triumphant hymnes which shall be sung to his victory, and filled with ioy, they shal accord their voices to the trumpets of the Angells.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let vs beginne then betimes to learne the songes of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let vs magnifie him and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his name as high as our voyces will stretch, let vs re-enforce our cries, to the end they may ascend as high at the least as we can discerne them, that the ayre filled with our songes, may carry them on the winges of the winde to the very farther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most partes of the earth

to the end that all people may be wakened with the sound of our tunes, and reioyce when they shall in this manner heare the name of the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth to be exalted, the lord, who is the trusty &amp; assured refuge of all those which call vpon him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I sought him and he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with heard me. I no more knew whether to goe, and after that I had cast mine eyes on euery fide, finding nothing able to succor me, the whole world forsaking me, I returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my selfe, and bewayling my calmity beheld my selfe: And on a sodaine he at once filled me with strength and courage, and causing my soule
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20975:85"/>
to rebound out of the gulfe of sorrow and tribulation which had swallowed me vp, he said vnto me, trust in me for I am here, then I cryed out ô Lord where art thou? make hast and quickly help me, and forthwith his spirit came downe vpon me and as a strong wind driueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cloudes, euen so did it driue from me all manner of griefe and aflictions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Come then and runne vnto him, come, the way is easie, it is open on ouery side, he shewes himselfe euery where, in what place so euer we be he calls vs vnto him. He is so much affraid least we should goe astray, as he comes downe from heauen to carry the torch before vs to

giue light vnto our feet. For hee is the Father of light, and giues a purer light to our soules then to our bodies, it dissipates and scatters of it selfe, all that which may hurt and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs. Come then and draw neere vnto it, for so long as it shall shine vppon you, you shall walke with an erected browe, and nothing shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to offend you, your strength shall be renued within you, and nothing shall bee able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found you: if your sinne offers to shew it selfe, it will driue it away: if your enemies come towards you it will ouer-throw them.</p>

and singular mercy. Looke vppon this poore miserable wretch, who was accounted the maister-peece of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who was supposed to haue lost al that he had, yea, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hope it selfe, the onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the miserable, yet he no sooner cryed vnto God, but he foorthwith heard him and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him from the misery wherein hee was, hee hath brought him to the hauen and set him in a place of safety.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He sends his Angels to the ayde of his seruants, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe them about like a strong guard, and stir not from them till they haue deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of al danger. For as he is great, so are his ministers mighty:
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20975:87"/>
and albeit of himselfe he is able to doe all thinges yet in regard of his greatnesse, he executeth his wil &amp; pleasure, by the means of his creatures gouerning the small ones by the meane, the meane ones by the highest, and the highest by himselfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Taste then a little how sweet his mercy and goodnesse is, how happy is he which putteth his trust in him. The swallow is very carefull of her young ones &amp; yet she often lets the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cry out for hunger, mixing their sweet with bitternesse: but our God comes at the first cry, at the first signe, at our first wish, and so soone as he perceaues that we thirst after his succour, he puts into our mouthes the fertill
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20975:87"/>
dugges of his goodnes, and sheds betwixt our lippes the sweet milke of his grace, which quencheth the thirst of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and the heat which our sinne like a rotten vlcer hath in gendred in our consciences.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now seeing he is so good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, &amp; denies vs nothing that wee aske him, take heed I pray yee vnto your selues, I speake vnto you on whom hee hath bestowed so many benefites, whom he hath sanctified with his holy blessings, whom he hath set apart to be his chosen, and to be partakers of his loue. Take heed least yee offend him by your vnthankfullnes, and make your selues vnworthy of his benefits by a distrust and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20975:88"/>
vnbeliefe of his goodnes. For those which feare him neuer want any thing, in fearing him they hope in him, also they feare him with a louing feare, with a feare, not that hee will hurt them, but with a feare to offend him, or rather with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly reuerence, which makes him by so much the more the ready to doe vs good, as wee are respectiue to demaund it. For hee of himselfe knowes what is necessary for vs, hee forthwith preuents our desires if they are not agreeable to his will, and makes vs rich in the middest of our pouerty, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant in the middest of our weaknesse.</p>
               <p n="9">9. On the contrary, hee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20975:88"/>
doth not so to the rich world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, whose wealth he hath not blessed, for those men are needy in their riches, starued in theyr aboundance, their wealth melts into pouerty, their magnificence vanisheth away into smoake, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like to a riuer whose spring-head is damn'd vp, his channell remaines drie, his bankes lose their greenesse, and the trees planted thereon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and fade. But those which haue recourse vnto God and do not forsake him, who referre all to his honor, shall neuer want any good thing, because the fountaine of all goodnesse, which is the loue of GOD, springeth in the middest

of their soules, and sheds it selfe abroad through all the parts of their body.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now in regard you see how much profit there is in fearing God, how his feare is that which reconciles vs vnto him, this reconciliation doth purchase vs his fauour, doth encrease our felicity, come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me and I wil teach you to feare him, who like a good and mercifull father, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deny his mercy vnto him which acknowledgeth his sin, and is willing to returne into the way of well doing.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Doe you desire to please him, by that meanes to liue in his fauour which is as much to say as to liue happily, and to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20975:89"/>
passe your dayes in tranquillity of spirit, and plenty of al things necessary for this mortall life, and moreouer to walke apace in the way of this immortall life, which tarrieth for vs after our departure hence: In a word do yee desire his blessing, which is as much to say as a firme and certaine prosperity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth in vs a spirituall ioy, which will keepe your heartes alwayes open to breath his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to vse, with conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the wealth which hee lends you in this world? In a few wordes I will shew yee the way. For I know wherein hee delighteth and which of our actions doe please him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The first thing that yee
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20975:90"/>
shall doe, bridle your tongue, that it vtter no wordes which may offend Gods honour, nor vse sharp and bitter speeches. Doe you see this little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how nice and tender it is? yet neuerthelesse it is the helme of our life, which steereth and turneth our minds on the same side as it selfe is turned. For so soone once as it is filled with naughty and vitious speeches, it carrieth the passions of our heart, where they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vnto the depth of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and doth water it in such sort, as it forthwith looseth the forme and figure of reason which God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired into it, doe you not see how a little sparke of fire burnes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20975:90"/>
downe a whole building? euen so the toung giues sin entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, brings him in deafely and spreading his fire abroad in our soule, consumes in vs all matter of goodnesse. Let vs then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our lippes to receiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the bare and simple truth, and let lies and deceipt befor euer banished from vs. For if we shut vp the euill cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which may arise in our hearts, not giuing them any vent, they will in the end smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themselues, like to a fire which hath no ayre.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Let vs first of all then put farre from vs all deceipt and lying, for the true praise which God expecteth from vs, is, that we imitate him
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20975:91"/>
as much as our nature will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte. Now hee is the God of truth and righteousnes, who can neither loue nor cherish vs, so long as lying, which is his contrary, shall dwell in vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly wee must fly from all sinne whatsoeuer; to avoyde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is the beginning of well doing, and if God find vs emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of euill meaning, hee will fill vs with good, and will teach vs what wee ought to wish and procure. Hee learneth vs that which wee ought chiefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. It is peace which hee will haue vs to wish for, with all our hearts. Peace first with him, which is the heape of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the which we cannot haue, vnles we yeeld him that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20975:91"/>
which we owe him. Peace afterward amongst our selues, without which we cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his. For hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our selues, but if we, insteed thereof, breath foorth nothing but blood and rapine, what peace can wee haue with him, whose lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements wee breake? For warre and discord are the roots of vnrighteousnes, and are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable before God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. His eye, which is this good and mercifull eye, doth not looke but vppon the iust: his light shines onely on them, his wonders are wrought in theyr behalfe; his eares are onely open to theyr pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20975:92"/>
and we may properly say, that his Iustice stands at his side which examineth the liues of such as present themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and doth recommend vnto him the prayers of those that are of an vpright heart.</p>
               <p n="15">15. As for those who take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in doing euill, he doth looke vpon them, but it is with an eye kindled with fury, whose beames are like arrowes of paine and misery, which he shooteth into their soules, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with feare and amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a thousand other mischeefs which he sends vnto them, as the earnest of eternall torment which attends them. He thinkes not on them but only how to root out their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20975:92"/>
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of the earth, and by his iustice to wash out the spots of their polution: for he hath a long time knowne their impenitent heart, which hath insolently neglected his holy mercy.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Iust haue not done so, for they returned vnto God in time, and crying after his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, they did at the last ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, they now inioy it as their portion, he hath drawne them foorth of all the troubles wherein they were plunged, &amp; hath couered them with his fauour as vnder a brazen wall, so as no violent euil whatsoeuer is able to pearce through it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Truly god is good &amp; fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable he is alwaies neere to the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20975:93"/>
afflicted which call vppon him, hee forsakes him not, neither day nor night, so soone as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hath humbled vs, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vs to know what neede wee haue of him, behold hee is at hand to saue vs.</p>
               <p n="18">18. The righteous indeede are afflicted with strange cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and wee may in a maner say, that they are the subiect of misery, so many euills doe at once seeme to ouer-whelme them. But it is onely to make the mercy of God the more il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious &amp; notable in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: For the greater that their tribulation is, the brighter doth Gods pitty and compassion shine in their conseruation.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Hee preserueth the least
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20975:93"/>
of their bones, yea, namely not an haire of their heads shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish or be pluckt off, but by his expresse will, and he neuer wils it, but for their good and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. More-ouer a! their wealth and store is vnder his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when hee pleaseth hee will multiply their riches, hee will make his blessings to florish in their houses, and hee will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their wealth and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aboue all enuy.</p>
               <p n="20">20. On the contrary the life of the wicked shalbe miserable.

               <p>IN regard that Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which gouerneth the world, oweth a recompence to euery man according as hee hath deserued; I am sometimes amazed to see how those whose onely study is to do euill, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue so many fauours in this life, and doe bath them-selues
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20975:95"/>
in so many kindes of pleasures. But as my heart begins to swell and to bee despited in it selfe, I feele (as it seemeth vnto me) the spirit of God which comes and toucheth me, and plucking me by the eare, it saith vnto me, soft and faire, soft and faire, thou poore wretch, thou losest thy selfe in this ouer-deepe and dangerous discourse: comfort thou thy selfe in mee, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie not the good of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, bee not iealous of those which worke iniquity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For that which thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to bee their felicity, is but a vaine shaddow, a false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull image, which will bee lost betwixt their hands, &amp; will flie away when they shall thinke
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20975:95"/>
to hold it fast. As the hay, which is mowen downe, fades &amp; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a moment, euen so in a moment shal the magnificence of the wicked lose his colour &amp; brightnesse. The herbes in a garden are not so soone withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as thou shalt perceiue the riches of the wicked to fal away and perish. Hast thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the flower <hi>Emerocall,</hi> true beauty of a day, which flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a crimson dye in the morning, keepeth his coulour all day long, and in the euening becomes so pale and withered, as though it had bin bitten with the frozen teeth of winter? The happinesse of the wicked, if a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull smile of an apparent felicity, may be termed a happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20975:96"/>
doth properly resemble that flower, for it is withered so sodainly, is changed in so short a time, and is transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in such diuerse manner, as it is a wonder to behold it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Put then thy trust in God, and beleeue it, the insolence of the wicked shall neuer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, so long as the diuine iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice shall beare rule, and bee lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise assured, that the iust man shall neuer bee forsaken, what affliction so euer he be in. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage not thy selfe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in wel doing, for he which perseuers vnto the end shall be saued. Dwell in the land which thy God hath giuen thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy selfe with the graces which he hath giuen thee, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20975:96"/>
enter not into iudgment with him; For thou shalt find in the end that the riches of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are but giuen them to keepe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Reioyce thou in the hope which thou hast in thy God, &amp; lay aside the melancholy which thou hatchest in thy soule, which like rust eats &amp; consumes thy heart. For when thy minde shall bee once purified, and thy thoughts lifted vp to thy Lord; he will accomplish all thy wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp; will cause thee to enioy all that which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art able to desire.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But do not present thy selfe before him with wauering, goe not vnto him with diffidence, do not hide thy thoughts, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very bottom of thy heart before him, &amp; discouer thy thoughts.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20975:97"/>
For it is impossible to deceiue him, and it is dangerous to goe about it. He seeth and noteth all things, chiefly a double and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing heart, the which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things else hee detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but hee receiueth and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the poore man that is humbled, hee harkeneth to his prayer, and giues him before hand that which he ment to ask.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nothing is wanting, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wealth, nor honour vnto him which hath his fauour: if thou please him once, hee will cause the glory of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to shine brighter then the day light, and the equity of thy iudgments to glister like the mid-daies sunne. For people on all sides shall be seene to come

from thee, blessing thy house for a temple of iustice, praysing thy word for an oracle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing thee as the cause of their rest and liberty. Euery one shall exalt thine integrity, as the protector of good men, and sure defence of the afflicted. But the more honour and glory that thou receiuest, humble thy selfe so much the more vnder the hand of thy GOD, and acknowledge this good to come from him, and yeeld him homage. The homage which hee demandes of thee besides thy heart, is but thy mouth and hands, thy mouth to set foorth his praise, thy hands to serue him according to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>

Loe, this is that which the spirit of God told mee, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to you my friends, and make yeepertakers of these holy aduertisements, to the end that if here-after you see any one to prosper in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and yet to blaspheme in his life, yee should not bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thereat, nor be angry in your selues, though hee which worketh iniquity, do abound in all manner of wealth.</p>

But he which possesseth his soule in patience, and constantly wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for Gods iudgement, God will praise and blesse his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and after that he hath pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the wicked for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, hee will confiscate their possessions, and make him mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and owner thereof.</p>

Peace, a rich and wealthy in heritance, which giueth tast to all other benefits, without which all the other is but torment and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.

so long as warr shall remaine in vs, and that sinne, which is the sinne of discord shall lodge with vs, wee cannot hope for peace and rest amongst our selues.

to bend their bowes and to take their ayme, to hit the innocent. They will band themselues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they will put their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in order, place their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush, giue the watch-word, and ioyfull in their hearts they will say: we hold him, he cannot es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape vs.</p>
               <p n="16">16. They will come to slay the poore, needy and innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and will make account to roote out all those whose harts and soules are vpright.

Thou hast rightly said ô Lord, that alwaies euill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles ouerthrow the authors thereof, thou hast foretold that the wicked are taken in their owne snares, and that at the last they shal suffer the punishment which they prepared for others.</p>
               <p n="18">18. It is not then ô Lord, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, greatnes, and worldly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20975:102"/>
which make men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, troopes and armies of men make them not safe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. For the small store which thou giuest vnto the iust man, who by his sincerity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to thy fauour, is of more worth, then all the plenty and a fluence of the wicked: the little which a iust man hath, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth like the leuen in the dough, his strength flourisheth like the branches of the Palme tree, for his vigour takes root in thee who art the depth of al strength and power.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But on the contrary the arme of the sinner, how strong soeuer it be, shal be, broken, and his strength shall be troden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote: for it is but a vaine

But the iust man is like to the diamond, the more it is hammered, the brighter it is: Affliction takes only from the innocent man his vppermost filth and excrement, and the nakeder he is, the fairer and purer he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
               <p n="20">20. In a word whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God sends, to good men, all is for theire good. Hee knoweth the life and dayes of all such people as are

pure and cleane, and giueth them that which is needfull for them. Their happinesse is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared from all eternity, and they shall eternally possesse it, not an earthly inheritance, but a heauenly, whose wealth is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and eternall, an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which deuided amongst his children, shall neuerthelesse remaine whole &amp; entier, whose parts shall be as great as the whole. For it is this inheritance of glory, which enritching so many people, doth fill them all with eternall blessednesse, and remaineth euer one, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies infinite.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Now albeit that the hope of Gods seruants is not fixed on earth, yet neuerthelesse so

long as they shall remaine in this world he will not suffer them to want that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the maintenance of this life. For when the euil time shall come, when as vengeance shal be poured vpon men, when the waters shall ouerflow their bankes, when tempests shall beare sway, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens raigne downe fire, the iust shall be then at rest in the midst of the tempests, stand dry-foot in the time of shipwrack, and shall be safe in the middest of the flames. And namely when a fearefull famine shall come to deuour nations, Manna shall fall from heauen to feed them. For the wrath of God is only vpon the wicked, his anger is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20975:104"/>
only kindled against them: As for the iust the neerer they seeme to danger, the neerer they are to safety.</p>
               <p n="22">22. They are not like to Gods enemies, who are highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and exalted, to make their dounfal the more greiuous and shamefull; for nothing hath a great fal but that which is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted. The ruines of tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers shiuer themselues in peices and fall to dust, the wicked doe worse, for when they once fetch their leape, they do not only fall away to dust but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish into smoake, and euapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to nothing. Behold the cloudes which comes foorth of the thundring throate of a great Cannon; what a thick

               <p>Such is the greatnes of the wicked, which hath no matter but their sinne, no motion but theire vanity; it increaseth in an instant, and in a moment per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth. And all the labour they bestow in preseruing it, serueth to no vse or purpose at all.</p>

nothing for other men to carry away, neuerthelesse all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffits them nothing, for as the aboundance of meat doth not fatten him that is in a consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because the radical humor of his life is spent, eauen so the blessing of God which is the roote of all prosperity, declines from the wicked. The iust man on the contrary who is full of mercy and compassion, giueth largely of his goods, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes his money, and like a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of springing water neuer waxeth drye.</p>

But those which blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his name, are disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his fauour, and like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull children, are depriued of their fathers inheritance, so, as bearing his curse they must of force perrish.</p>
               <p n="25">25. For there is none other saluation in the world but to trust in God, and to commit ones selfe to his keeping. He directeth the wayes of the iust man, and gouernes his actions, so as they need not to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He stirres vp his will to

godlines, and turnes a way his eies from the baits of sinne, he will bring him back from the lanes and bywayes of pleasure, into the road way of vertue, and cause him to walke in the paths of his commandements.</p>
               <p n="26">26. It is a faire plaine way where there are no stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks, all is smooth and euen.

the Pipe of a Pumpe, which draweth vp water in casting it forth: the full in him could not endure the empty. The iust man giueth, good doth forthwith fill him, his posterity is neuer the poorer for his bounty, for the blessing of God causeth riches to spring in him, as the sunne doth the fruites of the earth, &amp; multiplies them a hundred for one.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Seeing then that God is so good and bountifull, if yee loue his fauour, take care to please him, the way is, to turne away from euil, and to do good.

He began this worke when he made the world, and is neuer weary of it.

which we call nature, and wee must thinke, that when wee iudge other men, we administer his power, and that such iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as wee giue, the like will he giue vs, when hee shall sit in his throne to iudge the world: not that hee can iudge amisse like vs, but he will make vs feele by his indgement the smart which wee haue procured to other men by ours. For hee will neuer forsake his Saints, hee will at the last gather them together, and will shield them from the in-iustice of men; he will of purpose sitte downe in his seate to iudge those which do oppresse them.</p>

I can no otherwayes describe it, then that it is a very high hill, on the toppe whereof a maruailous goodly garden is to bee seene, set with all sortes of flowers, hedged in with an infinite number
