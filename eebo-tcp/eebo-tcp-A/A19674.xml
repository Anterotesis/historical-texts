            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

faire roomes and gardens belonging to it, after diner,
wee entered into <hi>Gelder-land,</hi> so through <hi>Wagening</hi> to
<hi>Arnheim</hi> to bed, passing that afternoone through
much danger, by reason of Out-lyers from the Army
at <hi>Schenckenschans,</hi> which was not farre off, the Prince
of <hi>Brandeburgh</hi> being heere in Towne, visited his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

visited him, who was shewed by him, the ashes of

following, and did see the smoake and fire out of
the great Peeces from the <hi>Sconee,</hi> as they were in
skirmish, thether his Excellency sent the Steward
and a Trumpeter to demand passage of the Spanyard
in the <hi>Schans,</hi> and <hi>Grave William</hi> for the Hollander,
but the Spaniard would not grant it, without order
from <hi>Brussels, Grave William</hi> hearing their answer, sent
his Excellency word, hee made no doubt, but to give
him free passage the next day, for he resolved to make
an assault that night upon the <hi>Sconce,</hi> upon the assault,
the Spaniards yeelded it up on conditions, and heere

his Excellency published certaine orders, to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

a Castle where the Hollanders take toll at, adjoyning
to the <hi>Rhine</hi> on the same side, then passing through all

his Excellency over the <hi>Rhine</hi> on a Bridge of flat bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
Boates, guarded with all his Troopes of Horse,
untill wee came at the Barke wherein his Excellency
lay that night, then returned and sent a Company of
English Souldiers to guard it, the next day earely wee
weighed Anchor and sailed up the <hi>Rhine,</hi> having a
Guard of Souldiers along the shore, by reason the
Enemy went out of the <hi>Schans</hi> that morning, so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

might enter in, for as his Excellency entered the gate,
one of the watch discharged his peece neere unto the
horses breast, the rest being instantly commanded to
the contrary, but the Gates were shut up, and wee
kept out, untill the Towne were satisfied, wee were
no Enemy, our carriage and Company being great,
frightened them at the first after diner we past through
a long Wood in much danger, and in the view of
Rogues, who did not set upon us because our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was great, yet we fearing the worst, had sent for
a Convoy of Musketiers to the next Towne before,
who met us not untill we were out of the Wood.</p>

thinking wee had beene some Enemy, but hearing it
was his Excellency was very joyfull, and sent Coaches
for him, to come and suppe with him, and to make his

after breake-fast, perceiving his Excellency would
goe away, had three Coaches waiting at the doore,

            <p>The next day earely weighed Anchor and went by

Towne, who were then skirmishing when wee came,

both sides, the Generall in the Towne making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to entertaine his Excellency, did but open the
Gate, thinking to cleare the passage for his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

wherefore they withdrew from shewing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
untill his Excellency came against the Gate,
and then came forth and intreated his Excellency to
dine with him, but hee staid not having a long way to
goe that night; they in the Castle are besieged on

every side, before them are Cannons placed just by

likewise in Islands in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> all watching that they
cannot be relieved, they in the Towne, if they doe but

presented at their heads, yet the Towne is somewhat
the stronger for a River called the <hi>Mosell,</hi> which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

it now be beaten downe, that there is no passage over,

on Boates, to relieve the Towne, under the Castle
there is a very beautifull house, which the <hi>Emperour</hi>
gave to the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Tryer,</hi> and hee resigned it to the
<hi>French,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Spaniard</hi> besieged him, when

and tooke him prisoner, and is prisoner now: as wee
were departing from hence, the <hi>French</hi> gave us a brave

            <p>The first of May being Sunday, and their Whit-sunday,
we departed, passing by Villages shot downe,
and by many pictures of our Saviour and the <hi>Virgin

by <hi>Rhinefilds</hi> Castle both on the right side, to <hi>Catze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelbogon</hi>
Castle on the other side, then by <hi>Oberwesell</hi>
on the right side; then begins the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi>
so by <hi>Caub</hi> on the left side, which is the first Towne
in the <hi>Pfaltz,</hi> and so to <hi>Pfaltz</hi> Castle, seated in a little
Iland in the River,<note place="margin">Bacharach.</note> from hence to <hi>Bacharach,</hi> a Towne
where we landed, it is seated on the right side of the

heere the poore people are found dead with grasse in

            <p>The next morning departed hence, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<hi>Momtzistzland,</hi> so by a little Tower in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

to be secure, but even thither they pursued him also,

to <hi>Rudeshein,</hi> a Towne on the left side of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which I entered, and did see poore people praying
where dead bones were in a little old house, and
here his Excellencie gave some reliefe to the poore
which were almost starved as it appeared by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
they used to get it from one another: from
hence by <hi>Geisenhem, Elfeld,</hi> and <hi>Wallaff,</hi> three Townes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9614:7"/>
on the left side of the River, and then we crossed over
the <hi>Rhine,</hi> unto the other side.</p>
            <p>Then to <hi>Mentz</hi> a great City seated close by the
<hi>Rhine</hi> on the right side against which wee cast Anchor
and lay on ship-board,<note place="margin">Mentz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for there was nothing in the
Towne to relieve us, since it was taken by the <hi>King of

dyed, in a faire corner house towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
side, heere likewise the poore people were almost
starved, and those that could relieve others before,
now humbly begged to bee relieved, and after supper
all had reliefe, sent from the Ship ashore, at the sight
of which they strove so violently, that some of them
fell into the <hi>Rhine</hi> and were like to have bin drowned.</p>
            <p>The next day being the third of <hi>May,</hi> from hence
wee departed, leaving the <hi>Rhine</hi> halfe a league above
the City on our right hand, and entered into a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
River called the <hi>Maine,</hi> passing by a place which
the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was building for a Fort, but could
not finish it, then by <hi>Cassell,</hi> on the left side, thence by

               <note place="margin">Francfurt.</note> and then to the stately City of <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt,</hi>
adjacent to the <hi>Maine</hi> on the left side, where we
landed and lay: from <hi>Collein</hi> hither, all the Townes,
Villages, and Castles bee battered, pillaged or burnt,
and every place wee lay at on the <hi>Rhine</hi> on ship-board,
we watched, taking every man his turne; heere wee
staid foure daies, untill our carriages were made ready:
where we saw the place wherein they keepe the <hi>Dyet,</hi>
afterward entered into the Church called Saint <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmews,</hi>
where the <hi>Emperours</hi> use to bee crowned and
take their oath; the City is inhabited with <hi>Lutherans</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:9614:8"/>
and <hi>Iewes,</hi> for in the <hi>Iewes Synagogue,</hi> I entered in to see
the manner of their service, which is an undecent way,
making a hideous noise, having on their heads and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their neckes things called <hi>Capouchins,</hi> the women
are not admitted into their <hi>Synagogue,</hi> but in places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
And on Sunday the seventh of <hi>May,</hi> by waggons
through the City over two Bridges which are alwaies
guarded with Souldiers, leaving the <hi>Maine</hi> on our left
hand, from hence we tooke a Convoy of Musketiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
being wee went through much danger, by <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach,
Selgenstat,</hi> seated betweene us and the <hi>Maine,</hi>
passing thus along through a great Forest in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
hearing the great Peeces so swiftly discharge off
at <hi>Hannaw,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> subdu'd, and now besieged
by the Emperors Forces, being not above three Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
miles off, then by a very great Mountaine two Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
miles long, all beset with Vines, untill we came at
a poore little Village where wee staid and dined with
provision of our owne, and after dinner departed, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through Plaines untill wee came at the <hi>Maine,</hi> and
there ferried over into a towne called <hi>Klingenberg,</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through this, we came to a very high hill the way
up being all stone &amp; 2. English miles up to the top, and
then through a Wood, after we were past this, we came
to a poore little Village called <hi>Neunkirchen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neunkirchen.</note> where we
found one house a burning when we came and not any
body in the Village, heere we were constrained to tarry
all night, for it grew very late, and no Towne neere
by 4. English miles, spending the night in walking up
and downe in feare, with Carrabines in our hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we heard Peeces discharg'd off in Woods about
us, and with part of the coles of the consumed house
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9614:8"/>
his Excellency had his meat rosted for supper, the next
morning earely, his Excellency went to view the
Church, which we found rifled with the pictures and
Altars abused, in the Church-yard, we saw a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
scraped out of the grave, in another place out of the
Church-yard, there lay another dead body, into many
of the houses wee entered, and found them all empty.
From this miserable place we departed, and heard after,
that they in the Village fled by reason of the sicknesse,
and set that house on fire at their departure, that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
might not be infected.</p>
            <p>Then came we into <hi>Wijrtzburg-land,</hi> and descended
downe another steep hill and there crossed over a little
River call'd <hi>Tauber,</hi> and through <hi>Keichelsheim,</hi> to <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruim</hi>
a poore Village where wee dined, after dinner
passing by the side of the <hi>Maine,</hi> and through Woods
and Plaines,<note place="margin">Wurtzburg</note> untill we came to <hi>Wijrtzburg,</hi> a faire City
passing over a bridge first, standing over the <hi>Maine</hi> into
the Towne, seated on the left side of the River, and a
faire Castle opposite to the Towne on the other side,
in which the Towne put all their riches when they
heard the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> was comming, thinking there
it would not be gain'd, but they hearing of it, surprised
and pillaged it in 3. daies, and it was 3. or 4. moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Emperors</hi> forces could regaine it, the next day
earely departed, being the 10. of <hi>May,</hi> and entered
<hi>Marggrafen-land,</hi> and to <hi>Kiteingen</hi> to diner, after diner,
thence through <hi>Ipza</hi> a City,<note place="margin">Marckbibrach</note> and so to <hi>Marckbibrach,</hi>
where we lay all night on the plancher, for the Village
was pillaged but the day before, earely the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wee went away and passed through <hi>Neustadt,</hi>
which hath beene a faire City, though now pillaged
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9614:9"/>
and burnt miserably, heere we saw poore children sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at their doores almost strav'd to death, to whom
his Excellency gave order for to relieve them with
meat and money to their Parents, from hence we went
to Eilfkirchen a poore Village where wee dined, with
some reserv'd meat of our owne, for there was not any
thing to be found, after diner, thence we passed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Villages pillag'd and burnt down, and so into <hi>Nurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berger-land,</hi>
passing through the place where the King
of <hi>Swedens</hi> Leaguer lay, when the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was
with him and my Lord <hi>Craven,</hi> and in sight of the place
the <hi>Emperors</hi> Army had intrenched themselves by the
side of a great wood, here the <hi>King of Sweden</hi> set upon
poles alive three of his souldiers, for killing 2. of their
Commanders, and flying presently to his Enemy, and
at the end of a Battaile that was then fought, he tooke
them prisoners, and so executed them, then drawing
neere <hi>Nurnburg</hi> a great City seated in a Plaine,<note place="margin">Noremberg.</note> which
the <hi>King of Sweden</hi> relieved at that time against the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi>
being not above two English miles off, heere we
passed by some of their workes before the Towne, and
then entered the Gate into the City being very stately
built, and one of the strongest in <hi>Germany,</hi> and so to his
Excellencies lodging, the next day the Lords of the
City came and visited his Excellency; here we staid II
daies untill his Excellency had word for certain where
the Emperor was, the most part of our time was spent
in seeing of the rare things in the Towne, as a very
brave <hi>Magazine</hi> wherein all their munition lieth, which
the Governours of the towne shewed his Excellency,
at our first entrance wee passed through a large Court
where there lay on our left hand 4. great Cannons by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9614:9"/>
the walles side, which were 6. paces long, and 2. foote
broad, and worke-houses there likewise, then entered
we into a long roome where there hung on both sides
armour for foot and horse, and then into the place it selfe,
where there were 6. partitions each 28. paces long and
6. broad, all full of brasse Peeces and other small ones
of severall rare inventions, from hence we went to see
a very rare water-worke which supplieth all the City,
adjoyning close to the wall of the Towne, returning
homewards, we entered into their great Church call'd
the <hi>Dome,</hi> there his Excellency was shewed a very state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
picture of the <hi>Annunciation of the Virgin Mary,</hi> which
hung in the middle of the Quire, drawne up, which had
not bin shewed to any in 18. yeeres before, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
home, and the Lords with him, who supped with
his Excellency, the next day they dined with him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and after diner desired his Excellency to goe and
take the aire in some of their Gardens without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which he did: the City is very strong being encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
without the wals with bulwarkes and a mighty
deepe and wide ditch, and within are many curiosities
and stately buildings: the ancient men (called <hi>Lords</hi>)
governe by turnes, not acknowledging any particular
Prince their Soveraigne, but hold correspondency with
all, for in the time of those great wars between the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>

bulwarkes and pallizadoes, having spacious roomes and
a faire Armory: early the next morning, from hence, by
Churches demolished to the ground, and through
Woods in danger, understanding that Crabbats were
lying heere about, untill we came at a poore little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
called <hi>Hemmaw</hi> where we staied and dined, which
hath beene pillaged eight and twenty times in two
yeeres, and twice in one day, and they have there no

dinner, to <hi>Ettershansen</hi> a poore Village where we cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over a little River in Boates, the Bridge being

it through a Tower in the middle standing over
the <hi>Danuby,</hi> which runneth with as swift a current as at
<hi>London</hi> Bridge, dividing it selfe into severall Ilands

            <p>The 25. day his Excellency went to take the ayre on

went to view a <hi>Capuchine</hi> Monastery, seated
very pleasantly on a high hill, neere unto the Towne,
first we passed over a bridge made of little rafts which
standeth over the river <hi>Inn,</hi> and so through <hi>Instadt,</hi> and
then ascended up the hill upon which the Monastery
stands, and then entered into the Chappell called our
<hi>Ladies Chappell,</hi> being built in the yeere 1636. where
we saw a neat Altar, and a picture of the <hi>Virgin Maries</hi>
set up in the Altar, and many fine reliques, left there
of those that are said to have been healed of severall
diseases, comming but thither to doe their Devotion,
and returned thence sound, from hence we descended
to another Chappell at the bottome of the hill, passing
downe 274. steps, being set in order, 10. and 11. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

and as much plaine ground as containeth the steps

passing thus thorow roomes, untill wee came at the
doore of the chamber in which the Emperour was,
and when his Excellence came at the doore, out came
the little Count of <hi>Kezell,</hi> high Chamberlaine to his
Majestie, and brought in his Excellence, and then
withdrew and shut the doore after him, that none
might enter in: after his Excellence had beene within
a while, we were all admitted, and kissed his Majesties
hand, and then withdrew, and passed thorow other
roomes and a gallerie, where the Guard stood in like
manner, to the Empresses chamber, where none
might enter neither, stealing a sight of her as wee
stood, and then returned.</p>
            <p>The eighth day his Excellence had his second au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the Emperour, as private as the first: and
the tenth day audience againe of the Empresse, and
then wee were admitted to kisse her hand: the same
day there were seven men beheaded which were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
for rising up in armes with foure hundred other
Boores against the Emperour: the first that was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
was said to be one that had inchanted himselfe,
that no bullet could hurt him, and the onely seducer
of the others: after he was upon the scaffold and his
face covered, two men held him fast to the blocke,
then came the Executioner with a red hot paire of
pincers, and violently clapt hold of both his brests,
that done, nailed his right hand fast to the blocke, and
chopt it off, then presently whipt out his sword from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9614:12"/>
his side, and cut off his head, one of the hangmen
presently tooke it up, and cryed at the eares of the
head, <hi>Iesus, Iesus;</hi> then the Iesuite which came a long
with him admonishing of him, desired everie one to
joyne in prayers with him for him; then came the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and a Boy which was beheaded likewise, all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their private confessions to Priests, at the foot of
the scaffold, having a Crucifix in their hand, kissing
their hands &amp; feet at the end of everie prayer: After
all those men were beheaded, and quartered, there
went two of their confederates a foot to bee hanged
about an English mile off, to a place where a Priest of
theirs hung upon a pole, and his head on the top,
which was taken in a Church a yeere before called
<hi>Ering,</hi> which we afterward passed by.</p>
            <p>The twelfth day being Sunday, the Emperour, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
and the Arch-Dutchesse, dined at the Iesuites
College; but before, they heard Masse in their Church,
and after dinner a play was presented to them by the
house, and some young schollers, consisting of many
varieties. The fifteenth day his Excellencie dined at
the Count <hi>Megaws,</hi> and was nobly entertained: the
sixteenth day as we were at dinner, there came a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
clap of thunder and lightning, which burnt downe
three houses presently, being not above an English
mile off, on the other side of the water, and such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
happen here often, by reason all their houses
be covered with thin boord, in the manner of tile;
and about foure of the clocke in the after-noone, his
Excellence had audience the third time, and we all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to a <hi>Balto,</hi> by the Empresses command, to the
Count <hi>Slavataes,</hi> who is Chancellour of <hi>Prague,</hi> where

all the Ladies assembled, and there spent the time in
dancing: in <hi>Moravia</hi> not farre from this place, there
was a Baron whose name was <hi>Rabell,</hi> having a wife,
which couple had beene married fortie yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had many children, and when he was eightie
two yeeres old, and his wife seventie five, she concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and brought him forth two children at a birth, a
sonne and a daughter, which children lived a yeere
and died, and then presently after their parents both
died, and was buried in S. <hi>Michaels</hi> Church, a Church
of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> in <hi>Brune,</hi> a towne in <hi>Moravia:</hi> this
storie was related to us by a Priest of the Empresses
for certaine; here his Excellence stayed nineteene
dayes, and all the time at the Emperours charge, and
served by his Majesties servants, in as much state as he
himselfe; at the first course the Drums beat up, and
at the second, musike with voyces.</p>
            <p>From hence we tooke boat for <hi>Vienna,</hi> the three and
twentieth day of Iune, passing downe the swift river
<hi>Danuby,</hi> neere the Church called <hi>Ering,</hi> wherein the
Boores assembled and chose that Priest, who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and executed as afore-mentioned, so by a faire ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
called <hi>Spiulbarke,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> makes
his Toll-place seated on the left side of the river, then
by <hi>Markhawsen</hi> on the same side, by <hi>Walzig</hi> a faire ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
seated on the other side on a high hill, and the
towne at the foot a little beyond, so by another faire
castle called <hi>Crayne,</hi> seated on a high rocke close by the
<hi>Danuby,</hi> on the left side, the towne at the foot of it,
both belonging to the Count <hi>Megaw:</hi> then thorow a
place in the water called the <hi>Struddell,</hi> where it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
very swift, with a great fall amongst the rockes,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9614:14"/>
and dangerous to passe, having no more space than the
breadth of a boat, which if it toucheth, breakes into
many peeces, and over this place on a high rocke is a
Crosse set up, having past this danger, just by on the
left side of the River is an old Chappell called S. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
out of which came two men with his picture in a
box, to receive an accustomed reward due from those
which passe by safe: from hence by a faire castle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Besinboe,</hi> seated on the same side on a rocke, and by
<hi>Pekelem</hi> on the same side, then by <hi>Wednick</hi> castle seated
on a rocke on the left side, with a village beneath it,
so by a castle and monasterie encircled with a wall,
seated on a verie high rocke called <hi>Milke,</hi> and the
towne at the foot of the rocke along by the <hi>Danuby</hi> on
the right side, part of it burnt by an accident when
the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> was in it, and by <hi>Sable</hi> castle on a
high rocke on the same side, with a faire banquetting
house, which belongeth to the Grave <hi>Sturbutz;</hi> and
a little further on the same side, is another banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-house,
called the Devils banquetting-house, by
reason of many apparitions there seene. Then to a
little poore Dorp called <hi>Aspagh</hi> on the left side of
the <hi>Danuby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aspagh.</note> where wee went a shore and lay that
night.</p>
            <p>Earely the next morning, being the foure and

the <hi>Spitz,</hi> seated on the same side, so by <hi>Stiringsteine,</hi> a
faire towne on a rocke adjoyning to the river on the
same side, with a ruinated castle over the towne on a

<hi>Van Seldingz:</hi> then by another faire towne seated on

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9614:15"/>
bridge over the <hi>Danuby</hi> made of rafts, having thirtie
seven arches, under which wee passed, and at the end
of it, opposite to the towne is a monasterie with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
faire houses belonging to it, and behinde this is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
stately built monasterie, called <hi>Kitne,</hi> seated on
a hill: from this an English mile distance, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
prospect, just by are two other faire townes,
the one <hi>Crempz,</hi> and the other <hi>Winsell,</hi> seated both on
the left side of the <hi>Danuby</hi> in a plaine, which three
townes are within the compasse of an English mile;
then by <hi>Tolnie</hi> a towne on the other side, which is the
oldest towne in all the Empire, against which wee lay
a while and dined on ship-boord: after dinner wee
entred into lower <hi>Austria,</hi> and went by an old castle
called <hi>Griffopsteine,</hi> seated on a rocke on the same side,
in which all Priests that offend are imprisoned and
tried.</p>
            <p>Then a Dutch mile further, on the left side, the
<hi>Danubius</hi> runneth out to a faire Towne called <hi>Corny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi>
seated an English mile off in a Plaine with
faire Monasteries therein, then on the other side of
the river is <hi>Cloysternybrough,</hi> full of Cloysters and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries;
so by <hi>Nustorffe</hi> on the same side, from
whence we discovered <hi>Vienna,</hi> seated in a Plaine, then
left the <hi>Danu,</hi> which divides its selfe into sever all bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and meet beyond the Towne, and runs thorow
<hi>Hungary</hi> into the blacke Sea, and went up in an arme
of it to the Citie, where wee landed, seated on the
right side of the <hi>Danu,</hi> which is very well fortified
round the wals, besides a compleat Regiment of 1500
men alwayes ready in armes, part watching at everie
gate, some about the Emperours palace, others about
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9614:15"/>
the place where the Iewes keep their shops in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for they are not suffered to lye in the Towne a
night, but constrained to keepe within a place on the
other side of the River opposite to the Citie, which
they have built, and is called the Iewes Burg; for if
any one be found all night in the Towne, he is misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
punished, if not put to death: there are likewise
7000 Burgers in the citie, which are to be in armes at
an houres warning.</p>
            <p>The next day being Sunday, his Excellence had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the Queene of <hi>Hungary</hi> and the Arch-Duke
<hi>Leopoldus,</hi> the Emperours second sonne, being the 26.
day, and nothing wee saw note-worthy at his palace,
but a spacious Court-yard: the next day againe his
Excellence went to see the Dukes lodging, where we
saw onely a few pictures; from hence he went to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
houses of the Iesuites, the first was a University,
where was presented to his Excellence a kinde of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
by young Schollers in masking attire, and one of
the house playing on an instrument like a Virginall,
severall kindes of musicke; after that, a banquet
brought in by the Actors: this ended, we went to the
second house called the Probation-house, where none
but young men are, about fiftie in number, there to
be tried whether they may bee made capable of holy
orders: thence to the third house, called the Profest-house,
where none but the ancient Fathers are, where
as soon as his Excellence entred, an oration was made
to him by one of the chiefe, &amp; after viewed the house
and Church, in which there was an hymne sung by
their best singers, with very sweet musicke, and they
have an organ of five thousand pipes. From hence
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9614:16"/>
wee returned home to our lodging, where there
came presently after the Prince of <hi>Ducardins</hi> to visit
his Excellence.</p>
            <p>The eight and twentieth day his Excellence went
to see a garden of the Emperours about a Dutch mile
off, called <hi>Nigobath,</hi> upon which place the Turke once
intrenched himselfe, when hee would have taken <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi>
and was then two hundred thousand men strong,
in the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> his time, and after they
were driven out of the countrey, the Emperour built
this on their works for a memoriall, the garden is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
foure-square, encircled with a strong stone wall,
and at every corner a faire Tower, and in the middle
two, with three partitions in everie one, and the tops
covered with brasse, round within the wall is a walke
for two to goe a brest, covered with brasse, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
thicke with pillars of stone: then returned wee to
another very stately large garden of the Empresses
neere unto the citie, called her <hi>Favorita,</hi> having seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
small gardens adjoyning to it and a faire house:
the next day his Excellence went to see the Queene
againe, and the two Princes her Sonne and Daughter
here we staid a weeke, and departed the first of Iuly
by waggons for <hi>Prague,</hi> passing first over three long
bridges handing over severall branches of the <hi>Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius:</hi>
so by the wals of <hi>Cornyburgh</hi> the towne afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
to <hi>Stackay</hi> a poore village where wee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
after dinner by <hi>Kildersdorf</hi> to <hi>Holebrum</hi> a poore
village,<note place="margin">Holebrum.</note> where wee lay all night on the straw, having
travelled seven Dutch miles, and every Dutch mile
is foure English, where six and twentie houses were
burnt that day fortnight wee came, by thunder and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9614:16"/>
lightning, the next day early from hence passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
plaines and corne-fields which were a reaping,
we came to <hi>Kudordorp,</hi> where <hi>Moravia</hi> begins in a great
plaine, where two stones are set in the ground, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Lower <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> then past we thorow
<hi>Colendorp</hi> the first towne in <hi>Moravia,</hi> and by a Crosse
standing in a plaine not neere any towne, with many
graves about it,<note place="margin">Swamb</note> then to <hi>Swamb</hi> a prettie towne where
we dined, having past that fore-noone in danger neere
a great company of Crabats, who were thereabouts,
who frighted the towne: for when his Excellencies
Harbenger entred the gates an houre before us, they
were all shutting up of their shops, and running out
to defend the towne. After dinner thorow most
plaines and corne-fields which were a reaping, untill
wee came at <hi>Bodewich,</hi> a poore village,<note place="margin">Bodewic</note> where wee lay
on the plancher, and travelled that day seven Dutch
miles.</p>
            <p>The next day being Sunday, and the third of Iuly,
we stayed there untill dinner, and thence thorow
part of a wood called <hi>Hertz-waldt,</hi> on a causey two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
miles long, the wood being three hundred miles
in length (as we were credibly informed) passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
we saw severall fires in it, &amp; many strange things
are likewise seene, and so by <hi>Bernetz,</hi> a little towne at
the end of the wood, to <hi>Iglo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iglo.</note> a beautifull built towne

then thorow <hi>Stickey</hi> the first towne in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

times of his guests ninetie men, and made meat
of them, so to <hi>Dutchbrade</hi> a towne where wee dined,
and then departed, passing thorow a plaine wooddie
countrey to <hi>Holebrum,</hi> where we lay that night on the
plancher, which was a most fearefull night of thunder
and lightning, having travelled seven Dutch miles.</p>
            <p>The next morning wee departed, and went tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a wooddie countrey againe, and thorow a towne
called <hi>Shasshaw</hi> where in the street we passed thorow,<note place="margin">Shasshaw.</note>
lieth buried the body of one <hi>Iohn Ziska,</hi> who made
war against the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> in the defence of
his deere friend <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> who died a Martyr: this
<hi>Iohn Ziska</hi> in all his wars was a victor, and when hee
was blinde desired to bee carried up and downe the
wars, and at his death commanded that a Drum might
be made of his skin, which was done, and whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that was, they subdued likewise; then by a silver
Mine of the King of <hi>Hungaries,</hi> which was by the way
side on a little hill, into which wee entred to see their
works, the oare being two hundred and fiftie fathom
deepe, and behinde this place is a citie called <hi>Ketten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
which wee left two English miles of our left

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:9614:17"/>
The next morning earely, being the sixth of Iuly,
from thence to <hi>Prague</hi> to dinner,<note place="margin">Pragu</note> being five Dutch
miles, passing first thorow very pleasant plaines and
meddowes, vntill we came neere the citie, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
on both sides with rocks and hils, all plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with vines, having three townes belonging to it,
<hi>Newstadt, Oldstadt,</hi> and the <hi>Slostadt;</hi> at <hi>Newstadt</hi> wee
entred in at a faire gate, passing thorow into <hi>Oldstadt,</hi>
to his Excellencies lodging, which said <hi>Stadt</hi> is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
chiefly by Iewes, who have there foure Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
and in one I saw there a Rabbi circumcise a
child, here we were told that all their fruits in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the countrey were spoyled, as corne,
vineyards, and the like, by the aforesaid thunder and
lightning with hailestones as big as ones fist, and also
divers cattell were then lost: between this and the
<hi>Slostadt</hi> runneth a pleasant river called the <hi>Muldow,</hi> and
over it standeth a faire Bridge of stone, as long as <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Bridge, over which his Excellencie passed, going
to view the Castle, being a stately large built Fort,
seated on a high hill within the <hi>Slostadt,</hi> called <hi>Ketschin,</hi>
in which the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first wee passed
thorow three faire Court-yards, having at one of the
gates a guard of Souldiers in which Court-yard there
is a statue of S. <hi>George</hi> on horse-backe in brasse, and a
fountaine, then entred we into a spacious hall, having
many faire shops in it like unto <hi>Westminster,</hi> but that
their Courts of Iudicature are in other roomes by it:
from hence wee went up and passed thorow many
faire roomes well hung, and pictures in them, and one
roome furnished with English pictures of our Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was forced to leave,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9614:18"/>
passing thus untill wee came at one roome two stories
high, which was their Councell-chamber, where the
<hi>Bohemians</hi> being sat at Councell, and three of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
Couucell with them, there rose a mutiny, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that they threw them three out on the
ground, which was fiftie five foot high, and shot pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols
after them, yet none of them killed, and two of
them still alive, and upon that ground they fell on are
set set up three gilt crosses: then went we downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a stately lower roome, which used to bee their mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
roome, upholden with severall faire pillars, in the
middle, and statures of brasse placed by them; by the
wals hang pictures of Indian horses which were there
then; adjoyning to this is a large dining roome, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a table in it of Mozaique worke, and musicke
within it not to be discerned, then at the end of this
roome is a little place where choyce armour is, and
one Piece which I saw shot off a bullet, not having any
powder in it: then into the <hi>Schaut kamber,</hi> where the
treasure was, and a most noble collection of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Rodolphus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first roome was cup-boords placed in the

second, of Purslaine; the third, of mother of pearle;
the fourth, of curious brasse-plates engraven; the fifth
and sixth. Mathematicall Instruments; the seventh,
Basons, Ewers, and cups of Amber; the eighth, cups

and eighteenth, Indian worke; the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
Turkey-worke; the twentieth, of a lively
statue of a woman covered with taffatie. Then in the
middle of the roome are rare clocks of all kinds; the
first was like a globe with musike; the second was set
round about the middle with little pillars, and a bullet
running round in a cresse out and in, and over it hung
two little cords, which being puld, wee heard sweet
musike, but could not discerne from whence it was;
the third had a faire lively face and hand looking out,
and musike with voyces singing, not to be discovered;
the fourth, a close clocke, and by it a faire table of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaique
worke; the fifth, with foure ascents set seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
with pillars, and a bullet running round in a
cresse up to the top, playing with musike; the sixth,
like the top of a globe, the gold coloured like a green
field, and a Bucke running round in and out, and
hounds after making a noyse, and beneath musike, and
Anticks, dancing in a round within it; the seventh, a
clocke with a globe: by the wals on the other side an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
things set up, and pictures, together with a steele
chaire very curiously wrought and cut thorow. Then
entred wee into another little closet, wherein were
more cabbins placed in the wals on the same side, of
presents sent to the Emperour, as gilt helmets and
head peeces, and statues.</p>
            <p>In the third roome, foure cup-boords in the wals
full of rare pictures, and in the middle of the roome
anticke things, as a Bore rough cast to the life, and a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9614:19"/>
statue of a strong Maid to the life, who went to war,
and a presse of ancient bookes. The fourth roome,
three cup-boords full of the Anatomies of severall
rarities, as Cockatrices, and fishes part resembling
men; and the fourth cup-boord of rare great shels;
the fifth, of fine dishes; the sixth, of all kinde of little
shels, and a Librarie, with one mightie great booke <hi>in
folio,</hi> written by a Fryar in a dungeon, who was there
put in, upon some hainous offence there to suffer, and
fortie yeeres after discovered by some Fryars going
neere, hearing a noyse, had search made, and found
him, who brought forth this booke, consisting of the
old and new Testament, and many strange histories,
which hee was all that time a writing, and assisted by
the Devill (as he conceived) and spake very little more
before he died.</p>
            <p>Here is likewise all the skins of those Indian horses,
whose pictures hung up in the masking roome: then
did wee enter into a large Church, standing neere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the middle of the Castle, where about the Quire
are cut in wood many fine things, and a tombe of the
Queenes Confessour, called <hi>Iohan. Nepomews,</hi> who was
miserably tortured by <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> the fourth King of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> to reveale her Majesties confession, and at
last put to death by him, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1383, from hence
his Excellencie went to view a garden behind the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
within the wall, where wee went in a walke cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
arbour-like, halfe an English mile long, untill we
came at a stately old building, with walkes round the
house, and set thicke with pillars and likewise on the
top of the house, with a delightfull prospect over all
the citie, and then his Excellencie returned backe to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9614:19"/>
the Keepers house, and there dined, having sent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
before: dinner being past, his Excellencie went
to see a Parke two English miles off the Citie, in which
there is a Friarie of white Friars, who were leaping
then in the Parke, as wee passed by to see a great beast
called a Buffule, which is kept there, and then retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home by <hi>Wallensteines</hi> new house, into which his
Excellencie entred to view it, first passing thorow a
large hall of eight and thirtie paces, or more in length,
and one and twentie in breadth, we went up thorow
galleries having pictures hung up, and painted on the
wals with stories of <hi>Hercules,</hi> above head divers stories
of <hi>Ovid;</hi> then to the Audience-roome, where the
foure elements are in the middle above head, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
other faire chambers; then downe into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
where there are five fountaines, and great figures
of brasse placed on them, and on the great fountaine
<hi>Neptune,</hi> with foure Nymphs about him, and a faire
<hi>Grott-house,</hi> but the waters run not; then into the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
being curiously built, where six and twentie hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may stand, the pillars and manger all of red mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and thirtie eight in number, and each pillar cost
twentie five pounds, there are foure Court-yards
which encompasseth the house, which is now the
King of <hi>Hungaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Wallensteine</hi> was sole Commander of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
under the Emperour, and grew so great, which
caused his Majestie to be jealous of him, as he had just
cause considering his plots which hee had laid against
the Crowne; but to prevent the worst, privately
tooke order with some of his Irish Captaines, who
were appointed to keepe watch of him that night, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9614:20"/>
cut him off, which was effected in the evening, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
on the sudden into his chamber found him onely
in his shirt, and said, <hi>Live Ferdinando, but dye traytour
Wallensteine;</hi> at which he opened his armes and cried,
<hi>Oh my God,</hi> embracing the stabs of the halberds, which
done, they cut off his head, and presently posted to
the Emperour with it, who gave them great rewards,
and they still continue much in his favour.</p>
            <p>The next day his Excellence was invited to a play
at the Iesuites College, where the <hi>Senior</hi> of the house
is an Irish man, and there entertained Prince-like;
first, an oration by a young Scholler, then passing
downe by a Guard of Souldiers, who discharged their
muskets: his Excellence being past to the roome
where the Comedy was acted, which action did please
exceedingly, not onely in respect of substance, but
also for the goodnesse of the action and severall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
in number more than fiftie, the chiefe part were
young Schollers, and divers of them Barons sons, and
being ended, desired to kisse his Excellencies hand
kneeling, in testimony of his approbation. And here
is the argument annexed in the page following.</p>

            <p>Here we stayed seven dayes, and departed the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of Iuly for <hi>Regenspurg</hi> by waggons, over the
plaine where the great battell was fought, betweene
the Emperour and the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> not above two
English miles from the citie, there wee did observe
many places in the ground, wherein the dead bodies
were put, and a great company of bones lying by on a
heape, where were slaine in all on both sides about
thirtie thousand: from thence thorow a plaine corne
countrey, to a little towne three Dutch miles from
<hi>Frague,</hi> called <hi>Beroum,</hi> where wee lay, which towne
hath beene burnt by the Duke of <hi>Saxon</hi> his forces.
The next morning earely wee went thorow plaine

pleasantly in a plaine, where there was not above
foure poore housholds remaining: not long since it
was in great prosperitie; for when wee were a little

over on rafters, the bridge being beaten downe

<hi>Cleandor</hi> two yeeres since, passing thorow this

(which encompasseth <hi>Augusta</hi> on the West, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

which is divided into so many branches so
running with so many Bulwarks: the river water is of
an excellent greene colour, which is caused (as they
say) running out of Copperas mines, which are in
the mountaines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> from whence it springs,
taking its name from <hi>Vindix</hi> a famous Captaine, who
first rebelled against <hi>Nero,</hi> passing over all these brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
we entred the outer towne, which is well built,
and so in at a broad port thorow the high street to his
Excellences lodging, that day and the next was spent
in seeing pictures: Munday being the five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth

First you must understand it to bee a square pile, of
at least one hundred foot square; in the middest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

of thirteene steps, into a stately lower roome suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

            <p>From hence, we went to view one of their Houses,

his <hi>Excellence</hi> with a Banquet: from hence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>And from hence to the Castle, where the Father of
one of the Lords lived, who after he had shewed his

            <p>The next day, which was Sunday, they all dined
with his <hi>Excellence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the morning being the 14. day, wee departed
having stayed heere three dayes, and tooke a Convoy
of 100. Musketiers along with us to <hi>Neustadt,</hi> five
<hi>Dutch</hi> miles; The first night, travelling part by
Torch-light through the Woods, and there lay on

having now five in it.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth day earely, thence to <hi>Ketzen</hi> five

his Horse.</p>
            <p>The next morning before his Excellence departed,
he was visited by the Bishop of <hi>Wesburg,</hi> whom wee
found, in the habit of a Countrey Gentleman, setting
aside his Order, which is an enamelled Crosse han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
on a Blacke ribbon about his necke; who made
very much of his Excellence, and presented him with
the Picture of our <hi>Ladie,</hi> done by <hi>Albertus Durerus,</hi>
being one of his best peeces; and then tooke leave of
him, who was ready to ride out of Towne, to some
other place for safety, the <hi>Swedes</hi> being within two

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9614:33"/>
to his Lodging, and presently went away.</p>
            <p>The seaventeenth day, taking a fresh Convoy went
to <hi>Bishopsheim</hi> that night,<note place="margin">Bishopsheim.</note> a Towne seated in a bottome,
and incompassed round with Hills, having the River

and most part through great Woods.</p>
            <p>Earely next morning, thence through <hi>K<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

up and downe in the Woods, being round about us,
in number 6000. or more, dispersing themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
severall Companies, pillaging and robbing of the

               <note place="margin">Mildebarke.</note>
but a <hi>Dutch</hi> mile before wee came thither, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into our old way at <hi>Nunkirken,</hi> the poore burnt
Village before mentioned, which is now inhabited by
some Foure or five poore people.</p>
            <p>The 19. day in the morning, from thence another way,
taking another fresh Convoy, leaving our old way and
the <hi>Maine</hi> on our right hand, passing along by the
side of it, through <hi>Hybach</hi> a Village, and a faire House
which is the Bishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> likewise, and through
other Villages miserably battered, and in Plaines
some sixe <hi>English</hi> miles in length, untill wee came to
<hi>Selgenstadt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Selgenstadt.</note> having gone this day sixe <hi>Dutch</hi> miles.
Falling into our old way within one mile of the
Towne, travelling all those dayes in danger of the
<hi>Croats,</hi> where as soone as his Excellence lighted, the
Grave <hi>Vandosme</hi> Governour of the Countrey for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9614:33"/>
the Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> sent his Excellence a present
of halfe a wilde Bore, and likewise provision for his
Horse; knowing that the Towne could not affoord
any thing.</p>
            <p>The twentieth day being Sunday, early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
wee went thence to <hi>Frankfort</hi>
               <note place="margin">Frankfort</note> to dinner, which
was three <hi>Dutch</hi> miles.</p>
            <p>And the next morning after, his Excellence went to
<hi>Hannaw</hi> to visite Sir <hi>Iames Ramsey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hannaw.</note> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman
and Governour of the Towne, and there stayed that
night, who met his <hi>Excellence</hi> without the gate with
a troupe of Horse, and entering the Towne there went
off a brace of Canons, and when his <hi>Excellence</hi> ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
went off two more by the doore of his <hi>Excellencies</hi>
lodging; which Towne, was besiedged a Yeare and a
halfe by the Emperours forces, and at the beginning
of the Siege had such a grievous Plague, that there
dyed in 7. Weekes, 22000. yet for all this, they kept
out the enemy, though in great want and misery, and
three months since it was releeved by the Landt-grave
of <hi>Hesse,</hi> who slew a great company of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
and drave the rest away; for as wee passed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at a distance, we heard them as they were in their
skirmish. The next morning, his <hi>Excellence</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Towne to view the Workes, which are very
strong, scarce to bee scaled by any force, having two
Engines made but of six Musket barrels a piece, which
<hi>Dutch</hi> Engine dischargeth 80. times together, giving
fire to it but once; the Towne is seated in a plaine
ground, having the <hi>Mayne</hi> on the East, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
on the North and West, with the River <hi>Knits<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zig,</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:9614:34"/>
besides Moted round, and this River serveth 14.
Mills which adjoynes to the Towne, and before any
man can enter into the old Towne he must passe over
three Bridges, and through severall Bulworkes, and
over another into the new Towne; and at the releefe
of the Town, there was one <hi>Daniel Lauter</hi> a chiefe Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
dyed for very joy; he being above in his house and
seeing the victory, was overcome with such a mighty
passion of joy, that hee fell downe and dyed instantly;
there was likewise a woman, who killed many Dogs &amp;
sold their flesh at a great rate to many people, and one
day as shee walked in the Streets, was like to have been
devoured by them, had not some poore Souldiers
by chance releeved her, who presently confessed what
shee had done formerly, acknowledging she had just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserved it; and after dinner his <hi>Excellence</hi> tooke
leave of Sir <hi>Iames Ramsey,</hi> and then returned backe to
<hi>Frankfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foure and twentieth day, foure of the Burgers
of the Citie came and presented their service to his
<hi>Excellence</hi> with twenty flaggons of Wine, and then
dined with him; here wee stayed three dayes untill
our Boates were made ready.</p>
            <p>And on Saturday the 26. day of <hi>November,</hi> wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from hence, and rowed downe the <hi>Mayne;</hi>
the first night to <hi>Flersheym,</hi> which was three miles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which wee cast anchor and lay aboard; The
next morning launched forth, and past downe to
<hi>Mentz,</hi> and there his <hi>Excellence</hi> went on shore, to see
if it were any way inriched since our being there, but
alas, wee found it as miserable as before, with divers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:9614:34"/>
poore people lying on Dunghils almost starved, being
scarce able to crawle for to receive his <hi>Excellencies</hi>
almes, and presently returning to our Boate to dinner,
wee afterwards releeved many poore hungry soules
with the fragments; Thence after dinner downe the
<hi>Rhyne</hi> to <hi>Rudeshem,</hi> which was five <hi>Dutch</hi> miles, and
there cast anchor, and lay on the boards likewise.</p>
            <p>Very earely the next morning wee weyed anchor,
and presently entred into a dangerous place to passe,
called <hi>Bingham-Locke,</hi> where the River <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> falls into
the <hi>Rhyne</hi> by the Towne amongst many Rockes,
which causeth a violent fall, tossing us up and downe,
that if wee had but touched any part of them we had
all been cast away; being past this, we came to <hi>Bacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,</hi>
where, some of our Company did but goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore
(and presently hastened after in a little Boate,)
were pursued by five Musketiers almost to his <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies</hi>
Boat, who discharged very often at them, yet
by good fortune mist them, and having overtaken his
<hi>Excellence,</hi> they instantly fled away; then going on to
a large Iland an <hi>English</hi> mile from <hi>Coblentz,</hi> wee there
cast anchor and lay all that night; for wee could not
passe to the Towne without leave from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by reason of severall watches which lay in our
way; which night wee lay in much danger, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them walke up and downe to catch a prey, for as
some of our company did but goe a little way from
our Boat, they were layd hold on, and one that fled,
had a Musket shot at him, and hee that was taken, they
caried before their Commander, who was in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
in the Iland, examining him, &amp; then let him goe.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9614:35"/>
The next morning,<note place="margin">Coblentz.</note> his <hi>Excellence</hi> sent againe to the
Governour, for passage, who like a base fellow made
us stay that night also, and the next day untill three of
the clock in the afternoone, and would not let us passe,
for all that his <hi>Excellence</hi> had sent him the Emperors
Passe and Letter, wherein hee was commanded, not
onely to give passage, but, to assist him in any thing
hee required; yet for all this, hee kept us still, and
would not give way that our Trumpeter might goe
to the <hi>French</hi> in the Castle; but they perceiving how
unworthily hee did deale with his <hi>Excellence,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
4. or 5. Cannons at his house, and shot quite
through it, at last hee came at the third sending for,
with an excuse, hee was very unkindly delt with by
Cardinall <hi>Genetta,</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> who lately passed
by, going to <hi>Colle<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> but stayed him three dayes first,
before hee let him passe, and made him promise faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
not to visit the <hi>French,</hi> but being got beyond the
Towne landed and went in, which made him vow
not to let any passe. But after that hee had talked a
while with his <hi>Excellence,</hi> gave leave to fall downe
neere the Towne, and having cast anchor, set a strong
watch about us, and then gave leave for the Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to goe to <hi>Monsieur Salade</hi> in the Castle for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
who most willingly granted it, and sent his
<hi>Excellence</hi> a very faire ancient Picture; but hearing
by the Trumpeter the Governours base usage towards
his <hi>Excellencie,</hi> presently plac'd their Canons against
his house, and vowed his Sonne should give fire to
them the next morning, and would send him such a
breakfast, as that hee should need no dinner; in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9614:35"/>
interim, there came a Lieutenant from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
upon a colour to visite his <hi>Excellence,</hi> who
proved a second Villaine in the end, for all that wee
used him very well, and fedde his hungry belly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it had beene long before; for the Souldiers
themselves confessed, that they had but one Browne
loafe and a halfe of Bread in eight dayes, and not one
penny of money; yet this Rascall lay lurking in our
Boate till our Trumpeter returned, and then violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tooke him and the Skipper, and carried them into
the Towne and set a watch about them; and the next
morning, sent his <hi>Excellence</hi> word hee might passe,
but the Trumpeter should follow after; whereupon
his <hi>Excellence</hi> sent his Steward to know the reason,
who found them tyed by the Armes together, the
Skippers finger cut off, &amp; the Trumpeters head escaped
very narrowly from being cloven in two, had not his
strong Hat defended it, and also had threatned to hang
them up the next day together, but with much adoe
hee brought them away with him, and after followed
a Gentleman to excuse that barbarous base usage of
the Lieutenant, and leave to passe, presently depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and being gone but a little past the Towne and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Castle, they saluted us, and said they would
drinke the King of <hi>Englands</hi> health, and then gave
fire to more than twenty thundring Cannons, beside
a brave volley of small Shot, which made their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to smoake and tumble in our sight, but they durst
not returne one backe againe; the other Governour
<hi>Geats,</hi> gave us very noble usage, but this who was
lately sent, shewed himselfe so base, that he deserves
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9614:36"/>
no name with us; from hence to <hi>Bonn,</hi> and there cast
anchor, but durst not lye nigh the Towne, the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
being very sore in it, and this day rowed eight
miles.</p>
            <p>The next day being the first of <hi>December,</hi> in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
we went from thence to <hi>Collen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Collen.</note> being foure miles,
leaving those delightfull Mountaines, Hills, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Vines, and entred into a plaine Countrey, where
as soone as wee came into the Towne, neere the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
where the Cardinall lay, had information, of all
what the boorish Governour of <hi>Coblentz</hi> sayd of him
was false; wee stayed heere three dayes untill wee
had exchanged our Boates for bigger, and every day
his <hi>Excellence</hi> had presented unto him 24. Flaggons
of Wine, sent from the Magistrates; who once dined
with him.</p>
            <p>And on Sunday the 4. day of <hi>December,</hi> about foure
of the clocke at night tooke Shipping, and the next
morning at three a clocke set sayle, and sayled downe
by <hi>Mulheim</hi> on the left side of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mulheim.</note> and <hi>Sonts</hi>
on the other side, which belongeth to the Abbots of

<hi>Newse</hi> on the same side, where the River runneth out
to it,<note place="margin">Dusseldorpe</note> and so to <hi>Dusseldorpe,</hi> where as soone as we came
but neere the shore, out came the Noble Duke of
<hi>Neuburgh,</hi> and clambered over other Ships to come
into ours, to visite his <hi>Excellence,</hi> being much joyed at
his safe returne, and had made provision at his House
to entertaine his <hi>Excellence,</hi> but perceiving he would
not stay, sent for a wilde Bore, Wine, and five Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and presented them to his <hi>Excellence,</hi> then
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9614:36"/>
tooke his leave, being very sory to let him goe, but
considering the time and tediousnesse of the weather,
was more willing to give leave, he staying by the shore
untill wee put off, and then went off 10. Cannons,
the Duke still walking along the shore as farre as the
water would give him leave, and stayed untill we were
out of fight. From thence by <hi>Keiserswert</hi> belonging
to the Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> seated on the left side of the
<hi>Rhyne,</hi> where wee were stayed to free our Toll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and at our lanching forth saluted us with one
Peece of Ordnance, so on by <hi>Ordingen</hi> a little Towne,
where on the other side, about a league further wee
cast anchor, against a small old Castle called <hi>Enger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,</hi>
sayling seaven leagues and a halfe this day, for
before wee went by miles, which were some foure or
five <hi>English</hi> miles at the least in length, but these are
but three English; this night wee lay in much danger,
for there did lye on each side of us, parties, which
robbeth and pillageth all Passengers; for wee saw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
fifty in a company, going all along by the shore,
but a little before wee cast anchor, and at 10. of the
clocke in the night being very darke, was a false ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
given by the Watch of a partie comming, which
made us all flye to our weapons, at last perceiving it
was but one Boate, and they that were in it, crying
out Friends from the Duke of <hi>Neuburg,</hi> else wee had
shot them, who came for to have passage into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next morning earely wee weyed anchor, and went
part of the day in danger likewise, to <hi>Orsoy,</hi> the first
Garrison Towne of the <hi>States,</hi> where we were stayed,
and our Ship searched what wee carried, but at our
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9614:37"/>
putting off, they gave us two Pieces of Ordnance; so
from thence along by <hi>Rhineberg,</hi> against which there
lay a man of Warre of the <hi>States,</hi> who saluted us with
three Pieces; then by <hi>Buricksweasell,</hi> and a league fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we cast anchor in the middle of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
this day but 4. leagues and a halfe, by reason of our
stay at severall Toll places.</p>
            <p>The next day earely in the morning, set sayle, and
sayled downe by <hi>Rhees, Emmericke,</hi> and by <hi>Schenck-Schants,</hi>
which is now new built and well fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
