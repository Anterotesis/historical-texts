         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

also, the stirring of the heart and affections should
be endeavored, as well as Information; and such
words be used, and so set, as may rather make a
Sermon then a Tract, and beget rather a love to
the Matter (as this Author endeavoreth) then an
opinion, or an esteem of the VVriters abilities.

Salvation through him. Hereunto he exhorteth them constantly to cleave,

1. An Inscription. 2. The Salutation. In the former
we have a description, 1. Of the person writing, and
that both by his Name, <hi>Peter,</hi> and by his Office, <hi>An
Apostle of Jesus Christ.</hi> 2. Of the parties to whom he
doth write, and that both by their outward state to the
World-ward, <hi>viz.</hi> Strangers scattered up and down in strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
namely, <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia</hi> and <hi>Bythinia;</hi> and by
their estate to God-ward, <hi>viz.</hi> Parties belonging to salvation, which
he sets forth by the causes thereof and degrees, namely, 1. Their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
2. Sanctification. 3. Redemption by the obedience of Christ
Jesus, which shewed it self in his shedding his blood for them. In
the latter, a brief but pithy Prayer to God for his favor, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from whence all happiness was to be bestowed, yea multiplied
upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter]</hi> Three Names are given unto this our Apostle in Scripture:<note place="margin">The several Names of this our Apostle.</note>
1. <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Simon,</hi> that he had at his Circumcision. 2. <hi>Cephas,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
a Stone,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 14.</note> which our Saviour Christ gave him at his calling,
thereby signifying what he meant to do for him,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 42.</note> namely, to make him
a stout defender of the Faith, on the behalf whereof (though he was
born of Parents of small note) he proved one of notable courage:
This is in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> tongue. 3. <hi>Peter,</hi> which in Greek is all
one with the former,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> so that these two Names were in effect but one:
In his second Epistle he names himself <hi>Simon Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here learn,</p>
                  <p>1. Christs kindeness to <hi>Peter,</hi> in giving him a Name to assure him
of some grace which he would bestow upon him: Though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do so,<note place="margin">What Names Parents are to give to their Children.</note> yet it behoves us to give our Children such names as may
edifie them, and put them in minde of some good thing; either to
imitate some good man or woman whose Name they bear, or else to
follow some good that the Name puts them in minde of.</p>
                  <p>2. In that he puts his Name to his Epistle, he shews his godliness
and innocency,<note place="margin">Such as set forth Books ought to set their Names thereto.</note> which makes him bold, for Truth may be blamed,
but cannot be shamed: Contrary to many Hereticks, and false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Teachers, the Devils disciples, which pen Books stuffed
with Errors, either under the Names of the Apostles, that so they may
the sooner beguile and get credit to their Lyes; or else without
Names, lest being found out by their Names, they should suffer, and
be brought to punishment for their Errors; or their infamous Names
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65522:18"/>
being seen in the forefront of their Book, should cause any judicious
and honest Reader with indignation to cast it away. The Apostle, I
say, contrariwise having the sound and holy Oracles of God from
Heaven to deliver unto them, puts to his Name. There are many
worthy Works,<note place="margin">Why some worthy men have not done thus.</note> I confess, which have no Names put to them (those
especially which were written in the times of Persecution) whereof the
Authors, howsoever desirous to spread the Truth of God hated and

This is not for any fault in the matter, but only avoiding
danger in speaking of the truth. This is no disgrace to them, but to
their times, and their enemies; for men need not cast themselves into
peril till God call them.</p>
                  <p>This condemns the vile practice of the wicked,<note place="margin">Use.</note> which hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the dark, and in corners, lewdness not abiding the light: We
must do nothing, but that we dare put our hands to it, and our Names.
We must do as the Angel did that rolled away the stone, and sate upon
it when he had done, as if he should have said, Let me see who will
control that which I have done. We must do so, as we may bid our
Adversary write a Book against us for any gross or unlawful thing we
have done and stand in. Alas! what a folly is this, you flee mens
eyes, but can you flee the eyes of the Almighty? And if you cannot
abide mens censure, how shall you be able to stand before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

principal sort of Ministers, differing from all others in these particulars:
1. They were immediately called by Christ own mouth, and sent
abroad: Many were called by him for Disciples, and out of those he
chose his Twelve Apostles. 2. They had a larger measure of the
Spirit then others, so that they could not erre in their writings.
3. They had also a larger Commission,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Go ye</hi> (saith our Savior) <hi>and
Teach all Nations:</hi> They were to preach to all the world; but this Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is ceased. This notwithstanding it hath communion with all
other sorts of Ministers that they were called and sent: <hi>No man</hi> (saith
the Apostle) <hi>takes this honor to him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>but he that is called of God, as was
Aaron;</hi> and so were also the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>There are two things required in a Minister:<note place="margin">Two things required in a Minister.</note> 1. That he be lawfully

                  <p>Touching a Ministers Calling,<note place="margin">He must have an inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and</note> it must be both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
1. He must have an inward Calling from God; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
1. By an aptness and competency of Gifts to teach and edifie
the Church of God. 2. By a willing minde to employ the same,
seeking not his own advantage and ease, but the glory of God: This
makes the Minister. As when God calls a King, he gives him the
heart of a King: So if he appoint a man to be a father of Souls, he
fits him for it.<note place="margin">An outward.</note> 2. He must have an outward Calling from the Church
and those that are in place to alow and disalow Ministers, whose appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
they must have, which is not to make them, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65522:19"/>
of them for their further comfort, that they may more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
go forward.</p>
                  <p>The Brownists call us Bishops-Ministers,<note place="margin">Use.</note> because they call us
to this Office, but they do but alow and approve whom God hath
made.</p>
                  <p>Both must necessarily concur, the one go along with the other: He
that wants the inward, though he have the outward, is not a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of God (yet his actions are not to be esteemed nullities and void)
and he that in ordinary times having the inward wants the outward,<note place="margin">

goes not to work humbly as he ought.</p>
                  <p>Well did <hi>Peter</hi> declare himself an Apostle, one sent from God, a
Messenger, who was to deal faithfully in his Message; For he publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Conceits,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 11.</note> or mens Devices and Opinions, but the holy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God from Heaven. So must every Minister of God speak as
the words of God; What is the Chaff to the Wheat, either ones
Opinion to establish anothers Conscience?</p>
                  <p>But why doth he call himself by this great Name of his Office,
and put this high stile before his Epistle?<note place="margin">Why he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship.</note> Not for vain ostentation,
or for his own sake, but for the peoples good, even to procure with
them the more authority to that which he was to write; for who
should dare to refuse that which comes from the Lord Jesus, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Son of God, the Light of the world, the Savior and Judge thereof?
Nay, who should not with all high reverence submit himself thereunto?
So did the Prophets begin, <hi>The word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord,</hi>
whereby they set their peoples faith on work to look to God, and not
to men.</p>
                  <p>Hence let the Ministers of God learn to procure what credit and
authority to their Ministery they can,<note place="margin">Use.</note> signifying often, that it is Gods
will, thereby drawing their peoples mindes upward from the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
They must deliver such soundness of Doctrine, as may be food
it self, not froth, which accordingly they must deliver in a grave and
religious maner; adding thereunto, as Prayer, so also a godly life, and
all little enough, considering the prophaneness of our hearts, that so
little regard what we hear, yea hear without preparation or reverence,
being of us no sooner gone then forgotten.</p>
                  <p>But how dares he call himself an Apostle,<note place="margin">Q.</note> that had deserved by his most

2. The estate of the Church of God here on Earth,<note place="margin">Gods Church here on earth is under perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> namely, to
be under persecution; <hi>In the world</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>ye shall have tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Always there hath been enmity between the seed of the woman
and the seed of the Serpent.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 33.</note> Thus was it when the Church was but
in one Family, in one Countrey, one Nation. The world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Power, Authority, Wealth, is full of malice against the poor
Church, so that were it not that God Almighty defends it, it could
not endure; It's as a Sheep amongst wolves, or a Ship among the
waves. Though God will exercise it to keep it from errors, and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
which it is subject unto through much prosperity and peace;
though it have need of some peace to gather it self,<note place="margin">Act. 9. 31.</note> yet if't be long in
peace it gathers mud as standing waters, rust as the ploughshare in
the hedge, yea settles it self on the lees, therefore God pours it out
from Vessel to Vessel. Ever mark, after long prosperity grew pride,
and thereupon errors and corruptions, which like a canker brought
destruction. Contrarily, the Church never shines so gloriously as
either in, or presently after persecution; Then life, zeal, sincerity,
heavenly-mindedness, and such like graces appear in their true lustre.</p>
                  <p>It followeth,</p>
                  <p>1. That as we are not to conclude for a company,<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> because they have
so much peace, that therefore they are beloved of God; so must not
we against any, because they be few in number, and outwardly despised
and slighted.<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 19.</note> Four hundred false Prophets were maintained by <hi>Jezabel,</hi>
whereas <hi>Micaiah</hi> the onely true Prophet of the Lord was put in Prison;
<hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> were the true servants of the Lord, whom whole
multitudes of proud men and false Prophets resisted.</p>
                  <p>2. That we are to prepare our selves for persecution,<note place="margin">Use. 2.</note> especially
having had so long a time of peace. To this end we must resolve to part
with all for Christs sake, and for his Cause and Religion. Thus did
these Jews, thus the holy Martyrs; and great reason: For what
would it advantage us,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 12.</note> if we should gain the whole world, in the mean
time losing our souls by denying Christ.<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 12.</note> On the contrary, If we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
any thing for Christ here,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 39.</note> we shall have a Crown of everlasting
glory, <hi>Great is our reward in Heaven.</hi> But how far are most of us from
any such matter; many are destitute of knowledge, and how can
they suffer? Many have no love to the truth, but are carnal and
prophane persons, which never could yet be wrought upon by
the word to embrace it, or be ruled by it, that will not leave their
vile lusts for it, and how shall these leave their goods and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!
Nay, that which is most to be lamented, how few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
be like to stand to it, many are more likely a great deal to
flinch! Alas, what poor faith is in most; especially how are most
given over to the world, being too eager and earnest for these things,
neglecting good duties, and slubbering them over for the worlds sake;
How wil these forsake it altogether, and leave Houses and Lands, when
they will not lay aside their businesses for an hour or two to hear the
word, or a quarter of an hour for prayer in their Families? O let's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labor, as for good store of Faith, so to come to a contempt of this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65522:20"/>
world; In the mean time, use we it moderately and in his place, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves by little and little, else we shall never come to it all at
once; but for our livings sake shall be subject to fall from God, and
renounce our Religion, a fearful state.</p>
                  <p>3. The lawfulness of flying in time of persecution:<note place="margin">The lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of flying in the time of persecution.</note> The Jews here
did it, to save themselves from danger: It's lawful for a Minister
or any other tyed by calling, either when persecution is onely or
chiefly intended against him, or having consent for a time to go aside,
seeing it to be best for the rest: It's lawful for any, either when God
makes a way for them that seems to call them thereto (whereunto if
they should not yield, we are to think they have some extraordinary
motion of the Spirit of God to the contrary, as it's written of some
of the Martyrs) or finde themselves as yet not strong enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
their rage; Those, I say, may slie to be reserved as a seed to
propagate the Church afterward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bythynia.]</hi> The
places whereunto they fled for habor, were Regions and Countreys
in <hi>Asia</hi> the less, where there were then famous Churches.</p>
                  <p>Note hence,</p>
                  <p>1. The large extent of the Church of God in the time of the New
Testament,<note place="margin">The large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Church under the New Testament.</note> that whereas before it was kept within the pale of <hi>Judea,</hi> in
the New, since our Saviours ascension, it's dispersed over all Nations
far and wide, from the Sun-rising to its going down; that it might be
fulfilled which God spake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his seed all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world should be blessed.<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 3.</note>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>They are all (lamentable to be spoken) under the tyranny of
the Enemy of God and Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> the Turk; They are now no
Churches, but Synagogues of Satan, cages of unclean birds; so are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

                     <hi>but fear; for if God hath not spared the
natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not us;</hi> yea considering
our luke-warmness, unthankfulness, contempt of the Word, and
such other our crying sins, we have cause to fear the like judgement.</p>
                  <p>2. The singular diligence and care of this holy Apostle,<note place="margin">The Apostles diligence and care in his charge.</note> over the
charge committed to him: Not onely did he preach to them, being
present with them, but wrote also being absent, being in perse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cution,
and scattered throughout strange Countreys; he encourageth
them unto constancy, and that they should not faint under their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
of such helps there is great need in such cases, and at such times.
He was careful, not onely to gain them to God and the Faith, but
to hold them fast,<note place="margin">See Act. 14. 22</note> that as they were begotten, so they might be
nourished up in the faith; as they were converted, so he was careful
to confirm them, this being no less necessary then that: For
<hi>Non minor est virtus, quam quarere, parta tueri.</hi>
having offended, but again put in trust with the sheep, he is now care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of his Commission,<note place="margin">Use.</note> which is set down for the example of all
Ministers, even as we love Christ, so will we, must we, feed his sheep
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65522:21"/>
and lambs. We must labor by all diligence and faithfulness to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and build up, yea in times of sickness or any affliction, when
Satan waits to tempt them, and they be weak, we are to come and
strengthen them, we are to shoar them up, that they reel not, to comfort
them that they despair not: But how do they perform this duty, that
never come at their charges, seldom or never preach, put it off to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though never so unfit? how also they, that either preach not,
or but unprofitably, which come not to a poor or mean mans house
upon any occasion? How shall they be able to answer the great
Shepherd of the sheep, when they shall be called to an account?

I will not here handle the common place of Election, I have
done it at large, and I reserve such things to Catechizing; onely
now of such things as are necessarily occasioned by the text: whereof
this may be one, That</p>
                  <p>God hath chosen out some men to salvation,<note place="margin">God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen some to salvation.</note> as he did of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which are called the Elect Angels. Before the world, he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and decreed some persons to obtain salvation,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> even <hi>the vessels
of mercy,</hi>

                     <hi>which he had afore prepared unto glory;</hi> See to this purpose
<hi>Acts 13. 48. Eph. 1. 4. 1 Thess.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
                  <p>This must needs be so,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> for whatsoever falls out in the world, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
or particularly, God in his eternal and unchangeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
Ordained the same. And if wise men do not (especially)
great things, whereof they have not before deliberated, much lels
doth God.</p>
                  <p>Let us hold fast this truth inviolable,<note place="margin">Use.</note> according to the Scriptures,
casting away all carnal conceits of cruelty or the like in the Lord, and
with the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33.</note> what we cannot understand, learn we to
adore and admire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But how could the Apostle know they were Elect, may one know the
Election of another?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> For our own we may,<note place="margin">How we may know the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others.</note> as we shall hear by an by; for others we may
also, though not with the same knowledge and judgement of certainty,
because the heart of man is known to none but to God only, and a man
may go far who yet may fall away; but with the judgement of charity,
which hath degrees according to the fruits we see in them, if they only
profess Religion, and be in the Church, we may hope, but it is but weak
hope where we see no fruits; where we see some good likelihoods of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
some good beginnings, we may more strongly be perswaded; for
to such a man may say, If these things be in you, in truth you are the
very Elect of God: Now when we see the fruits of faith, sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and godliness in men, and that they shew it not by fits, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
not in some things, but in all; not in prosperity onely, but in
adversity too, in persecution, and under the Cross, we may the more, yea
very boldly judge of them as the Elect of God; and so doth out A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
here, as appears by the next words, <hi>Unto Sanctification of the
Spirit:</hi> He saw good signs of Sanctification in them, and that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65522:21"/>
persecution for Religions sake, therefore he so hoped of them, he
so stiles them.</p>
                  <p>We should not onely labor to have sound testimonies to our selves
of our Election and Salvation,<note place="margin">Christians must so live, as that even o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be perswaded that they belong to God.</note> but so live, as we may get a good and
full testimony thereof in the conscience and minde of the Church

when great and mighty ones that have been wicked, their names be

which the more it is stirred, the more it stinketh: They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that live vilely in their lusts, bring an ill name upon themselves,
who can judge they are Elect, or shall be saved? yea many be despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
they care not what men say, as bad a sign as can be; such also
as walk hollowly, and by halfs, in some things well, and in some
other taking such liberty as will not stand with Christianity or a
good conscience; These cause that the Church of God cannot conceive
so well, nor give so full a testimony of them as were to be desired,
but are forced to speak doubtfully. Oh let us so walk, that by since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

not our selves; It's an honor when we die, as the contrary, even
to be accounted vile, a fearful punishment; yea it's a comfort and
crown, to our Wives, Children, Friends, and a provocation to
them to follow our steps whom they hear so well spoken of.</p>

the cause why God refuseth any, but because he would; for though
he neither hateth nor casteth away any but for their sin, yet this was not
the cause of the Lords decree, but his own will, which is that which
maketh any thing just and good. Our will indeed being so corrupt,
must not be a reason of our actions, but in God his is, whose will
maketh a thing good, and not because a thing is good, therefore he
willeth it. Beyond this will of his we must not enquire, but in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
lay our hand upon our mouth, and admire the depth of his

at the unsearchableness of Gods free mercy, that he should think upon
him a poor worm before the beginning of the world, and one that
should be of the common stock of <hi>Adam,</hi> a sinfull wretch; think of
him I say, to choose him to life passing by so many. Oh how should
this ravish our hearts, and inflame us with love!</p>
                  <p>2. That if any be rejected,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> they must not complain of cruelty in

them, because it is unchangeable as God is, so that all the Devils in

and ever so, onely labor to walk worthy of this love, and grow in
sanctification, that we may have the more plentiful and strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

cause of our salvation is Christs obedience and sufferings;
and his obedience was chiefly in the offering up of himself: for though
the Father had Elected us to salvation,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> and made us happy in <hi>Adam,</hi>
yet we wrought our own overthrow by sin,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> and so deserved the curse
of God here and for ever. The only way then to deliver us from this,
and to save us, was by the Lord Jesus, God and man, who suffered all
the wrath that was due to us for our sins, and so discharged us. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
this wrath there was in our selves no power; no means else in
the world would serve, even the Angels were unable to help us herein.
This hath Christ done for us, and that fully, the dignity of his person
being such, that he is both God and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

blood of the lamb sprinkled on the Israelites houses was a sign, all

is not all mercy, as the world imagines: Therefore, for prophane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
ones, they shall bear the just wrath of God themselves, and
not by every late forced, <hi>Lord have mercy,</hi> have God at command as
they imagine: For if Christ was feign to suffer, and the Father would
not be intreated, notwithstanding his strong cries, but when he stood
as our Surety, laid on load and spared him not at all, shall his prophane

these to do to talk of Christs death? yet have these it in readiness,
<hi>Christ hath died for us;</hi> What, for such prophane ones as make his
death a packhorse, and lay on more load, which is to crucifie Christ
again? No, let these know, they shall bear the burthen of their own
sins; but let the true penitent be of good comfort, and know, that all
his sins (how great soever) be done away: Neither let such think, that
their afflictions are any part of the punishment of sin, for it is all done
away once in Christ, and therefore shall not again be demanded of
them; but they are loving chastisements to humble them for their
sins past, and prevent others for the time to come; both furthering
their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>7. For all that know they have their part in Christs death,<note place="margin">Use 7.</note> how
should this work with them! 1. For sin past, it should vex and grieve
our hearts, for we were the Crucifiers of Christ; <hi>Judas,</hi> the Soldiers
and <hi>Jews</hi> but our Servants, whom our sins set on work: It's our great
fault, that we can think of our sins without being humbled, shall
Christ shed tears of blood for our sins, and we not be troubled for our
own? 2. This should make us hate sin for ever, being as it were the
knife and spear that killed Christ; what father could ever love that knife
that should kill his childe? 3. How should this inflame our hearts
with love to him again, and carry us on in a zealous care of obedience
all our days? our woful coldness in Christs cause and service deserves
to be rebuked. Alas, how little will we do for his sake; we ought to
be ready to leave Goods, Liberty and Life for him; we should
herein but do as he hath done for us, yea who began thus to do for us,
when we were even his enemies! How much more any other thing!
And may not this stop the mouths of all prophane persons, which will
be talking, they hope to be saved by Christ, when they shew no love
nor thankfulness to him, but live yet in their sins to anger him.</p>

in the mean time they see in them no true tokens of Gods favor, but
alas what are these! It should more glad us to see an humble, godly
heart, turned from sin and embracing righteousness, though sickly
and poor, then to flow in all the wealth of the world, and be ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and to come home in a Gold chain, or to hear that our childe
were like <hi>Joseph,</hi> the second man in the Kingdom, without grace:
But men do for their children as for themselves, labor more for
goods then grace. But what shall we say to those Ministers that check
their people for forwardness, and seek to discourage them? what also
to those Parents, that are so far from desiring grace for their children,
as they check and discourage them for their forwardness thereunto?

even a desire to joyn grace to grace, is both for our selves and
others commendable. So should a Minister desire that his people may
not be a little better then the worst, but to exceed others by far, that
they may answer the time and means; and to this end, as to pray, so
to call upon them continually, and they not to think amiss of this,
but to rejoyce in it as a special fruit of his Love; so must Parents to
their Children: God gives us leave to be covetous in these things, and
to joyn grace unto grace,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5.</note> as men do house unto house, so shall we
honor him much, for a little grace will go but a little way. Thus shall
we benefit our Neighbors much, when our branches spread far, and

selves into the glorious Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10, 11.</note>

purchased by Christ, and revealed therein; and that they
would lead an holy and and godly life, answerable to this profession

Death and Resurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> Assurance of Salvation, Hope, Joy,
Peace, &amp;c. and at last everlasting life in the Kingdom of Heaven;
all which are revealed and wrought in us by the Gospel, which is no
new Doctrine, but that which of old was revealed to all the Prophets,
though now more clearly and fully manifested. Therefore seeing God
hath done so great things for us by Christ Jesus, and these things are
revealed in the Gospel, which is very ancient, good reason they
should cleave to Christ, and be carried after no other way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

cannot but break out into his praise. Indeed, the common sort
that have those things but in their brain onely, and never had the
feeling of the one or of the other, they can speak of these things but
faintly, and from the teeth outward, and not from the heart as others;
but for any to boast of great matters done for them, and yet shew
no whit that they be ravished with love to God, neither breaking
out into his praises in words, nor shewing it in their lives, they do
certainly lye and deceive their own souls,<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 10.</note> for they that have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

                  <p>This condemneth as well the Blasphemy of Swearers,<note place="margin">Use.</note> as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent

much in respect of his Manhood, <hi>viz.</hi> that he took the lump where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
his humanity was framed, which was of the substance of the Virgin,
and first Sanctified and freed the same from all stain or blemish of
Original corruption, and actually United it from the first conception
thereof to the Godhead and second person, and so framed the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
of Christ of this substance, and infused into him a reasonable
soul; but especially in respect of his Godhead, by an unspeakable
communicating of the whole essence of the Father to him before all
worlds, which mystery though we cannot fully understand, we must
believe and adore.</p>
                  <p>Here he is stiled, <hi>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi> (as formerly

he sheweth himself more cleerly to us, and the way how we should

                  <p>If therefore we would obtain any thing at Gods hands,<note place="margin">Use.</note> we must not
come barely to the Father, as for forgiveness of sins, mercy or any thing
else, but with respect of his son Jesus Christ, by whom only he is and

If any great man would by money ransom,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 26.</note> or by his sword rescue

our Lord either way. Whence ariseth,</p>

he will never lose that which he hath so dearly bought, and taken such
pains with every way, to come into the world, to die for us, then
so to work, as we may come to the knowledge of it by his Word
and Spirit; Whereby Faith and Sanctification are wrought
in us.</p>

to be his loyal people; we must kiss the son, take up his yoke:
He hath paid full dearly for our service and love;<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> his we are, being
now no more our own. There are too too many that yet do not so
cleave to this Lord and his Word,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19.</note> but that they suffer other things,
other Lords to carry them away. Many could be content to have
Christ their Savior, but they will not have him their Lord and King,

would appoint their work themselves (as some coy servants) which
the Lord will not indure:<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> Well, let us bring our hearts to yield unto
him as our Lord, else we shall never have Salvation by him: There's
no refreshing by him, unless we take up his yoke, both must go
together; they that will not willingly stoop to him, he will be
their Lord and King in despight of them, and that to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>

whom Christ will save.</p>

                     <hi>Which according to his abundant mercy, &amp;c.]</hi> Now we are to observe,
1. The benefit bestowed for which he blessed God, namely, For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
us again unto a lively hope. 2. The moving cause, His mercy,

Jesus Christ from the dead; of which as they lie in order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hath begotten us again unto a lively hope]</hi> This is the benefit,<note place="margin">What means here by hope.</note> God
hath begot them again to the hope of Salvation, for so he means;
for by hope is not strictly meant that grace of hope which proceeds
from Faith, which is that whereby we wait patiently for that which
by Faith we believe, but its here meant of both faith and hope, even

                  <p>Whence note, That</p>

or by our first begetting; no, by nature we are the children of wrath,
enemies to God, dead in sins and trespasses, having no hope, and
without God in the world:<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> Nay, to have Faith and hope of Salvation,
is the onely work of God, as our Savior unto <hi>Peter</hi> upon his confession

titles given unto Faith shew as much,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note> as precious Faith, the Faith of
Gods elect,<note place="margin">Iude 20.</note> most holy Faith; have we any such thing in our selves?</p>
                  <p>The means whereby he works this Faith,<note place="margin">The means whereby God works Faith.</note> are, 1. The outward
Ministery of the Word. 2. The inward working of Gods Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
us by the Law;<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> then working it by the promises of the Gospel:
Father,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 13.</note> Son, and Holy Ghost work Faith.</p>
                  <p>God that brings light out of darkness made all of nothing,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 23.</note> and
raiseth up the dead to life, he only works Faith in us, and puts life into
these dead hearts of ours; its a great work of God that we can do
nothing toward it. To be humbled truly in the sight of our sins, is a
great work hardly brought to pass; yet this no part of Faith, but a
preparation: Then when we see them, its a great work of God that
we are not swallowed up of desperation, but that God upholds and
works by the Gospel longing after mercy, and so by degrees gives
power to apply it; many that long seek and cannot lay hold, or
having, yet quickly let go, finde faith a great work of God.</p>
                  <p>What shall we say then to the hope thats so common in the
world,<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> almost at every hand? Go through a Parish, and you shall
finde few but hope to do well, to be saved, making no doubt of it,
having no fears, asking no questions about it; yea, thank God they
have been of this perswasion ever since they can remember. Surely
this is but a false hope, a presumptuous conceit of their own heads,
without ground or bottom in Gods word, an illusion wherewith
the Devil seeks to undo them, getting them to bear themselves fair
in hand, that they might not be troubled till wrath overtake them
without help; yea, it may appear they are not begotten again to it,
for being asked, how long it hath been thus with them; they thank
God they have ever been of a good belief: and they have no ground
for it, but because God's a merciful God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not considering that
God is as Just as Merciful, and that his justice must first be satisfied,
ere he can shew any mercy. Besides, they cannot say it hath been
wrought, as God worketh Faith in his, <hi>viz.</hi> First, he humbles and
brings to the Gates of Hell, and then lifts up; this is not with them:
They also cannot say nor remember when it was wrought, nor how
they came by it, nor that it hath been otherwise with them at any time.
Besides,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note> true Faith purifieth the heart, and he that hath it purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as he is pure,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 3.</note> which is not in them, but they abide in their sins;
at least in the love of some, and have no Faith for outward things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65522:26"/>
but use unconscionable shifts:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> Therefore whereas true hope makes
not ashamed, but in the needful time and great day will make men
lift up their heads with joy; this will be like <hi>Aegypt,</hi> a deceitful and
broken Reed, to lay them under feet that do trust to it: Contrarily,
know we that Faith and Hope are not so easily gotten; they must
be wrought from Heaven, herein both Father, Son and Holy Ghost
must joyn: therefore wofully do they deceive themselves, that trust
to any blinde conceit in stead of the true work of God; as they do
desperately that put off Conversion and Faith till the latter end, as if
they had them at command; we must in time labor for this true work
of grace.</p>
                  <p>But if any can prove themselves begotten truly to this hope,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> they
have great cause of thanksgiving, whereinto the Apostle here breaks
out; Oh what a thing is it, not only to give his only Son to the death
for us, but to reveal it to us in his word, and thereby to assure us that
we have our part in the same, and we poor sinners may come to know
our sins forgiven, and that we shall be saved: Oh unspeakable favor I
What is like this? Or what can make a man miserable that hath this?
prize we this as a Jewel, nourish we it by all good means, especially by
keeping a good Conscience; rejoyce in it, as being of more worth then
all the world: let not a few wants or afflictions daunt us, or take away
this joy. It's a fault in Christians that they will be heavy if they want
something they would have: Oh! Is it not enough that God loves thee?
Again, a little cross casts us down and quells us, as if we had nothing
to comfort us; Oh, no earthly thing should daunt us, while we know
this: He that said, I could be content to lie as a fire-block in Hell till
the day of Judgement, so I might be sure to be saved then, would
have been glad of assurance in this life though with many crosses.</p>
                  <p>If any have not yet this hope,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> let them give no rest to themselves

it is opposed against all other vain hopes of the world, in outward
and transitory things, which yield no sound contentment to them that
have their part deepest in them. Herein also from the forged hope of
Salvation, that the world fain to themselves, which also hath no life

as through this the Martyrs endured the fire; <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Three

his mercy to them that repent; yea hereby we shall be fit to every good

                     <hi>I will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge mine
heart,</hi> namely, by the perswasion of thy love, and by thy Spirit and
the hope of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Its a fault in Christians,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that they be no more cheerful in this hope,
but lumpish and soon daunted in afflictions; a fault I say, that we are no

                  <p>Let every one then labor for it; till this we are not alive, our soul
never prospers, nor sees good day: This, even this, is the beginning
of life, and the first step to eternal life. Would any man live, and be

being daunted in adversity, persecution, death at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
let him by all means get this: Without this, mens hopes
are vain; their stout courage will fail them in those times when God
shall frown. Its Faith onely, which will carry a man through all things:
Hereby he shall have a heart to serve God, yea, both do and suffer the
greatest things for him and his sake.</p>

good, nay, when his utter enemies? why also hath he called us? Did
we, or could we do any thing before our calling to deserve it? We

infinite.</p>
                  <p>Was it a small matter that moved God to chuse thee to Salvation,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

What, Not his Servant, nor his Friend, but his Son, his only begotten
Son, the wisdom of the Father, the Image of the invisible God, the
engraven form of his Person, to stoop so low as to become man! nay
in that base estate to be despised of men, to be hated, spitted upon,
mockt, shamefully Crucified, and he that knew no sin, to stand in
the stead of most vile sinners, and so to be dealt with, and that for us
no friends, but enemies; no good persons, but vile and wretched ones?
Was a little love enough to bring this to pass?<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> Oh no, but a love
without measure, without example, never such another, even that
any Father gave his only begotten Son to save traitors and enemies.</p>
                  <p>It was wonder that the Father did not rather suffer all mankinde to
perish,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> then to give his only most blessed Son to suffer the least of
these indignites. And it was no small love of Iesus Christ that moved
him to leave the glory of the Father, and stoop to the estate of a man,
and all his infirmities save sin, and to endure all these tortures of
men, and his Fathers wrath especially? It was no small love that
made him give us his heart-blood; when he shed a few tears for <hi>Lazarus,</hi>

to shew us the nature of it, being also described by sundry properties,
under divers-phrases, as if no words could sufficiently express the
same. Those shew the perpetuity and purity thereof, as also how we
shall come by it; its reserved for us, but where? in Heaven, where
its out of danger: but how shall we come to it being here on earth
among many dangers? We are kept for it, and that by a mighty hand,

                     <hi>An inheritance]</hi> Therefore no purchase, no wages of a servant, but
an inheritance given by a Father to his son, not (such as many heirs
have) entailed, or as any natural son, which hath it by a kinde of
right after his father,<note place="margin">See Act. 20. 32</note> but an inheritance of Adopted children;<note place="margin">Luke 12. 32.</note> taken
in as the childe of a Traytor,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> nay a Traytor himself, and so made
heirs, then which what can be freer? This is said to be given, and whats
freer then gift?</p>
                  <p>This serves to confute not onely the gross Opinion of Papists,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
that we, God setting us forward, and helping us, can do such
things as whereby we can merit Heaven and Salvation; but that which
is more nice, is of those which say, that we have no good of our selves,
but that its wrought in us by God alone, yet now look for Salvation
by their Holiness and Sanctification; No, God forbid, for our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
being imperfect, God might justly condemn us for it, and
count our works a polluting of his grace;<note place="margin">Psal 146. 2.</note> therefore <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>No
flesh</hi> (before nor after grace) <hi>can be justified in thy sight;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> not onely by
nothing of our own,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> but by nothing that God worketh in us. What
differ these men from the proud Pharisee, he attributed his holiness not
to himself, but to God, and thankt him for it; but he thought this
would merit (that he was not so and so as others) and challenge some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at the hand of God, and therefore was rejected. True it is,
God not onely disproveth not, but liketh and accepteth of our works,
though unperfect, yea crowns and rewards his own grace in us; yet
not for the worthiness of the work, but for the persons sake that is in
his favor by Jesus Christ, whose perfect righteousness is imputed, to
make a supply of our imperfections and wants.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore it is an inheritance every way free, bestowed upon
us onely by right of Adoption in Jesus Christ, which by his grace he
hath called us unto; let us so acknowledge it to the glory of God,
and like Adopted children, love our Father, fear him, be zealous for
his glory, and take his part.</p>

us, it abides firm for ever, it cannot be moved. All earthly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
are subject to decay, liable to a thousand perils, alterations
and troubles, they may be taken from us, and we from them by
death. How were the Canaanites put out, and the Israelites succeeded in
their places? How did the Chaldeans displace them, as themselves were
by the Medes and Persians? These things below are the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,
uncertain riches, a treasure which moth and canker corrupt, and
whereto theeves may break in and steal, whereof also civil or foraign
Wars might quickly deprive us; neither are the smallest inheritances

There's nothing in this world but welks; the older we grow, the more

ready to drop down, or are quite consumed: Kingdoms also fade and

of a childe of God, covered with Christs Righteousness,
heir apparent to such a Kingdom, endued with the Spirit of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and who he were that is one of them, he would fall down at
his feet, and kiss the ground he trod on, and cry out, Blessed be the
day that ever thou wert born; but twice blessed the day wherein thou
shalt die, for then thou shalt be blessed, and that eternally: but this

how can they take notice of us?</p>
                  <p>This should stir up them that have attained hereunto,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> to be highly

Kings Sons must not carry themselves like base persons; so
neither must we,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note> but have our conversation in Heaven, seeking for
those things that are above, and esteeming of this world as vain; so
using it, as that thereby we may be furthered to our true inheritance, not
hindred; we must long to be at it: How do heirs under age, long to
be of age to come to their Lands? so should we (here as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
age) long to come to our Inheritance; as they that be long tossed
on the Sea, long to come to the Haven, and Pilgrims to be at their
own Country, and Prisoners to be at liberty; so should we desire to
be dissolved, that we enjoy Heaven, our Haven, our Countrey, the
onely place of freedom. A wonderful fault in Christians, that so
little think of it, take so little pleasure therein, are no more thankful
for the same; seek after earthly things too eagerly, and do not so much
aim after this: Oh what great unthankfulness is this! to be called to
such an Inheritance, and so little to think thereof, so little to long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it? Oh how we linger here below! if God should not drive us

have no Inheritance here, not one foot; yet if we have assurance of

But few do thus, because this Pearl is hid from carnal men,
they do not see it, and many among us will not see it, though it be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to us: But O woful and miserable world, he that would look
upon most men, might think there were no such inheritance: How do
some spend all their time in pleasure, and never look after any thing
else? How do most men rake after the world, night and day (Sabbath
and all) by right and wrong, hook and crook, and suffer no stone
unrolled for this pelf and trash of the world, that never set their hearts
once to enquire after any other inheritance for time to come, as if
Heaven were here: poor beasts, they might as well go on all four:
Oh base, that men should spend their time, their thoughts, their pains,
and all, for that which may be lost ere morning, and no whit for
that which will last for ever: Thus with <hi>Judas,</hi> most sell Christ for
Thirty pieces; with <hi>Esau,</hi> their Birthright for a mess of Pottage;
and with the Gadarens, prefer their hogs before Christ; others that
seem not altogether eaten up of the world, or so prophane, will
talk of this inheritance, but how do they hold it? by every blinde
conceit; they that cannot even by learned Counsel make sure enough
their Earthly inheritance, can of their own heads make sure their
Heavenly: Nay, the world if they see any take pains in Hearing,
Reading, Praying, and the like, wonder at them, count them fools,
say, they will beggar themselves, I wonder what they mean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Dost thou wonder? They desire to attain an heavenly inheritance, not
easily attained: They may rather wonder to see thee so earnest for this
trash, which thou must leave thou canst not tell how soon, and have no
care for the time to com, which is for ever; let such leave off seeking for
the body,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 19.</note> and now care for the soul, <hi>Laying up in store a good foundation

that thou art one of them to whom God hath promised mercy, and
for whom Christ dyed: To this end, examine thy Faith by its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted

                  <p>If it be an undefiled inheritance,<note place="margin">Use 6.</note> let every one therefore labor to
wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and by the Spirit of
Sanctification, else can we never come there; none but such are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Gods presence: what an impudent sawciness then is it in a
number that wallow in the filthy mire of their sins, and yet hope to
go to Heaven as well as the best? Are swine, and such filthy cattel
used to be brought into Kings Presence-Chambers? No, thou must
be washed ere thou come here, and that so, as all the water in the sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wash thee: If such as thou go to Heaven, then who go to Hell? If
you will say Turks &amp; Pagans, then look into the Parable of the Sower,
three sorts of hearers perish; you know and do not, they know not the
will of God: Dost thou think that thou canst go on in thy lewdness,
and step out of thy filthy life into Heaven? No, then had all Gods
servants lost a great deal of labor: We read of one, and but of one,
that made any short cut, namely the thief upon the Cross; labor
thou therefore in time to be washed, in time for Sanctification, and
hereafter (as heretofore thou hast still done) put not off from day to
day: But the Apostle contents not himself with the foregoing descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
he yet adds more touching the same; what then? We notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
must learn to be wise according to sobriety; and that we
(forgetting our weak understanding) mount not up to search more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
into Gods mysteries then he hath revealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest the glory thereof
dazle and confound us: We are ready, &amp; have a tickling desire to know
further then God hath revealed, which breeds rather jangling then
godly edifying: It may be enough for us to know that this inheritance
and happiness is such, as that when all that mens tongues can speak is
uttered, yet it is nothing to the excellency of it: So laying aside all
curious questions about it, let us rather imploy our pains and study to

and thought Christ should come and deliver them from the <hi>Romans:</hi>
See it in the two sons of <hi>Zebedeus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 21.</note> yea after three years teaching of
Christ,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 6.</note> after his death and resurrection, they were not free of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit:
our Savior used to call their mind from this to heaven, <hi>Can ye drink
of the cup that I drink of,</hi> saith he; and, <hi>I came to serve, and not to be served.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> draws them to look for their glory in Heaven; we must not
therefore look for an happy estate here below but in Heaven: Here the
Cross, there the Crown; here the Battel, there the Victory; The
Crown of Thorns here, the Crown of Glory hereafter; many
would follow Christ and the Gospel, if there came any preferment by
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 19, 20.</note> that now do not; so would the yong rich man: But Gods

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65522:31"/>
from hope to obtain this eternal inheritance, that we cannot keep these
earthly ones which we have: He answered, this is safely reserved for us,
and is out of danger to be lost; and though they lost their earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances,
they were but uncertain and transitory things, whereof
God never promised that they should be other; but this is eternal,
whereof they shall be most sure:<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34.</note> For, hath the Father prepared this

miss it? God forbid, the Spirit of truth cannot deceive us; shall
Christ lose his death? Oh no, its reserved for us in Heaven, where
no Devil can come, nor wicked men to take it from us.</p>
                  <p>Let this be a comfor to all the faithful servants of God that are
justified and sanctified,<note place="margin">Use.</note> to sweeten all their afflictions here below,
that they may be as sure of Heaven in the end without fail, as if
they had it already: Many children lose their temporal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
for want of good Gardians and Keepers, they are often wasted
and gone ere they come to years, or are suffered to be recovered from
them by some others; but the Lord is a faithful keeper, we are
yet under age; when we shall come to age and dye, the Father
that kept it for us, will bestow it on us; Christ Jesus our head
and elder brother, he hath taken possession of it for us, and tells
us, that where he is, there shall we be. But if we say, we
have many ill willers, there can none come into Heaven, but our
Friends: The Devil our deadliest adversary, he comes not there,
though he did into the earthly Paradise: And for the wicked, though
they hare Gods children, so as they could wish, that as they take away
their earthly Inheritances, so they should never be happy, if they could
help it; its past their power to deprive them hereof; they shall go to
Heaven do what they can, yea oftentimes they help them sooner thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then otherwise they should be (though no thank to them) and
at the day of Judgement, to the increase of their torment, the godly
shall be taken up in their sight to Heaven, when themselves shall be
thrust into that place of utter darkness, to be tormented with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his Angels for ever and ever: Hereof we have need to be
throughly perswaded, else when great afflictions come, they will be
ready to overwhelm us, as it did almost befal both <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
Oh the afflictions of this present time are not worthy the glory that

by these outward things no man can conclude whether he be loved or

of truth,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> then it is not; <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they

                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore we finde the fruits of the Spirit, an hatred of all sin, an
unfeigned care to please God in all things, love to Gods Word and his
people, grieve that we can serve God no better, strive after more power,

injurious to the Spirit of God, if we did not believe this inheritance

and such like, with his continued practises (there recorded) to hinder
our Salvation, evidence the same: Accordingly doth he daily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor

all your former life? you have ever been counted an honest man, do
not now discredit your self: and to rich men, will you go among
them, a company of poor despised people? it will be no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
unto you. 3. The profits and pleasures thereof, whereby most
men are beguiled and enchanted: By profits some are kept from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
religion altogether, their Oxen and Farms keep them off, they
have no leasure; yea, some that have heard with joy, and (with <hi>Demas</hi>)

by Faith we believe eternal life, by Hope we patiently wait for it: And
as there could be no Hope, if there were not Faith before, so Hope doth
greatly help Faith; it keeps it that it makes not too much haste,
nor break off in the mid way; for God oftentimes after his promises
deferreth to perform them (so that the wicked also come to say,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Where
is the promise of his coming</hi>) yea ere he come, he hides his face, and seems
as if he would not fulfil the same; now therefore here doth Hope her
Office, and steps in, and sustains Faith very well, so that a Christian
must necessarily have both to go along with him: But I see no reason
to alter the Apostles words, but to take Faith properly for the grace
of true Faith and believing: though this is true, that Hope helps well
on, but he speaks of Faith, which includeth Hope as a necessary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
                  <p>But how doth faith bring us to Salvation?<note place="margin">How Faith bringeth us to Salvation.</note> It is said by the
Apostle <hi>Paul, By grace ye are saved through Faith:</hi> Now as it first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
Christ and Salvation,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note> so it holds this hold, and continues
our comfort, and still carries us on in the service of God, and an holy
life: This assurance of eternal life makes us contemn profits,
offered to pull us from a good conscience,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 24.</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> did <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65522:34"/>
and pleasures of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> so to despise the Cross, and overcome
troubles that would draw us therefrom, as the holy Martyrs did from
time to time.</p>
                  <p>Also Faith apprehending the promise of God for our upholding to
the end, rests upon the goodness of God, which is constant, and his
power, which is infinite: Therefore when any shall perswade us we shall
never hold out, we shall be forsaken, Faith then puts up head, and
saith nay to it, because God hath promised to keep us unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>The wicked come and say, where is now thy God, by reason of
troubles which befal the Godly; so the Devil and their own unbelief
assaults them,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 5. 11.</note> now Faith helps and saith, <hi>Why art thou cast down,
why art thou disquieted, trust yet in God, he is my present help and my God:</hi>
and,<note place="margin">Psal. 23. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no ill:</hi> and,
<hi>the name of the Lord is a strong Tower;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 18. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the Righteous runneth to it, and is

                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 4.</note> This is the Victory that overcometh the world, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the shield,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>By which we quench the fiery darts of the Devil:</hi> For
this purpose our Saviour when he prayed that <hi>Peter</hi> might hold out,
prayed that his Faith might not fail:<note place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> If that fail we are gone, if it hold,
we shall be too hard for all the world; so long as our Faith holds, all
the world, with all the Engines it hath to destroy us, can never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
us: Contrarily, without Faith we can neither begin nor stand
against any temptation or danger.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth men to labor for this true Faith,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> without it they may
fall to any thing, as the second and third sort of ground mentioned by
our Savior in the parable; most people content themselves in being
professors, but labor not for this grace of Faith, and therefore do
they fall away, and never come to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>It teacheth also the Godly,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> still to say with the Apostle, <hi>Lord
increase our Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 17. 5.</note> using all other means to that purpose: A little
Faith will go but a little way; the least, if true, shall get to Heaven,
but with much ado, as a poor tattered Vessel may get to shoar,
especially if there come no storms,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but if there do, its in great
danger, and very hardly attains unto it: but as a strong Vessel comes
safely, though it have strong tempests; so a strong Faith, though it
be strongly assaulted, and put to it (as oft it is) both in life, and in the
end of life, yet it conquers.</p>
                  <p>We have had none but calm times hitherto, but what we may
have we know not, whether common trials, or particular ones, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with pain, grief, vexation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Labor therefore for good

                  <p>He knew they rejoyced in the assurance of their happiness, he knew

with his sword drawn, before his face an hissing Serpent ready to

                  <p>1. We should not dream all of peace and prosperity here,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but of
trouble also; accordingly looking for it one after another; if God
spare us, it is because of our weakness, but look we not long to be
spared, but in the mean time gather strength; if we expect troubles,
they prove the weaker; if they come on us unlooked for, they daunt us
the more. In our prosperity we must think often hereof, thus reasoning
with our selves, Well, now I am in health, how shall I do when long
and strong sickness shall lie upon me? now I have wealth, what shall
I do if all be taken away. and I be put to a poor condition? now I am in
mine own Countrey, House and Land, what should I do if I were
imprisoned or banished among them I know not? This will partly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65522:37"/>
make us use our present prosperity more soberly, and also we shall be
fitter to meet with adversity when it comes: if it come not, its labor
well lost; if it come, well bestowed.</p>
                  <p>2. We should bear them patiently,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> seeing not onely we must needs
undergo them, but they are so many ways for our good: We must
not then be dismaid at them, seeing even Gods dearest children have
undergone them, they have been their lot: But how loath are we to
think of troubles till they come? They will come time enough we
say, but never the sooner for thinking on them, it may be the longer,
and to be sure the lighter.</p>
                  <p>3. We must be thankful for them,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> as we would be to one that
tames our wilde Horses or Steers, or to a Physician for purging our
superfluous humors. Its no matter, so as our souls gain, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
we smart: Shall we thank and reward the Physician for very
untoothsom Phisick, and which makes us sick at the heart, and shall
we be unthankful unto God for healing our souls, what means so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he useth?</p>
                  <p>4. We must neither think them the better that are without affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note>
nor them the worse that are afflicted; the latter may be happy,
as the former miserable.</p>
                  <p>5. We must make a right use of afflictions,<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> whensoever they come

Temptations; they serve to try what is in us, not but that God
knoweth what is in us already (he knoweth both the heart and
reins) but that our selves and others may attain this knowledge. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we overprize, sometimes we underprize our selves: But they
sometimes bewray hidden grace; as who would have thought of so
much Faith in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Patience in <hi>Job,</hi> Meekness in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
if they had not been tryed? Sometimes also hidden corruptions;
for who could have thought of so much weakness in <hi>Peter,</hi> and the
rest of the Apostles, if they had not been tryed? So what grace hath
appeared in some, as weakness and impatience in others in the time of
affliction, neither of which before could have been believed?</p>
                  <p>Are afflictions tryals? then</p>
                  <p>1. Labor we for such soundness of grace,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that when afflictions
shall come, they may finde us pure gold and wheat, and not cast us
out for chaff and dross.</p>
                  <p>2. Do we consider that God now tryes us by them,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and so look we
to our selves, observing what they discover, if it be more grace then we
thought, that we may thank God; if more corruption, be truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
laboring for more grace: yea, whatsoever shall be discovered,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65522:38"/>
we are to thank God, as which will tend to our good. There's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no cause why we should be impatient in troubles, for they try us;
and who would be unwilling to be tryed? Its a sign he meant not
well that would not have his gold put to the Touchstone; or he that
proffering Land to be sold, would not have his Writings perused.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In heaviness]</hi> Can heaviness and rejoycing stand together?<note place="margin">Here on earth heaviness and rejoycing may stand together.</note> 
                     <hi>A.</hi> They
can in divers respects and degrees: In Heaven where our joy shall be
in such an high degree and great measure, we cannot mourn, nor the
wicked in Hell rejoyce; but here on Earth we may: The wicked be
merry, because they have their will, yet inwardly they are wounded
in their consciences, for fear of that which may come after; So the
godly are joyful in the assurance of Gods favor and Heaven, and yet
heavy thorugh troubles which here lie upon them: As a sick man
hearing glad tidings may rejoyce, and yet be heavy for his pain; a
Father also may be heavy for his childes death, and yet rejoyce for
his happy end and godly departure:<note place="margin">Ezra 3. 12, 13.</note> Amongst the Israelites upon the
rebuilding of the Temple, some wept and others rejoyced; both
might have been (and haply were) even in some one.</p>
                  <p>Gods servants as by their Faith they are not freed from afflictions,
so neither from heaviness,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note> but have sence of their miseries, which are
grievous to them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 10.</note> as Poverty,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 20.</note> Sickness, Imprisonment, and the like;

saying, yea crying out, <hi>My soul is heavy unto the death:</hi> Faith
makes us not blocks, neither takes away sense, onely moderates our
grief. The Martyrs had pain, but Faith prevailed and enabled them
to bear it: Where there's no pain, there can be no patience; nothing
due to blockishness, else were frantique persons worthy commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which feel nothing: Faith moderates our grief, makes us wait
upon God, speak good of him, using no unlawful means when the
cross is upon us.</p>
                  <p>1. This is contrary to that blockishness of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that profess to

                  <p>3. This may comfort the servants of God when they are pinchad

Though they may be thought impatient, they are not; God knows we
be not iron, as long as Faith can moderate; and we being heavy and
pincht to the heart with pain, are yet upholden with the joy of eternal
salvation,<note place="margin">Iob 13. 15.</note> and can say with <hi>Job, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him,</hi>

                     <q>That the trial of your Faith being much more precious then of
Gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
praise, and honor, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.</q>
                  </head>
                  <p>HEre also he qualifieth their troubles from the end of them:<note place="margin">A quilificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their troubles.</note> They
come not for our hurt, but for our good; Thereby we are no
more hurt, then Wheat is by threshing, or Gold by fining, they come
for the trial of our Faith, and tried Faith, is better then any tried
Gold; For that will perish, and be lost, but this will abide, and come
forth to our honor and praise, at the great appearing of Jesus Christ: It
may be conceived, as if he had said, The affliction and persecution which
you now suffer, bear patiently, as serving for the trial of your Faith,
which (how painful soever the tryal thereof may seem for the present)
will be found to your praise at the great day. This being so, who
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65522:39"/>
should not willingly undergo them? If we take pains and toil our
selves to get riches, and so long as we get them, forget our toil;
should we not much more be concent to endure some trouble, that our
souls may get the true riches?</p>
                  <p>Now particularly for the trial of our Faith afflictions come, 1. To
try whether we have any at all. 2. Whether it be so much as we take it
to be. 3. To purge and refine that which we have.</p>
                  <p>1. To try whether we have any Faith;<note place="margin">Affliction try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether we have Faith.</note> as God doth it sometimes
by false teachers and heresies, so doth he also by afflictions, wherein
many that have not received the love of the truth have been carried
away;<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 3. 2.</note> whereas others,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 3.</note> though haply of less parts, but more sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note>
have resisted and stood to the truth; for there be false Faiths,
and our hearts are deceitful, and the Devil is subtile to make as believe
we have the right, when we have nothing less. Affliction will prove
this,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 16.</note> as in those whom our Savior termeth the stony ground, They
went far, yea farther then most in most congregations go, yet had
they not that which would serve to Salvation; affliction discovered
what they were, that they were not such as before they were taken to
be. The Israelites were proved in the wilderness, whose troubles
manifested their unbelief;<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 19.</note> for which they were both plagued in the
wilderness, and shut out of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Many a one thinks himself a tall
man, till he comes into the field with his adversary, where he proves
himself a rank coward; many think they can do great matters till they
come to it: A Mariner is not tried till a storm, nor a friend till adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
he that then stick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to one, is a friend indeed: So afflictions have
discovered many that have thought but too well of themselves: Many
talk that they believe in God, and put all their trust in him, yet when
they are visited with sickness, losses, and the like, they run to witches
and wizards for help, or in poverty, steal, lye, dissemble, or use any
other unlawful courses to help themselves: Many also that in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
profess the Gospel very forwardly, when trouble comes fall
quite away, are not onely shaken as <hi>Peter,</hi> or a good man may be on the
sudden, or for a while, but fall quite away, when many poor souls,
it may be of less gifts, have stood out and suffered.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that God will try us by troubles,<note place="margin">Use.</note> we should labor to
have true Faith against troubles come,<note place="margin">How we may1 try our Faith.</note> that we prove not dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us try the Faith which we think we have by the touchstone of
Gods Word,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1. 11.</note> if it will abide that, then will it endure the furnace of
affliction.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 6, 7.</note> It may be tried, 1. By the maner of Gods working it, even
through humiliation. 2. By such companions as go with Faith, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, as peace, joy, and the like; so if we love God most dearly
(as they that have much forgiven,<note place="margin">Luke 7. 47.</note> love much) if we love his Saints
and people most heartily,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 8.</note> if we wonder at and admire his unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercy to us,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 14.</note> passing by so many thousands of others,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 22.</note> with one
hearts and mouths enlarged,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 1.</note> praising him secretly and openly for the
same;<note place="margin">1 Thes 5. 14.</note> if we pity, comfort and strengthen others, if we long to go
hence where we are absent from God, and to be with him; if we
mourn for our sins committed against him,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 6.</note> who was kinde to us when
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65522:39"/>
we wandred from him,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 18, 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and have an hatred of all evil, with an unfeigned
care hereafter in all things to please him,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> they are infallible tokens
of a sound Faith: Its needful that we should thus try our Faith, as
being of that absolute necessity, that by it Christ and Salvation are
made ours, without it, no hope of either. In so weighty a thing
we had not need to venture without tryal, without it no person or
work is pleasing to God, and its the foundation of a good life, and all
true comfort therein.</p>
                  <p>2. To try whether our Faith be as much as we take it to be,<note place="margin">Affliction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether our Faith be more or lesse then we take it.</note> or more;
this affliction will discover: sometimes we think we have more then
we have, as <hi>Peter,</hi> who notwithstanding his bold and confident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
to our Savior Christ, shamefully upon the trial denied him.
Contrarily, others think they have little Faith, that upon the trial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
more, and shines gloriously, as <hi>Jobs</hi> and <hi>Davids.</hi> Who also could
have believed that there had been so much in many poor Martyrs, if
they had not come to the field and encountred with Tyrants, and
their Torments? as who would imagine such sweetness in Spices,
till bruised?</p>
                  <p>We should not be against such afflictions as are sent for this end;<note place="margin">Use.</note>
for whats more comfortable then to know we have more Faith then
we knew of? and what more necessary, then to know that our Faith
is weaker then we imagined, that so we may labor to have it strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
If it appear weaker, then be we humbled, and distrusting our
selves, let us ever fly to God for more grace and strength against
temptations, so will God give us as much as shall stand with his glory:
but if we trust to our selves, and be slack in seeking to God, then are
we like to bewray our own weakness.</p>
                  <p>3. To purge and purifie that true Faith which we have,<note place="margin">Affliction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to purifie and encrease Faith.</note> and encrease
the same; this also is most necessary: for though a small Faith, being
true, will save us, yet the more and purer it is, the better it will carry
us to Heaven; and though by a weak Faith and mingled with corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we shall see the face of God, and his loving countenance, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the cleerer and brighter it is, the more certainly &amp; comfortably shall we
see him: As they that have weak eyes, yet see so as they are directed
to their ways end,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> who if they had cleerer, would be there sooner, and
with less danger.</p>
                  <p>As therefore its requisite to have those gross humors purged th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
dim the sight, so those, corruptions that dim the eye of our Faith.
Beside, such is our corrupt nature, that much dross and corruption is
mingled with the grace of God in us; so as except it be subdued by
continual affliction, it will wax wanton against God, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his grace in us.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Standing waters corrupt, and bodies not exercised,
are full of gross humors: So would it be with our souls, were we not
continually exercised with troubles; as the finest Wheat not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed,
will be musty with dust, the finest cloaths catch dust and moths, if not
continually brushed; the finest vessels take soil, if not continually
scoured: so our Faith not looked to, is quickly overgrown, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

with weeds, if the husbandman plucks them not out: As far, brush,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65522:40"/>
weeding-hook,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 67. 71.</note> wisp, fornace, are to these things, so afflictions to
the children of God. We are as an untamed heifer, if not held under
the yoke;<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 18.</note> God therefore purgeth, scoureth and weedeth us, that his
graces in us may shine in their perfect colours:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As the Vine-dresser
shreds his Vine, and cuts off much, which one would think were
against the Vine, yet makes it more fruitful, so doth the Lord deal by
afflictions with his servants, which are his Vine branches.</p>
                  <p>Though the outward man decay (by sickness, poverty, disgrace, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note>
and the like) yet is the inner man (Faith, Hope, Comfort, &amp;c.)
increased daily; for Faith the more its cut, the more it grows; the
more its trodden on, the thicker it comes up. And by afflictions there's
purged away a great deal of pride, self-love, worldliness, hypocrisie,
and the like, which long peace gathers, whereof <hi>Jonah</hi> had experience
when he was cast into the Sea; those tame us also: A man that was
conceited against his neighbor for smal causes in prosperity, in sickness
and affliction will be glad to take every one by the hand; therefore
are the most afflicted, for the most part, fullest of Faith and Grace, and
purer then others; and a man is never better then when he is in, or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come out of affliction.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 16.</note> Hence it is, that we are willed to be thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
them,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 2. 12.</note> yea to account it exceeding joy when they come, those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
blessed that are so affected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being much much more precious, &amp;c.]</hi> He sets out tried Faith by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with the most precious mettal we have,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> even gold, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it by far before the same,<note place="margin">Faith more precious then gold.</note> which is elswhere termed also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and much more precious is it every way. 1. Gold comes
out of the earth,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> Faith from Heaven, whence every good and perfect
gift is. 2. Faith is more rare, termed therefore the Faith of Gods
elect,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note> whereas most, even of the most wicked, are not without gold.
3. Faith cannot be purchased with all the gold in the world. 4. Its hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gotten and hardly kept, and hath many and strong enemies, our own
nature, the world and the devil are all against Faith, but not so against
getting of gold. 5. It apprehends Salvation and life eternal, and so
is the instrument of our happiness; so is not gold, but the instrument
of many a mans damnation, by unconscionable getting, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
keeping the same, many cast away their souls. 6. It will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
a man with true comfort in his life,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 3.</note> carry him strongly through
troubles, and boldly through the gates of death. 7. Gold perisheth,
here canker and rust consume it; we may be taken from it, as it from
us, but Faith endureth till Christs appearing, to our full Redemption,
as the fruit thereof for ever.</p>
                  <p>The uses hereof are,</p>
                  <p>1. To them that want gold,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and yet have Faith, know that thou
art rich,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 5.</note> richer then he that hath thousands of gold, and hath not Faith;
thou hast enough, that hast Faith, it assures thee of eternal life, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
them to Christ, yea, hath the promises even of this life. Seest
thou a worldly rich man, and wouldst thou change states with him?
Oh but both would do well: Thou canst not tell if both would do so
with thee; besides, God divides his gifts, they that have much of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65522:40"/>
the one, have less or none of the other; therefore as long as we have
of the best kinde, let us think our selves well dealt with.</p>
                  <p>2. To the rich,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Rejoyce not that thou art rich, but that thou hast
Faith: Again, think all your pains to become you well, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
in getting this precious Faith. If any should say, What you?
such wealthy men; its a disgrace to you to toil so in hearing Sermons,
which few do but mean persons; do not these exclude themselves
with their own mouthes? But do not rich men travel to <hi>London,</hi> and
to Markets and Fairs to enrich themselves, and take great pains, and
is it a shame then or a disgrace for them to travel for that which is
much more precious then gold? Hereat if any wonder, tell them,
You seek that which is more precious then fined gold; and that you
are so far from thinking your selves too good for this, that you highly
thank God for vouchsafeng you this favor: yea, that you are so far
from thinking that you credit the Gospel, and its beholding to you,
that you confess freely, that its your credit; and that if you have any
thing in you worth the commendation, you may thank the Gospel for
it: for, as for wealth it commends not a man, even reprobates are not
without it.</p>
                  <p>3. To them that have not Faith,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> poor souls, labor after it, that you
may be made inwardly rich; seek for it in the means appointed, the
preaching of the Word. But O poor &amp; miserable creatures, that regard
it not for the most part, but think their poverty here shall serve for all;
but worse in the highest degree remaineth behinde, if not prevented
in time, could any look into your souls, they might perceive them more
empty of grace, then the poorest houses are of provision.</p>
                  <p>4. To rich men that have toiled for gold,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> seek this that is so much
better: Many toil by Sea and land, and undergo no small perils to
get gold, and to wax mighty, but as for Faith, they will scarce stir
over the threshold for it: But will your gold procure a pardon for
your sins? Alas, its no payment with God for any thing, especially
sin: Will it shelter when Death and Judgement comes? Alas no, it
bears no sway in the other world, see <hi>Job 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18, 19. Prov. 11. 4.
Zeph.</hi> 1. 18. No, it will not abate your pains in Hell one jot: O once
consider your folly, and labor for that whereby you may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
when you draw away, and your friends are thinking of a Coffin
to bestow you out of the house, and thereafter you may enjoy life
everlasting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May be found unto praise, and honor, and glory.]</hi> The farthest end of
our affliction that our Faith thereby tryed,<note place="margin">Faith will be crowned at the last day.</note> may come forth to our

                  <p>What an encouragement is this to them that have Faith,<note place="margin">Use</note> and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation

and make us please God, but will give us boldness also at the great

                     <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> yea, though our
Faith be tryed by afflictions and persecutions, yet we should rejoyce,
for they will turn to our glory: Our shame, reproach, infamy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
and troubles, will turn to our praise, and honor and glory
at that day; when we are reviled (by private persons) when persecuted
by publique Magistrates and false Witnesses coming against us, yet
we should not be troubled,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11, 12.</note> but rejoyce, <hi>For great shall our reward be in
heaven;</hi> our poverty shall be recompenced with great riches, our shame
with honor,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 28.</note> and if we be rejected of men, we shall be taken in of
God: Yet do not our afflictions or persecutions deserve any of this
honor, as the Papists would gather from hence, and from 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.
5, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> Alas, no; <hi>For the afflictions of this present time, are not worthy
to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us:</hi> God indeed will
crown his own graces in us, and hath promised to reward the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his servants with glory; and so he is become our debtor, not
by taking any thing of us, but by promising us all things: We should
therefore be comforted in all our sufferings, and oppose unto the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy
thereof, the glory and honor we shall then have, which is
infinitely greater: O who would not endure casting out by men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a token that we shall be honored of God, and taken in at that day.
Indeed if there were no day of Judgement, nor reward, we might be
sorry; but seeing there is, let us lift up our heads, and wait for that
day: As the wicked shall have a second course to mar all their mirth,
so contrarily the godly to swallow up their sorrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At the appearing of Jesus Christ.]</hi> Namely, to Judgement: True
it is (as we have heard) our souls enter into glory at death, but our
perfect happiness is not till the end of all;<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7.</note> besides, that which we
have at death is not seen but to our selves, whereas then it shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to all. We must be content to wait for our full Redemption till
then;<note place="margin">Christ will come on the last day to Iudge the world.</note> on that most solemn day shall we be honored by the Lord
himself: Then shall our Savior come to judge the quick and the dead;
and though he defer to gather his Elect, and be gone into Heaven, yet
he will come, and that in another fashion then he came first; namely,
in wonderful majesty, glory and power, which cannot but be a terror
to his enemies.</p>
                  <p>1. This must needs comfort all that have and do still embrace
Christ Jesus as their Savior and King,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> for he shall be their Judge, and
therefore shall it go well with them.</p>
                  <p>2. But wo to them that have despised him,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> where shall they appear?
Not to appear is impossible;<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 5.</note> for <hi>He numbreth the stars, and calleth

besides, we have nothing to give. To escape also is impossible, for

he filleth all places, and whether can he go, that hath this revenging
Judge over his head, Hell under his feet to swallow him, on each side
Angels and Devils to torment him, within a tormented Conscience,
and without all the world on fire? And to abide his wrath its intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;<note place="margin">Psal. 76. 7.</note>

                  <p>One thing more. The phrase here used seems to imply, that</p>

known, yea and that of those that have most hated, disgraced and
persecuted them, accounting them mad, and esteeming basely of them;
even before them, I say, they shall be honored of God: As it will
be a torment to the wicked to see Christ whom they have pierced to be
in such high dignity and power; so will it increase their torment to
see them whom they so basely esteemed of, as not worthy to live,
to be received into honor, and stand on Christs right hand, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
of whom they were so well conceited, cast out: But its just
with God, that they which willingly and of purpose have vexed and

S. <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 1, 10.</note> even that he might provoke them to go on
in well doing:<note place="margin">Whereat Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters should aym in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending their people.</note> And this must be the end of all good Ministers in the
commendation of their people, not of flattery (that were abominable,
and being men-pleasers, they could not be Christs servants) nor out
of a conceit that they have gone far enough, and now may stand at a
stay (that were sensless,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 10.</note> for that we have is nothing to that we might
have had, or should have, and want) but to be a spur to provoke
them to go on forward, it being a shame for them not to satisfie the
expectation of such as have a good opinion of them; and so must
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65522:42"/>
the people take such at any time, not being lifted up therewith, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humbled thereby; conceiving, that the Minister rather sheweth
what he would were in them, or should be in them, then what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in them; and that he would not have them stand at a stay, but
proceed and go on more and more.</p>
                  <p>Speak we particularly first of their faith, though last set down, as
without which there can be no true love.</p>
                  <p>They never saw Christ, yet they believed in him; they saw the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
speaking of him to come; they heard of him also by faithful
witnesses; the Apostles had preached of his person, birth, life, death,
resurrection and ascension, and that he came to save them that were
lost: This they believed, and so believed in him for salvation, though
they saw him not.</p>
                  <p>This shews the nature of true faith,<note place="margin">Through faith we believe even things above the reach of our reason.</note> namely, to believe things, not
onely that we see not, and are hidden from our sense, but such things as
are above the reach of our reason, and which we cannot comprehend.
So <hi>Abraham,</hi> when a son was promised by <hi>Sarah,</hi> stood not to scan
this by reason,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1, 3. and 17.</note> but believed it, and is accordingly commended for it;
So <hi>Joshua</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> compassing the walls of <hi>Jrricho:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 17.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both <hi>Zachariah</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> failed,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19, 20.</note> in that they doubted of Gods
Promise,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 30.</note> for that it was against reason:<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 18, 20.</note> Hence it is that our Savior
rebuked for his <hi>Thomas</hi> infidelity.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 12.</note> If all that <hi>Thomas</hi> had gone and
preached to,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 25, 29.</note> should have been of his minde, he would have made a
poor preaching; Christ must have come to the earth again, and here
tarried:<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 56.</note> No; Faith hath eyes, as well as the body; <hi>Abraham saw
Christs day,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>and rejoyced;</hi> and <hi>Moses endured, as he which saw him that
was invisible:</hi> Yea, it hath a more certain eye then the body, for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon that which is more constant then Heaven and Earth, even
Gods Word,<note place="margin">Iob 19. 25.</note> which shall endure when the others shall vanish away;
therefore is faith called a knowledge,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> not a guessing uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>Hereby we believe the Incarnation of Christ, the framing of his
body in the womb of the Virgin, she untouch'd of man; so the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Trinity, and the Resurrection, the Union of Christ and
Believers, the glorification of our bodies in the Kingdom of Heaven,
and the like; yea, we so believe them, that (as <hi>Moses</hi> was content to
part from the honor of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court for the Kingdom of Heaven,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note>
so) for the assurance we have of them, we are content to forego both
pleasures and profits, which we have eagerly followed after; yea, to
endure present pains and losses,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34. and 11. 35.</note> and that grievous ones, for the joys
to come, not seen, but believed, whereof we have store of Examples,
both in the Scriptures and Church Histories.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth Atheists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that reject all that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in their foolish and corrupt brain; but Religion is not a matter
of Reason, but of Faith: Wo were to us, if there were nothing for
us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> but that which we see with bodily eyes; the wicked were then
in better case.</p>
                  <p>2. It stirreth us up to try whether we have faith,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> or not; If we so
believe the things to come, as whatsoever would let us from the joys
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65522:42"/>
of Heaven, we avoid it, and would rather endure any thing, then be
deprived thereof, we are not without faith: The wicked will not do
so; they will provide for the present time, they will have their will,
will here take their ease, enjoy their unlawful profits and pleasures; as
for the time to come, they are ignorant of it, what it will be: If any
come after, so it is, but they will make sure work for the present; a
Bird in the hand, is worth two in the bush: Neither will they suffer
any thing for Religion, or the Gospel, or hope of Heaven; a sign they
want that grace of true faith: They have Carnal eyes to see these things
here below, but no Spiritual ones of faith to see the things to come,
and so give no glory to God:<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>But the just shall live by faith,</hi> and <hi>We
walk not by sight,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>but by faith;</hi> Thus must we do here for maintenance,
thus for deliverance out of dangers. As Historical believing the truth
of these things, puts a difference betwixt Atheists and common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
so the particular believing and applying these things, between
these and true Christians. The servants of God would not lose their
part in that which is to come, for all that is here present: They say,
the Bird in the bush is worth two of that in the hand. If the world
count themselves wise that can save themselves from danger, and Gods
servants fools for suffering,<note place="margin">See D. <hi>Taylor</hi> on Acts 10. page 296.</note> be it so; it shall one day appear who hath
made the best match: Oh, say they, we are sure of this, we have it in

will not change with you, <hi>for we know whom we have believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be so,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> then why may we not believe that Christs body is bodily in
the Sacrament, under the signs of Bread and Wine, though our sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
say otherwise, seeing our faith goeth beyond both.</p>
                  <p>Though faith believeth that which no sense nor reason can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
because God hath said it, yet it crosseth not our senses, and
the things which are daily subject to the same,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 27.</note> wherein there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty:<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 1.</note>
If we might give no credit to our senses, there would be no
end of conceits; therefore seeing all our senses say it is Bread and
Wine, we are to believe it to be no other.</p>

                     <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love]</hi> Now of the fruits of Faith, love
and joy; for its impossible for us to love him, unless by faith we be
assured of his love to us,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 19.</note> for <hi>we have not loved him, but he us first;</hi> so is it
not possible, but believing in him, we should love him, and his love
must constrain us, having done so wonderful things for us. Then</p>
                  <p>True love is the fruit of faith,<note place="margin">True love the fruit of faith.</note> and it cannot be sundred from love
to God, and our brethren for his sake: <hi>He that knoweth, and believeth

                  </p>
                  <p>1. This confutes the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which distinguish faith into formed
and unformed, and that this latter is sufficient to the salvation of the
people, Charity giving a form to it; but we must know that there's
no true faith without it.</p>
                  <p>1. It serves to confute that Slander wherewith they burthen,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> not
us, but the Doctrine of the Gospel; namely, <hi>That Justification by
faith onely, is a Doctrine of licentiousness:</hi> But while we establish faith,
we set up good works, as who teach that they cannot be sundred:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65522:43"/>
Though works have no place in our Justification, yet they are necessary
to our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>3. Perceive the force and power of faith;<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> faith made them love
Christ, though they had never seen him, as which told them of so
great things done for them by him, whereby they could not but be
exceedingly knit in love unto him, and be content to suffer for him.
Its an encrease of love, to love one we never saw; for sight moveth
much, and draweth the heart: but by faith we love that we never
saw; as we love many good Christians which we never saw, because
by faith we believe that they be members of Christ, and fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
with us: So we love Christ, because we believe what great things
he hath done for us, and that we shall see him one day in his glory,
when we also by him shall be set in possession thereof; so that if we
believe these things,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 1.</note> we cannot but love Christ, though we never saw
him:<note place="margin">How to try both our faith and love.</note> Faith is not idle, <hi>but worketh by love to God, and to our brethren;</hi>
and hereby we may try our faith, as our love, by the fruits thereof:
namely, 1. If we take care unfainedly to keep his Commandments
in one thing, as in another.<note place="margin">Psal. 97. 10.</note> 2. <hi>If we love the brethren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 15. and 15. 14. and 21. 15.</note> which are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, so as we dare not harm them; yea, love them, not
onely because they have his image restored in them, but are a part of
Christ,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 3.</note> as it were, and of our selves. 3. If we be content to suffer
for his sake, and will not be pluckt from him, but are vexed to see him
dishonored by any. 4. If we long for his coming, that so we may
be with him, and married to him, to whom we are already betrothed:
Its the Churches voyce (and should be ours in particular) <hi>Come Lord

                     <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 20.</note> If the husband be gone a long journey, his wife doth not much
love him, if she never desire his coming home. 5. If in the mean time
we desire to hear often of him,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and from him; as the wife that loves
her husband, will send or be often at the Carriers to hear of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and receive Letters from him: So must we frequent the Word
upon every occasion, where we may hear of him, and of his great
honor and glory, and of his providing us a place there, and of the
glory there, and how he would have us in the mean time to carry our
selves, taking heed of any other lover in his absence, which also doth
inform us, That <hi>his coming draweth nigh, and is at hand;</hi> Thus to
hear of him, and from him, as much and as often as we can, we should
be desirous. By this Touchstone we may thus try both our faith
and love.</p>

                  <p>The common people say, <hi>They believe in God, and trust in God;</hi> which

things done for them by Christ, and so great things prepared for

wrath for our sins is fearful,<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 14.</note> and cannot be endured (<hi>a wounded spirit
who can bear?</hi>) as may appear by the heavy cryes and complaints of
some of Gods servants in agony of conscience, O I am cast out of his

horror of the wicked, who feel it so intollerable, as that they
cannot bear it, as <hi>Judas,</hi> who went and hanged himself; for no man
seeing and feeling himself under the wrath of God, and no way to be
freed therefrom, but must needs wish he had never been, or now were
not,<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 7.</note> or were a Toad, or the vilest creature: so contrarily, they that
feel themselves freed from this,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 13.</note> and called to the hope of so great
glory, must needs rejoyce; as <hi>Joseph</hi> doubtless was a glad man,
when being delivered out of prison, he was advanced to honor.</p>
                  <p>The way hereunto is true Faith:<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Worldlings indeed think Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity

                  <p>In the midst of their mirth,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> the wicked have secret gripes; as thieves
condemned, though they drink and play at cards, yet to think that on

minde, or quiet to the conscience, or joy to the heart; for 1. We have
many sins, and therefore can merit nothing of God. 2. We know by
our selves, that even many of them are unto us unknown: who knows
the errors of his life?<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 12.</note> no man can say, he hath found out all his sins,
or the corruptions of his heart, so that he can say, now here be no
more. 3. Our best duties be mingled with much weakness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection;
so that though they may appear before men, and be well
accounted of and reverenced, yet when they come before God, then
they must hide themselves; as the Stars and Moon shew a goodly light
in the night; but when the Sun appears, they appear not. The Nazarets
vow was pleasing to God,<note place="margin">Numb. 6. 13.</note> yet the time thereof being expired, there
was a sacrifice appointed for the sin of such a one; what, of such a
one, as had lived and served God in that strict order? yea, even they
must acknowledge no desert, but as they stand in need of mercy, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call upon God for it, <hi>Who will shew mercy to thousands of them that love
him; and keep his commandments:</hi> our works then, or any thing that we
can do, cannot bring us sound peace and joy, as being imperfect and
unable to abide the justice of God; but Faith, that layeth hold on the
all sufficient merit and satisfaction of Christ, and his most perfect
Righteousness, whereby they are made ours, brings us great joy, as
whereby we dare come before God with boldness and confidence.</p>

often,<note place="margin">No pains too much to get faith.</note> who would not take any pains to get faith, being so rewarded?
The world wondreth at them that take pains to hear the word, yet
this is the means of faith, which is the instrument of Salvation; yet
wonder they not at themselves and others, that travel weekly as much

over the threshold: But do not we rest our selves either upon our
gifts of Knowledge, Utterance, Profession, shew of Zeal, outward
Civility,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note> and the like, for nothing will save us but faith, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the end hereof. If a man had lived in the days of Christ, and
both heard him, conversed with him, and seen his miracles, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faith he might be damned, as <hi>Judas:</hi> Were one the kinsman of
Christ, should he handle him in his arms, nay, were one his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
what would the same avail without faith? Therefore refuse no

happy.</p>
                  <p>If the Apostle had said,<note place="margin">Salvation not the end or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Works.</note> End or reward of your works, the Papists
would have had their mouthes made up, and run away with a full cry,
Lo here, whether our Works merit not Heaven and Salvation, or no:
Alas! there's no such matter; Can they not distinguish between
Merit and a Reward freely given? True, the Scripture calleth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a Reward, and promiseth the same to them that hold out in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing;
but doth it not also call in an Inheritance? and who knows
not that that is free? There are two kindes of debt, one of desert,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65522:45"/>
and another of promise; <hi>Herod</hi> made conscience to keep his rash Oath
to the daughter of <hi>Herodias,</hi> she deserved it not, but he promised it:
And when God promiseth Eternal life to constancy in well-doing, is
it to puff us up, as if we did deserve it? no such matter, its onely to
help our weakness.</p>

these be harsh to our nature, therefore to encourage us, God makes
these Promises, and accordingly at the end of our work, we shall have
the thing promised,<note place="margin">We cannot inherit heaven.</note> not because we have earned it, but because Christ
hath purchased it, and God hath promised it to us. That we cannot
merit heaven, may thus appear; 1. Because our best works be stained
with many imperfections; and what's good in them, is Gods gift, not
our goodness. 2. Because there must be some proportion between the
thing merited,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> and that wherewith, but here there's none; as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
buy a great Manor for a trifle, so the things we can do or suffer here,
are not worthy the glory to be revealed. 3. Because that whereby we
must merit, must be free, and that which we are not bound to do; but
we are bound to do all that we can, and having so done, we have done
but our duty, and consequently not merited; As if we had a lame ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,<note place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note>

howsoever by his Victories he deserved well; what then should we in
respect of God? But as the whole Scripture labors to beat down our
Pride, Arrogancy, and any Conceit that we might have of any thing
in our selves, so this place saith, The Salvation of our Souls, is the end
and reward of Faith, not of Works; and yet not the reward of Faith,
as if it merited any such thing, as it is a Grace in us, no, but onely it
apprehends it an instrument, that whereby we are justified and saved,
and that which meriteth our Salvation.</p>

                  <p>HAving spoken of Salvation by Christ, laid hold upon by Faith,
which they had obtained; He now commends and sets forth this
Salvation and the means thereof, to be the onely true way, and the
Gospel revealing it to be the most blessed and excellent Doctrine that
ever was: for 1. Its no new device of any, or first preached by the
Apostles, but that which the holy Prophets that have lived in all ages
(men endued with the Spirit of God) have studied and enquired into,
and found, and have in their writings prophesied of the same; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
also to know the time when our Savior Christ should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
into the world; who understanding by the Spirit, that he was
not to be born in their days, but in the last ages of the world, yet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him afar off, were glad, and took it thankfully, and so believing in
him, were saved by him. 2. That the Gospel and Salvation by Christ,
was preached by the holy Apostles, men set apart by God for that
business, endued with his Spirit that came on them from Heaven; and
so its the same that was known to our Forefathers, and Patriarks, and
Prophets, not varied, but the same Doctrine and constant way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
3. That the very Angels as they wondred at the wonderful
mystery of Christs Incarnation, and learned (as is very probable)
something by the Apostles Ministery, which they knew not before;
so, into the fulness of this Salvation they desired to see. So we have a
commendation of the Gospel, or the way of Salvation therein
preached: 1. By its antiquity; the Prophets knew and embraced it:
2. The Apostles not of their own heads, but by the Spirit extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
sent upon them, preached it. 3. The Angels desire further to see
into it. In the Prophets search we are to observe, 1. The substance
they sought. 2. The circumstance of time: for the substance, it was
privately for their own benefit, who therefore enquired into it, and
searched it our diligently; and publiquely, for the benefit of the
Church, who therefore prophesied of it.</p>

things are left rawly, whether those worthy men intending the greatest,

might not put too much confidence in them, or give too much to
them: But for many latter ones, they are patcht by the Pope and his
Adherents, which will be sure to do nothing against him, and the
greater part overcomes the better part; Therefore we are not to rest in
these,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 20.</note> but go to that Law and to that Testimony, which alone must

(as haply it doth still in some parts of the land) but O dead hearts,
and unthankful in most places. Those under the Law, saw but a little,

we ignorant of the one? its for want of acquaintance with the other;
Hath God set on work his holy Prophets, to Prophefie such things

storms of Persecution, and shall we not be conversant therein? yea,
those Chapters that seem of least use in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> touching cleansing
of many sorts of uncleanness, have this main use, even to teach, That
God cannot abide sin, but that it must be cleansed through the blood

or to know any thing, we must not go to work by our own head or

we do, if we keep our selves to the written Word of God; for Gods

would not; they would give no more credit to <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, then to

a blasphemous Opinion: The Scripture is above the Church, and

from all false Christs; do they therefore depend upon our testimony?
and are we above them? Though the Church discerneth the Word or

no part in him themselves,<note place="margin">The Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists confuted.</note> those concerning us; They had
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and temporal benefits, and looked no further; But
how absurd this is, we have already shewed, having sufficiently
proved the contrary: And these words are not to be understood of
Christ, or of the substance of salvation, but of the time of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and of the maner and measure of revealing him to them more
darkly, to us more clearly; to them more sparingly, to us more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
They believed in Christ that was to come, we hear of Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come, and that he hath finished all things, and how; and thus
are we to understand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 33, 39. where there seems an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
They received the promises, that is, the fruit of them, and
salvation by Christ; and they received not the promises, that is,
saw not the exhibiting of Christ, who was promised to the World:
For more plainness, there was never but one Covenant between God
and his people, from the beginning till now, nor shall be, which is
the Covenant of Grace, except we mean the Covenant of Works,
which was between God and all mankinde in <hi>Adam;</hi> the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and matter whereof was our own strength and righteousness, but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65522:53"/>
this was soon at an end; <hi>Adam</hi> had soon broken this, and overthrown
himself,<note place="margin">The Covenant of Grace one and the same throughout all ages.</note> and with him all us: The Covenant of Grace then the
Lord entred in his great mercy with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, which was
founded in Christ Jesus, requiring of us to believe in him, and repent
of our sins, and he would forgive us our sins, and give us salvation
and life eternal: This for the substance thereof, was never altered
one jot, onely the Lord hath revealed his Son more fully to us, more
sparingly to them; more plainly to us, more darkly to them: Herein
may be considered, both the Author, Matter, Form and End.</p>
                  <p>The Author,<note place="margin">The Author,</note> the same God to them and us.</p>
                  <p>The Matter,<note place="margin">Matter,</note> Christ Jesus the same to them and us.</p>
                  <p>The Form was generally also the same,<note place="margin">Form, and</note> for as God required Faith
and Repentance of them, as well as of us, so he gave them the same
means for the working thereof, the Word and Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>The End the same (<hi>viz.</hi>)<note place="margin">End thereof.</note> the Salvation of his Elect, and Eternal
life.</p>
                  <p>The difference is in the measure of his giving them,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the measure given, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to whom.</note> as also in the
persons to whom; then was it to the Jews onely, who were the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
people of God; now the partition wall is broken down, and
the Covenant is to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews: So also for the
measure, he spake to them by visions and dreams, to us by his word,
and when to them by his word, it was both more sparingly, and more
darkly: Also our Sacraments compared with theirs, are, as fewer, so
more easie, and more significant; and for the Spirit, they had him
more sparingly (except some extraordinary persons) whereas it was
promised,<note place="margin">Ioel 2. 28.</note> that he should be poured upon us: And for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, they are far inferior to Christians now; they saw
Christ to come afar off, we already come, yea, that he is dead, risen,
ascended, and shall come to judgement: They had him under Types
and Shadows, we have the substance, the body it self; theirs was as
the seed time, our time as the harvest; they had the twilight, we have
the noon day: And there was great reason that the time when Christ
himself should come, should bring more glory with it; as the coming
of a King himself, hath more solemnity and priviledges, then when
the Kings Harbenger comes before; and that when the sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
should arise, there should be more light then before.<note place="margin">Why God sent his Son no sooner.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why did God send his Son no sooner, and not in their time
rather?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We must not quarrel with God, we may as well ask him, why he
made the world no sooner, why he put distinction between the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and winter, day and night: We must know, that all things are
done in infinite Wisdom and Justice by the Lord, though we know
not always the reasons of his dealings:<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> He came in the fulness of
time, he could come no sooner, nor tarry any longer; we are to thank
God that he is come.</p>
                  <p>The difference between them and us, is onely in the measure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
and means; therefore we call their time the Old Testament,
or Covenant, and ours the New, not two, but one; onely the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65522:54"/>
to them was sealed in the blood of Bulls and Goats,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 20.</note> ours in
Christs own blood, as he himself witnesseth.</p>
                  <p>The cause why their time was called the time of the Law,<note place="margin">Why theirs was called the time of the Law, and ours of the Gospel.</note> ours the
days of the Gospel, was not but that they had the Gospel also
preached, as <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, so <hi>Abraham,</hi> so the Jews in all
their sacrifices and cleansings; but because then the Law was so much
preached, and the Gospel so darkly and sparingly, as now the Law
more sparingly, the Gospel more frequently.</p>
                  <p>Neither is God to be charged with inconstancy,<note place="margin">God not to be charged with inconstancy.</note> because he taught
his Church otherwise then, then now he doth, no more then a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for training his children up otherwise when they be children,<note place="margin">Simil.</note>
then when they are men grown; he doth both in wisdom. The Lord
trained on his children in their infancy, by those babish rudiments,
fit for the time, reserving greater things for the grown age of his
Church; yea, such is his constancy, that he hath never altered the
way of Salvation, but hath ever been the same from the beginning,
and shall be.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that the Lord hath honored us to live in these days,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
and revealed his will so plentifully, O how joyfully should we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Christ Jesus, and labor to be found answerable in Knowledge,
Faith, Repentance, Zeal and Holiness! Our Forefathers saw but a
little, and took great pains for it, and were glad of it; How glad
then should we be of that we have?<note place="margin">Luke 2. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Simeon</hi> waited for the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Israel, and was so glad that he had seen, and taken Christ in
in his arms (though then in his swadling clothes) that he was willing
to dye; O how joyful would he have been if he had seen his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
heard his Preaching, known his Resurrection, Ascension and
Glory,<note place="margin">Psa. 119. 127.</note> as we do. <hi>David</hi> was so glad of the Word, that he accounted
it better then gold and silver, and sweeter then the honey, and the
honey-comb;<note place="margin">Iob 23. 12.</note> and <hi>Job</hi> esteemed it above his appointed food: Alas,
What a little had <hi>David</hi> (especially <hi>Job</hi>) in respect of that we have? we
have the whole Old Testament, which some of them had not, and the
New also, an Exposition and Commentary thereof, which they had
not at all; How cheerfully then may we come to Christ, and believe
in him? How should we walk, that know he is gone up to heaven to
prepare a place for us, and will come again to receive us? But alas,
if the Lord come to look for these fruits, where be they? Alas, to
whom is the Gospel welcom? How many be there that would as
willingly there were no Preaching as any? and are there not many
that hear onely for the fashion, that will hear but when they list?
The Lord publisheth his Gospel, and offereth his Son to the world;
but alas, men have more minde to their Oxen, Farms, Pleasures,
then to imbrace it; many savor not of the Gospel, many count it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a burthen then a jewel: yea, of those that hear the word usually,
How few are there that hear it with delight? how few finde such need
of Christ, as they desire him more then all the world? as they will
willingly stoop to his yoke, and serve him? And as many have no
more knowledge, then if they had never had the means thereof; so
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65522:54"/>
even they that have some measure of knowledge, make no conscience
of their ways, are utterly void of Reformation: Thus do not they take
thankfully this great jewel of the Gospel, the onely glory of the
World, but most unkindely requite the Lord; yet whats their saying?
They hope to be saved by Christ, as they that believe stedfastly in
him; but how they came by their Faith, or any good fruits thereof,
they can shew none: For this God must needs have an heavy contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
with the Land; and were't not for a remnant that he hath to
gather, we should quickly perceive it: O therefore let our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be such as becometh the Gospel,<note place="margin">See Heb. 6. 7.</note> bring we forth meet fruit, to
the pains God hath bestowed on us: But as for those that live and
make no account of, nor receive any profit by this Gospel, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
will be heavy, God will take his Word from them, or snatch
them from it; and not onely <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and old times
shall rise up against such, but even the good Souls that saw but a little
light fifty or sixty years ago, and had but a little knowledge (for the
means were small) yet were zealous and godly, and sundry gave their
lives for the Truth; even these, I say, shall rise up and condemn
them: Then would they be glad of one of the days they have had,
but shall not have any. Awaken therefore to day, while it is called to
day, for we may fear it draws to night-ward, towards the Sun-setting
of the Gospel.</p>

                     <hi>The things which are now reported unto you, by them that have preached

                     <note place="margin">The same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel which was preach'd by the Prophets, was also preached by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> The second part of the commendation,
The same Gospel preached by the Prophets, was also preached by
the Apostles since Christ, men that were trained up with Christ all
the time of his preaching, and were witnesses of his Life, Death,
Resurrection and Ascension: These have preached this Gospel, and
that not of their own mindes, but by the Spirit of God, which was
sent down from heaven upon them, and that in an extraordinary and
visible maner. The Prophets preached of the same Christ, and that
by the Spirit (as we have heard) so that they and the Apostles agree
notably in one; but the Apostles received a greater measure of the
holy Ghost, and a more plain and visible sign, not onely perceived of
themselves, but of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In that he addeth,</hi> Which the holy Ghost sent down from heaven, <hi>he

                  <p>If then the Gospel was also preached by the Apostles,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and that by
the Spirit sent from heaven upon them, Hereby may all that hear it
be induced to embrace it; as on the contrary, their case must needs
be fearful which reject and despise it:<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> Such is the case of the Jews,
though they killed the Prophets, yea, though they rejected Christ
and his preaching, yet were they not cast off, till they had rejected

                     </note> having done this, their sin was at the highest, and
from them the Apostles turned unto the Gentiles. Such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

of the Turks, utter enemies of Christ and true Christians. Such
is also theirs, who among our selves despise this Gospel: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

none do so: Yes, many in sundry degrees; for all that receive not
the Gospel, embrace not the Gospel, do not believe, obey and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
all these despise it; for to believe and repent, are the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Gospel: therefore he that yields not unto them, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Gospel. <hi>He that is not with me</hi> (saith our Savior) <hi>is against me;</hi>
All these have a dreadful account to make: For, though now it be
preached by sinful men, yet it is the Gospel that was preached by
Christ himself,<note place="margin">See 1 Pet. 4. 17.</note> and after by the Apostles inspired by the Spirit, and
it hath been abundantly confirmed by Miracle:<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 1, 2.</note> This is that (I say)
which we preach;<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 8.</note> let every one therefore take heed, lest they set

of men.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">The Apostles have left a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect direction for all things needful for our Salvation.</note> in that the Apostles were so filled with the Spirit to preach

                     <hi>Thaddeus, Bartholomew,</hi> &amp;c. and in Traditions and unwritten Verities;

what is this, but to tax the holy Ghost for leaving something
not necessary, nor profitable for his Church, and by altering or
taking away the same, to make our selves wiser then he?</p>

                     <hi>Which things the Angels desire to look into.]</hi> The third commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gospel, The Angels defire to see into the further end of
that salvation that is preached therein. They are not ignorant of any
thing the Church knoweth; but they have gathered some things they
knew not of, or not so much till they came to pass; as, touching the
Incarnation of the Son of God, both Natures in one person, &amp;c.
This they desired to see before he came;<note place="margin">Exod. 37. 8.</note> and this was figured by the
Cherubims looking down toward the Mercy-seat, which covered
the Ark, which was a figure of Christ, signifying that they desired
to look into that Mystery of his Incarnation; and when they saw it,
they admired thereat, even to see the Eternal Son of God joyned to
mans Nature, it to be worshipped without Idolatry, and his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to suffer, the Deity remaining free without suffering: So also by
the Church they learned the Mystery of the calling of the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 10.</note>
But now that which they desire to see, is that which is yet to come,
namely, the fulness, perfection, and accomplishment of the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Church and People;<note place="margin">Why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels desire to see the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the salvation of Gods Church.</note> namely, to see the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when God shall be perfectly glorified in his Saints.</p>
                  <p>They desire this; 1. Because they are enforced to see now a great
deal of sin in the world, yea those duties which the Saints themselves
perform,<note place="margin">See Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> full of corruptions and weakness, which after that day
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65522:55"/>
they shall see no more: 2. Because that day shall be our perfection;
Alas, here we are imperfect every way, and weak, then shall we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and free from sin, and in a most happy estate both in body and
soul, which for the love they bear to God and us, they long to see: for
as God revealed himself more darkly to the old world, more clearly
to us; so when we shall come to heaven, much more clearly then
now: There shall be as much and more difference between that which
we shall know then,<note place="margin">See 1 Ioh. 3. 2.</note> and that which we know now, as between us and
the darkest times before us under the Law;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9. 10, 11, 12.</note> Here (as children) we
are weak, and rather stammer, then speak plainly of God, his Word
and Works; but when in the life to come we shall come to mans
state, it will be far otherwise: Here we see with spectacles of the Word
and Sacraments, but there without, and that most perfectly.</p>
                  <p>1. Is there such an happy condition remaining for all Believers?<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
O how should we rejoyce, that are entred into the first degree of it,
and expect the other! How should we bless God for his Gospel, and
for the pains which we have taken herein to attain the same! Yea, how
should we walk thankfully, that look for such a state? how zealously
and heavenly-minded, not defiling our selves with this world, nor
sticking here, but mounting up in our affections, and having our
conversation there?</p>
                  <p>2. How should we long for the day of our dissolution,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> to enter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
degree; but especially for that last day, when we shall be made
perfect? The Angels have what they shall have, yet in love to God
and us, they long to behold our perfection; what should we then do,
that shall have the benefit of it?</p>
                  <p>3. This should teach them that be yet void of grace,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> to embrace the
Gospel, that they may come to this happy estate, else they shall go to
one as miserable as this is happy; from which the Lord deliver us.</p>

                  <p>For our selves,<note place="margin">The corrupt conceits of Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</note> How many corrupt conceits be in peoples heads that
hinder them from Faith? As some think that they be no great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and hope to be saved by good prayers, good meaning, civil
life, &amp;c. Others, that its no such hard matter to be saved, but if that
men call to God for mercy, they shall do as well at the last, as they
that make all the stir: These conceits be as it were the strong
Castle of carnal People, whereinto being once got, all that we can
say, proves unable to beat them out; Others hope to be saved by
Christ, who yet live in their sins; Others think that if they should
Repent, and go to Sermons, they should never be merry again:
Now these, and such like, must be reformed, finding these lets,
we must gird up our loyns, and remove them: Nay, even Gods good
servants that are truly humbled in conscience for sin, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hungring after Christ more then all the world, as desirous to
turn to him, yet are held off by some false conceits, O they be
unworthy that God should forgive them! Therefore he will not,
their sins be too many and too great; and, O if they could sorrow
as deeply as some, and serve God as well, then they would hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and, O they have so many corruptions, and such a rebellious heart,
as they know God will not forgive any such; whereas it is not that
will hinder, so as our hearts be unfeignedly bent to strive against
our corruptions, and serve the Lord in truth.</p>
                  <p>Neither do the very best prize so highly this Salvation as they
ought,<note place="margin">The best prize it not as they should.</note> we weigh not what God hath done for us in Christ: This is
the reason why we walk not more thankfully, joyfully, and zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;

up, and be sound of these points, and whatsoever thought would
hinder us from resting on Christ Jesus for Salvation,<note place="margin">Mark 10. 49, 50.</note> let us cast it
from us, as the blinde man did his cloke, when he went to Christ.</p>

but moderates us in the use of things lawful, that we exceed
not our bounds therein:<note place="margin">Luke 21. 34.</note> These may be referred to two heads, Profits,
and Pleasures,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 15.</note> which we are most subject to abuse, and are therefore

drink,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> apparel, recreation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which we must use soberly to the
glory of the giver, our own good, and the good also of others.</p>
                  <p>1. For our meat and drink,<note place="margin">Sobriety about meat and drink</note> we must neither be excessive, nor over
curious, as <hi>Dives</hi> that fared deliciously every day, making his belly

2. For our apparel,<note place="margin">About apparel.</note> we must not exceed for the matter of it, nor
for the fashion, God hath given it for necessity, comeliness and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 9.</note>
it must not be newfangled,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> either we use it to wantonness

                  <p>3. For Recreation,<note place="margin">About recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it must be sparing in time, place, measure,
to make us more fit for our duty; for God hath not set us here to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
and pamper the flesh, but to mortifie the lusts thereof; not to
play, but to do his work; to this end is Recreation to be used.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those that wallow in beastly and unlawful lusts,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
in whoredom, chambering, wantonness, drunkenness, &amp;c. so in

                     <hi>I said of laughter, thou art madness:</hi>
For a man to sport at Gods dishonor, and their own destruction, is
madness: Can we play with nothing but edge tools? the Lord will
laugh such to scorn;<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 9.</note> O turn your beastly pleasures into weeping and
wailing.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh also such as are drunk with lawful things,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as
some that so glut themselves, and so pamper the body, that they
make themselves unfit for any duty; many waste and consume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
this way, Bodies and Goods, yea, Souls and all: Others also
are so curious in their meats, as that nothing can please them, nothing's
good enough for them; yea, are more angry for any want this way,
then for any sin in themselves or others; they have fat Bodies, but lean
Souls: O, think they, this is a goodly life, but indeed it is a swinish life,
fitter for beasts then men, most unseemly for a Christian: So for Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
they that follow every new fangled Fashion, and are so proud and
costly, and so over curious, as they spend no small time in trimming
themselves, taking no care to trim their Souls with Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Spiritual Graces, How are they to be reprehended? What
painted Sepulchres are these? may not an image have gay clothes put
on? yet how many spend their precious time and goodly patrimonies
about this vanity? So for Recreations, some are so mad on them, as
they think and speak of nothing else, as if they were set here to eat
and drink, and rise up to play; thus spend they the greatest part of
their time.</p>
                  <p>3. Let us therefore pare away whatsoever super fluity hath been
in us in these things,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and learn soberly to use these mercies, as the
Gospel teacheth us, so as thereby we may ever be made fitter for our
duties, and to serve God, and that they may be as a staff in our hand,
to help us on in our journey, and this is to walk pilgrim like; be we
more careful in feeding, clothing and making merry the Soul.</p>
                  <p>For the latter,<note place="margin">About profits.</note> namely profits, we must also be sober, both in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  <p>We must not onely use no unlawful means to get the world, but
use the lawful means moderately, not setting our affections upon the

they are called to the Wedding Feast, they have Farms and Oxen to

to God, our Souls, our Families, our Neighbors, the Poor, or any

Grace; That is, Salvation; which is described by the means how they
came by it, It was brought them, and that by the Gospel which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>1. They are exhorted to trust and believe in Christ for Salvation;
Faith is a particular assurance, that whatsoever Christ hath done, he
hath done it for me:<note place="margin">What Faith is, with the parts thereof.</note> This is to put on Christ, to eat and drink his
flesh and blood; It hath three parts: 1. Knowledge of the mystery
of Salvation. 2. Consent. 3. Particular Application:<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> This is the
instrument of our Salvation, and puts a difference between justifying
and temporary Faith, what else soever a man hath, there's no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
promised to it;<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 3.</note> This the mother of all true joy and peace,
The mother of all obedience,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 17.</note> and good life: See it in <hi>Abrahams</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
up his Son; Hereby we are induced to do or suffer any thing

and desire to come out of it, and hunger after Christ: we ought
to believe that we shall be saved,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 40.</note>

commandments are as necessary to be obeyed as those of the Law,

                     <hi>hath put to his seal that God is true:</hi> Its therefore our

you shall be refreshed, and are pardoned in Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. They are willed perfectly to trust;<note place="margin">How they were to trust.</note> namely, 1. Sincerely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faining. 2. Stedfastly without wavering. 3. Constantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
breaking off. Sincerely, nor fainedly, but so believe as we have
ground out of Gods Word for it: many say, they hope to be saved,
and this is all; but put them to prove why, and whereon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
is grounded, they can say nothing: Can you prove it out of
Gods Word? What promise have you thence? if you have, then
its well,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Downham, Christ. War.</note> else its Presumption, not Faith. Try it by the fruits
of Humiliation, and by the fruits of Sanctification, by thy love to
the Word and Saints. Stedfastly, without wavering, we must not
be off and on, we hope well, but we cannot tell; Gods promise is
not yea and nay,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 22.</note> but most certain and infallible, so that we may be
out of all doubt:<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 21.</note> To this purpose its called assurance of Faith, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65522:58"/>
(as <hi>Abraham</hi>) we are willed to ask in Faith,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 6.</note> and not to waver: Its
true, no mans faith is so perfect, but there may be sometimes some
doubtings, but they are not of the nature of Faith, but being from
our corrupt nature, are contrary thereunto.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that tell us we may be of a good
hope, but are great enemies to assurance; we may be assured, say they,
in respect of God, but in respect of our selves we cannot; he being
faithful, changeth not, but we are weak and variable, may be well
now, but by and by fall; a tormenting Doctrine: If we look to our
selves, we need not doubt, but despair rather; and God hath not
promised Salvation to us upon condition of our constancy, as to
<hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 13. 1.</note> but of his unchangeable love,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> he will never leave us, but
finish the good work he hath begun in us; yea, say the Papists, if
we hold out: What a foolish repetition is this? God will do great
things for us, if we continue; what were this to us, if we were left to
our selves?<note place="margin">Ier. 32. 40.</note> nay, he will give us a minde to continue, and so do all
these things for us.</p>
                  <p>2. This reproves even good honest humble Souls,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that long after
Christ, and hate sin with a deadly hatred, and have many excellent
things in them, and yet stand at a stay; they would not for all the
world, but hope that God will have mercy, but cannot be assured:
Why, Is not God faithful? hath he not said, that such and such
shall be saved? shall he say it, and not do it? God forbid.</p>

Gospel zealously? not Wealth, Honor, Peace, Credit in the world,

shall please God, Angels to be our guard, our Prayers to be heard,
our Souls at death to be carried into heaven, both our Bodies &amp; Souls
to be glorified at the great day; Will this satisfie us? Hereof we

found the wind and tide against profession, and reproach, trouble and

such be dealt with, though in their conscience they think best of
such, yet keep in their heads, thinking that its best sleeping in a whole
skin: But alas, they make but a weak choyce; were they not better

of Christ, and saved at the great day, though with some sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows

and to have him ashamed of them at that day, as he will? for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

but he of his goodness brought it them, which he useth here
as an Argument to perswade them to trust stedfastly to this Salvation,
and look accordingly for it, because God would bring them to the
Faith of it, when they thought not thereof.</p>
                  <p>Note here, That</p>
                  <p>Salvation is not of our own procuring or seeking:<note place="margin">Salvation is not of our own procuring or seeking.</note> Alas, what

the woman,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 5.</note> he could not make himself an help, a wife (for God made
and brought her to him) much less a Savior. So, whats the reason he
hath given us the Gospel in this Land, and not to our Forefathers,
not to many other Lands? we sought it not, but when Idolaters in
darkness, God brought it. So have we not been brought by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
or by Service into Towns where we have had the Word, when
we purposed no such thing? So to our hearts, what were any of us
when God called us? Did we seek him? Alas no, we ran from him
rather, long ere we yielded, but he followed us, and overcame us:

See it in <hi>Saul,</hi>

after Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8, 9, 10.</note> have some taste of his love, and some desire to please
him that were far from these, he will continue this, and will never
leave us: Thus the Apostle reasons; But God commendeth his love
towards us,<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10, 11.</note> &amp;c. So <hi>Jacob</hi> in danger of <hi>Esau,</hi> He came over <hi>Jordan</hi>
with his staff, and God had given him two bands, therefore he was
perswaded to relie on God for present deliverance; for why (might
he say) I am perswaded thou hast not done all this for me, to be lost
in an instant, as an ox should lick up a flower, or a candle be put out
at once. We use not Gods mercies well, when we grow not stronger
by them for time to come.</p>
                  <p>4. Comfort to a fearful heart,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> that fears he shall not hold out, or
that God will cast him away: O its impossible, did he bring thee
Salvation that regarded it not? and now hath given thee an heart to
prize it above the world, and to walk in the way to it, will he now
disappoint thee? No assuredly: If he would not have saved thee,
he would have let thee alone as thy companions and many others, and
never have done this for thee.</p>
                  <p>O but the Devil is so strong and subtile,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and I so weak and simple.</p>
                  <p>He that hath pluckt thee out of his hands,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> will never suffer him

Law, and the Ceremonies which were out of date, (but they could

Ceremonies, &amp;c. All these be done away in the Gospel, where
Christ is laid open without any covering. Note,</p>
                  <p>We have the excellency of the Gospel,<note place="margin">The Gospel lays open Christ Iesus unto us.</note> that doth uncover and lay
open Christ Jesus unto us, brings us tidings of him, who is the Way,
the Truth and the Life, and the onely Savior of the world; So that
the Gospel is the glory of the World: The Sun is not so necessary in
the Firmament, as the Gospel is to the world: This teacheth us
Christ, which is life eternal, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> desired to know nothing,
but Christ and him crucified,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and counted all dung for the excellent
knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord:</hi> O how welcome should this be!
It is well called glad tidings, so it is indeed: The Gospel is our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
If we should finde evidences of great Lands and Inheritances to
come to us, or a Will wherein were bequeathed great Legacies to us,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65522:60"/>
how glad would we be of the same? How often would we revise and
read them over? The Gospel brings us tidings, and tells us the way
to come to an everlasting inheritance, and therein are bequeathed such
blessed Legacies, <hi>Item,</hi> I give thee forgiveness of thy sins by my
Sons death; <hi>Item,</hi> Eternal life by his obedience. <hi>Item;</hi> I give thee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that thou shalt be raised here from sin, and that thy body
shall be raised at the last day by my Sons Resurrection; <hi>Item,</hi> I give
thee assurance of a place in Heaven by my Sons Ascension.</p>
                  <p>1. Is it not a marvel then that the Gospel is so hardly entertained?<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
and that the World cares so little for it? Its welcome to most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not as if it brought them news of a blessing, but as if it would
spoil them of all they have.</p>
                  <p>2. How should they that want it be set on work to labor to get it?<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
as without which there's no Salvation; Its light, food, armor,
without which darkness, famine, spoil: If the Sun should be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Town, and could be procured, how would all joyn to get
it? Or rain for a dry and barren ground; who would not wonder at
any that should be against it? yet who joyns, who labors for the
Gospel.</p>
                  <p>3. If the Gospel be the revelation of Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> then are the
Ministers revealers of this blessed Secret, therefore worthy to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for their works sake,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 12, 13.</note> for the greatness of their work,

either rate them, or at least set light by them, not reverencing
their calling, but esteeming them more base then the meanest Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;

unto their Faith, vertue</hi>) as if he should say, You that sometimes were
the Children of wrath, and are now by grace made Gods Children,
walk obediently as becomes such a mercy.</p>
                  <p>This Sanctification hath two parts:<note place="margin">The two parts of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and stands, 1. In renouncing
evil, or the lusts, which (before grace) we were wont to be led by. 2. In
putting on, and embracing holiness of life, that we may resemble
the disposition of our Father who is holy, and looks for holiness in
his; yea, holiness in all maner of conversation.</p>
                  <p>For the order,<note place="margin">Obedience and Sanctification follow Faith.</note> first goes Faith, then Obedience and Sanctification;
for as the light and Sun-beams comes from the Sun, a river from the
Spring head,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> fruit from the tree, so doth obedience from Faith: Till
a man be pardoned and believe,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 8.</note> he cannot repent nor obey the will of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65522:61"/>
God, no more then a dead stick can bring forth fruit. When by
Faith we are ingrafted into Christ, then we receive power, not before;
one that hath never been humbled aright for sin, cannot hate and flie
from sin as he should: He that seeth not the love of God to him,
cannot love God, nor set upon a good life; to deny his lusts, being
as dear as his life, and to yield obedience, is irksom to nature: for
this cause the Devil is such an enemy to our Faith, and labors to
shake it, for then he knows he damps our care of a good life.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that boast of holiness of life, and yet
overthrow the foundation of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) A true justifying faith: They
may stir up good moods, and a blinde devotion, by scaring men
with the pains of hell, and telling them of the joys of heaven,
but no sound Obedience, godly Life, renouncing Lusts, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the work of Faith, from that will be Obedience, even to
suffering.</p>
                  <p>2. It confutes them that think Repentance is before Faith;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> they are
indeed wrought at once, and Repentance sheweth it self first, but in
order of nature, Faith is as the root: Many humble souls hold off,
and dare not believe, O say they, if I could repent so heartily as I see
some, and could serve God as I would, then I could believe.</p>
                  <p>3. It teacheth men,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that if ever they will set upon a good life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and in time, they must begin at the right end, and lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of true justifying faith; for want of this, many deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that have some purpose to do well, being afflicted, or somewhat
stirred at the Word, and fall out of a bad course, to leave this and that
evil, or take up good duties; and many that never had experience of
the work of Faith, that think they live well, or some that upon some
occasion thus promise, You shall never hear me swear more, Ile ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
play more, Never come in an Alehouse; yet this lasts not, but they
fal to their old byase by and by, because they took not the right course:
Many also purpose to repent, and do great matters, but this is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
matter then the world thinks off; a man must first be the childe of
God, ere he can obey, and Faith must be wrought first, ere he can
come to true repentance; therefore put it not off, its not the work of
a day, or sickness the fittest time to be allotted thereto, but constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be set upon, till we shall attain thereunto.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>1. We must obey,<note place="margin">We must obey in all things.</note> not to halves, or where we lift, but in all things,
not as <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Herod,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>2. We must not on the other side run without our errand,<note place="margin">Which are commanded.</note> nor do
things whereof we have no commandment; this is no obedience, be
it never so costly or painful, have it never so goodly a shew: And
here falls to the ground all Will-worship of the Papist, to whom it
will be said, Who required these things at your hands? as also all
good intents without warrant of the actions: How was God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with them that offered their sons and daughters to the fire,<note place="margin">Ier. 7. 31.</note>
having no such commandment from him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">Be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so strange or unpleasing.</note> we must obey the Commandment of the Lord, be it
never so strange, harsh, unpleasing, or contrary to Nature, denying
our selves contrary to custom, though all the world counsel to the
contrary: and that not indenting or covenanting with the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
for wages or success; as to say, I would do such a thing,
so I thought no hurt would come of it, or that I should thrive in
that course, or that I should not meet with trouble: no, we must
follow the Lord, as the blinde man follows the staff of his leader,
and chooseth not his own way. Thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> in forsaking his
own Countrey at Gods Commandment in his old age; it was his
Native Countrey, that wherein he had lived so long, he was to go he
knew not whether: He had questionless contrary counsels of his
Neighbors, What a mad man are you to remove now, and seek a
new dwelling in your old age; you are here known, here are your
Kindred, you know the Countrey, and have thriven: Its as if one
should remove a tree that hath grown long in place, into another
place when its old: Well, for all those he persisted in his obedience
to Gods Commandment.</p>
                  <p>The Jesuits train up their Schollars in strange obedience,<note place="margin">The strict o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Iesuits to their Superiors</note> as that
they must do whatsoever their Superiors bid them, and that speedily
without questioning; as to water a rotten tree, to pour a vessel of
good wine into a gutter, to set trees with the roots upward, &amp;c.
when his Superior calls him to go in an instant, and not to stay to
make up the circle of an <hi>O;</hi> when he is writing and made the one
part of it, he must not stay to make up the other part: They to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this, and provoke to obedience, tell a miracle, That one thus called
of his Superior, and leaving his <hi>O</hi> in the midst half made, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
found it made up a perfect <hi>O,</hi> and so gilded, that it shined, &amp;c.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65522:62"/>
Such obedience owe we to God, and these rules be very good, so as
the Commanders and Commandments were good. We must obey
God directly, and never cast about beforehand what shall be the end,
we must leave it to him, and to obey him must needs fall out well.
<hi>Abraham</hi> did not amiss, but sped well in obeying God: So <hi>Noah</hi> and
the rest. <hi>Abraham</hi> never shifted for himself, but twice about his
wife, and he was like then to have spoiled himself, if God had not
helpt him out of the bryars; So <hi>Jonah:</hi> Our own Devices never
succeed, though never so likely. But we have such reaches before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
that mar our obedience: Oh, if I were ruled by the Preacher,
I should not thrive by plain dealing, nor wax rich; or if I should
leave such a course, or such a course, I should be poor; If I should
do thus and thus, I should come to trouble: but let us do our duty,
and let the Lord alone for his part to look to us; in obeying him
we cannot do amiss. The wicked will leave their sin a little while
it may be, through Sickness, or Fear, or Counsel, as the Dog
that is beat from the Carrion,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or called away, yet hath a Dogs
eye back again after it,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 30.</note> and will be at it again, as soon as one's back
is turned; yea, and if haply they give good words, yet will not
their doings be answerable.</p>
                  <p>3. We must obey without reasoning the case,<note place="margin">Without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su1lting with flesh &amp; blood.</note> or consulting with
flesh and blood; we must binde Reason hand and foot to follow God

Friend,<note place="margin">See Deu. 13. 6.</note> nay the Wife of our bosom entice us from him, we must not
give ear to them; nay, if our right hand, eye, or foot offend us, we

Angels out of Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice, opened the Earth,

move thee not, consider, I beseech thee, his Goodness; Who hath
nourished thee up? given thee a comely body, a reasonable Soul, and
so long kept thee, that thou art not now in Hell? Whats all this for,
that thou shouldst flie in his face that gives thee bread? He lets thee
hear his Word, calls thee to Repentance, &amp;c. Is it that thou shouldst
tread these things under thy feet? Oh, thou art of thy father the
Devil, whose works thou dost; and except thou fall down at the

God will have no parting Stakes:<note place="margin">1 King. 3. 26.</note> The Devil, like the Harlot, would be
contented with the one half, but God, like the true Mother, will have
all or none. If God were so revenged of half-obedience under the
Law, what then now? This halving is an Argument of no true Faith,
for that purifieth the heart;<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> also of no Repentance, for he that repents
truly of one sin, repents truly of all: Whosoever therefore thou art
that dost thus, <hi>thou art in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity,</hi>
thou art in the state of damnation. If thou livest in the practice and
love of one known sin, profitable or pleasing, this one shall be enough

the chearful and constant obedience that we ought to perform in all
things. If neither his Authority, nor his outward Benefits will move
us, consider we his love towards us in Jesus Christ, that of children of
wrath he hath made us his children, that by giving his Son, he hath
freed us from Damnation, and means to save us: Oh, the Name of
Children calls for much obedience,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> as the Name of Brethren
should still all Controversie. And this is the Argument which
the Apostle here useth to perswade to obedience: Oh, we be Gods
Children, Children ought to obey their Parents, there's nothing
more uncomely then the contrary, much more we the Father of our

the loyns of your minde,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Seeing God hath done such and
such things for us, let us trust perfectly on that grace that is brought
unto us, and walk obediently: Yea, the more we profit in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the more comfort we may have, that we be the Lords, and
have true Faith; the more will our comfort be also in our death: So
many of us therefore, as can prove our selves the Lords, do we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to walk worthy hereof in all due obedience; and for others
that know not they are the Lords, let them try it by obedience.</p>
                  <p>Many Covetous,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Usurers, Oppressors, Swearers, &amp;c. will say,
they believe: no, be tryed by this rule, If your heart stand to obey

Why? who hath wrought these things in you? Not flesh and blood,
they are the gifts of Gods sanctifying Spirit, therefore they come
from Faith; as if we see a Sun-beam, we say, the Sun is risen; if an
Apple that is good,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we say, there is a good Tree: Except therefore
you will say that men can gather Figs of Thistles, or Grapes of
Thorns, you cannot deny but that you have Faith; wheresoever
Sanctification is, there Faith went before; O but I finde it but weak,
yet as long as it is in truth, with desire of increase, it presupposes Faith:
as if we see a Sun-beam, though but dimly, yet we say, the Sun is up,
after it will shine out more clearly: So we say, its a good Tree,
though the fruit be small at first, so long as it is good.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Two parts of obedience.</note> &amp;c.] There are two parts of Obedience, or
Repentance, a dying unto sin, and a living unto righteousness; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of lusts,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 16.</note> and imbracing holiness; a ceasing to do evil,
and a learning to do well;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 9.</note> an abhorring of that which is evil,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 10.</note> and
cleaving to that which is good; a putting off of the old man, and
putting on of the new; he that hath the one, hath also the other, they
are married by the Lord, and none can divorce them: Therefore
if any man seem to have the one, and not the other, he hath neither in
truth: If therefore any leave evil, and do not good, or if any do
some good, and hate not all evil, he is but an hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65522:63"/>
For the order here used,<note place="margin">We must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake evil before we can do good Simile.</note> he sets renouncing of our lusts first, before
imbracing of holiness; men put off their old rags, ere they can put
on new apparel; purge the stomack of ill humors, ere they take good
nourishment; dig up the weeds, ere they sow or set herbs: so in
this case.</p>
                  <p>Where therefore there remaineth the love of any lust or sin, there is
no true grace in that heart, neither will any grow till that be rooted
out, God will not plant any of his grace there, till the Devils planting
be pluckt up. Many think they be Christians, and do many things
well, though they keep the love of some sin; no, mark, the love of
grace and goodness, and the love of any sin, cannot be in one heart,
they are so contrary the one to the other; therefore while thou livest
in any known sin, and lovest any lust, as sure as God is in heaven
thou art an hypocrite, and let me perish if there be one dram of true
grace in thee, but thou standest in the state of damnation.</p>
                  <p>Therefore renounce and bid adieu to thy lusts;<note place="margin">Use.</note> and seeing you make
a profession, and do many things, will you lose heaven for your lust,
for one sin?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 24.</note> so run that you may obtain, lose not heaven for a little,
make either something or nothing of thy profession, banish from thee
all sin, that God may work some true grace in thy heart.</p>

and ignorance is the cause and root of a wicked and bad life:
For till men know the will of God out of his Word, how can they
do it? and what are we prone to by nature, but to all the evil in the
world? Therefore the devil labors by all means to hold people in
blindness, &amp; of all books, hath most been an enemy to the Bible, and
to sincere and diligent reading and preaching the Scriptures, for were
those away, he knows all iniquity must needs abound, as there did in
Popery, when people were nuzled up in blindeness; O what abundance
of sin was committed? but it did not so much appear, because they
were in the dark, and the light of Gods word discovers sin, which
was then very rare:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As if one come into an house at midnight, he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ees no faults, but when the morning comes, then he sees a number of
things out of order; so in this clear light of the Gospel, we see the
wickedness that then appeared not in the dark. Whether will not our
nature run? and whether may not the devil and world lead one, when
he hath no eyes to see whether he goes? The blinde eats many a fly,
and a man may lead a blinde man into the deepest pit.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As the Raven
first picks out the Lambs eyes, and then kills it at his pleasure, when
it cannot see to escape away, so doth the devil by people: Ignorance
is often compared to darkness, and they that go in the dark often
stumble, fall, and hurt themselves: <hi>Sampson</hi> when blinde, was led to
any thing, as to grinde, to make Sports, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth us to desire that the clear light of the Word may
shine more and more brightly into all places of this land,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> for there are
many places that have either no preaching, or else very seldom; So as
for want of knowledge, people wallow in a number of lusts most fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,

                  <p>3. People are to labor for knowledge,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> else they must needs be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives

and expert in the Law, having it read among them daily?
and had they not good knowledge in the Law, and in the Prophets?
True, yet he justly calls them ignorant; 1. Because though they were
so cunning in the Law and Prophets, yet they knew not Jesus Christ,
the end of the Law, and so the sum of all. 2. Their knowledge was
onely in their brain, and not effectual in their hearts to renew and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them,<note place="margin">Rom. 2 17, &amp;c.</note> but they were carried away by their lusts, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their knowledge.</p>
                  <p>1. Then all the knowledge in the world without the knowledge of
Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">All know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without the knowledge of Christ is nothing.</note> is nothing: If a man could measure the heavens, tell
the number of the stars, had skill in all Arts and Sciences whatsoever,
yet without the knowledge of Christ it were vanity. <hi>Paul</hi> knew much

this were nothing without the knowledge of Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. All the knowledge of the world,<note place="margin">Knowledge without refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is but ignorance.</note> if it reform not a man, is but
ignorance; So much a man knows as he obeys: That is not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that is in the brain, but that which soaketh down into the heart,
and transformeth a man into the similitude thereof; so much men
know, as they mortifie their lusts: He that lives after his lusts, let him
have never such store of knowledge, he knows nothing yet as he
ought to know: what if a man know he should not Swear, Lye,
commit Adultery, &amp;c. yet doing these is he any whit the better? Is
he not rather much worse? Yea, the Devil himself hath more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
then any man: The world wonders many times to see men of
great knowledge do such and such things: Alas, Knowledge and
Conscience are two several things, and often sundred in the
subject.</p>
                  <p>1. Then, let no man boast of his Knowledge: Many love to hear
themselves talk, but look what power they have over their lusts, what
mastery over their affections.</p>

2. Do not we labor so much for knowledge,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as for the power of
it; Therefore when we have heard a Sermon, let's not content our
selves that we can repeat it, have a good memory and utterance, but
by our selves pray earnestly, and travel upon our hearts, that it may
effectually work in us: A little well learned of an humble Soul,
craving to be ruled by it, is better then much that a vain bragger
can repeat, that will be ruled in nothing but when he list.</p>
                  <p>But he would not have them live now they had Knowledge,<note place="margin">Such as have attained knowledge, must not live as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> as
they did in Ignorance, and now God having wrought in them the

                  </p>
                  <p>People therefore that live under the Word,<note place="margin">Use.</note> must not do as they
did before they heard it: Why may we not do this or that, will some
say? we do but as we have done, and as other Towns do? well, is
it not enough if upon your true humiliation God pardon the time
of your ignorance,<note place="margin">Iohn 9. 41.</note> though he now expect obedience? and so must
you now obey, else your sin will be great, and ye must be beaten
with the more stripes: will God look that your work should be done

our conversation must be such as becometh the Gospel.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 27.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So for Christians that have received assurance of Gods love, and
entred covenant with God, they must not yield to their lusts as others,
to whom God hath not shewed such mercy, or as themselves did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they knew God in Christ Jesus: they must not be as worldly now
as before they knew God to be their Father, and that there was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inheritance for them; as proud now of apparel, following every fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
as before they knew the true apparel of Christs righteousness, &amp; to
be deckt with grace to be the best attire; as froward as before they had
the Spirit to refuse these corruptions; they must not backbite, slander,
talk of other mens faults, rejoyce in their infirmities, as they did in the
time of their ignorance; they must not talk of worldly matters on the
Lords day, as they were wont ere they knew the holiness thereof, and
what a strict rest &amp; observation God requireth; nor follow gaming, as
before when they knew no better mirth;<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 25.</note> nor be so vain in talk, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they knew it to be a fault, &amp; as carnal persons be: Then what sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
thing do we? We must be now as much altered in our behavior,
as our case, we hope, is altered from top to toe; as from being heirs of
wrath, to be heirs of heaven: Kings sons and daughters must not live
as every ordinary base person, nor Gods Chrildren as Worldlings.
Let us therefore so many as have given our names to Christ indeed,
and know our selves delivered out of this evil world, and are assured
that God is our Father, and we his children, walk as it becometh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

not avoiding gross and outward ungodliness onely, but resisting

our own lusts; for Christians must make an account they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

but this is but half; he that stands here will come but half way,
almost onely with <hi>Agrippa</hi> to heaven,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 28.</note> not altogether: Repentance
hath two feet, he that stands not on both is a lame Christian. If
there were a Preferment for a man at <hi>London,</hi> and he should go half
way, and there stay, would he not lose it? might he not also be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accounted a fool, a negligent and lazy person? Such are we, if
through lack of one part of Repentance we deprive our selves of
heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as he which hath called you is holy,</hi> &amp;c.] Speak we first of the
Exhortation unto holiness, ver. 15. then of the Reason enforcing
the same, ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Exhortation, its to Holiness, whose extent is in all
maner of Conversation, which is set out by a Simile, <hi>viz. As God is
holy;</hi> who is described by a main benefit bestowed on them, Their
Calling: <hi>But as he that hath called you is holy, so be ye holy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Exhortation then is to Holiness; we were made holy at the
first, we are now filthy and unclean; we must have the image of sin
put off,<note place="margin">Christians must be holy.</note> and a new image of God put on; we must be sanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
set aside for the Lords use, as the Shew-bread, that none might
meddle with, or put to any other use. We must be for the use of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Flesh, World, Devil, but for Gods use onely; we must have no
more Body, Soul, Wit, Will, Reason, Hand, Eye, Finger or Foot, but
for the Lords use.<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the will of God, even our Sanctification:</hi> Angels
our fellow servants be holy, Heaven the place we look for is holy,
no unclean person comes there;<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 3. and 17. 17.</note> God hath also given us his holy
Word, and holy Sacraments to encrease us in holiness; so holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
and his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>This the end of our Election,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As without holiness no man shall see God:<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note> So,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. This condemns such as are so far from holiness,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 32.</note> as they give
themselves over to all maner of lewdness and prophaneness,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and mock
at those that desire any better, Oh, you be of those holy ones, of the

Take heed, you will speed as <hi>Esau</hi> did. If you be not holy, you shall
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65522:66"/>
never see God, but (as <hi>Belshazar</hi> saw the hand-writing) to your terror:
Is it not too much you be prophane your selves, but would you that
others also should be so too? Doth not God enjoyn holiness? speaks
he not to all? Therefore except you will publish to the world that
you are marching in the Devils Rabble, and have renounced your
part in heaven, and vowed your own destruction, break off your fins
by Repentance, and cease to be for the Devils use any longer: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and cry for pardon of that is past, enter a new Covenant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

this, else you cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Its great
pity, that many men of very fair carriage are no better for themselves,
and they trust to their honest and just dealing with their Neighbors;
but alas, it will deceive them for want of holiness. Alas, that you
will see nothing into the first Table: How little do most regard the true
Worship of God, and the Spiritual use of it? How seldom do they
pray, or have any divine Meditation? How little regard they the
Sabbath? How often swear? and such persons be the best Papists
we know.</p>
                  <p>

what is it if a man be not covetous, if he be proud or unclean, &amp;c.
some will yield in great matters, but in small do as they list; as to swear
by their Faith and Troth, especially in that which is true, talk vainly,
play a game or two on the Lords day, put a little false Ware, deceive
a little, &amp;c. Some again will yield in all small matters, but in some
great thing they will not;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 5.</note> as to give all diligence to encrease in every

mouthes:<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 29.</note> though thou hast spoke many good words, yet hadst thou
better be silent, then have no more good to speak. There are some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
in the Church, but Spirits in their houses at home; In their own
Town well ordered, but in strange places as the company is, riotous,
wanton,<note place="margin">1 King. 20. 23.</note> deep in gaming, &amp;c. as though <hi>God were God of the Mountains,
and not of the Valleys,</hi> of one place, and not of another. Some must
be vain at the Table, and Christ-tide, howsoever at other times.
Some in adversity will be very humble, good words, golden promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but in prosperity nothing so. Some in prosperity carry themselves
well, in adversity not stick to run to a Witch: At the Communion,
or a day or two after,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> will be demure, but not so long. Some use their
Superiors well, their poor Tenants or Workfolks hardly: Alas, there
is no part of our life, wherein God gives any licence to do evil; in
our particular Callings let us shew the truth of our Christianity.
Some servants will make a shew of Religion, and be desirous to hear,
but are lazy and unthrifty in their Callings: Some men carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very forwardly, that in their shops and dealings shew it not.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65522:66"/>
Papists seem very devout in some things, yet you shall lightly
ever know any that make Conscience of an Oath, or of the
Lords day</p>
                  <p>2. Let us prove the truth of holiness in us,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> by the generality of it;
keep a constant tenour, an even hand, and let there be a proportion
between every part of our life, not one part as it were devout, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prophane and wicked;<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 32.</note> like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, one part
gold, another silver, another brass, &amp;c. These cannot hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

our Death-beds,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 11.</note> and give us a large entrance into the glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord Jesus Christ: True it is, we cannot come to any
perfection here on earth, but shall be subject to offend; yet this were
to be wished, that all our actions and behavior, and all our speeches
and thoughts were such as become holiness; and its that we should
endeavor unto, the beginning whereof is simplicity, and truth of
heart, desiring without dissembling, or feigning to walk so as we
may please God in all things.</p>
                  <p>Wonderful is the weakness of most part of Christians, who how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
in many things they do well, yet many of their actions and
speeches are not answerable: Well, let us notwithstanding endeavor it,
and that every day more &amp; more; and lets not be discouraged, though
we cannot attain to all we would, but if we can gain ground this way,
though it be but a little at once, yet our labor shall not be in vain:
we must every day exceed our selves a little, and so not bearing with
our selves in our corruptions, but unfeignedly striving against them,
we may receive no small comfort; let us therefore not bear with our
selves in the least evil,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19, 24.</note> but strive to reform our selves in every thing; in
the mean time (with the Apostle) mourning because of the corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But as he that hath called you is holy,]</hi> That is, God: This is the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,
whereby the Exhortation to holiness is set forth, which hath
in it also the force of a double reason to perswade thereunto: 1. From
the person calling. 2. From the calling it self.</p>
                  <p>The person calling,<note place="margin">God is holy.</note> God: he is holy, therefore must we be so.
Concerning Gods holiness, we need say little; Its his very essence,
and uncreated in him, he hath been so for ever, and is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely:<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 3.</note>
The Angels cannot cease praising the same, Holy, holy,
holy,<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 8.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He is the Fountain of holiness, and conveyeth the streams thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Creatures,<note place="margin">Lev. 20. 8.</note> Men and Angels: He is holy by nature, whatsoever
holiness is in Angels or Men, is not by nature, but by grace: He san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
the place where he manifesteth himself, as the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Moses</hi> stood by the bush where God appeared;<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 5.</note> much more Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where he most clearly sheweth himself to the Saints.</p>
                  <p>This should teach us,<note place="margin">Use.</note> as to acknowledge him so in his Word, and
in all his Works, and that we should not dare admit a thought to
the contrary, though we cannot see the reason of all things, so the
use hereof is, That we should study after holiness, that so there may
be some agreement between him and us, as we are bidden be merciful,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65522:67"/>
and perfect,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 48.</note> as he is, and our Savior faith, Learn of me; not that he
requires an equality,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> which can never be here and hereafter: Here we
cannot be perfectly holy as he is, in Heaven we shall be perfectly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but not infinitely as he is, because we are finite; but so that we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to imitate him, that we may have his blessed Image renewed in
us daily,<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 7.</note> and grow more and more like unto him, going from strength
to strength, till we appear before the God of gods in <hi>Sion:</hi> Can the
most holy God abide unholy persons?<note place="margin">Lev. 12. 3.</note> He hath pure eyes,<note place="margin">Hab. 1. 13.</note> and hateth
sin,<note place="margin">Psal. 94. 20.</note> abhorreth iniquity, what agreement between light and darkness?
God and <hi>Belial?</hi> Therefore the Lord so often called upon the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
to keep themselves from all kindes of Pollution, and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them unto holiness in innumerable things, whereof some were
very small: Therefore as we take Gods holy Name upon us, hear his
holy Word, partake his holy Sacrament, and take his holy Name
in our mouthes, let us also study after holiness, else never look to
see Gods face: He can no more endure prophane persons, then we
to take a Toad in our mouthes. This holiness stands not in coming to
Church, mumbling over a few Prayers without understanding, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Communion at <hi>Easter,</hi> &amp;c. The Pharisees fasted oft,
prayed long, gave Alms, had broad Phylacteries, yet were rejected
by our Savior Christ; It stands in the purity of the heart, and the
whole conversation. But how little doth this example of the Lord
prevail to bring men to holiness? most follow after their own hearts
lusts, and the corrupt example of men, we do as we see others do, and
why, (say we) should we be wiser then our Forefathers, then all our
neighbors? and thus being willing to follow such examples, we draw
one another to all evil: But follow we not those in evil, but the blessed
example of God himself, as in holiness, so in sanctifying his
day. Thus of the person calling.</p>
                  <p>The calling it self.<note place="margin">A twofold cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> A great benefit indeed: why, Is it so great a
benefit to be called? Yea, as is here meant.</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold calling; 1. Outward: When God calls men
by every days new benefits, by every new correction, by his Word,
whereby yet they are never aw hit the better,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> nor converted, <hi>for many
are called,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>but few chosen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 24.</note> and this is common to Reprobates. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and Effectual: when besides and with the outward means, God
speaks inwardly by his Spirit to the Conscience:<note place="margin">The parts of the inward calling.</note> The parts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The enlightning of the minde to understand the Principles of
Religion, which though alone it be not sufficient, nor more then may
be in a Reprobate, yet its the foundation of the rest, without which
no effectual calling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The opening of the heart to believe (as <hi>Lydia</hi>'s was) when one
believes every thing particularly to belong to them,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 14.</note> and so the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Salvation among the rest, till then her heart (as all ours) was
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fast lockt up,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> not able to believe.</p>
                  <p>3. The change of the whole man:<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 2.</note> This is essentially necessary to
Salvation,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> for by nature we are slaves of sin;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> as long as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65522:67"/>
as we were born,<note place="margin">The fruits of this inward calling.</note> we are far from Salvation.</p>
                  <p>The fruits hereof are,</p>
                  <p>1. When a man goes about the works of the same, and labors to
walk worthy of it in an holy life.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. When a man highly esteemeth his calling, and the hope of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
glory he is called to, as <hi>Paul</hi> accounted all dung in respect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Christ crucified; and the things he esteemed highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his calling, afterward he made no reckoning of.</p>
                  <p>3. When he will suffer any thing for the same, rather then be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
drawn from the hope thereof.</p>
                  <p>Some are called sooner, some later, as in the Parable of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers
hired into the Vineyard.</p>
                  <p>Examine we our calling,<note place="margin">Use.</note> for much hangs upon this, Our Election
past,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> and Glorification to come. Calling is the fruit and proper effect
of Election;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> if the one,<note place="margin">Marks of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling.</note> then certainly the other: Notes hereof are

                  </p>
                  <p>1. Not to hear the Word,<note place="margin">Negative.</note> and that diligently; so doth the Devil,

                  <p>1. To seek above all to be at peace with God, and to have his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to assure us of our everlasting Salvation, not to serve the time, nor
any such thing, but above all to be assured of Gods favor.</p>
                  <p>2. That we hate unfeignedly all evil, but especially the special <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
evils of the Time, and of our own Nature.</p>
                  <p>3. To affect heartily all good, but especially those good things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that the World and Times least regard, and our selves be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
unto.</p>
                  <p>If by these notes we finde we be called, then have we cause to
rejoyce, and to praise the Free-grace of God, who for no desert, but
his meer mercy, hath vouchsafed to call us that were vile, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
an Idolater, <hi>Paul</hi> a Persecuter, <hi>Zacheus</hi> a covetous person, the
Goaler a desperate Ruffian; and hath now put a difference, and that
for no goodness in us, rather then in others: And hath he done
so to all our companions? No, they abide in ignorance, unbelief,
impenitency: And now our work must be this, even to study after
holiness more and more, being called out of the world, that we
should no longer fashion our selves according to the same, having no
fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 11.</note> but reproving
them rather: As you would be loath to be put back with the world,
and have as they shall, so be not as they, no not in the least things;
and as our hope is in Heaven, so have we our conversation there, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called of God to that high Priviledge: If you be not effectually
called, and have had so long and so great means of calling, its a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65522:68"/>
sign that you hearken not,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 25.</note> because the Lord will slay you. The
earth that after much cost,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note> yet yields nothing but bryars and thorns,
is reproved, reprobate ground, near the curse, whose end will be to
be burned.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3.</note> If the Gospel be hid,<note place="margin">Acts 13. 48.</note> its hid to them that perish. <hi>So many
as were ordained to eternal life, believed;</hi> therefore if thou hast hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
stopt thine ear against the Lords calling, take heed thou provoke
him not further, but to day, whilest it is called to day, give ear and
obey: Its more then thou couldst have looked for, that he should
have all this patience, abuse it no longer, lest it turn into fury, and
the Lord in his wrathful indignation flying away from thee, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that he will never more speak to thee, and either snatch thee
from the Word, and send thee to Hell, or the Word from thee; or
if thou hear,<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 9, 10.</note> that he yet bid the Minister preach to harden thee, and
let thee alone:<note place="margin">Hos. 4 17.</note> agreeable to that, <hi>He that is unjust, let him be unjust
still,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 11.</note> &amp;c. which is most fearful, and curse thy heart, as Christ did
the Figtree, never fruit grow on thee, never good motion come in thy
heart, or if any do, let them dye presently &amp; not live, and give thee over
to be more strongly tempted by Satan; Devil, take him, and hurry him
at thy pleasure, &amp; lay down thine own corruption unbridledly, which
is the fearfullest curse under heaven: O lets seek to escape it, and
tremble, to prevent this fearful judgement, which lighteth on many
that have long lived under preaching, and are hardlier won at last
then before. Some of you haply having barren Trees in your
Orchard, and having resolved to cut them down, have tryed one
year more ere you cut them down: We may fear there be sundry
of us in this place going upon our last year (who they be God knows)
If now you listen not,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24, &amp;c.</note> the Lord will hew you down, and cast you
into the fire; and then will you call and cry to God, but in vain, he
will not answer you then. When God shall cast such into their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
place, how shall they then fret and vex themselves? What
beasts were we that we did not yield to the Word of God, which so
often called upon us? Others obeyed, and they are well: O that we
had profited at such a time, when such good motions came in our
mindes! O that we had yielded to them, and not cast them off as
we did! but then all too late; they may fret, and gnaw their tongues
for vexation, but to no purpose: Endeavor we therefore in time to
prevent this. Thus of the Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the Reason of the Exhortation laid down in the
16 Verse, <hi>Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy;</hi> where's to be
considered, 1. That he urgeth still the matter in hand, and cannot
have done with it. 2. How he urgeth it, even by Scripture, <hi>It is
written.</hi> 3. The Text it self, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. I say, he still urgeth the matter in hand, much pressing his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
unto holiness, and is very earnest herein.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons may be these:<note place="margin">Why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to holines.</note> 1. Because the thing in hand is so excellent
and necessary, then which nothing can be more: Holiness makes us like

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65522:68"/>
Who seeth not what a work we have to bring any to turn from
their sins, and to take an holy course? how few such, and with what a
deal of pains? and when converted and brought to a love of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and desire to please God, yet who findes not what a stir he hath
to bring himself to any good Duty, Prayer, Meditation, Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of his heart, &amp;c. or when we are brought to do good things,
yet to do them in a right maner, but the heart will be gone? especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in all things, and in our whole conversation; therefore no marvel
though the Holy Ghost dwell long upon it.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth us Ministers in weighty points,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> to dwell as it
were upon them, and not sliding from them too quickly, to urge
them again and again, questioning their hearts whether indeed they
will do so and so, or not, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. People,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> when they perceive their Ministers so to urge such and
such a point,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 40.</note> they must consider it the more seriously; so when
we read any thing,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> wherein the holy Ghost is more earnest
or repeats it often, as to search and examine our selves, we
must take knowledge of the weight of the matter, and of our own
dulness, dwelling the more thereon in our observation and attention;
where the holy Ghost is earnest, we must not pass it slightly over.</p>
                  <p>2. He proves it by Scripture,<note place="margin">Ministers must prove their Doctrine by Gods Word</note> and so must we when we would prove
any thing to the Conscience; for Gods Word is the Judge of all
truth and falshhood, good and evil; its the Golden rule, the Ballance
of the Sanctuary.<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 25, 26.</note> Philosophers prove things by Reason, in Gods
School proof must be from the Scripture: We must not look what
this man, or that man, or twenty men say, this stablisheth not the
Conscience; but the Word of God, that bears meat in the mouth,
that is of weight and authority, either to make to yield, or at least to
leave without excuse: One Testimony of Scripture, is of more
weight then the testimony of a thousand men, for that is the Word
truth, and all men are subject to error, and thereto may people say in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,<note place="margin">Acts 12. 22.</note>

alleage, Fathers, Councels, School-men, &amp;c. O how they applaud
them! but if any shall alleage Scripture, properly and plainly, Oh,
he is a plain homespun Preacher, he may do well in a Countrey Town;
but Christs sheep do otherwise, they reverence and adore above all the
Word of God.</p>
                  <p>This condemns the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that deal most treacherously, and will
not have the scriptures to be judge, but Fathers, Councels, the Church;
And who is the Church but themselves? and the Head of Councels
but the Pope? and so upon the point, the Pope is the Church, and so
its like enough to go well on their sides: And in their Councels, who
is any thing but the Pope and his Consistory? as he will have every
thing, so it shal be, as in their last Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which they so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
as the most sacred Assembly that ever was, which indeed was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a conspiracy of Traitors, against the Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Christ Jesus, and his Truth; there such were pickt as were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65522:69"/>
fast to the Pope and the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and such as were sworn
to be true thereto; and when some few spake somewhat more boldly
in some things, then was well liked of, they were quickly packt out,
and this charge they had after they had sate a while, That they should
interpret no Scripture, but such as might stand with the Doctrine of
<hi>Rome;</hi> this was good stuff, that whereas they should have brought
their Doctrine to the rule of Scripture, they must bring Scripture to
their Doctrine, as if the Carpenter should cut his rule according to
the piece, and not the piece according to his rule: And howsoever
they sate there at <hi>Trent,</hi> disputing for a fashion, yet nothing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
but such as the Pope and his Consistory at <hi>Rome</hi> devised,
which being set to them, they were to publish; and thus the parties
become Judges, and they that should stand at the Bar to be judged,
sit on the Bench to judge their own cause, therefore it must needs go
well on their side: They cannot away that the Scripture should be the
Judge, because they then know how it would go with them and their
Doctrine, but we must receive it, and try all Doctrine by it, and stand
to the sentence thereof, as being the onely Judge: So here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
enjoyning holiness, takes this as a sufficient proof, <hi>It is written,</hi>
though that was against their nature and disposition; though by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
after it, they might be counted Puritans, Singular, Proud,
Hypocrites, &amp;c. yet they must not stand reasoning the case with flesh
and blood, they must be holy, for so it was written.</p>
                  <p>If then we know any thing once proved by the Word of God,<note place="margin">Obedience is to be yielded to those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which are proved by the Word.</note> we
must make no more ado; if the Word command a thing, we must
yield and obey; if forbid a thing as vile, we must dare no more med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
therewith, then to eat poison.</p>
                  <p>For the Word of God is the Royal Law,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> that Rule of Righteousness
that must command all the world, Prince and people must stoop here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;<note place="margin">Amos 3. 8.</note>
This is the Law of his Kingdom, whereby all we his Subjects

hereof,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 27.</note> and yield obedience thereto? this was ever Preface
enough to the Prophets in their Sermons, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, The

it off at our pleasures, the same may command obedience.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns the prophane and dissolute world,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> do men go
by any such rule, and try, ere they do any thing what God saith
of it in his Word? O that were too much preciseness: But by what
rules then? If it stand with my pleasure, with my profit, with
my ease, with my credit, most do so; I shall be accounted a fool
if I do not so: O cursed rules, What? shall Profit, Pleasure,
Mammon, and our Lusts become now as it were our God?
dare we cast the word of God behinde us? do we provoke the

uncleanness, &amp;c. because the contrary is prescribed in the Word:
And yet how dare men live in those very sins against the Scriptures?
Hath not the world smarted sufficiently yet, whereat to take warning?
What threw <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, drown'd the old World,
brought such variety of Judgements upon the Jews from time to
time, if not their disobedience? have there drunkards enough,
swearers, prophaners of the Lords-day, Usurers, &amp;c. been plagued,
and sent to Hell already? This rebelling against the Word of God,
hath made all the racket and havock in the world, and hath brought
to confusion the Proudest and Mightiest: If we had not the Word,
but were left to the light of nature, God might condemn us for our
sins, how much more when by the Word he hath told us all his
minde? Well, let us look to it, if the Word may not be a light to
guide us, it will be a fire to consume us; If it be not strong enough
to make us yield obedience, it will be strong enough to throw us
headlong to confusion, as whereby we shall be judged at the latter
day: If when God smites any one part of us with pain in extemity,
we be weary of our selves, when yet we have many comforts, and
many to pity us, and hope also of an end thereof, what shall their
care be that are smitten and plagued in all parts of Body and Soul,
there being no eye to pity them, nor hope of an end? which yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
upon the disobedience to Gods Word; Then will they fret and
vex themselves, O beast that I was, that took not warning at such
and such a time, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. For as many as are willing the Word should guide them,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and be
it with or (in appearance) against them, are willing to be ruled, let
these be of good comfort: Its a good mark of Christs sheep, they
hear his voyce and follow him,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 47.</note> and he is of God that heareth and
obeyeth his word.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">Gods Word the rule of all Truth.</note> in that its said, <hi>It is written;</hi> we note, That the Word of
God is the rule of all Truth and Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the Papists,<note place="margin">Use</note> which as if the written Word of God
were insufficient and imperfect, and the Prophets and Apostles either
would not, or could not, or might not leave a perfect direction for

their endeavor thereto; to the wicked they are commandments of
conviction, which God may justly require of them, because he made
them able to do the same; to his servants they are not so, but with
the exhortation he conveys such grace, as whereby they are enabled
to do the same.</p>
                  <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Nor is it against the marryed estate.</note> this place is abused by sundry, to cry down the married e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,

                     </note> but this gift is given but to few; therefore rather then they should

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65522:73"/>
that live single, take heed they put no holiness therein, or think that
thereby they please God the more, but rather let them use it well, and
profit thereby, in being so much the more zealous and forward in
every good work, publike and private, else that their single life will
one day be a witness against them; but especially take heed of a filthy
sole life, for many wanting the gift of continency, yet to avoid trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
cares, and charges of marriage, and that they may live easily,
proudly, and gather riches, will live singly, though impurely; Such
shall one day know, that they had better been married, then here to

                  <p>HEre the Apostle proceedeth in matter not unlike the former: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he exhorted to holiness in all maner of conversation, now to
pass our time in the fear of God; the same thing, but in other words,
and urged with new Reasons: Or this may be the intent of the holy
Ghost, to meet with a secret corruption of mans heart, placing holiness
in outward observance of duties (as the Jews were much given that
way) thereupon exhorting not to rest in the outward doing of them,
but to do them carefully, and in the fear of God, with desire therein to
glorifie God, and to do the most good: And this fear of God is a great
help and fnrtherance to holiness. Herein he wills us to pass our time
here in this world,<note place="margin">Why we ought here to pass our time in fear.</note> using three Reasons for the same; 1. From this
Priviledge, that we call God Father, we must then so behave our
selves as Children of such a Father, and as he may not be ashamed
of us, when we so call him, saying, Callest thou me Father? away
varlet, and bastard, thou art none of mine, I acknowledge thee not,
neither hast thou any quality of my Childe. 2. From the nature of
God, who is a Judge, and that an upright one, who will Judge
every man, and that without partiality, and give him not according
to the outside, but the inside of his works. 3. From the invaluable
price of our Redemption, laid down in the following Verse. Speak
we first of the Exhortation, then of the Reasons thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.]</hi> This is the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and very requisite it is, to speak of the fear of God, that
knowing the nature thereof, we may the better try whether it be in
us; for though most men will challenge it to themselves that they
love, fear, and put their trust in God, and serve him, yet alas,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65522:73"/>
there's no such matter in them,<note place="margin">Hereof see Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 10 p. 108.</note> there belongs more to it then the
world thinks, as I hope we shall see ere we part.</p>
                  <p>There be three kindes of fear;<note place="margin">Three kindes of fear.</note> 1. Natural, being an affection plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in man at his creation,<note place="margin">Natural.</note> as his other affections, whereby he shuns
any evil thing that comes towards him, which is not in man onely, but
in all sensible creatures: This in it self is not evil, it was in <hi>Adam</hi> in
his innocency,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> it was also in Christ, who was heard in that which
he feared. If a man should see a beast run at him, or a man with a
drawn sword, he cannot but fear; onely the excess of it is a fault,
when men having promises of Gods Providence and Blessing, do
not believe them, but are swallowed up of fear, are at their wits
end, made unfit for any duty, or reach out their hand to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
shift or means. <hi>Jacob</hi> no doubt was afraid when he heard of
<hi>Esau</hi>'s coming against him, but yet his faith comforted him in his
fear, and made him pray to God, and use wise and lawful means.
<hi>David,</hi> when they of <hi>Ziklag</hi> were ready to stone him, feared, no doubt,
but yet by faith comforted himself over it, that it did not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him up, which is a thing worthy to be spoken of, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good servants of God, are yet fearful to be alone in the dark,
fearful of death, of the day Judgement: The best may be so a
little, but we must take head of too much fear, being in our way,
and having Gods Promises, as our Savior to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out,<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Save, Master, I perish,</hi> so may it be said unto us thus fearing,
<hi>O ye of little Faith.</hi> 2. Slavish;<note place="margin">Slavish.</note> when men fear God onely in respect
of his wrath and punishment, and abstain from sin, not for any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
thereof; or do good, not for love, but either because Gods
judgements are on them already, or hang over them, were't not
for them, they would not care what they did: As a galley-Slave that
rows and toils but onely for fear of the whip,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and were't not for
that, he would do nothing, being in the mean time so far from
any love, as he could eat his heart for whom he works; or as a
Trewandly Boy, that learns onely for fear of the rod, not out
of any love to his Book or Master: This may be and is in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
as in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but is not that (as neither the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
which is meant here.<note place="margin">Filial.</note> 3. Filial or son-like fear, whereby the
Children of God considering his Power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Mortons Threefold estate pag. 122.</note> Justice and Truth, and
especially his Goodness in it self, and shewed towards them,
stand in a reverend awe of him, and are careful to please him, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to offend him, even chiefly for the love they bear him, yea, and
would not grieve him, though they knew they should not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for it, as having been so gracious and merciful a Father to
them; as a good and gracious Childe would not willingly grieve
his father, though he knew he would not cast him off, or shut him
out of doors,<note place="margin">This last often enjoyned.</note> even because he is a loving Father unto him: This
proceeds from Faith, and is that which is here meant.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto we are often exhorted,<note place="margin">Psa. 2. 11.</note> as may be seen by the places
quoted in the margent,<note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 13.</note> which (howsoever abused by the Papists,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> who
understand them of slavish fear,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> to overthrow assurance of Salvation,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65522:74"/>
and to maintain that vile Opinion, That a true Christian may fall
finally) are meant of a reverend awe of offending God, which is not
onely not against Faith, but stands well with it, nay proceeds from
it, yea, the more Faith, the more such fear.</p>
                  <p>This proceedeth from the consideration both of Gods greatness
and goodness,<note place="margin">Whence it proceedeth. The benefits hereof, Pro. 1. 7</note> whether joyntly or severally considered; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

Ark,<note place="margin">The opposites hereunto.</note> the want of which is a floodgate to all iniquity: Hereunto there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are four main opposites, 1. Prophaneness, when men dare live as they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> list, and their lust is their Law. 2. Security, when men live carnally and
wretchedly, contenting themselves that they be none of the worst, they
be not such and such kinde of persons, yet go on without regard either
to God or his Word; The evil they abstain from, as it is not from the
fear of God, so if good come in their way, they do it after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
and evil also, as comes to hand; they dare commit sin in hope
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of mercy, and think they shall do well enough. 3. Hypocrisie, which
hath more shew of Religion, but resteth in the outward ceremonious
performance of duties, and looks not to do them in the right maner,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and so are not guided by the fear of God in their lives. 4. Slavishness,
when men fear indeed, but never, but under or in expectation of the
rod; they then will flie to a book, have good words, golden promises,
&amp;c.<note place="margin">The marks hereof.</note> at other times they care not what they do, or at least be as before.</p>
                  <p>Contrarily the true fear of God is known by these notes; 1. To hate
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> evil, and not leave it off onely for some sinister respects. 2. Not onely
gross and open evils of the hand,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 13.</note> but inward corruptions of the heart,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as Pride, Arrogancy, Hypocrisie, Hardness, Frowardness, Wordliness
of the heart, &amp;c. spying them out, mourning for them, and striving
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> against them, as being seen to God, as well as gross sins to men. 3. All
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> evil, the evil way, every evil way. 4. Such evils as a man may go
closely away withal,<note place="margin">Gen. 39. 9.</note> as <hi>Joseph</hi> might with uncleanness with his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Mistress,<note place="margin">Neh. 5. 15.</note> but would not, as fearing God. 5. Such as a man may carry
out by strong hand,<note place="margin">Joh. 31. 15, 21, 23.</note> by might and authority, and no body to control
him, yet dares not do it, because there's an higher who hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> it. 6. It will make a man watchful to avoid evil, as the Hare hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> an eye to passengers as she sits. 7. It will make men avoid the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of evil. 8. It is ever joyned with the fear of his Word, and as
is the one in us,<note place="margin">Isa. 50. 10. &amp; 66. 1, 15.</note> so is the other.</p>
                  <p>If it be thus,<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> then I may too truly and plainly conclude, That there
is but a little fear of God in this Land; for how few hate evil, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
corruptions, all evil, such as they can go cleanly away with,
such as they can carry away by might and colour of Law? How
many live prophanely, as if there were no God, no Law, no Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
day, no reckoning to be made, but do what their lust leads them
too; and that which some would not, nor durst do for a world, they
make no bones of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:65522:74"/>
Another sort live securely and carelesly, not so bad as the former,
but such as look not to God, nor set him before their eyes in their
deeds.</p>
                  <p>Others perform more duties to God, but so as they regard not
why, nor in what maner, but rest in the work wrought, not casting
with themselves how they may do them aright, and thereby taking
notice as well of their own weakness, as Satans malice.</p>
                  <p>Others slavishly fear in their misery, but in their prosperity regard
nothing but their own will: These being called out, a few there be
remaining that truly fear God,<note place="margin">See B. <hi>Halls</hi> 3. epistle of his 6. <hi>Decad.</hi>
                     </note> for which he may justly have an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
controversie with this Land, that after so many happy means, so
few should be found that truly fear him, though many think they do:
How few keep Gods commandments all, alway with delight? let
every man examine himself carefully by these notes.</p>
                  <p>If any be loth, and would have a wider sieve, truly I can give
no wider, God hath given me no wider to let Hypocrites, Prophane
Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> scape through; I try you but by the Word, and by
it you must be judged at the last day.</p>
                  <p>But for those that do indeed fear God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> there's abundant comfort
for them,<note place="margin">Prov 31. 30.</note> they have that which is better then all the world;<note place="margin">Psal 112. 1. &amp; 128. 1.</note> yea,

of Gods children, not a few have but a small measure hereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it comes to pass, that they hate not sin so heartily in themselves and
others as they should, neither are such enemies to privy corruptions,
but that they break out often, and so pull many a sorrow and gripe of
Conscience upon themselves, which more fear of God would have
prevented: Our often falls argue too little fear, as may appear by our
small zeal to duties, and our little trembling at the Word of God;

indeed to look to our heart; if it be there, and temptation comes,

                  <p>Means to attain hereunto,<note place="margin">Means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the fear of God.</note> may be these, Let us often set before our
eyes our own baseness, Gods greatness, power and justice, with the
effects thereof on <hi>Adam,</hi> the old world, and others; especially do we
consider what God hath done for us, that so our care and resolution
may grow how to please God: If this religious awe be in us, O how
it will keep our lives from innumerable evils, and replenish them
with all goodness, that having finished them well, we may come to
the Lord in peace at our latter end: O if we did consider the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
mercies of God towards us, we should see cause enough, though
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65522:75"/>
there were no hell, yet to fear more then death it self to offend God;
but because our nature is so exceeding lewd and prone to sin, its good
to think often, that that God under whose power we live hates all sin,
and will not let any go unpunished: What cause have we then to grow
in the fear of God, that have seen his greatness and just displeasure
against sin so much, every year one punishment or other? What
cause have we also to fear God, that have such experiences of his
goodness in 88. when he delivered us from the Spanish Armado, and
after from the Gun-powder Treason, and now of late hath begun to
relent towards us,<note place="margin">A great drought, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615.</note> and gives us some showers of rain? But alas, if we
will prove our selves by the notes before mentioned, it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that most have not the fear of God, which is a fearful thing:
As no better testimony can be given of a man then this, that he feareth
God, as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Obadiah;</hi> so none more fearful then this, <hi>There's
no fear of God before his eyes,</hi>

even the tiles of their houses,<note place="margin">Iob 15. 2.</note> their tools, every stile they go over,
every crow that flies over their heads, all creatures, from the angels
to worms; they have cause to fear the bread they eat, the hair of their
own face, lest it choke them, yea, the thought of their own minde, lest it
turn to their ruine: And though haply they do not fear, yet they
have cause so to do, epecially lest the Devil pursue them in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and lest God should give him commission to haunt them and
theirs: They have cause to fear every thing, as <hi>Cain</hi> doubtless, that
every thing would kill him: a fearful state; yet none so bold as blinde
<hi>Bayard,</hi> none fear so little, as they who should fear most: well, they
that fear Gods judgements least, shall feel them most.</p>
                  <p>Let them therefore labor to get out of this case, and seek to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled

Can we spend our time better then in Gods? There is no part of it that

for Gods service, yea, think themselves hardly dealt with, if any
perswade them to leave their tricks of youth, and turn to
God; nay, they think it unseemly (so vile is the World grown)
to be Religious in youth, and that its never spent in the

repent afterward, when they have been married a while, and they be
groan somewhat ancient: Thus vile wretches dally with God, and
their souls, giving the wine to the Devil, reserving the lees and Cask
for God: But is thy Youth too good for God, thinkest thou? and is
not too good for the Devil and thy lusts? Who is the better Master?
Who pays the better wages? which is the better work? the Devils
Kennel stuff, or Gods service in righteousness and holiness? that
which thou must afterward unsay, and be ashamed of, or this that
is pleasing to God, and Angels? Fond Youth, that promises to thy
self repentance afterward, see thy folly, knowest thou that thou
shalt live? canst thou boast of to morrow? hath not God cut off
many as likely to live as thy self, and prevented their Repenrance?
Nay, what if thou knewest thou shouldest live, hast thou power to
Repent? do not many after they are grown ancient, finde as great a
let of the world, as in Youth they did of their pleasures? and have
become so worldly, that they have been as far from Repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ance as
before? and this is just with God, because they will take upon them
to be carvers of his gifts at their pleasure: And what if thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou shouldest both live and repent, yet were it not better for thee
to turn to God now, then to follow thy lusts till then, and so to be
long out of the service of righteousness? This were, as for one to
feed on draff and Hogs meat, which might have Angels food: And
besides, thou treasurest up a great deal of sorrow for thy self, and it
may be, fasten some punishment upon thee, such as thou shalt never
get out of in this life, though thy soul be saved: Therefore follow
the Lords counsel, who knows whats best for thee. Begin betimes,
come into the Lords work with the first, before the Devil hath train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy wit, tongue, &amp;c. so will it be easie to thee, and never depart
from thee, and (though there be a divelish proverb, A yong Saint, an
old Devil, yet) if thou be truly turned to God in thy youth, thou
shalt never fall off: Contrarily, they that take liberty to be yong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
in hope to be old Saints, if God snatch them away while they
be such, they will never prove either yong or old Saints.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemns those that can afford no part of their time to the

an account for their time, how they have spent their youth, how their

Devil, then shall they certainly have their wages, with whom they
have wrought.</p>
                  <p>3. This condemns also those that having come in late into the

for that he requires: Alas, none of us have done so, but spent a
great deal in vanity and lewdness, grievous to be spoken of, some
more, some less; every one of us have come short of that we should
have done: what then? This cannot be called back, it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;
and seeing we came not so early to the Lords work as we
should, we must now work the harder; The longer it was ere we
came, the more painful we must be, and employ us the faster, and
now be as earnest in goodness, as we have heretofore in vanity;
we must now speak as much for God, as heretofore for <hi>Baal,</hi> and
for goodness against the enemies thereof, as herefore in defence
of Sin.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As travellers that have loytered in their way, when they see
Night approach, ride hard; so let us be as earnest, and go as far to
draw men to God, as we were wont to call them to vanity; let old
men that came in so late, call upon yong men, and give them counsel
by their own miserable experience; and if any call us, let us go as
readily and gladly, as ever we did to any pastime, and the worse we
have been before, be now (as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) so much the more
zealous: What shall we say to those that came not in till the tenth or
eleventh hour, had they not need to work night and day? as also set
forward the work in others all that ever they can, calling on others,
and on their Families to this end, and spending all thier affections
about this? They cannot but vex to think how they have spent their
youth and middle age, thereupon wishing with all thier soul, that they
had spent the same in Gods service.</p>
                  <p>5. But for those that have long continued in this Christian course,<note place="margin">Use 5.</note>
they must not now leave off, but continue therein to the end. There's
no time wherein we must cast off our care, or lay away our Armor,
or be off our watch: What! must ancient Christians walk in awe
and fear of offending still? Alas, yea: Have they not still an evil
and false heart? Will the Devil ever be at peace? Nay, he laboreth
with old Christians most, that he may foil them in the end, to make
them call their estate, and all they have done into question, and to
shame their profession, and open their enemies mouthes: The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
are but scarcely saved;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 18.</note> all our diligence, watchfulness, care, is
little enough to carry us through this evil world, wherein so many
enemies lye in wait for our souls. Besides we see such famous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> those famous servants of God, who yet
in their old age at the waters of <hi>Meribah</hi> doubted, and did not glorifie
God,<note place="margin">Num. 20. 10, 11, 12.</note> but said, <hi>Hear ye rebels, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Noah,</hi> that had seen the old
world drowned, himself miraculously preserved, and been a Preacher
of Righteousnes so long, in his old age was caught with Wine, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65522:76"/>
uncovered in his Tent: So <hi>Solomon</hi> to whom God appeared twice,
and was the mirror of Wisdom, yet how fell he in his latter time?
so <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Joash.</hi> The Devil will say of an ancient Christian, This
man hath done me much hurt, hath been constant many years, and
many have followed him, now if I can foil him in his old age it will
be worth the while; so shall I make him call all the time past into
question,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 17. and 28. 14.</note> shake weak ones, make my company cry out, Look on this
old professor, they are all Hypocrites: Be we therefore in the fear of

O let ancient Christians look to themselves now a while, and anon
they shall be at their journeys end! so look to thy self, that as thou

                     <hi>Of your sojourning]</hi> We are here but for a little while,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> not Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
but sojourners,<note place="margin">Christians here in this world are but Sojourners.</note> and must away to our Countrey and Home in
Heaven: Therefore we must pass this little time so as we may honor
God, and so provide for our end, as that dying we may live for ever;
our life is so frail, as that it cannot (as I may so speak) be set out by
things frail enough:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> Its compared to a Tent, set up in the Morning,
pulled down at Night; some booths stand two or three days, some a

yea to nothing;<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 5.</note> whether we be eating, drinking, sleeping, waking,
playing, &amp;c. it continually runs on, and never stands at a stay: The
swiftest things have staid, even the Sun it self at <hi>Joshua</hi>'s prayer, but
not <hi>Joshua</hi>'s life, nor any mans: Many dye the same day they are born,
some the same year, some in their youth, and even they that live
longest, yet dye: We are as a Traveller that lodgeth in an Inn for a
Night, as a Player comes on the Stage to play his part, longer or
shorter, and comes away when its done; or as one that goes to the
Market, to buy one thing, and to sell another, and then home again.
Therefore we have great reason to spend the time of our sojourning
here in fear, we should spend that little time in well-doing to glorifie
God, do good in our places, and work out our own Savation; not
havocking away our precious time, or spending it about needless
things,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> as God hath given us this time, so to do the work that he hath
sent us hither for: This the Apostle requireth of the Galarians, <hi>As
we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,</hi> where's imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that having but a little while to tarry, we are to bestir our selves:
<hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might</hi> (saith the Preacher)
even whatsoever our duty doth any way require of us:<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>I must work

                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 9. 4.</note> so

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65522:77"/>
and lewdness, that we must after be ashamed of, such work as we shall
never have thanks for: Seeing we are but on this Stage, to play a
part and down again, it were meet we should play an honest Mans
part, the Christians part, the good Magistrates, the good Ministers
part, the good Husbands, the good Parents part; not a Thieves part,
nor a Cousener, nor the part of an idle Person.</p>

                  <p>2. This condemns the common sort,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> which will not consider of the
shortness of their life, though both the Scriptures and Experience
preach it continually, and therefore thinking the time long, care not
how they squander it away, and thereupon follow their pleasure, as
drinking, riotous living, &amp;c. even selling themselves hereto; and
so (to use their own Phrase) drive away the time: Alas, they need
not drive it, it runs fast enough, unless they spent it better: Others
are all for the world, toiling and moiling night and day, scraping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by hook and crook, and minde nothing else: Is this the work
for which God sent you into this world? Is Lying, Swearing,
Sabbath-breaking, Whoring, &amp;c. any of Gods work? pointed
he out any time for this? And did he set you here onely to rake for
the World, to Oppress, Deceive, gripe the Poor, &amp;c? No, but
to set forth his glory, and work out your own Salvation; but this
lies all undone, you never went about it, as neither to do good in
your places, in the Church, Common-wealth, Town, Family, &amp;c.
where you live: Now if you have done hurt to the glory of God,
your own Souls,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and to others by your ill example, have you not
(think you) spent your time well? A man hath two Servants, and
sends them to Market to sell his Corn, do Errands, buy Provision, &amp;c.
The one, when Market begins, gets him to an Ale-house with his
Companions, and there calls for beer by the yard, or by the dozen,
and sits quaffing, and prating, and gaming, and thereafter hath his
Harlot, thus holding on till Night, and then is the Market done:
The other being a worldly fellow, pitcheth down his Masters sack,
and spying good Commodities, he falls to look after them for his
own gain, and buyeth what's cheapest, and most profit to be had by,
and so he spends the day, wholly omitting his Masters business: Well,
Market is done, and all the people gone: Being come home,
their Master falls a reasoning, What, was it a good Market to day?
how sold the Corn? and have ye sold it all? have you brought Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision?
did you the Errand to such a Man? They answer, they
have not done any of those; No, saith he, what then? What have
you done, Sirrah? And what you? How spent you your time?
One makes answer, I went into an Ale-house to drink two or three
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65522:77"/>
pots, and good fellows came in so fast, and held me till Night, that I
could not do your business: The other saith, he saw there some good
Bargains and Penyworths to be had, and while he followed these for
himself, Market was done ere he was aware: would not the Master
hereupon pull the coats of these varlets over their ears? would he
not discard them in his displeasure, yea and get them punished? yet
thus for all the world do most men with God; Some hunting after
their pleasures, as others after the things of this world: Well, let
them that have hitherto mis-spent and lost their time, let them, I say,
yet ere Night come, bethink themselves and fall to their work, and
dispatch it ere Market be done, and thank God that they be yet alive:
Its better to be a living Dog then a dead Lyon;<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 4.</note> thank God thou hast
yet an hour, and use it well. There be thousands in Hell, that if they
had the whole world, would give it for one hour here upon earth,
and if it were so much worth to them, its as much worth to thee, that
hast lost all the hours of thy life hitherto; O therefore whilest thou
hast yet an hour, bestir thee, for the night approacheth: Thou hast
plaid a bad mans part hitherto, now ere thou goest off the stage, unsay
that part, and tell the world it was not that part thou shouldest have
plaid; now begin the honest mans part, defer not all thy work to the
last, as most men do, that think when they be sick, and fear they shall
dye, Oh, then they will send for a Minister, and as though we could
work miracles, we must teach them in a rice the whole way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and, O I pray you give me some good counsel, I sent for you to
speak a few comfortable words to me, and then either the Minister
daubeth with untempered morter (which is a just judgement) or if he
be faithful, and begin to wade into his misery, this he thinks to be
strange; Oh, I sent for you to tell me some-words of comfort, not
to speak so much and such things to me. And let all good Christians
be wise, let us think of our brittle state, lets ply us, and be doing all
the good we can to our selves or others; and do not we put off from
time to time, I will next year take up prayers more constantly, when
such a business shall be over; I will be liberal hereafter, or at my
death, I hope I shall do my duty in due time; O fie upon it, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should say. Hereafter, and be bold to put off time, and in the mean
time we dye; Oh, do all the good we should now, lest on our death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with grief we be forced to say, Oh, I thought to have left this sin,
done that duty, &amp;c. if I had lived a year longer, I would have put off
some of my dealings that have clogg'd me, given up some of my
Farms; I purposed to have got out of the Usurers books, and never
take that course more; I purposed to have done more service to the
Town where I live, more good then ever, and now death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents

whereof the first is, Because they call'd God Father, it was
therefore meet they should walk as children in awe and reverence, and
that not when and wherein they list, but in all things, for he cannot be
their Father unless they be his Children. An impregnable reason, That
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65522:78"/>
they which call such an holy God Father,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> should walk in fear and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
as sons:<note place="margin">Such as call God Father, must walk in fear and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as sons.</note> No Father without sons, and the very name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
calleth for reverence and obedience; Therefore when God
would include all Superiors (to whom reverence and obedience is
due) Magistrates, Ministers, Masters, Governors, &amp;c. he calls them
in one word,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 12.</note> Fathers; even as he that calleth one Master, thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
service and obedience, and the King his Soveraign, professeth
subjection, so calling God Father, we do thereby make known our
filial awe and reverence.<note place="margin">See Mal. 1. 6.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the name of Father (which we ascribe to our Fathers) as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
one to be the Author of our Being,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 18.</note> and that we owe him
obedience,<note place="margin">What the name Father im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth.</note> so we challenge much of him, as that he should have a
care of us, to preserve us, defend us, and provide for us all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for thus do Fathers to their children, especially their dutiful ones;
in like maner when we call God Father, we both ascribe so much to
him, and profess to look for so much from him, as that it requireth
of us to pass our time in a reverent awe of him in all things.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns them that live wickedly,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and in their sins, and
yet call God Father; they might as well say any thing: If one should
fight against the King on his Enemies part, and say he were a good
Subject; or say he is a mans servant, and yet doth nothing that he is
bidden, but is drunken, quarrels with his fellow-servants, beats his
Master children, breaks down his windows, rails upon him, should
this be counted a good servant, or the other a good subject? so the
Lord defies that such should call him Father, and counts it a disgrace
to him to be call'd Father of such miscreants,<note place="margin">See Psal. 50. 16</note> that live like bastards,
that have no care to please God,<note place="margin">Ier. 3. 3, 4.</note> no fear of offending him,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 46.</note> nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to be in his presence: We should take it as a disgrace to have
some base and filthy person come in a market to us, and call us father,
yet this may and doth befal men, yea, good too, who have lewd
children, and such be like them neither in favor nor condition: yea,
there's scarce one childe like the Father, or one like another; but its
nor so with God, he hath never a childe but is like him, and hath his
image in him,<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 2. ver. 15. of this 1 Iohn 3. 9.</note> like hearted and like handed to him, innocent hands,
and a pure heart, <hi>holy as he is holy,</hi> hating sin as he he doth, loving his
Word, People, Righteousness, &amp;c. as he doth, <hi>He that is born of God, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not:</hi> Those are true properties of a childe of God; yet even others
have a father too, Christ hath pointed him out, <hi>Ye are of your Father
the Devil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>and the lusts of your Father you will do:</hi> Such as care for no
goodness, nor for Gods children, but are Lyars, Deceivers, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
and the like, they are like the Devil; God is not their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but their Enemy, with such all the Angels and Creatures are at
defiance, and wait for their destruction; all the judgements of God
hang over their heads, their death will be a passage to their endless wo
and misery.</p>
                  <p>Therefore never call God Father till thou change thy maners, nor
look for any priviledge of a childe from him, as either protection or
maintenance, no nor so much as good look: But shall I thus leave
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65522:78"/>
these? God forbid; for though we finde them children of the Devil, yet
we would be glad to bring them to be Gods: Therefore humble your
selves, confess your sins, as the Publican and the Prodigal, entreat
and sue for Pardon, change thy behaviour, and when thou canst feel thy
heart effected like a Childe, or truly desirous so to be, then call him
Father: In the mean time, if thou wouldest mourn for thy sins, and
labor for a contrite heart,<note place="margin">See 2 Cor. 6. 17.</note> and abstain from every unclean thing, thou
shouldest be received, thy sins pardoned, and God would be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto thee; But if thou goest on in this graceless course, as thou
workest, so shall thy wages be.</p>

calling as a Christian, to walk holily, righteously, and soberly?
Fearest thou to offend God thy self, or to see him dishonored by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
carest thou to please him? lovest thou to be in his presence?
dost thou conscionably hear his Word, and patiently bare his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
2. In thy special calling, art thou careful to glorifie God,
as a Parent, Childe, Master, Servant, &amp;c. not onely in ceasing
to do evil, but in doing good, yea, and laboring to do it well?
Thou mayest comfortably, and with good leave call God Father, and
make account of him so to be,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 12.</note> which is the greatest priviledge in the

things in this world, and Salvation in the Kingdom of Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:

Death no Death, but a passage to Life: O let us be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to increase more and more in this care, and every time we call
God Father, we may be put in minde, and provoked to labor for the
affections of dutiful Children! We can readily look that God should
be a Father to us, that we want nothing, but we for our parts, can
be content to be wanting in our duties many ways, we neglect this
and that duty; yea, in those we perform, how cold are we, little
differing from Hypocrites? how often do we break out into gross
evils? how little grieved, when we offend or see others offend? for
these the Lord is often driven to afflict us. As its between natural
Parents and Children, we see that love descends, but seldom ascends;
They look for all maintenance from their Parents, but care little how
small reverence or obedience they give them; So we deal with God,
our head must not ake a little, but he must presently give ease, but
we can be slack enough in the performance of our parts.</p>
                  <p>

Here's the second Reason,<note place="margin">The second Reason of the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> He whom we call Father, is also a
Judge, and that a very sharp-fighted one, that will not be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with shows, and false glosses of good works, but will look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the inside, and judge accordingly; If they proceed from an honest
heart, he will surely reward them, if not, they shall not onely miss
the reward they look for, but have, for all their gay shows, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with Hypocrites: Therefore it stands us in hand not onely to
renounce evil, and to do good, but to do the same with a right affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

Here I might speak how God judgeth,<note place="margin">How God doth and will judge of mens actions.</note> and will judge mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
as 1. In this life he approveth the ways of his Servants by
his Word, and by his blessings upon them outward and inward; and
disalloweth the wicked actions of the World,<note place="margin">1. In this life.</note> and their courses, by his

                  <p>But because this is not the main drift of the Apostle, I pass it over

2. That it be done in Faith, or a particular perswasion of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the thing done.<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 4.</note> 3. It must proceed from a sanctified heart,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note>
else the fountain being impure, makes the sacrifice or work abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> 4. It must be done to a good and right end, our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
and the good of our brethren, as inferior ends, but the main
end, the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>1. Here are rejected all the works of natural and unregenerated
men,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> all the civil vertues in the Heathen Philosophers, their Justice,
Temperance,<note place="margin">Splendida per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata.</note> Liberality, Fortitude, contempt of the World, Patience,
and the like, which great works of theirs were but shining sins: So
the actions of such as are meerly civil, though never so fair condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the world-ward, these are in no account with God, nay their
hearing, praying, Alms-giving, are abominable, till their persons
please God, and be sanctified; and all such, though haply of great age,
did never in thoughtword, or deed please God, trust nor then to these
things: Oh, many will brag with the Pharisee of their just dealing,
but resting thereon, they shall have the Pharisees reward. Many a
poor man will say, I thank God I have lived honestly, followed my
work, earned my living truly, no man can say, Thus and thus hast thou
done amiss; but even this not done to a right end and in a right maner,
is sin.</p>
                  <p>O but Christ loved the rich yong man,<note place="margin">Object.</note> though not yet converted.</p>
                  <p>He loved that seed or good that was in his own work,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but not the
person.</p>
                  <p>2. Here are rejected all works of Hereticks,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> though never so cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
devour, painful; as their early rising to Mass, their painful travel
on Pilgrimage, their costly gifts to Religious houses: So of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that coming into the Temples of their gods, throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
down on the ground, smite themselves on the breasts, &amp;c. of
all these being done without Faith, God will say, <hi>Who required these
things at your hands?</hi> The faster one runs in a wrong way, the further
he is out, and the longer ere he come in.</p>
                  <p>3. Here are rejected the works of hypocrites and carnal Gospellers,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
which make a profession, hear, receive the Lords Supper, joyn in
outward performance of duty, but look not to themselves, their hearts
remaining tainted with their lusts: Such as yet live in some sins, may
go to Hell with Water of Baptism on their faces, and the Bread of the
Lord in their mouthes. They care not how works be performed, but
slubber them over, so they be out of their hands, they care not how;
these will be paid according to their work: They make sale ware for
the Lord, slight and of no substance, but this the Lord cannot abide,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65522:80"/>
he will have it substantial: If it come not inwardly from a good
heart, let the outside be what it will, its but like a painted Tomb or
gilded Idol, hollow within, that cannot speak. We are here met to
day to hear Gods Word, a good work, an excellent work, if all came
with an upright heart, God requiring it, and that we should know his
will, and in all things be ruled thereby, but few be such; but when
they have heard all they can, yet do as they list, at least in part: Its
true, <hi>Ahabs</hi> hypocritical repentance was rewarded with a temporal
benefit, but not for love of the work, but for example to others, how
well God would reward things done in truth.</p>
                  <p>4. Let this teach all Gods servants,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> not onely to have a care to do
duties (so can hypocrites) but to do them in a right maner: Herein
lies the difficulty to bring our vile hearts to do them aright, else the
doing of the duty is an easie thing, and no straight way, if that were
all; but we have a wretched heart, full of inwindings and privy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
that cannot be seen to others when we do our duties, for even
sundry of them are unknown to our selves, pride, hypocrisie, dulness,
earthliness, unbelief, and the like; look therefore when we Hear, Pray,
give Alms, follow our Callings, or whatsoever, that we do it well and
substantially, using all skill and diligence, for we have a God with
whom we deal, that looks to the inside, and hates all slightings; and
he will pay well, cares not what he gives so the work be done well.
Commonly men that be good husbands, will look to have their work
well done; so doth the Lord, and he pays presently in hand, Peace
of Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, with divers outward Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
besides the inheritance reserved for us hereafter.</p>

and Slavery;<note place="margin">Redemption presupposeth Bondage and Slavery.</note> neither is the bondage wherein we stand, such as of
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or the Turks, but Ten thousand times worse, even of Sin,
and of the Devil; God indeed made us free in <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin nor Satan
had nothing to do with us, but we all sinning in <hi>Adam,</hi> became sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
not onely to the Wrath and Curse of God, the first and second
death, and the forerunners of both, but to sin also, and so by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we can do nothing but sin, we drink sin, as a thirsty man doth
water; Its as natural to us, as for the fire to burn: So fast is our will
bound to the will of the Devil, that for our lives we cannot think
a good thought. Now as all bondage is abhort'd of the nature of
man, so the baser person one is in bondage too, the more odious it is to
them that see it, and the more tedious to themselves that bear it: Now
none so base in the world, as sin and the Devil, the woful enemies
of God and our souls.</p>
                  <p>This should humble us all,<note place="margin">Use.</note> being in this woful case, and so would
it do if we could be brought to believe it:<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 33.</note> But (as the Jews) we think
we were never in bondage to any, and finding our bodies at liberty,
conceive so of our souls, whereas both be in a spiritual bondage unto
evil: Nay, such is our woful bondage, as we cannot believe we are in
it, nor can desire to come out of it, but naturally we love and desire it,
&amp; thereupon are enemies to the means of our freedom: most think that
if they may have their lusts satisfied and fetch their flings in all maner
of evil, some of pleasure, some of their unconscionable dealing, &amp;c.
O its a little Heaven! O such Towns and Houses where they may
thus have their wills, are the onely places! but for the Towns and
Services where they may not thus lash out, but are restrained, and
must be brought to the Word, Prayer, Reading, Repetition, Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
and the like, O fie upon it, say they, Here's a Bondage, a
Slavery, who would be tyed thus? If my year be our once, Ile lay
a stone there, &amp;c. This is a hard saying, who can bear it? <hi>Let us
break their bands, and cast their coards from us:</hi> If this Preaching be
suffered, we shall do nothing shortly, we shall not be merry, we shall
have our hands bound behinde us: Thus counting Gods service,
which is perfect Freedom, to be Bondage, they hold their woful Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
to be the onely Liberty, and therefore are not onely willing so
to continue, but are against the means of their Delivery, which is a
great depth of bondage: for let one be a slave to the Turks never so
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65522:81"/>
though his body be bound, yet his minde is free, he retains an
earnest desire to be set at liberty: well, men must see it, and feel it,
else they shall never be delivered, and if they dye in this case, they
must have their wages according to the work.</p>
                  <p>2. That there is a way out of this bondage,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> for our parts we could
finde none,<note place="margin">There's a way whereby to come out of our bondage.</note> we could desire none; nay, God of his infinite mercy
having found it out, and prepared it, we have no desire of it: This
indeed is a great and wonderful mercy; He might have been glorified

as he hath for us. It followeth hereupon,</p>
                  <p>1. Seeing there is away of Redemption,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that all that know not
themselves delivered, must give all diligence, that they may have
their part in it: Believe Gods Word that thou art now in Bondage,

now serve God, and that under the hope of eternal Life: They must
study how to shew their thankfulness in all dutiful obedience all the
days of their life; If any were ransom'd from the Turk, doth he
not count himself his that hath ransom'd him? so should we: <hi>As
we have yielded our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note>
                     <hi>so must we now yield them as instruments of righteousness unto God:</hi> We
have taken great pains for the world and vanity, forgot our meat and
sleep, thought the time short, feared ever we should come too late,
have pleaded for <hi>Baal:</hi> O lets now do so for goodness, we have spent
our substance on lewd persons, &amp; to follow our lusts, now let us spend
it in the service of God, and on Gods Children! O lets not serve the
Devil and sin in any point more forwardly then God! we must glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God in Body and Spirit;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> we must have neither Heart, Tongue,
Wit, Will, Eye, Ear, but for the Lord, and all to be at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
O that we would often think of our Redemption, both from
whence and to what! This would make us gather up our feet in our
Masters service more roundly, and call home our ranging Wits,
Wills, and parts from following our Lusts, to yield better obedience
to God.</p>

of the Jews, both their worshipping of God, and the rest of their
lives; It was empty, and therein was no substance, as a blown blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

to follow it; to follow their Parents, I say, which were corrupt both
in their Lives, and the worship of God: Concerning the corruption
of their Fathers, its to be understood, not of all, for God had his
among them: <hi>Abraham</hi> was a true worshipper of God, and a sincere
man in his conversation,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 18.</note> and so taught he his Family, and lost not
his labor: So <hi>Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua,</hi> and the Prophets; In
this respect the Apostle said,<note place="margin">Acts 24. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>I worship the God of my Fathers.</hi>

against the second:<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. and 23. 23.</note> Afterwards it was worse with them, They cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the true and sound interpretation of the Law; They were full
of Hypocrisie and Ostentation, and would set up their own Traditions,
and make them equal with the Word of God;<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>They taught for Doctrine</hi>
(even things necessary to Salvation, and parts of Gods worship) <hi>the

so set themselves above God:<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 4, 5, 6.</note> the former was fearful, but this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
blasphemous, as by their Corban they set a Son free from any

                  <p>This condemneth the Papists,<note place="margin">Popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion stands in patches.</note> for they are nothing but inventions;

whole round Cakes, the Priests forsooth for holiness, putting the
same in the peoples mouthes? (with their polluted hands they must
not touch it) as if their mouthes being clean, their hands could be
unclean? How by keeping away the Cup altogether? how by taking
away that plain apparel which Christ and his Disciples used, and
bringing in costly apparel, like that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> fitter for an Emperor?
Not to speak of their Altars, Musick, Elevation, Censing, Reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
Fastings, Vows, Pilgrimages, set numbers and stints of
Prayers, and that upon Beads, their Penances, Indulgences, &amp;c.
one devised one thing, another another thing, those that came after
not being willing to be behinde herein them that went before: Thus
ceased they not, till they had filled all with trash; and then lest
they should be loathed and laught at, they began to urge them more
stifly, and enjoyn them under pain of great sin to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>They also prefer their own Traditions before Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Usually they count it more hainous to work on an Holy-day,
or Saints-day of their own devising, then on the Lords-day: So to
eat a bit of flesh on Friday, then to commit whoredom all the days
of the Week: So to speak against any of their toys, when to swear
or take Gods Name in vain; The one is punisht more severely, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Here may be also noted, That</p>

                     <hi>Not with corruptible things, as silver and gold,]</hi> The things whereby
we are not Redeemed, are silver and gold; These he names in stead
of all other worldly things,<note place="margin">Pro. 10. 19.</note> as which answer all, and by them
Houses, Lands, yea, the most costly things, and most precious
Pearls are bought.</p>
                  <p>By these men may be ransomed and redeemed out of bodily Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
but all the silver and gold in the world is insufficient to redeem
even one man out of his Spiritual bondage:<note place="margin">The things of this world are insufficient to redeem any out of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bondage.</note> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons hereof may be these,</p>
                  <p>1. God hath no need of any of these things, and they are his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note>
                     <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof; The gold of Ophir
and Havilah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>as are the beasts on a thousand mountains.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Our soul is an immortal and incorruptible being,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> a Creature
that had a beginning, but never shall have end: Now gold and silver
are things corruptible and vanishing, therefore are not of worth or
value to redeem or countervail the soul; for there must be some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between the thing bought and the price given, so is there
not between the world, and the soul of a man; one soul is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then the whole world.</p>
                  <p>3. Sin is a transgression against an Infinite God,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> and so deserveth
an infinite punishment, a death, and that eternal and infinite: now
a death must be paid, Gods justice hath set it down, no such price
therefore will be taken, neither are these things infinite, all the
world is not.</p>
                  <p>4. Many times even for a Trespass committed against men,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> these
things will not be taken for a recompence.<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 35.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:65522:83"/>
5. These often,<note place="margin">Reas. 5.</note> when God sends some bodily judgement, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to do men any pleasure,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 4.</note> nor can at all pacifie God.<note place="margin">Ezek. 7. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. These cannot redeem a mans bodily life,<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 18.</note> and save it from death
(for many would give much to procure that) nor can they prolong a
mans (ones own brothers) life an hour beyond his appointed time,<note place="margin">Reas. 6.</note>
much less can they redeem his soul.<note place="margin">Psal. 49. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. These cannot purchase Wit,<note place="margin">Reas. 7.</note> Learning, Eloquence for those
that want them, much less Sanctification and Grace; as also if a
man were born Blinde, Lame, Deformed, they cannot purchase Sight,
Strength or Beauty.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns those gross Absurdities,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> nay, Blasphemies of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they by Pardons and Indulgences, sold for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
take upon them to forgive sins; yea, they give those to houses
of Gentlemen, for many years to come, perswading also, that by
their Masses (which they must purchase with their Money) they shall
be freed from Purgatory, and sent to Heaven: Among them, belike
the rich are in a good case, they may sin freely, but the poor are in
an hard taking: O cursed Blasphemy! None can forgive sins but
God onely; yea, whereas all the Silver and Gold of the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
satisfie for one sin, yet will they set it at such and such a rate of
Money: It may be said to them, as <hi>Peter</hi> said to <hi>Simon Magus, Your
Money perish with you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 8. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>because you think that the gift of God</hi> (such a
special gift as is the Remission of sins) <hi>may be bought with Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. We must learn by any means not to hazard or sell our souls
for Silver or Gold,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> not for the whole world: If a man should
sell his soul for the whole world, would the same price redeem it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?
no, not if there were ten thousand worlds: Then is it a very
hard bargain to sel any commodity at such a rate, as a man would give
a thousand times as much for it again, and yet must go without it;
what shall I say of the common sort, which so basely esteem of their
souls, that they sell them away to destruction for toys of this world:
How many sell themselves to hell, some by Robbery, Bribery, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Simony, Sacriledge, Cousenage, Lying, Swearing, &amp;c. others
for a bare living and maintenance? O poor woful Creatures! They
know not what they do: They are like yong Heirs, that know not the
worth of their Inheritance, and so part with all to some couzening
companion for a Horse, Dog, or Hawk, nothing to the true worth of
it, and then fret to think that they had such a living whereby they
might have lived in good fashion all their life, and now its gone, and
they have nothing, but like prophane <hi>Esau</hi>'s have lost their birth-right:
O if men knew the worth of their souls, they would then despise the
whole world if it were offered for them,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 9, 10.</note> but an <hi>Omnia Dabo</hi> pulls most
of the world upon their knees to worship the Devil: Many Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
say, they would not give their lying for Forty pounds a
year; but poor blinde Creatures, yong Heirs, if they gate Forty
thousand pounds a year, they were great losers, for if they would
give it, and as much more to it, it would not recover their souls
again from Damnation thereby deserved; Oh, the soul lives for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65522:83"/>
ever, and sin casts it into everlasting Wo and Torment: And for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
a few short pleasures of sin,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25.</note> shall we throw our selves into
everlasting torment? <hi>Moses</hi> would not thus do, but left <hi>Pharoahs</hi>
court and the delights thereof, which he could not hold without sin:
O lets be wise at last, and royally set such a price on our souls, as if the
Devil would say as he did to Christ, <hi>All this will I give thee,</hi> we
may tell him he bids like an higler, and if he would give us seven
worlds,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> we would not part with our Souls.</p>
                  <p>3. We wust be more afraid of sin, then of any thing else, seeing the
price is so great that must satisfie for it, even more then the loss of all
that we have: If we should commit sin to save all we have, we lose;
But how little account do men make of sin, whereas nothing but
Christs blood can satisfie for it? If we were set to pay Twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
for every sin we commit, how shie would we be? but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the very greatest sum can neither take it away, nor pay for it,
we ought to be the more careful; but, O Lord, men commit sin as if an
half peny would satisfie for it, nay, a straw under their feet: Thus do
many rap out oathes, others talk ribaldry, others lye, others rail,
curse, backbite, &amp;c. The devil thinks, nay he knows he doth us a
greater spight to make us sin,<note place="margin">Iob 1. 11.</note> then to pluck away all that we have;
see this in his dealing with <hi>Job,</hi> he desired to spoil him of his goods,
Why? because he hoped thereby to bring him to blaspheme God;
and its true, he doth us more mischief by bringing us to commit one
sin, then by stripping us of all the estate we have: O do not that,
which when done,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> all the world cannot make amends for.</p>
                  <p>But what are these things?<note place="margin">The things of this world are corruptible, vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</note> what's their nature and quality? they are
corruptible things, vain, uncertain, of no continuance; fire consumeth
houses, water wares, death cattel, land is subject to barrenness, to bad
titles, wranglings, enemies, all these outward things, sick of a consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:
They may hold out for a time, but at length perish; nay, our
selves and our own lives as frail as any thing,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> a bubble, a shadow, a
vapor (as we heard larely) yea,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> the very heavens shall pass away.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore be not proud of these things, alas, they be gifts of
Gods left hand,<note place="margin">Pro. 23. 5.</note> common to the bad and good, also they have eagles
wings,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> and are uncertain: And yet how do these things lift up mens
mindes, and make them contemn their brethren? and so lordly, that
they are not fit to be spoke too, froward, contentious, &amp;c. there's lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
cause they should so do, but rather make them the more humble,
for the more a man hath, the greater account he is to make: If of any
thing, be proud of grace (yet not of that) and disdain not a poor
Christian;<note place="margin">Iames 2. 5.</note> for though he have no wealth, yet if he have more grace
then thou hast, he is the better man, I mean in the sight of God, who
therefore is not to be contemned for his poverty.</p>
                  <p>2. Trust not in them,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> let them not be thy strong city; hereof <hi>Job</hi>
particularly acquits himself,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> and so should we.<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Esteem of riches accordingly,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 24.</note> and seek them in their place:
To this purpose peruse <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 19, 20, 33.<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:65522:84"/>
4. This condemns the common sort,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> that seek after nothing else,
as if there were no other heaven, nor other end of mans being here:
Multitudes seek after them by right and wrong, yea, the most unlawful
and vile courses: Others not so openly evil, yet so seek these things,
as regarding them more then that one thing that is needful, being so
addicted hereto, that in the whole day they cannot spare one quarter
of an hour for prayer in their family; so in the whole week no leisure
to break off and hear a Sermon, nay, Sabbath and all, onely coming
to Church (and some scarcely that) but will lose as little time as
they can, for they will talk of the world till they come to the Church
door, and in many places in the very Church, and as soon as they
are out again, to it again: With them every little time for God and
the Soul is too much, no time for the world enough; every small
measure of knowledge, a shadow of any thing in that kinde is much,
but much of the world seems yet small: <hi>Mammon</hi> is much beholding
to them, God and their Soul but a little; therein they are wise, and
have tongue enough in such things, none at all in heavenly matters,
and so they bring up their children, and so match them: Thus they
set the cart before the horse, and speed in their souls accordingly; yet
is one dram of Faith Repentance, Knowledge, worth all the silver and
gold in the world. Yea, its not onely the fault of the common sort,
that they see no better things, but even of Gods children, that have
the substance, and yet will be catching at the shadow; so did not
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> they dwelt in Tents, and counted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Pilgrims, neither regarded <hi>Moses</hi> the pleasures of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But with the precious blood of Christ]</hi> Here's the true price of our
Redemption:<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> Its true,<note place="margin">Christs blood the true price of mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> we are redeemed by the whole course of Christs
obedience, which he performed from his birth to his death; but its
ascribed here particularly to his death and suffering, being the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part of his obedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> whereby he satisfied Gods justice for our
sins (by his blood,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> is here meant, all his sufferings from his beginning,
and that not onely visible from men in his body, but the inward ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of God upon his Soul, yea and death it self) and no less pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would serve the turn for us, for by our sin we had deserved death
of body and Soul, the first and second: Therefore blood must be
shed, death must be paid, else Gods justice cannot be satisfied; well, be
it so, Would not then the death of some Saints have done the turn?
All men are inwrapped in one and the same Condemnation, unable to
help themselves, much less others: Neither could the very Angels
help us, for having sinned against an infinite God, we deserved an
infinite punishment, which being finite, we could never overcome;
therefore it must be blood of Jesus Christ, his that was both man,
that he might suffer, and as mans nature had offended, therein give
satisfaction; and God, that he might make his sufferings of
infinite worth and value, and that he might overcome the same;
therefore it is called Precious, by reason of the hypostatical union of
the Divine Nature therewith, and so was the blood of that man that
was God, and so after a sort, the blood of God: Hence he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <p>But how could he in so short a time dispatch that which was infinite,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and
we should have lien under for ever?</p>
                  <p>Because he was God.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> It was more that he should suffer for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then all men and Angels for ever: As a rich man is able to pay
that debt in an instant, that a poor man can never be able to winde out
of; so did he that quickly, which we could never have done: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let every man trust to this; if this be not a sufficient way, thou
mayest say, I am content to perish; thou mayest well enough, and I
with thee for company.</p>
                  <p>1. This confoundeth all other false and devised satisfactions by
any other,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and sheweth the most fearful state of all that know not nor
embrace Christ; as 1. The Jews that look for another Christ: 2. The
Turks that trust in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and do not acknowledge Christ; so the
Pagans that are utterly ignorant of him: The Papists also that make
him but half a Saviour, and adde a number of other Merits and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
with their blasphemous Idol of the Mass, their Pilgrimages,
Penances, &amp;c. yea, not onely say they are the sufferings of the Saints,
meritorious for themselves, but even to put something into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
treasury to help others: These also among our selves that hope
to be saved by their good meaning, good prayers, and civil life, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do not at all look to Christ, or but to halves, being as good as not
at all; So those that make God an Idol, all of mercy, and no justice,
when as they are both essentially in him, and he could not be God
without both, and the one is infinite in him as the other; yet by crying
God mercy, they think to escape, never considering how his justice
should be answered; but he should not be just, nor God, if he should
let thy sins go unpunished.</p>
                  <p>2. This sheweth the fearfulness of sin,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> such was our case that (as if one
had committed a fault, and there were no way to scape, unless he
could obtain the Kings son to dye for him) we could not but perish,

avoid it above all things in the world, look upon every sin in blood;
no sin but hath a bloody face, when we have committed it, all the
world cannot satisfie for it, it must be blood, the blood of the Son

sin were't not fearful? but its Christ Blood, therefore how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
should we be? But, O Lord, How small account is made of sin!
How doth the world make a May-game thereof? How do men think
they can appease Gods Wrath with a broken sigh, or a Lord have
mercy upon us, for we are all Sinners, or by making some counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
shew in their sickness, or on their death-bed? And do not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
think that it may be done away by auricular Confession, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Pilgrimages, Holy-water, Popes Pardons, the saying over of so
many Ave-maries, Paternosters, &amp;c. But those that set so light by
sin, are such as never knew the weight of it, nor have part in the
remedy; and therefore in vain do such say, they hope to be saved by
Jesus Christ, and he dyed, and shed his Blood for their sins, and yet
they still live in sin: What is this but to make a light account of
Christs blood?<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> a treading of it under foot? an accounting of it an
unholy thing? a despiting of the Spirit of grace? Yea, if even
Gods Children did so weigh this unspeakable price as they should,
they would be more afraid to offend then they are: This also should
awaken those that know no part in their Redemption, that they have
the greatest matter in the world to seek; Such should never be quiet,

that so we might be freed: What man would beat his Son,
to spare his Servant? What man would kill his Son, to save his

death?<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> yet all this hath the Lord done; <hi>God so loved the world:</hi> O wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that the Father did not rather suffer all the world to perish, then
that his most blessed Son should suffer the least of those indignities
that he indured! And was not the love of Christ infinite, that for us
gave himself, and did willingly lay down his life for us, which could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65522:86"/>
do nothing to deserve or requite it, nay, which were his very enemies?
so to endure such base and cruel dealing from men, who himself was
Lord of the world, and could have commanded the earth to swallow
them, so to be spitted on, mocked, scourged, nailed to the cross, &amp;c.
but above all, that he would undergo his Fathers displeasures for us
Rake-hells that had so provoked him.</p>

give himself to serve and be bond for us, yet more; but to lay down
his life for us, a Superior for inferiors, yea for enemies most of all;
so far and all this hath Christ done for us, How then should this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
and break our hearts to love, and cause us out of love to serve
him? O woful dulness in us and unthankfulness, that can say, We
have part in such a Redemption, from such a misery to such a glory,
and by such a price, and yet can be ready to think every thing too
much for him! How dull are we, and slow to do his service, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, Prayer, and other duties? How quickly are we weary
of well doing? How think we every little time too much for him,
that thought not his pains, his abasement, nay his life and heart-blood
too much for us? When we have him asking us in his poor members
some small refreshing, how hardly and sparingly (if at all) doth it
come from us? nay, we will not part with our lusts and sinful affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
at his request: Will we give our lives for him, and not our

though we grieve him not again by our unthankfulness: O
that we would labor to gratifie him by all means possible: To this
end do we often meditate of this price, come we oft to the Sacrament,

was so in his life,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 46.</note> Who could accuse him of sin?<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 4, 24.</note> so also in his death,

Is this a new trick, or rather is it not the old course of Satan to raise

he was not a new way devised of late, and that after Four thousand

decreed beforetime; for nothing comes to pass without Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(for then were not he infinite in Wisdom) nor without his

                  <p>How could this be,<note place="margin">Object.</note> seeing there was no need of Christ till after the world

                  <p>The remedy was ordained before the misery;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> was, but not before
the misery was foreknown to be: Thus was the Lords order, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all time set down this to glorifie himself: How? In the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some of mankinde, and condemnation of others: Well, how
could he bring this to pass? he decreed to make man male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
and to make them holy; he decreed also to leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that falling, he might make a way for the glorifying of his
mercy and justice, which if man had continued righteous, had been
stopt up; then he decreed to give his Son to redeem the vessels of
mercy. Now for his decreeing of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, let it not seem strange;
he did not onely foresee, but decree it, yet so, as he is altogether free
from any fault thereof: God, Man and the Devil had all a hand in
that action, yet man and the Devil most guilty, and the Lord most
free, as may appear partly by their diverse ends that they aymed at,
and partly by their maner of bringing it to pass. Their ends; God
aymed to glorifie his mercy in saving some, and his justice in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
others; a good end: The Devils aym was to strip the Lord
of any creature on earth to serve him, and to overthrow all mankinde:
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> they listened to the Devil, counting God as it were a
lyar (that had threatned them when there was nothing so) and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of their good estate, therefore thought without him to thrust
themselves up into his seat, and make themselves equal with him; two
vile ends: for the maner also there are great odds; God effects it thus,
He makes man an holy and happy creature, gives him a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to exercise his obedience, gives him power to obey, useth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to have him take heed of breaking it, threatens death thereupon,
onely leaves him to himself, and to the Devils temptations, yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
armed to resist him, onely follows him not with new grace,
which he was not bound to do: Who can finde any fault in this? The
Devil effects it by alluring and tempting them to do that which God
forbade, and that by his vile lyes: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> they believe the
Devil, and break the Commandment of their Creator: Who can

Hath the Devil? nothing done but what he perswaded to: Hath <hi>Adam</hi>

godly they are restored to a better condition in Christ, then they lost
in <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. The wicked they are never punished till they have justly

are they justly to be blamed.</p>

thus graciously to plot a remedy so soon, which no man could have
done, God like a Father did plot and forecast for us: If we had been
left without a remedy, or must have shifted for one, it had gone ill
with us. Now as this should make us love the Lord for his goodness
and care, so what a comfort is this to poor souls, that seeing their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
desire above all the world to be delivered out of the same; Shall
these miss of it, if they seek it of God with humble heart? If the
Lord had this care of his Church ere it was, will he suffer it to want
any thing now, that is, if it seek it of him? Did the Lord ordain a
remedy before the world was? was he so careful? and now will he
not bestow this remedy on all that truly desire it? Will a Father be
so provident to lay up corn and necessaries into his house, before there
be need of them; and when need is, and the children call and cry for
bread, will he deny it them?</p>

Christ:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Was he fore-ordained of the Father, and did he come and

and unthankfulness! yet how few seek him? how few seek him aright?

as that they shall not obtain such a benefit as this.</p>

                     <hi>Before the foundation of the world,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obs.</note> As the foundation of the world
was laid,<note place="margin">The world shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue.</note> so it may and shall be unlaid, and pull'd down, and that by
him that laid it: The time will come, when <hi>the Elements shall melt,</hi>
&amp;c.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 10.</note> when the earth, with all the works therein shall be consumed with
fire. As all things here be frail, and of no continuance or certainty,
but subject to many alterations; so the world it self, that hath worn
out many generations of people, it self shall have an end, already
waxeth old.</p>
                  <p>Trust not to it,<note place="margin">Use.</note> it will deceive all that do; Its like a great round
Bowl, whereon if a man should offer to stand, it would roll away,
and lay him under feet, if not break his back: Too too many break
themselves with the world, onely Heaven lies foursquare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But was manifest]</hi> He is manifested three ways;<note place="margin">Christ how manifested.</note> 1. By the Word
and Sacraments: 2. By his coming in the flesh: 3. By his last co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Judgement. Here the second is chiefly meant; for he was
revealed in all Ages to our Forefathers in the Word and Sacraments,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note>
but yet not so evidently and clearly as in our times, in these last times,
wherein he was made manifest in the flesh.</p>
                  <p>Note here,</p>
                  <p>1. The constancy and unchangeableness of the Lord,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> who as he
Ordained Christ before the world,<note place="margin">God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</note> so he sent him in due time into the
world: <hi>The Lord is not as man, that he should lye or repent,</hi> his purposes
are unvariable, and his promises most certain and sure; he wants no
power to effect his Decrees and Purposes, No length of time could
make him alter or fail, neither the wretchedness of the Age that he
came in, which was wofully corrupt, when even they that bare the
Name of the Church were defiled in Judgement and Conversation,
God notwithstanding would accomplish his purpose: So it is with
every one whom he elected before the world, he will not lose one,
but in time afford them effectual means for Faith and Repentance;<note place="margin">Acts 13. 48.</note>
no length of time, no mans badness shall hinder this work. The Lord
had decreed to call and make his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
yet what was he but a blinde Idolater till God called him? What
also <hi>Paul,</hi> who notwithstanding was ordained from his Mothers
womb, nay, before the world, to be a special instrument in the
Church?</p>
                  <p>1. This may comfort godly Parents over their children that be
yet uncalled,<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> they may have hope they be in the compass of Gods
election, and so that God will one day have mercy on them: Oh, but
they be thus and thus bad! Its grievous indeed, but that shall not
hinder, if they belong to Gods election: <hi>Shall the wretchedness of man
make the faith of God of none effect? nay, let God be true, and every man
a lyar;</hi> wheresoever God hath any elect ones, he will finde them out
and remember them.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth us also to be constant in all our good purposes;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Hell
is full of purposes,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 29, 30</note> Heaven of performances:<note place="margin">Psal. 76. 11.</note> How many good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65522:90"/>
in sickness, after the Word, before the Sacrament, &amp;c. have we,
which prove as blossoms without fruit?</p>
                  <p>2. The constancy of Gods promises they be Yea and Amen;<note place="margin">Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</note> no
length of time can make him break a promise (as this of sending Christ
into the world) as neither the unworthiness of men: The Israelites
as wretched as might be, yet they could not make him break promise
with <hi>Abraham</hi> to give them <hi>Canaan;</hi> one would think he should cut
them off in the mid-way, but he had respect to his Name: This was
the cause that Gods Servants were always glad of a promise,<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 9.</note> as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah.</hi>
So are his threatnings, as that with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> though
then there were no more upon the earth: So even with our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
himself, that innocent Lamb of God, yet standing as our Surety,
God spared him not, but according to the threatning of death, gave
him to dye; notwithstanding of his prayers and strong cryes, he
abated nothing, but laid it on him to the uttermost.</p>
                  <p>1. Here's a comfort to Gods people,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> finde out, apply, and hold
fast the promises in all our necessities: Stand upon them, on any one
one of them, as upon an unmoveable foundation; God cannot fail,
who ever trusted in him and was confounded? Happy is the man that
trusteth in him.</p>
                  <p>2. Let the wicked know how small account soever they make now
of the Lords threatnings,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> they shall finde them too true for them:
And if the Lord Jesus, the innocent Son of God, the Surety, found
it, shall those horrible monsters, that shake off all care of God and
goodness, think to scape free, and finde his Word loose? No,
though they bare themselves upon late repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In these last times]</hi> Christ was not exhibited till after Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years of the world:<note place="margin">Obser.</note> and why not before,<note place="margin">Christ was then exhibit it when God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that he should so be.</note> or all this while? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God decreed it to be no sooner: why decreed he it to be no
sooner? because he would not: If any go yet further, and ask why
he would not? this is Presumption, and curious Pride: we must not
ask a reason further then the will of God, where none is revealed,
God determined (as we shall see after) to bestow a greater priviledge
on the last age of the world, then on the former, and who should
question him for the same? This then was the time which God in
his counsel had appointed,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> which is called by the Apostle, <hi>the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of time:</hi> when all time was run out that was to be before,
then he came; so that he could not possibly have comed any sooner,
nor tarried any longer: If we respect the Power of God simply, he
could have sent him sooner, but if Gods Decree, he could come no
sooner; even as Christs bones could not be broken in respect of Gods
Decree, though the nature of them was as other mens, subject to be
broken: Nor could Christ have lived longer in the world in respect of
Gods Decree,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> though he might by the course of nature and strength
of body continued many years.<note place="margin">What God hath decreed shall be in due time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note we then from hence, that</p>
                  <p>What God hath decreed, as he will effect, so will he do in the due
and appointed time;<note place="margin">Acts 16. 6, 7.</note> whomsoever he hath chosen he will call, every

one in their time, yet after <hi>Peter</hi> writes to the Christians scattered in
those places; what is this, but that the time of their calling was not
yet come,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 5.</note> which afterward was fulfilled? At the first sending out of
the Apostles,<note place="margin">Mat 28. 19.</note> they were forbid to go into the way of the Gentiles,
but afterwards (and that upon the forementioned ground) bid to
Preach to all Nations:<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 25.</note> So the Jews shall be called, but when? when
the fulness of the Gentiles shall be come in: Some were called into
the Vineyard to work at one hour, some at another.</p>
                  <p>1. This may teach us,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> being truly called, and our time come, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to praise God.</p>
                  <p>2. And for those that yet be behinde,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> be not out of hope, wait
still, use the means, &amp;c. and when God sends the means, hope the time
is coming: who knoweth whether God hath not some Elect among
the <hi>Indians</hi> that he will send means unto, which they have hitherto
wanted, and so call them to the knowledge of Christ Jesus? The
like may be said of particular persons: But let none hence cast off
care, and say my time is not yet come wherein I shall be called, and
so neglect the Word, and live badly, but let such use the means with
all speed, to day, while its called to day: The longer any goeth on
uncalled, its the more dangerous sign of no Election of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Here see the reason why many a good Prayer and good Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
taketh not effect by and by,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> but the wicked prevail, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the time is not yet come.</p>
                  <p>Further,<note place="margin">Three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of times.</note> observe three differences of times, Before the Law, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, and After the Law, or after the manifestation of Christ:

                     <hi>A.</hi> They be so in comparison
of former times; and these from Christ onward, are the next before
the end of the world, when there shall be no more time.</p>
                  <p>God will never speak to his Church after any other maner;<note place="margin">Obser.</note> he
will make no new Covenant,<note place="margin">God will no otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his will, then he hath already done.</note> no new Gospel, Religion, maner of

his Son Christ Jesus, he will never alter his course; we have all
that ever we may look for here on earth,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> nothing can be more clear.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the Turks,<note place="margin">Use.</note> which look for their Mahomet, and
the Jews which look for I know not what <hi>Messiah</hi> and Lordly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior:
The Papists also, being belike ashamed of what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his Gospel, patch together an infinite number of mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so that their Religion is as a beggars cloak, full of pieces, of
divers colours set on at divers times.</p>
                  <p>These being termed the last times,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> because they be the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
times before the Worlds end;<note place="margin">We now live in the latter end of the last times.</note> it followeth, that having been
so ever since the Apostles, we live in the latter end of the last times.</p>
                  <p>1. Here's comfort to Gods people, that the last day is so near, which
therefore they may wait for with patience.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>

God is not slack, but patient for his Elects sake that yet are behinde:
If it had come one hundred years ago, we had been prevented,

                     <hi>But a thousand years are but as one day with the Lord,</hi> and it will surely
come, and that too soon to the wicked, who shall feel the terror
thereof.</p>

                     <hi>For you]</hi> The Reason of Christs coming thus towards the end of
the world,<note place="margin">Why Christ came towards the latter end of the world.</note> because God had appointed to do a greater favor to the
last age, not but that those which went before, both knew and saw
Christ, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> though afar off; So that here the Fathers are
not excluded, but he was manifest for us, that we might have a fuller
sight of him then the fathers; their light was but dim in comparison
of ours.</p>
                  <p>How much then are we bound to God?<note place="margin">Use.</note> and ought we not to have
more knowledge and faith, and shew more tokens of thankfulness then
they? But alas, though we have the Gospel and Sacraments so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
never did iniquity more abound: Thus do we reward the Lord
for his kindeness.</p>

                     <hi>Who by him do believe in God]</hi> He saith, They believed, how came
he to know that? he hoped so, and in charity so judged of them, as
who willingly gave themselves to the profession of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and for the same did undergo persecution: Therefore I say, he hoped
the more confidently of them, even as we may do of such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies

they should come for Conscience, and expect better things at their

well at home in your places and several dealings, not onely to Gods

                     <hi>By him]</hi> We cannot believe in God,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> but by the Son: For 1. The
Father dwelleth in the light that none can attain unto;<note place="margin">We cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, but by the Son.</note> How then shall
we come to him of our selves, we being so poor and weak, and he of

upon the Sun shining in his full strength, but may view it in a pail of
Water;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> so must we see the Father in the Son, who is the image of the
Father,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> and the ingraven form of his person. 2. God is infinitely
just,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> and we extreamly wicked, he a consuming fire, and we stubble;
How then can we come to him, believe in him, or take comfort, but
onely in and by the Lord Jesus our Mediator? who by his death
hath made satisfaction to his Father,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> and covered us with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 12.</note>
                     <hi>He is the Way, the Truth and the Life, none cometh to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

1. Therefore Jews and Turks believe not in God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> because they

                  <p>2. All are Hereticks that deny any of Christs natures or offices,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>

for Transubstantiation; and his offices Priestly, by their Masses,
Satisfactions, Joynt-intercessions; his Prophetical, by their own
Traditions; his Kingly, by making the Pope head of the Church,
making Laws to binde the Conscience, to forgive sins, save, damn,
&amp;c. Therefore they cannot truly believe in God, and therefore it
stands them in hand to know Christ aright, and then to believe in
him.</p>
                  <p>4. This condemneth a number of ignorant creatures among us,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note>
which will come to God, but how? by their good meanings, good
prayers, good serving of God, civil life, and the like; as others which
seem better taught, by their repenting, and crying God mercy: Oh,
this goes for current, and in the mean time take no thought how his
justice should be satisfied: These may cry their hearts out to God, and
finde no mercy; they must bring Christ their Surety in their hand,
and plead mercy for his sake, and his satisfaction: Such as were stung
by the Fiery-Serpents, could not be otherwise healed, but by looking
up upon the Brazen-Serpent, neither we otherwise accepted of God,
then through Christ: Humble thou therefore thy self, confess thy
sins, judge thy self, know Christ, and plead his satisfaction.</p>

though absent in his Humanity, he is ever present by his Spirit, and
how he is most highly advanced, and how his Godhead was not thus
advanced (it was impossible) nor his manhood by it self had such a
name, and such glory due to it, but that the person of Christ, God
and man was advanced, and how now he makes intercession, and
hath prepared a place for us; but of these I have spoken at large on the

                     <q>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through

                  </head>
                  <p>A Good life is an inseparable companion of Faith and Hope; God
having bestowed upon them the former, the Apostle would not
have them to be wanting in the latter. Generally he exhorts to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
<hi>vers.</hi> 14. then particularly, first to renounce their lusts,
<hi>ibid.</hi> then to embrace the contrary, Holiness, <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16. This he
divides into two parts: 1. <hi>The fear of God;</hi> which contains all parts
of Piety towards God, <hi>vers. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 2. Love to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi>
which comprehendeth all the Duties we owe to them. These
two are knit in a comely order, not to be sundred.</p>
                  <p>In this verse we have an Exhortation to true and Christian love;
wherein we have, 1. The ground of it, The grace of God, which
they had received, namely, for that they were Justified and Sanctified;
which is set out by the part purified, Their Souls: the outward means
whereby, the word called Truth, which they did obey; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
worker, the Spirit. 2. The end of it, which was as to all good
duties, so to true love amongst the rest; as if he had said, Seeing you
are pardoned and purged to this end, that you should love purely, see
that you do so. This ground is a Reason of the Exhortation; where
it seemeth the Holy Ghost keeps a good order both in his Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Reasons. Before he exhorted to the fear and love of God,
now to the love of the Brethren: Before he had used Reasons both
from the Godhead in general, <hi>vers.</hi> 15, 16. and from the first two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Trinity; the Father, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. and the Son, <hi>vers.</hi> 18, 19.
Now he useth one taken from the third person, the holy Spirit
of God, who had wrought grace in them, and purified them to
this end.</p>
                  <p>From the order which the holy Ghost useth, Note we two things:</p>
                  <p>1. Where there's no love nor fear of God,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> there can be no true
Brotherly love,<note place="margin">Where there's no love nor fear of God, there can be no true brotherly love.</note> that being indeed the root from whence this
springeth.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore there can be no true love amongst the wicked: Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
meet together, and Pot-companionship is common, but this is
no love,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> its conspiracy; Love rejoyceth in good, not evil. No more
is a company of Thieves and Traytors that conspire together,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> or
many or fewer that combine against a good part, they may stick close,
and hold together in evil, but this is no love; nor in those Towns
where there's scarce any, or but mean teaching, where people meet
twice or thrice a week to Bowls, and women to Stool-ball, or other
games, thus to spend out their time, and to no good, is far from love;
and yet if one speak against such things, Oh, say they, You are an
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65522:92"/>
enemy to love and friendship; and, It was as a peaceable Town till
such a one came, as any other whatsoever, now there's no good-fellowship
&amp;c. But our Savior <hi>Christ</hi> saith, He came to bring no such
peace in evil, but rather debate: The Devil is content with this
peace, because they strengthen one another in evil; for if any
good come to cross this merry prophane world, then will it be
opposed: What hold is thereof their love? they go arm in arm to
the Tavern, yet straight ready to stab one another, or betray each
other,<note place="margin">Iudges 9. 23.</note> as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abner,</hi> and it was between the men of <hi>Sechem</hi> and
<hi>Abimelech;</hi> if they be once out at deadly defiance, its seldom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
never forgotten.</p>
                  <p>2. Nor can the wicked love the children of God truly;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> they may

in the sight of God: So impure that we cannot cleanse our selves, nay,
nor desire it, conceiving that even our uncleanness is purity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

which is by the Blood of Christ Jesus from sin past, and from the

affected? how few take knowledge of their uncleanness, and that sin
doth so defile them? 1. There are even open prophane ones, which
yet seek no washing, but refuse it, yea, think themselves clean enough,
yea, hate them that wallow not in the mire as themselves, thinking
strange to see any cleanse themselves by the Word and Prayer, yea,
think them strange that will not go on in their filthiness, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying

sanctifying grace;<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> therefore Faith is said to purifie the heart, namely,
by uniting us to Christ, and the Word is the instrument to work
Faith: Besides, the Word purgeth thus, not onely setting before us

us care and conscience to be obedient.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore thank God for the Word,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> the instrument of purging:

and all the seeming good things they do, are in hypocrisie, and to no

one heart. O look to it, will you lose all your comfort here, and all
your labor, yea Heaven it self, for some one sin?</p>

things doubtful to the best; (that is, speeches or actions of men
towards our selves or others) and if they may be taken well, will not
take them ill: Our nature is to take every thing in the worst part, Love
doth otherwise; the Mother saith a pin pricks the Childe, or it breeds
teeth, when it may be its of frowardnes that it cryes. Thus <hi>Josephs</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

then worse then it is: Always provided this be understood, not of
palpable, notorious, foul evils, nor of continued courses in sinning;
for what good or charitable construction can a man make of these?
Therefore such say foolishly, when being informed hereof, they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
Oh, ye must not judge; what can be judged of this case, but
onely that there may be Repentance? Its a fault in Ministers and
others that will extenuate foul sins in bad persons and wicked livers,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the mean time aggravating a Professors oversight. 2. It will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from its own,<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 27.</note> rather then break love, as give way in conference,
and yield,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> though we know we have the truth, so it be in small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
after offences yield, and sometimes seek Reconciliation, though
it were meet the other should seek to us; for why? it more prizeth
and esteemeth love,<note place="margin">See M. <hi>Perkins</hi> Christian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</note> then small matters: It will lay down the buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
go on the lower ground, yield the way or the wal, when there's no
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reason for it. 3. It doth no hurt; its against the nature thereof so to do,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65522:95"/>
whether in life,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> chastity, goods, and good name: See it in God, a
perfect patern of love, He doth all good (no hurt) to his Children:
It provokes not, but strives by all means to please all as far as may be
with a good conscience; it seeks not its own things, but others as well.
4. Its not easily provoked, but forbears, forgives, puts up, &amp;c. It wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
cover natural infirmities,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> cases of Cons.</note> such things as be weaknesses in our brethren,
natural defects, not done of set purpose, or breaking out into extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:<note place="margin">1. 3. cap. 3. pag. 135.</note>
As some be a little too quick, some a little too slow; some
seeing a fault are too ready to speak,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5.</note> some a little too slow to speak or
reprove; some a little too fine, earnest, negligent, merry, solemn,
others a little too homely and plain, remiss, sad, sullen, &amp;c. If they
were not so much on either hand it were better: These love will cover,
or nothing; love will not stand upon them, rebuke or reproach them,
it will not deal hardly with them for these things, but wisely bear
them: Thus will a loving husband bear with his wife, that fears
God, though haply somewhat quick, and curst, haply not so cleanly,
or provident altogether as were to be desired: So a wife with her
husband, though haply not so affable, or whose nature will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to use such complements to his wife as some can with faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
So if a servant be very trusty and careful to please, onely some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
slow, the Master must not hereupon rebuke him too oft, too
openly, too sharply, sometime lovingly in private he may: So a
Neighbor confers with a Neighbor, and the one is a little too quick;
love will not see it, but consider its a natural infirmity, its not much
out of the way, though somewhat it is; love will not exasperate him,
or answer him tartly, but go on friendly, in a maner not so much
as taking notice thereof: Love will also cover and put up wrongs
done unto it, not seeing small ones, but forgiving, and putting them
up, saying, Thus ought I to do, he is a man, I am also subject to
offend my Neighbor, and would be forgiven, and stand also in need
that others should pardon me: And as a Christian I must do, For I
sin daily against God,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 12.</note> and so crave to be forgiven of him, as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
others: If they be greater matters, yet love will easily accept
of any indifferent conditions of agreement, and that unto Seventy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times: If they be so great, that without great prejudice to our
estate and reputation they cannot be passed by, then its lawful to
have recourse unto the Magistrate, and use the benefit of the Law;
but so as there be no malice, and the revenge be not in any case
sought after.<note place="margin">Two Caveats to be observed of them that for redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of wrongs make use of the Magistrate.</note> Herein two Caveats must be observed, It must not be
for trifles (which ought rather to be forgiven) and it must be the
last remedy, when all other ways of more peaceable and quiet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
have been tried, as the cutting off of an arm or leg, when
no ways else will help: Hereto belongeth also, that love covers
folks faults from the World,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 7.</note> except it hath cause and calling
to speak thereof, commonly it speaks of their vertues: The
contrary is most wofully common, little of mens vertues, except
a word or two to make way to speak of their faults, and these we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65522:96"/>
to be much in;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As the Crow that likes the Carrion, and the

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Hemlock onely. 5. Its bountiful, beneficial and helpful, not having
that to it self which it hath, but ready to distribute and communicate
to the good of others, whether they be gifts Spiritual or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
Spiritual; for love begins at the Soul, and doth good to that
first, whether of our Children, Servants or Neighbors: Love taketh
to heart their Spiritual wants, giving counsel to the ignorant &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
comfort to the afflicted, admonition to them that be out of the
way, exhortation to them that be in the way, and especially if they
begin to slack,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 42.</note> adding prayer for all. Temporal; It will give to the
poorest that are to be helpt by alms,<note place="margin">Deut. 15. 10.</note> as it is able; it will give in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
measure on solemn times,<note place="margin">Acts 4. 37.</note> yea of the main stock in persecution or
hard times; it will give cheerfully, and such God loves; it will also
give quickly,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 7.</note> that is to give twice; it will also lend to them that be
a degree above the poorest,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 28.</note> which having a Trade, Skill and will
to follow their Trade, onely want a stock to employ themselves and
theirs: These a man is as much bound in conscience to lend unto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ability, and honestly to pay again, as to give a piece of
bread, or a peny to a poor miserable creature; by this help many
have lived in good sort, and brought up their Families. To the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
that have no need of us, yet we must be neighborly and friendly,
communicating in kindenesses with them, inviting them also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to us, and going to them being invited; so we must visit them
in their sickness and heaviness, and comfort them in the best maner
we can.</p>
                  <p>Now love being such a thing,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> and these being the properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">There's little love in the world.</note>
if we try the world by the same, we must needs conclude, that
there's little love in the world. 1. Who takes not things in the worst
part, hardly construing mens words and actions? the doubtful ones
(haply not bad) they judge to be evil; those that be evil indeed, they
make far worse then they are:<note place="margin">1 Sam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

when her lips onely moved; &amp; the Jews with our Savior Christ, when
he said,<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Destroy this Temple:</hi> this is the cause of innumerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and breaches among men. 2. For departing from right, who
doth it? who stands not out stifly to the uttermost? This is an usual
speech, Its my right, and I will have it, I ask no more but my right, and
that I will not lose; this is thought but reasonable, and he is thought
but an honest man that will have but his right, but its an ill speech
and resolution, whether it be in conference: If a man know he hath
the truth (though it be but in small matters) yet he will hold it out,
though the other be never so peremptory, till in conclusion, they fall
flat out, this is nought; in small matters it were better to yield: so
in Dealings, Covenants, Bargains, Bonds, men will have their right;
herein right may be extream wrong, always provided that we give
not away anothers right,<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 9.</note> especially Gods: <hi>Moses</hi> would not yield an
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65522:96"/>
hoof; yet most men are stiff in their own, will yield enough of Gods
right; as they will not suffer their Servants to play one hour in the
week day, but for the Lords day, they will suffer them therein to play
as much as they will. 3. Whereas love does no hurt to any, Whence
comes all the hurt and mischief in the world? Stabbing, Fighting,
Quarrelling, Railing, Reviling, Scolding, Crying, all the defiling of
mens Wives, Children, Servants? So for Oppression, Bribery, Thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
Cousenage, false Weights, deceitful Wares? So Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Defaming, Backbiting, Mocking? All these abound in
the World: I am sure they come not of Love, it was never at the
doing of them, and those that will so readily provoke one another
by words and deeds they care not how, are far enough from
love. 4. For being provoked, O Lord be merciful to us, who can bear
any thing, but taunt for taunt, quip for quip; he shall have as good
as he brings, is common with every one: How do men stand upon
every small trespass? Hence the innumerable Contentions and Suits
in the Land, thousands in a year for meer trifles, wherein ten times as
much is spent then is sued for, which is a shame for <hi>England,</hi> having
had the Gospel of Peace so long: Oh, mens stomacks be up straight,
all their blood in their faces, or looking as pale as ashes, or secretly
practising to revenge, hand on the Dagger straight, straight on the
top of the house, fly in our Neighbors face by and by; so little
love is there to forgive till Seventy, I may say till Seven times; so
short Spirited, as we can bear nothing; and that which is worse,
if we have once taken up a displeasure, its not easily laid down,
but Sun after Sun, Moon after Moon, yea, Year after Year it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth;
quickly provoked, hardly pacified, especially truly. It may
be we live not in open enmity, yet in secret grudging, the heart not
sound, but ready to break out upon every occasion, can abide nothing
but Revenge, which is fearful. 5. Where is communicating of
Spiritual good things? Parents bring up their children brave, but
how few Catechize, Counsel and Instruct them, pray with or for
them? So for Servants, They give them Meat, Drink and Wages,
with work enough on the six days, little caring how they spend the
Lords day, neither instructing them, examining them, or drawing
them to hear the Word, or Read, and Pray: What love call you this?
shew you not as much to your Beasts? So for our Neighbors, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth
them that be out of the way? do we not rather let them run
on, talking of their Infirmities behinde their backs, and spreading them
to their grace? Nay, do not many, yea most rejoyce thereat? what
consolation to the heavy? who takes it to heart? how few are able
to comfort fitly? but utter vain, idle, if not more hurtful words to
to such, nay, many rather laugh and jest at heavy conscienced persons,
every man saith, Is he is Brothers keeper? Nay, alas, so far from
communicating Spiritual grace to them (which they ought) or to call
one another to go to the house of God, as they rather use all means,
by jesting at them, troubling them, &amp;c. to discourage them; yea,
how many have given lewd and wicked counsels to others to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65522:97"/>
of God? For outward things, how backward are most from
giving any more then they needs must? What contentions at making
of Rates? For lending, where is this? but rather as if God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
given precept for it, or as if it were like a Statute repealed, which is
of no use, so is this duty: That cursed Trade of Lending upon U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
hath eaten up, and banished out of the Countrey this Christian
duty of free lending; What rich man hath almost at any time any
thing to lend? Some are so grim and austere, as a poor man dares
not speak to them for such a thing: Some put so much to Usury, as
they neglect their Trading, set none a work, nor have ought to lend
at any time, but rather borrow; and if a poor man happen to do any
work for them, they cannot pay him in a good while, they are so bare;
for as soon as any money comes in, it must out straight to Use, as if it
would burn a hole in their Cupboard if it lay there two or three days,
or a week. Others are ever Purchasing, and are ever in debt, and will
be; then wrangle at Rates, grudge at this and that, are never fit
to lend; such bring a curse upon themselves willingly, which is to
borrow, when as they might else lend. Others are so miserable, that
though they have wherewith, yet will not lend: So for Neighborly
dealing,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 12.</note> inviting, visiting, &amp;c. Love is very cold. Here I may adde,
That there's a great deal of counterfeit love, Pot-companionship,
and joyning in vanity, a deal of fawning, crouching, conguing, &amp;c.
a great deal of self-love,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 2.</note> making others faults great, and their own
small or none; nay sometimes extenuating and making light of the
vertues of others, highly esteeming their own; being ready to provoke
and wrong others, but bearing nothing, straight provoked, seeking
their own in all their dealings and courses, so making sure for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without regard to their Neighbors: These be the times. Now
let every man examine himself, and see how its with himself in these,
who findes not himself ready to take things at the worst? and have
we not often done so, when as afterward having heard that it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so, but quite otherwise, we have been put to shame, and forced
to say for our own excuse, We heard or thought it had been so: The
like might be particularized in the rest.</p>
                  <p>3. The causes of the want of love:<note place="margin">The causes of the want of love.</note> 1. Want or weakness of
Faith; when our Savior taught his Apostles this Duty, they said,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Lord, encrease our Faith:</hi> Assurance of pardon makes us forgive.
2. Pride,<note place="margin">Luke 17. 4, 5.</note> whereby men think highly of themselves, meanly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> think they may speak or do any thing, but that others may say
or do nothing to them:<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 10.</note> Onely by Pride comes contention, but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
causeth love:<note place="margin">Eph. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> Pride makes men think themselves so wise and
good, as every body should say as they say, and yield in all things to
them, when they do not, they break the peace, as <hi>Haman</hi> with <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai:</hi>
Pride cannot endure a reproof, therefore could not <hi>Herod</hi> abide
<hi>John, Ahab, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Micaiah:</hi> Pride makes men think so highly
of themselves, and meanly of others, that they will not bear any
wrong, but take the least in scorn. 3. Covetousness; this makes
men contend for trifles, Oppress, use false weights and sleights, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65522:97"/>
also hinders from inviting and meeting together. 4. Envy at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
thriving and wealth of others about them, or equal to them, as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
sons did at <hi>Jacob; Cain,</hi> that <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice was better regarded
then his; <hi>Esau,</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> was blessed; and <hi>Ismael,</hi> that <hi>Isaac</hi> was the
son of the Promise. 5. Frowardness and shortness of spirit breaks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
love very often, for angry words stir up strife. 6. These very days of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
peace make men grow hollow and strange, and to set little one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
As when Sheep see a Dog, they run all together; so trouble
makes men to make much one of another, whereas its otherwise in
peace: These be woful causes.</p>
                  <p>4. The effects of this want of love,<note place="margin">The effects of the want of love.</note> are lamentable every where,
both in Church and Commonwealth; O what woful breaches and
contentions? what wrongs and enmities? So in Families, so among
particular persons, how break they out to the dishonor of God? yea,
sometimes Professors one with another, to the shame of their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the interrupting of their Prayers, or either the hindring of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Sacrament (as many a time it is) or slubbering it over,
and coming with festred hearts, and so depriving themselves of the
benefit thereof, nay, provoking the Lord by their unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
                  <p>Seeing these things be so,<note place="margin">Use.</note> O let every one of us, finding our selves
faulty, humble our selves, crave mercy, and labor to be reformed
herein: To this end learn we to pluck out of our hearts those noysom
weeds, that this precious plant of love may grow. We must strive
against infidelity, and labor for more faith: In humbleness of minde
we must labor to esteem every one better then our selves; we must
labor for a moderate affection to outward things, setting more by
peace then them; we must also avoid envy: We have more then we
could have look'd for; Is our eye evil because our Masters is good?
we must also cease from frowardness, and be gentle and meek; and
labor we that this love to our brethren may shew forth it self in all
good fruits, as in judging the best, departing from our right, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking,
or being easily provoked, but forbearing and forgiving:
Alas, we have need that others should forgive us; for who lives, and
is not subject to offend? God forgives us many and great debts, and
shall we catch our neighbor by the throat?<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 26, 28</note> God bids us ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
on no other condition, but to forgive our offenders; and there's
no better sign that a man is forgiven of God, then to shew mercy to
men; none can be assured of that, but they will forgive: Let us
therefore from the sea of compassion that God sheddeth out upon us,
let fall some drop thereof on our neighbors, and not seek revenge,
which every bad man,<note place="margin">Pro. 19. 19. 11.</note> yea beast can do, but pass by offences, which
is the glory of a man: Besides, revenge is the Lords Office, and to
revenge, is indeed to resist the Lord, without whose Providence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is done; this kept <hi>David</hi> from revenging himself on <hi>Shimei.</hi> Not
to revenge, is always the best way for us, and the worst for him that
wrongs us: There's no dealing with a man that commits his cause
to God; more safe to anger a Witch, then an Innocent meek spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65522:98"/>
man that hath his recourse to God; thou hadst better deal with one
that will take revenge on thee to the uttermost. To this end keep we
out anger if we can; if not, yet let it not rest in us, as it were sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our hearts: Let not the Sun go down upon it. This indeed the
world accounts a base thing,<note place="margin">Mic. 7. 18.</note> but its honorable, it makes us like God:
Neither must we labor for this a little, or some few times, but for a
long skirted love,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 12.</note> that will cover even a multitude of offences. And
let our love shew it self in giving Spiritual and Temporal things; for
God gives to good and bad, and makes us but Stewards of that he
gives us, that we may dispense the same; yea, the more we give, the
more we have, as which encreaseth by giving: and for Temporal
things,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 24, 25.</note> the high-way to thrive therein, is to be merciful; as to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,
to be pinching.</p>
                  <p>5. The general reasons inciting to this duty of love,<note place="margin">Reasons inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to this duty of love.</note> 1. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
it of us, who is love; and if we perform it, we do not so
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> much serve our Neighbor as please God, who takes it as done to
himself: If we neglect it, we neglect not our Neigbor onely, but
God,<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 2.</note> who takes himself wronged in this point. 2. We are all one
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> flesh, and all have some part of the Image of God upon us: But for
the people of God,. 1. We be members of the same body: The
members of the Natural body not onely hurt not, but help each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
else quickly would the body be brought to confusion. 2. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note>
not Natural ones, but a better Brotherhood, a nearer Bond:
Now between Brethren there must be no contention,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 6.</note> and it were a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> shame for such to contend. 3. Both the Word requires it, and the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper calls for, and puts us in minde of it.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. No better Argument that we are in the light,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 34, 35.</note> love God, are Christs
Disciples,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 14.</note> and translated from death to life, then this. 5. The beauty
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of a Christian is love; he's the best Christian who loves most, whose
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> lips feed most, whose branches spread widest. 6. As it brings us much
peace to our conscience, and will comfort us not a little on our death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
that we have not lived to our selves, but to be useful to many, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
to Souls; so it procureth us love in the places we live in, and
in the Church of God, where we have a good name. No man is well
beloved, though he have good things in him, if he be not loving; Oh,
say they, he is a good honest man, but a harsh Censurer, Contentious,
and so hasty, that no man can tell how to speak to him; he is a
strait man, no man is the better for him by counsel, encouragement,
admonition; so for other things: But if a man be full of love, Oh, it
shall procure him love again, he shall be commended while he lives,
and mourned for when he dyes;<note place="margin">See Pro. 10.</note> as they wept for <hi>Dorcas;</hi> but a proud,
churlish,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 39.</note> close man, he shall live without being desired, and dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being mourned for: Many would have Love, and Good-will,
and Credit, but will not seek this way to procure it; they live closely
to themselves, neither being useful, or any way liberal to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
let them never look for it: Many care not, so they may scrape
all to themselves (for their good name let it go whether it will) but
these are bafounded, and its a curse so to live. Thus in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:65522:98"/>
In particular, Touching the love to the Children of God, which
is here chearfully called for, consider we both the duty, and the maner
how its to be performed.</p>
                  <p>For the duty it self, it hath these two things in it, 1. That we have
brotherly and tender affections one towards another. 2. That we shew
it forth by brotherly actions and fruits answerable;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 16, 17.</note> both which must
necessarily go together.</p>
                  <p>1. Then,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> In vain do any challenge tender and loving affections, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they shew the fruit thereof to their Brethrens Bodies and Souls
especially.<note place="margin">The fruits of love towards our brethren must accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Its not enough to do brotherly offices, unless they proceed from
brotherly affections: Many a man will give frankly, and do other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
required of him, but defiles his liberality with insulting over the
parties relieved,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> upbraiding them therewith,<note place="margin">The doing of brotherly offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to make them subject unto them; whereas a gift should be given
chearfully, and seeing one that stands in need of our help, we ought
compassionately to tender his estate as our own; remembring Gods
commandment for relieving such a one, and thanking God we may:
and though the party ought to be thankful, yet should not we stain
our liberality with any sinister maner of giving: It must be frank,
thats the nature of a gift, and it must also come from compassion and
feeling. So for reproving, admonishing, &amp;c. (an excellent duty, I
would it were more usual) it must proceed from a brotherly affection,
not proudly, imperiously, or harshly: So we must invite from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
affection, else our brotherly action loseth his grace with God,
yea, with men also if they perceive it.</p>
                  <p>And though we are chiefly to love Gods servants,<note place="margin">Love must reach to all.</note> Christians, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
with us of the same Religion, and our fellow Brethren; yet
we are not to neglect any, we must love all, all that either be, or
may be the people of God, though they be yet Pagans, Heathens,
&amp;c. for they are our own flesh, and have in them (as ye heard)
some part of the Image of God, as in their Soul, which is a Spirit,
and Immortal, and the Majesty of their face above all Creatures: A
King, though an Heathen, hath a part of the Image of God in his
Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>Then we must love the Devil,<note place="margin">Object.</note> as having some part of Gods Image.</p>
                  <p>We are not,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> because he is pronounced of God as his final and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Enemy, appointed to destruction: So if we knew any such
men (as the Prophets did) we ought not to love them, but hate them;
not pray for them, but against them, as <hi>David</hi> did. For others, though
Infidels we must love them, and if God cast them into our lot, we
must do good to them, to their Souls and Bodies.</p>
                  <p>They be strangers to me.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So was the Jew that fell among Thieves to the Samaritan,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and in
that Christ taught who is our Neighbor:<note place="margin">Luke 10. 33.</note> Gods Image ought not to
seem strange to us, but loved wheresoever we see it.</p>
                  <p>They never did ought for me.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But God hath,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> who bids thee love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65522:99"/>
They have wronged me,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and are mine enemies.</p>
                  <p>This is no sufficient ground for thee not to love them,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for the rule
is not to love for that thou art loved,<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 44.</note> but because the Lord commands
it:<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> God is not our enemy, he deserves well of us, and to him
we owe all that may be; and he hath turned us over to pay some of
the debt we owe him to our enemy, and he will take it as paid to
him:<note place="margin">Note.</note> O that we could learn this Lesson! And if we must love that
small part of the Image of God where we see it, then where its
more, we must love more: Therefore where we see the very face
of his Image renewed in Wisdom, Holiness, Righteousness, and
the Sanctifying Grace of Gods Spirit vouchsafing to make a man a
new Creature, and Holy as he is Holy; Oh, this we ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
love, reverence in a high degree: we cannot shew a better token<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
our love to God,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 1. &amp; 3. 14.</note> then to love his Image, and the more we
see it,<note place="margin">Zech. 2. 8.</note> to love it the more, such are dear to God, as the Apple of
his eye.</p>
                  <p>1. Those that make all alike,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> make one as welcome as another,
make no difference of good and bad in their countenance, help, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
they be not endued with the Spirit of God, for where it is,
it will take knowledge of his own work, and make a man love it; yea,
though a carnal man should have some natural parts of civility,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> skill,
&amp;c. more then a Christian man, yet we must affect grace most: These
men be neither fish nor flesh.</p>
                  <p>2. But much worse are those that of all persons like the Children
of God worst,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and that for their zeal and forwardness; If't were not
for them they could like them, and therefore chuse swearers, jesters,
and prophane persons for their companions, and cannot away with
the society of Christians, who in their liberality will rather give to
bad persons, fitting in the others light, and making them fare the worse
for their zeal and godliness: Of all men they cannot away with these
Puritans, and had rather their Friends should be any thing then
of that number, their Sons, Daughters, and Tenants, &amp;c. They
would love them,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 14. ibid. 10.</note> if they were not so precise: A bad sign, such are
not translated from death to life, are not of God, are in darkness to
this hour;<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4. &amp; 16. 3.</note> they are not led by <hi>Davids</hi> Spirit, who could not abide the
workers of iniquity: The more of Gods Image a man seeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to like him the worse is a fearful sign of no love to God: If
you will needs hate, hate not them which God loves, but whom he
hates; hate them not because he loves them, and because of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 29.</note>
for God saith to them as to <hi>Jacob, I will bless them that bless thee,
and curse them that curse thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 23. 8.</note> even <hi>Balaam</hi> himself refused to curse <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi>
If they shall stand at the last day, and be damned that gave them
no meat, then what shall become of their haters, imprisoners, and
that for their goodness? Then would they be glad to be with the
least of them, but it shall be far from them, how little soever they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them in this world, and then shall their time of glory be, as is
their enemies in this world: We must therefore labor to be religious,
else we can never love them that be so because of their goodness.</p>

Here also observe a difference between the love we ought to bear
to the Wicked,<note place="margin">How we ought to love the Wicked.</note> Pagans, Infidels, &amp;c. we must love them as our flesh,
not as our brethren, for they have not God for their Father, the
Church for their Mother, have not suckt the same breasts with us, the
Word and Sacraments: Therefore look how natural Brethren be
affected each to other, so ought Christians, Fellow-heirs of the same
Inheritance, as having a better Brotherhood, as much as the Spirit is
better then the Flesh, and Grace above Nature. Our Savior prefer'd
the hearers and doers of the Word, before his natural Kindred: This
is a more lasting Brotherhood, which abides longer then this life, even
for ever, when it shall be with a most intire affection each to other,
which often in this life is not, because of the weakness of Grace: Its
unseemly for Kinsmen to disagree,<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> much more Brethren, but most for
Christians to fall out,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 6. 8.</note> to contend, wrangle, and be at odds: Do we
not profess we are members of Christ, and perswade our selves our
Neighbors are so? We do; then let Nature teach us: See how the
natural members be affected? Are we not Fellow-Brethren? When
therefore we live in enmity with our Neighbor that is a Christian, we
do as much as in us lies put him out of the Lords Roll, and unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him; for is he our Brother, of the same Father and Mother,
and can we jar with him? especially (though somewhat should fall
out otherwise then well) can we suffer the Sun to go down upon our
wrath? God forbid: When we come to Heaven, we shall love
all our Fellow-Brethren, better then ever two Brethren loved
in this World, and shall we not aym at it now, and come as
near it as we can?<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 19.</note> and we have need so to do, for the World
loves their own, therefore hates us; shall not we then hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
shall we be divided within our selves? O what wrack
comes of this in the Church of God in these days? whiles Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
differ and contend, the common Enemies, Atheists and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
multiply.</p>
                  <p>For the maner of it,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> It must be without faining, love unfained;
God hates dissembling in every thing,<note place="margin">Love must be without fainng.</note> loves simplicity and plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 9.</note>
as in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Nathanael:</hi> If love, which is the main vertue, be
counterfeit and false,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 18.</note> what shall become of all the duties that proceed
from thence?</p>
                  <p>Two sorts of persons may be here chiefly taxed:</p>
                  <p>1. Such as pretend to love,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but indeed hate, as <hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>Amasa,
Saul</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 28. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Judas</hi> to our Savior Christ; such have a mark of
Rebrobation, workers of Iniquity, to whom belongs some notable
judgement of God;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> they be like the Devil, who pretended to love
<hi>Eve,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> and our Savior Christ: of these see <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 2. &amp; 55. 12. &amp; 62. 4.
<hi>Pro. 26. 24. Jer. 9. 2. 1 Sam. 18. 17, 25. 2 Sam.</hi> 20. 9. Those are more
dangerous to them they hate, then if they bare open hatred; as one ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
within the walls, is worse then ten without: its also worse for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for any vice cloaked or masked under shew of vertue, is double
iniquity; <hi>such shall receive greater damnation,</hi> yet how common is this?
Many will speak men as fair as may be, yet lie in wait to do them a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65522:100"/>
shrewd turn, and as soon as their back is turned, raise a slander of them,
and do them all the hurt they can: Others haply have done so with us,
but so must not we do.</p>
                  <p>2. Such as pretend they love,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> but do not: Many will salute with
<hi>Good morrow,</hi> and <hi>Good night,</hi> when as there's no true love; one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of true hearty love, is worth ten armfuls of their Court holy-water,
crouchings, and congees down to the ground. <hi>These are clouds
without rain,</hi> vessels with false bottoms, that have onely a little water
in the top. Such are they who pretend they love the poor, who yet
coming to them, can get nothing of them, but what they are enforced
to, and that very hardly. So many good Ministers have proved the
good-will of a number that have made goodly shews, but have found
small kindeness at their hands: What love call you this? its dead,
<hi>as Faith without Works:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iames 5. 17.</note> Such is theirs, who will speak well of such
and such, and seem to pity them, saying, They are worthy men, and
pity they should want, but yet relieve them not at all. If God should
so feed and deal with them, they would soon complain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.]</hi> Here's the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
wherein we have again both the duty required, which is
to <hi>love one another,</hi> and the maner also, <hi>with a pure heart fervently.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Love one another] <hi>This noteth,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. A mutual love:<note place="margin">Obs.</note> It must come from one to another mutually,
and be at every hand.<note place="margin">Love must be mutual.</note> As others are to love us, so are we to love o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
none free. Many wil look for a deal of love from others, that yet
care not how little they themselves part with; would be visited, but
care not to visit others; would have their own vertues commended, but
will not do so by others; have their infirmities covered, but will not do
so by others; would not be provoked, yet will provoke; would not
that others should be quickly angry with them, who will yet be angry
with others:<note place="margin">Acts 20. 35.</note> Alas, this is weakness; <hi>Its a more blessed thing to give then
to receive,</hi> and we should rather strive to go before, and set others in
our debt by love: A good minde rather remembers the debt that is
going from him, then that which is coming to him. This often comes
of pride in some men, to look for much of others, and perform little
themselves: The husband often looks his wife should walk at an inch
with him, though he will break many ells out of square; So the
wife will look for much of her husband, not caring how little she
perform: This is no equity; We must do as we would be done to.
Its more dangerous for us to neglect our duty to others, then for them
to neglect theirs to us; let us therefore strive who shall perform most
each to other, Husbands, Wives, Neighbors, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. A community:<note place="margin">Obser.</note> We must not love one or two, or a few, but all
that fear God in the place wherein we live.<note place="margin">In love there must be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</note> Love communicates it
self, and is not ingrossed to a few.</p>
                  <p>Many can be content to love one or two, or a few, but they oppose
and justle against many others, and live unkindely with them: This
is no true love, nor ought love so to be; yet in many Towns there is
siding, which at the length turns to its undoing; yea, we must love
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65522:100"/>
the meanest that fear God, and not neglect them, as the meanest mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Body is regarded of the chiefest; we must not have the
Faith of Christ in respect of persons.<note place="margin">Iames 2. 1.</note> God hath vouchsafed to give
his Son to Redeem them, his Spirit to Sanctifie them, and Heaven to
be possessed of them, and shall we despise them? Nay, we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to encourage and hearten them on in well doing, seeing so few of
that sort fear God. If we regard them, they will bear their poverty
the better, and it will be a great chearing to them: There's nothing
more comely, then for the wealthy to be thus affable and kinde to
them;<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 2.</note> The Lord is the Maker of both, and being fellow-Brethren
and fellow-Members,<note place="margin">Iames 2. 5.</note> the one as dear to God as the other, a little
wealth must not puff up the ones minde over the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With a pure heart]</hi> Every kinde of love is not that which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note>
it must be the fruit of the Spirit,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 1.</note> proceeding from a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
heart, and be agreeable to the pure Word of God.</p>
                  <p>This hath many properties:<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of pure love.</note> 1. It loves for some good actions,
which condemns the common love of wicked persons, as of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator
and his Harlot, the Adulterer and his Mate, the Drunkards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and Thief, though sworn Brethren. To love any because they can
rail against goodness, or Dice well, or are eager against the Servants
of God,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> &amp;c. this is cursed love. True love rejoyceth not in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
a worse note cannot be, then for one to love them, whom as
Rebels and Conspirators against God, he sees fighting against God.
2. Pure love is that which is grounded on Grace and Religion, not on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
any transitory thing, which condemns the carnal love of the world,
which love onely for worldly respects, as strength, beauty, and the
like; or if it be for any inward gift of the minde not Sanctified, thats
also but carnal, as wit, skill in Arts, Musique, &amp;c. these are worthy
love; but to love onely for these, is not true and pure love, for thus
the Heathens loved;<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 28.</note> as <hi>Isaac</hi> loved <hi>Esau</hi> for his hunting, and many a
man his wife for her beauty: These are false grounds, when they fail,
love fails. 3. Pure love is in respect of the party himself whom we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
love, and for no respect to our selves, or commodity of ours, which
condemns the world, which onely loves on such respects, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is my Uncle, my Friend, loves me, hath done this or that
for me, or may do me a pleasure; therefore I will make much of him,
or for fear he may do me a shrewd turn. This being shak'd out of
the clow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 46.</note> is indeed but self-love, as having a respect onely to our
selves. Many a man shews kindeness to others to purchase credit:
The charitable deeds of the Papists were of self-love, for they were
done out of opinion of merit: So the love of worldlings, they have
a reach at themselves. 4. Pure love reflects chiefly on anothers Soul,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
therefore hates his sin in him, whom he loves most dearly, advising
him from all evil, counselling him to all good.</p>
                  <p>This condemns all impure love:<note place="margin">Use.</note> So to love, as not to tel our neighbor
of his fault for angring or disquieting him;<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note> this is hatred: So Parents
that love their children so well, as they will not nurture, rebuke or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them, do indeed hate them, &amp; slay them in following their ways:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65522:101"/>
                     <hi>He that spares the rod, hates his childe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 13. 24.</note> Its as if any should be so tender
over a childe, as not to suffer the wind to blow on it, and therefore
holds their hand before the mouth of it, but holds it so hard, as they
strangle the childe;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> or as the Ape, which hugs her yong one so hard,
that she strangles it. Again, friends perswade a man to do this or that
for preferment, which he cannot do with a good conscience, Oh, they
love him, they would fain see him prefer'd; woful love to the body,
by destroying the soul: A neighbor hath his Childe or Cattel strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled, one comes in of love, perswading to send to such a
Cunning-man or good Witch (one of the Devils worsts instruments)
Is this love? Is he a friend that will do that whereby a peny may be
gained, but many hundred pounds lost? So when a Christian is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to suffer for a good Conscience, and a friend comes and says, Oh,
I pray cast not away your self, I wish you well, do as the times are, and
as others do: This was the tormentors love to Martyrs (tormenting
love indeed) that by saving their bodies, their souls might perish:
Thus would <hi>Peter</hi> have perswaded our Savior,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>O Master, these things
shall not be unto thee;</hi> but if Christ had not suffered, we had all perish'd
in our sins, yea, the Saints in Heaven must have come out from
thence, for they went to Heaven by Christ who was to be crucified;
What love was this? our Saviors Answer shews, that he gave him no
thanks for that counsel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fervently.]</hi> This stands in two things, Earnestness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</p>
                  <p>1. For the Earnestness of our love,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> we must stretch it to as many
persons as we can,<note place="margin">A Christians love must be earnest.</note> and to as many duties, as giving, forgiving, &amp;c. and
therein we must not be sparing; as in giving, <hi>For he that gives sparingly,
shall reap sparingly:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> So for forgiving, it must not be onely an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
or two,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 8.</note> Charity covers a multitude; thus is God to us, in
giving for Soul, Body, Goods, Good-name to us, to ours, day and
night, never weary, never upbraiding us: So in forgiving, how mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
is he to pass by our many offences, and that daily? should
not we then herein resemble him? Again, a little love is soon
quench'd, soon hindred, but we must love so, as if we meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
temptations from our selves, or the parties whom we are to love,
our love notwithstanding must last still; yea, we must not onely do
these things when we can well do them, or there's nothing to let us,
but even forget our ease, pleasure and profit to do our neighbor good:
Love seeks not her own things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 5.</note> is laborious; we love our selves fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,
and therefore must so love our neighbors.</p>
                  <p>This condemns the cold frozen love of the world,<note place="margin">Use.</note> wherein there's
no heat or fervency, a little thing lets: We are so full of self love,
that we will not speak so much as a good word in defence of the very
best,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 23.</note> whether man or cause,<note place="margin">Hest. 4. 16.</note> if thereby we may be prejudiced never so
little;<note place="margin">Obs.</note> so did not <hi>Jonathan,</hi> so did not <hi>Hester,</hi> when she adventured
her life for her people.<note place="margin">Love must be constant.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. For the constancy thereof,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 1.</note> Unity must be kept, we must seek
Peace,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> and follow after it, and its a part of fervency when it will not

easily be broken off.<note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> Gods love is constant, ours must be so; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
will assay to break it off, we must therefore the more stand in it:
Oh, its the easiest matter in the world to break off love, but we must
not embrace any occasion moving hereunto.</p>
                  <p>This rebukes the inconstancy of many men,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that are won with an
Apple (as we say) and lost with a Nut, that will upon every slight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
break friendship; I loved him as well as could be (will some
such say) till such and such a thing fell out: and what, are you now
broke off? what can worldings do more? If God should so deal
with us, how miserable were we? but his love is constant, yea, he
loveth us in our adversity and low estate, nay, best then, and is then
nearest with his comforts; so it ought to be with us, for then our
Neighbor hath most need of us, and then our love will appear most
free, not mercenary: But how contrary this is, daily experience shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
while men be in prosperity they have many friends, which in
their affliction forsake them (as Doves, that come to fair houses, not
to low cottages) whereof <hi>Job</hi> often complaineth.</p>

them, They were born again, and therefore were to shew the fruits
thereof, as in other things, so in this of love. Where might be
noted,</p>
                  <p>1. That such as are not born again,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> cannot love, no more then men
can gather Grapes of Thorns,<note place="margin">No unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person can truly love.</note> or Figs of Thistles, or pour Wine
out of a Bottle full of Vinegar; but as Grapes are gathered of the
Vine, so must love come from a Regenerate man, not otherwise.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Regenerate man must needs love;<note place="margin">Observ.</note> therefore they that
declare no love,<note place="margin">Such as are born again, must needs love.</note> but hate their Brethren, the people of God especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
shew they be not born again, nor of God. But I proceed to the
words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being born again,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 10.</note>] Here's occasion offered to speak of the grace
of Regeneration. Touching it, consider briefly these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
                  <p>1. What it is to be born again;<note place="margin">What Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is.</note> Its to be made new creatures, to
be cast in a new mold, to have the corrupt Image of Sin, which we
have by Nature (and wherein we were conceived and born) put off
throughout, and the contrary good one, wherein we were at the first
created, put on, to have the understanding enlightned with distinct
knowledge of God, the heart bowed to the obedience of God, &amp;c.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65522:102"/>
new thoughts,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> desires, speeches, actions: In the new Creature all
things must become new; Thus its done to all that were elect before
the foundation of the world: They are changed up and down, from
a good state by Creation, to a bad in <hi>Adam;</hi> from thence to a good
one in Christ, by grace here in expectation of glory hereafter: For
the wicked, they are changed from good to bad, and there remain the
same (but still worse and worse) for ever; we should give God thanks
that made us so good at first, be humbled to see our base and woful
state now, and seeing there is help, never to be quiet till we recover
our first condition.</p>
                  <p>2. That the Lord is the Author hereof,<note place="margin">The Lord the author thereof.</note> he takes away the stony
heart,<note place="margin">See Deut. 29. 4.</note> and gives a new heart, an heart of flesh; Its his work onely,
nor Man or Angel can change the heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 10.</note> to work a deadly hatred of
that which by nature we love as our lives,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26.</note> and to love and take delight
in those courses,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 13. &amp; 3. 5.</note> duties, companies, which sometimes were as a
Prison:<note place="margin">Acts 11. 21.</note> Alas, the best <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> cannot; often even of
their Children or very Friends,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 9.</note> not a few remain unconverted, though
haply in the mean time God bless their labors to convert many others;
Yea, if an Angel should take a man and carry him to Heaven,
and shew him the Joys thereof, and thence to Hell, and shew
him the Torments thereof, yet this would not convert him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all Mercies, Afflictions, or Plagues of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Its a great
work of God, and so great, as if all things were not possible to him;
he could not do it; Its a greater work then the Creation of the
World: In that, there was no opposition, in this much: we
have not onely no aptness to good, or to be wrought to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but a violent opposition against it; there but to make the
things, here both to put out the corrupt nature, and to put in the
contrary good; then he made all of nothing, now he makes good
of nought.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As its easier making a thousand glasses, then the setting
together one that is broke; so it was easier (to speak <hi>quo ad nos,</hi> for all
things are alike easie to God) to make the world, then to repair the
broken Image of God in man: Its a miraculous work of God, greater
then any miracles that Christ or his Apostles wrought; our Saviors
several miracles upon the bodies of men, are all done in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of a sinner; sight restored to them that were blinde, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self, hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb, feet to the lame,
Devils cast out, yea many, for the Devil possesseth us, and all our
Parts and Members, Hearts, Hands, Eyes, Tongues, Feet, &amp;c. as
any Captain holds a Castle, and hath it at command. Thus its a
wonderful work of God to see a mans Soul and Life,<note place="margin">Acts 3. 10.</note> his wit, will,
desires,<note place="margin">Iohn 9. 8.</note> affections, and all altered from black to white: It was a
wonder to see the Criple go, and for him that was born blinde to
see; but its more marvel to see a man converted: for whereas God
gave power to work all these miracles (the raising of the dead not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
to men,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> this of regenerating is his own onely: If we finde it
ascribed to Ministers, as <hi>Paul</hi> is said to have begot <hi>Onesimus,</hi> and as
a Father the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> we must not conceive as if it were not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65522:102"/>
proper to God onely, but know, that it is; for that God would
keep them the instruments by whom he works from contempt:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 16.</note> A
good Husband or Wife may be a good means each to other, but have
no power of themselves: <hi>Adam</hi> could easily cast away himself, but
none could restore him but God onely; as a Childe of half a year
old may break a glass, which all the men in the Town cannot set to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again: Its wrought of God by uniting us to Christ by Faith,
through his holy Spirit, which works this alteration, when pardoning
our sins past, he taketh away the guiltiness and punishment thereof in
his death.</p>
                  <p>Let all that can prove it,<note place="margin">Use.</note> give all glory to God, for so unspeakable
a mercy, even that when they were going headlong to destruction,
when as vile as any, he yet called them, passing by thousands which
yet lie in their sins: And for them that can prove no such thing, let
them not delay, nor put off to the last, as the fashion is, as though
it could be dispatcht in a trice, or with a wet finger, but seek it both
earnestly and quickly in the means appointed: Why do men think
they shall repent on their death bed rather then now? Is it because the
pain or fear of death will make them? Alas, all the Plagues in the
world cannot change a man without God, and will God be near to
work then? Nay, he that was rejected in health and life, will more
likely cast off in death; and if he will not bless his Word, will he
work in the end by other means? This is little better then <hi>Sauls</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
to go to the Devil when God would not help him.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Lords own will is the moving cause hereof;<note place="margin">The Lords will the cause hereof</note> As he
Elected freely, and gave Christ of his love, so this: Nothing in us
could move him hereto,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note> but whom he elected before the world,
those doth he of the same grace effectually call and convert,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> which
should binde our hearts more effectually to praise and serve him all
the days of our life.</p>
                  <p>4. That the excellency of this grace is such,<note place="margin">Without rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, all things else that we have are nothing.</note> as all things without
it are nothing; If we had the wisdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> the strength of
<hi>Sampson,</hi> the policy of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> the wealth of <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> &amp;c.
if we could measure the Heaven, Earth and Sea, and knew the nature
of all Creatures therein, from the Cedar to the Hysope; nay, if
we could understand the Bible, could Preach never so Learnedly,
and had all gifts of knowledge and utterance, yet were we not
born again, all were nothing: Besides, its the more excellent, both
because so rare (only the Elect of God are born again) and because E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
In the natural birth we dye, because born of mortal seed, and
nourished by corruptible food, but they that be born again never dye
more, never come more into their former state, as being born of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
seed, of the Word, and Spirit, and being thereby nourished, are
joyned to the fountain of life, Christ: Again, by our first birth we are
made miserable, by this happy; by that sinners, by this righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
by that children of wrath, by this children of God; by that slaves
of Satan, by this servants of righteousnes; by that limbs of the Devil,
by this members of Christ; by that heirs of Hell, by this heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65522:103"/>
O happy day, O happy birth; before Regeneration, Sin and Satan
wholly ruled in us, but after, Grace and the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>1. This should teach us,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> if we can prove it in our selves to rejoyce,
and remember our birth-day. Many delight to talk of their age, as
others, when, where, and what year they were born; But canst
thou tell where and when thou wert born again? thou canst else have
little joy of thy first birth. The older thou art, the more shame and
greater condemnation if thou art not born again: He that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
is a Bastard; for though he have after a sort the Church to
his Mother, yet he hath not God to his Father; and though in the
Natural birth the Mothers side is the surest, yet in the Spiritual birth
its otherwise: Therefore if thou hast Wit, Beauty, Strength, Wealth,
and the like, rejoyce not in them, but that thou art born again; yea,
though thou art Poor, Weak, Sickly, yet being born again, thou art
happy: If God hath denied thee Wealth and Health, or taken them
away, yet if he hath given thee grace, thou art to rejoyce exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>2. It may teach us to rejoyce,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> if we know our children new born:
We rejoyce at their Natural Birth; but alas, wert not for hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be of Christian Parents, we might rather weep: for when
a childe is born, there's come a sinner, a guilty person into the
World, one that is in danger of all evil, subject to a great deal of
sin and sorrow, and one that hath deserved to be cast into Hell;
O therefore, if we know them born again, there's cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
yea, we must rejoyce at the new birth of a servant or any
other as the Angels do: The World likes such the worse, a sign they
are the old men.</p>
                  <p>3. If we know it not,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> we are to use the means, bring them to
Baptism, after teach them what is fit, that they may make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their Covenant, and bring them to the Word; if they be any
whit forward, further them, if backward or unwilling, use thy Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over them.</p>
                  <p>4. Rebuke them that desire to see them Strong,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> Fair, Rich, Healthy,
and the like, in the mean time not respecting whether they be born
again or not.</p>
                  <p>5. He that is not born again,<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> hath nothing excellent in him, but
abides in death, and is the servant of sin.</p>
                  <p>5. That its so necessary,<note place="margin">Regeneration of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</note> as without which there's no entring into the
Kingdom of Heaven, for thereinto can no unclean thing enter, and
they onely which are pure in heart shall see God:<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 3, 5.</note> We are born impure,
sinful,<note place="margin">Revel. 21. 27.</note> defiled from head to foot; while we are in this state, there's
no possibility of serving God,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 8.</note> as either by thinking, speaking, or doing
good; we must therefore be washed and made clean.</p>
                  <p>The world imagine no such necessity herein, its a riddle to them, few
know what any such work or change meaneth: They think to be
saved by their good meaning, civil life, and living orderly, O this is
sound; if these do not well, God help us all: Again, though
openly bad, if they can cry <hi>God have mercy</hi> on their deathbed, they shall
do well enough: Here's no dreaming of a new birth, of any change
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65522:103"/>
in the understanding, will, affections, yea, throughout both body and
soul;<note place="margin">Col. 3. 9, 10.</note> but none of the others will serve the turn, therefore try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye be new born: If we live still in sin (as in lying) its a certain
argument we are as we were naturally,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is in Christ is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and such a one <hi>walketh not after the flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>but after the Spirit;</hi> if thou
art thus, thou hast put off thy old conversation, and put on a new.</p>
                  <p>6. The effects of Regeneration;<note place="margin">The effects of Regeneration.</note> 1. An hatred of all sin, a love of
all good. 2. A strife and labor to do the one, and avoid the other. 3. A <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
diligent use of the means for this purpose, and a Spiritual combat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the lets, wherein being conquerors, we have peace and joy; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
if otherwise,<note place="margin">See also the notes laid down.</note> grief. 4. Delight in the Word, Prayer, and Heavenly
things, whereas we were wont to delight in vain and worldly things;
so to cry,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Abba-Father,</hi> to love the Father, to <hi>desire the sincere milk of
the Word,</hi> and to live innocently: If upon tryal of thy self by these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
notes,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 29.</note> thou findest thy self not born again,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> thy case is fearful; it had
been better then thou shouldest thus dye, that thou hadst never been
born, or born a Toad, whereof when its dead, there's an end; but
the man that is not born again while he lives, when he dyeth, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death will lay hold on him eternally; yet alas, a number of old
folks ready to drop into the grave, are not yet born again; What
shall become of these? few men are born again when they become
old, which I speak not to discourage you quite, but to awaken you the
more earnestly to look about you; some were called about the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
hour, but let them that have day before them, not defer or put
it to the venture.</p>
                  <p>6. That the life of a Regenerate man cannot be that it was,<note place="margin">A Regenerate man is not the same he was before.</note> or as is
the life of carnal men, for the case is altered; he is now united to
Jesus Christ as an imp to the stock, a member to the head; by Faith
on our parts, but principally by the Spirit of God: by which Faith we
draw, and by which Spirit is conveyed to us vertue from Christs
death to kill sin, our old man, and the corruptions thereof, whereby it
hath a deadly wound given it, which it shall never recover; so from his
Burial, his Spirit conveyeth power to hold under our corruptions, that
they get head no more; so from his Resurrection, power to rise to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life: so that now being graft into such a living stock, by such a
cunning hand of the Spirit of God, the Regenerate man receiveth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
accordingly: He was before a branch of the wilde olive, but now
of the true olive, therefore the fruits are and must needs be accordingly;
so that though he sinneth, yet its not as before: before he was guided
by the Spirit of Satan and the world, now by the holy Spirit of God,
and therefore must needs bring forth the fruits of holiness,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> as it is holy,
must needs be renewed throughout, though not wholly and perfectly.</p>
                  <p>1. Here's a great comfort to Gods children,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and infinite cause have
they to praise God, that whereas before they brought forth nothing
but fruit unto death, now they are enabled to bring forth fruit to God,
and to life; before servants to the flesh, reaping corruption, now to the
Spirit,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> the fruit thereof being everlasting life: There must needs be joy
in doing such work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:65522:104"/>
2. This condemneth them that say they believe,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and hope to be saved by Jesus Christ, and yet continue in their
course: No, every one thats in Christ is a new creature; its a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to Christ to say such fruit comes from him.</p>
                  <p>7. The growth of one thats truly Regenerate,<note place="margin">A Regenerate man groweth by degrees.</note> he is not at his pitch
the first day: Its not with him as with <hi>Adam,</hi> who was perfect at once
in his creation, but he comes to it by degrees; as every thing that
moveth from one place to another, doth it in some space of time, so
in this motion from sin to righteousness and life eternal, its done in
time, and by degrees, and that not in all alike: But as some men are
of greater stature, some of smaller, and sometimes the yonger are
taller then the elder; so it may be in this: but all do and must grow,
and that by the Ministery of the Word and Sacraments, as Corn by
the early and latter rain springs up by degrees: and a Babe first small
and weak, yet by good tendance and Gods blessings grows bigger and
stronger in every part, then can go alone, speak, digest strong meat,
begin to bear burthens, and do the works of a man; so must a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
grow from a Babe to be stronger, to digest strong meat (higher
Points of Doctrine) to be able to go alone in good Duties, by the
finger, as in Prayer, Reading anothers Prayer, but now can go alone
in it, so in other Duties; then stronger to bear Afflictions. Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Mocks, Discouragements, and also to put up wrongs, and go
through duty and service.</p>
                  <p>1. This may rebuke them that are so far from growing,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as they go
back, and are worse then sometimes they were. These may suspect
that either they never begun in truth, but were suddenly moved, had
but some common gifts, and were but built upon the Sand; or else
that they have ill behaved themselves, beginning in the Spirit, to end in
the Flesh: Were you too well? what fault found you that you are
weary, and gone back to your old Master? If you belong to God,
and do not awaken your selves, the Lord will whip you home, will
send you as Runnagates to the house of Correction.</p>
                  <p>2. For those that stand at a stay,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and no difference can be discerned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that they were many years ago, and now, they also are in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
case. Doth not a man look his childe should grow in learning every
year, and would it not grieve if he should stand always at one stay?
We love to see our children grow, and would grieve to see them
Dwarfs, and no bigger now then they were many years ago; and have
we no care of our own or their growth in grace? As men every year
aym more and more to grow in wealth: and as in a Race men press
hard forward towards the mark, so should we to grow in grace. But
why do men grow no faster?<note place="margin">Why men grow no faster in goodness.</note> 
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Some are proud, and conceited
they have more then they have, and so strive not. 2. Some compare
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> themselves with them that are under them, and not with them that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them in grace, and so think they have enough; whereas in
worldly things they reach always at those above, that they may not
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> onely equal them, but over-top them. 3. Some are so cloyed with
the love of the world, and multitude of businesses, that they can
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65522:104"/>
spare no time for this. This is the bane of Religion, and hinders from
many a duty publike and private, choking the Word in the obedience
thereto, and practice thereof, and causing many a duty to be but
poorly performed. 4. Ill company is as great a hinderance to Spiritual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
growth, as the East and North winds to tender flowers and plants.
5. Neglecting and failing of the means of growing; as if any man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
want his meals, he will soon faint, and if any Tradesman want his
Markets, he will soon be Bankrupt. 6. Some use them negligently,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
as Hearing, Praying, &amp;c. and thrive accordingly: He that keeps the
Market but once in a moneth, will not gain much; so they that hear
the Word but now and then at their leisure, will not get forward very
fast, especially they that keep not the main Market, nay, the Mart of
their Souls, The Lords day, when they should make off their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
and provide themselves with all Spiritual commodities.
7. Such as hear often, but without preparation before, or regard after.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
Do men thrive by meat taken into a full or foul stomack? or by
swallowing their meat whole? no more shall we Spiritually thrive
though we swallow down whole Sermons, unless we chew them by
Meditation and Practice they will never nourish us.</p>
                  <p>And whereas many humble Souls complain that they do not grow,<note place="margin">A Caveat for such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain they do not thus grow.</note>
though earnestly desirous thereof, and diligent in the use of the means,
they must examine themselves, whether indeed they have used the
means, and that diligently with preparation and prayer; If not, they
must reform the same; if yea, they may be of good comfort, for
assuredly they cannot but grow somewhat, though not as they would:
They must yet be constant, and that God who hath given them an
heart to use the means of growing,<note place="margin">See <hi>Wilson</hi> of Sanctification, pag. 11. 12.</note> will also enable them to grow: we
must be growing as long as we live here. If we had <hi>Methuselahs</hi>
years to live, and still took pains, yet still there would be work; so
hard is it to get victory over, and to subdue this Army of our lusts,
and to draw dry this ocean of our corrupt affections.</p>
                  <p>Blessed is he that makes this his chief or onely work, to mortifie
more and more his sinful nature, applying the Word, Promises,
Threats, Mercies, Judgements, general, particular, on our selves or
others: To this end God hath given us many means to subdue them,
therefore will be angry if we keep them not under, and grow espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
against our strongest corruptions; they offend God, hurt us,
glad Satan, defile the Temple of the holy Ghost, were the cause of
Christs death, are of long continuance, and therefore must be put
away: And as we must labor daily to mortifie our lusts and old man,
so to grow in all graces.</p>
                  <p>8. The perfection of a Christian:<note place="margin">There's no perfection here in this life.</note> There's none here in this life
we know but in part; there be still remnants of sin in us: we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
perfectly Justified, not, but in part Sanctified. Sin and Grace is
mingled in every part,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> (not sin in one part, and grace in another) as
heat and cold in lukewarm water,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 27.</note> light and darkness in the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
God will have it so to be,<note place="margin">Reasons hereof</note> 1. That we might be saved of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and by Christs merit, and not by any merit of our own: for if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:65522:105"/>
we were perfectly Sanctified here, then should Christ seem onely to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> make us fit to merit our own Salvation. 2. That his power might be
made known in our weakness, whereby we are enabled to overcome
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> such mighty enemies of our Salvation. 3. That continually we might
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> be kept humble, ever thankful to God for daily pardon. 4. That
there might be continual use of the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> one of another. 5. That there might be something to weary us
hence, and make us long for Heaven, where we shall attain that which
here we can never: But though these Corruptions remain, yet

to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> or Rebels that make Insurrection in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but have not the Scepter in their hand, but are subdued in time;
and they dwell in us as unwelcom guests. There is always a Civil war
in a Childe of God; two men in one man, the old and the new; two
laws, the law of our members, and the law of our minde: the Flesh
and Spirit fight each against other,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> now the one prevailing, then the
other,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> yet so as the old man grows weaker, and the grace of God
stronger. It had a deadly blow at first, and still languisheth, and is in
a Consumption;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> as a Serpent that is deadly wounded in his head, yet
wrigles with the tail; or a Soldier deadly wounded in his brain, yet
thrusts with his weapon. The Scripture speaks of the old man in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
as if it were crucified and wholly destroyed, because its
so wounded that it can never recover his former strength.</p>

they meet with temptation, and feel sin rebelling in them, and
their corrupt nature lusting after evil. Its not so much a sign you are
not converted, because you have sin (for thats common to all) as that
you are, because you feel it, strive against it and grieve for it: This
is indeed a sign you have the Spirit in you. The godly and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
sin both, but there's great odds in the maner; the wicked sin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and advisedly, yea, delight in it, are loath to be hindred from
it; when they have done, are not humbled, but go on therein: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Regenerate sin not with full consent, but haled thereto by
force of temptation, and strength of corruption, being thereafter hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
ashamed, grieved. If it be thus with thee, be of good comfort,
be still constant in resisting, use means to subdue the old man, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the new, so shall you every day get the victory more and more,
and when you be overtaken thus, it shall not be laid to your
charge, but pardoned in the Death and Obedience of Jesus Christ:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65522:105"/>
Neither shall your corruption recover it self again to rule over you as
before, but shall still languish; and this is the cause why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaks, as if our Regeneration were perfect, our old man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:
And at last by death we shall get a final and perfect victory,
and never feel sin more, for with laying down our bodies, we lay
down our sin, and not before.</p>

not as it ought: the will desires nothing that good is, or at

mortal seed begets that that is mortal onely, and not immortal; but

of this place, where by Blood, and the will of Man, and
of Flesh, the same is meant that here he calleth mortal seed, and

makes a way for Conversion and Faith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 25.</note> by humbling and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart with the sight of misery; the Gospel effectively: This
works Faith and Repentance, tells us of the remedy, the sufficiency
of it, and how freely it is offered, then works an earnest desire after it,
and an heart to leave any thing that might let us from it; not that
God is tyed to this,<note place="margin">God doth not always tye himself here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> but thus it hath pleased him to appoint ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to work: In times of persecution he can bless, and doth read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word to convert, yea, the report of private men: So also
for Infants he hath another way (no less easie to him, then hidden and
admirable to us) how to work in them, as he sanctified <hi>John Baptist</hi> in
his mothers womb:<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 29, 31</note> He hath not ordained Angels to come and tell
us news from heaven, nor any to come from the dead with tidings,
but <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, Ministers to open and apply the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
and this he makes effectual. Its true, God prepares men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by crosses, as the fire doth the iron, but most are moved present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the Word; some by sickness or terror outward or inward, sent
of God, have something brought to their conscience that they have
heard, and so are converted; as others thereby prepared to the Word,
and thereupon converted by it, as by experience hath been often found.
This is the reason that the Devil hath ever been a spiteful enemy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
an enemy to true, sound, plain and diligent preaching; raising so
many Enemies against it, laying so many logs in the way to hinder the
course of it, raising up such in the Ministery as either preach not at
all,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4, 13.</note> or seldom, or in the fleshly words of mans wisdom, crying down
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65522:106"/>
preaching, under this or that colour, &amp;c. for he knows well that its
the mighty Engine to batter his Kingdom; its that which pulls down
the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note> how base soever in the worlds eyes: Its the
strong voyce of God that casts Satan out of his hold and possession,
his mighty arm that plucks us out of his power and Kingdom, and
translates us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth us highly to esteem of it above all other means,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
not preferring or equalling thereto either Reading or Prayer, publique
or private; For what were this but to thwart the Lord? hath he blest
these alike to win souls? If thou sittest at home and readest, when
thou shouldest be hearing, God will curse thy pride, that thinkest to be
wiser then he, or teachest any so to do.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth us to praise God for his unspeakable mercy towards
us,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that whereas most of the world sitteth in darkness, he hath given
us the means of the new birth: If thou art hereby Regenerate, thou
art happy, if not, thy case is hard; then will it profit us, when it hath
wrought this in us; therefore pray unto God to continue his Word,
and give it power to change thee, and that he would whet this two-edged
sword to pierce through thee, and make it an hammer to break
thy stony heart.</p>
                  <p>3. They that have it not,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> should mourn for it, and pray for it, as
being subject to perish,<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>For where prophesie faileth, the people perish:</hi> we
must pity them who do not pity themselves.</p>
                  <p>4. Labor to profit daily by it,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> for its also for our further building
up, and whereby we go on to perfection, praying that it may be so
long continued, till we shall have no more need of it, or our poor
children whom we leave behinde us.</p>
                  <p>5. Pray to God to give it free passage every day,<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> to the winning of
many souls, to the accomplishment of the number of Gods Elect, and
let every man further it what he can to the utmost of his power, herein
shewing himself Christs true friend: And let all men take heed of
hindring the same; hinderers are enemies to mens souls, and to the
Kingdom of Christ, and friends to the Devils Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Here I may speak how God hath appointed Ministers to be the
bringers of this glad tidings,<note place="margin">The Ministers of the Word, are appointed of God the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to convert souls.</note> that converts the soul, and that the Lord
useth them as instruments to win the soul, who are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Scripture by many Honorable names, as, <hi>Men of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 20.</note>
                     <hi>Ambassadors from God, Spiritual Fathers &amp;c.</hi> so, <hi>Builders, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers,
Watchmen, Shepherds, &amp;c.</hi> in respect of their pains; They are
appointed over the Lords flock, they have the trust of Souls, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
trust that can be; other callings are about mens bodies or goods,
but this their Souls.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore for Preachers,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> we must be faithful, in token of our
thankfulness to God, that hath so highly honored us, and deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
us,<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> so shall our reward be great above others; if we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4.</note>
we must look for greater damnation, as being treacherous in
so weighty a work.</p>
                  <p>2. For people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> how ought they to regard Gods faithful Ministers, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65522:107"/>
watch over their Souls? Alas, how little are they regarded! how
poorly maintained? every thing too much, every little enough for
them; whereas Lawyers, Physicians, &amp;c. live wealthily, are much
sought to: Its a plain sign men love their Bodies better then their
Souls, and the Earthly Inheritance better then the Heavenly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whence it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to pass, that the Word worketh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</note>] These words spoken of God,
are to shew how it comes to pass that the Word is able to Regenerate
and beget us to a new and immortal life; namely, because it is the
Word of him who liveth, and giveth life to all, and endureth for
ever: If it were not the Word of such a one it could not; for as for
the word of man, it can do no such matter. All the wisdom of all
the men of the world put together, and used to perswade a sinner, are
not able to change his heart: The word of a man can but stir up that
in a man which is in him already; but to put any thing into him that
was not in him, it cannot.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth us to preach the pure Word of God purely,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and
not our own Devices: for what is the chaff to the wheat? not any
word of man, this or that (how wise or ancient soever) can put life
into a man: So, nor to mingle mans word with Gods; it hath no
need of help from mans testimony, let it alone, it shall be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that which its appointed for. The Word of God is sharp enough
to divide between the joynts and the marrow,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> though it be not whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on this or that mans Grindstone. As Pearls need no painting, so
that which is of incomparable power,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note> and is pronounced to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
hath no need of the help of weak man.</p>
                  <p>2. Let him that is born anew by the preaching of the Word,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> be
well assured he shall live and endure for ever, as God so liveth and
endureth; as every one that is not begotten thereby, shall through
Gods judgement live after a sort and abide for ever, but it shall be in
everlasting wo and misery.</p>

Regeneration whereof he had spoken, and that is by shewing
the miserable state of a carnal and unregenerate man; and that a man
without this hath nothing that good is, nothing that can please God,
that can stand him in stead, and bring him to Salvation; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is in man besides this, is flesh, is corrupt and sinful, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
vain and vanishing as grass; yea, the best thing that is or
can be in an unregenerate man, is but as a flower, that fadeth soon
away, and cannot abide the heat of the Sun; no more can any thing
in an unregenerate man abide the censure and judgement of Almighty
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65522:107"/>
God: and this he doth to drive as well carnal men out of themselves,
and make them labor for this grace of Regeneration; as to stir up
them that were Regenerate, to be thankful to God for this marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
work, and labor to walk worthy of it in all fruits of holiness
and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Now having laid out the misery of a carnal men, yet he leaves him
not so, but tells him that there is a means to help this, and to bring
him to an happy state, and to live for ever; namely, The Word of
God, which endureth for ever, whereby the Soul is converted, Faith
wrought, we united to Christ, and fetch from him as pardon of sin by
his death, and favor by his obedience; so, ability to live the life of
grace here, and the life of glory hereafter. But lest any should say,
But where is this Word that is able to do thus wonderfully for us?
and how must it be dealt with to make it thus effectual for our Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration?
He tells them, that its among them; and being sincerely
preached, and humbly heard, believed and obeyed, would become
effectual to their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>In the words we have both the Law and the Gospel: 1. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
state of all unregenerate men. 2. The mean to make us live
for ever. Both these are set down in two Propositions: The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the base estate of a carnal man, hath two branches, one a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
above another; The first, that all flesh (that is, whosoever is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and unregenerate) is grass, that is, frail, brittle, fickle, perishing,
which is not onely in respect of his bodily estate, but any thing else
in him. The second, that the glory of man (that is, the best things
that be or can be in him) are as the flower of grass, vain and vanishing.
The second concerns the Word of the Lord, that it endureth for ever,
and that to make us live for ever, by uniting us to Christ the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of life.</p>
                  <p>The words are taken out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 6, 7, 8. (where note by the way,
that no text is ever cited out of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi>) the Apostle being guided
by the same Spirit that the Prophet was, looking upon the same sense,
not standing precisely upon the very words.</p>
                  <p>

that, yet in the spring the beasts will crop and bite it off; if it miss both
these, yet the mower will cut it down with his sithe; if it escape all
these, yet there is one thing coming that it cannot escape, namely, the
cold frosty winter, whereby it must needs wither away: So we may be
blasted as soon as we be born; how many have dyed the same day they
have been born, or shortly after? if we scape then, yet some disease
may bite us in our youth; or if we miss both these, death with his sithe
may cut us down in our middle age; but if yet we scape, the winter not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

such delight in a piece of clay? may it not lie by the walls this week?
may not a Tuft of grass be cut down this night? O that there should be
such excess, cost, vain fangles, endless and too much time spent in
trimming up the body, and no care of decking the soul! O this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

a great deal of precious time is spent this way? Also what art thou

In the second Table, God for the preservation of civil society, hath
left a little more light to discern between right and wrong, just and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,

for our will, its altogether corrupt and rebellious; it ought to be

right, it will not onely not be ruled, but will over-rule Reason; as the

better way to effect it, then the preaching of the Word, you should
do well to set about it: But if ye do neither of these (as I know ye

was done by preaching. Its true, the Word read and preached are
both alike apt to convert in respect of themselves, but not in respect
of us; as whole loaves, and bread cut in pieces and made small,
have like nature and aptness to nourish in respect of themselves,
but not in respect of us: for whole loaves will not enter into the
mouth, nor into the stomack; or if they could be there, so fit to digest
as when cut small, yea and chewed, for then its fit: So a sentence of
Scripture must be broken, and divided into Doctrine and Use, then
its fit, and not till then to nourish us; so that the cause why the Word
read is not so apt to Regenerate and nourish us as the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is not in the Word it self, but in us, in respect of our weakness
that cannot conceive it, nor yet apply it to our selves.</p>

and that as sufficient for the Salvation of a Congregation, they are
Enemies to the Souls of Gods people. True it is, the reading of the
Word, as well privately as publikely in the Congregation, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
both holy and profitable, and hath ever been used in the Church
of God, and is to this day, but yet not as sufficient (as the other) to

this second, hoping for the same assistance; and I pray
lets all attend to the beginning with carefulness, for no doubt sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of us (so frail are we) shall never live to the end of it, and
therefore are to make the best use of that we shall hear.</p>

whereof he was perswaded many of them were partakers;
now he perswades them to declare and honor that state and calling by
a life answerable, even an holy conversation, both in their general
and special callings, renouncing the sins and corruption from which
they were called, and which became not new persons, and performing
all the contrary good duties, beseeming them that are called to the
state of grace and hope of glory.</p>

cannot stand together, it must needs be accompanied with
a new life: This is the end of our new birth. The life of a
Regenerate man must be a continual practice of mortification,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Seeing you are Regenerate, and God hath done so much for you
as thus and thus, therefore we must lay aside, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. Here's reproof for those that bless themselves,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as if they were
Regenerate and Believers, who do yet still live in their old lusts; Do
Vines bear Haws and Brambles? do men gather Grapes of Thorns?</p>
                  <p>2. Admonition to all that have proof of this work of Gods special
grace in them,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> which Man nor Angel could not have wrought, and
which is given but to a few, that they labor to shew forth their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
by renouncing all evil, and setting themselves on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
duties to please God.</p>
                  <p>3. Comfort to them that do thus,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> They may rejoyce in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Regeneration, they have cast off the work of darkness,
put on the armor of light.</p>
                  <p>2. That there's no perfection here to be attained,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> for men cannot
lay away that they have not,<note place="margin">There's no perfection to be attained here.</note> but that they have; even the best have
remnants of the old man, they have sin dwelling, though not
reigning in them; they are sanctified throughout, but not perfectly;
so that though it be true,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 9. &amp; 1. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>That he that is born of God, sinneth not,</hi> its also,
<hi>That if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in
us;</hi> God will have it so to humble us, and exercise us in his Word,
Sacraments, Prayer, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns all such monsters as challenge any perfection or
purity here,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> whereof have been sundry sorts, raised up by Satan at all
times, as the Pelagians, Catharists, Caelestians, Donatists, Anabaptists,
Libertines, Family of love, &amp;c. a dangerous Opinion: 1. To puff up
with arrogancy while they look for inherent righteousness to come to
heaven. 2. To drive such into desperation that feel the corruptions of
their hearts rebelling, and cannot be rid of the same, which yet was
the case of <hi>Paul</hi> himself: We are at the best unprofitable servants, and
while we live shall for many things stand in need to make this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note>
                     <hi>Forgive us our trespasses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This must not yet quail or discourage us from this Spiritual
combat,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> but rather set us on work more carefully; for though we
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65522:112"/>
cannot overcome in all, yet we may prevail much; and though we
shall have cause to say with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> yet
we shall also have cause to say with him, <hi>I thank God through Jesus
Christ;</hi> and though we shall have cause to grieve that we can get no
more mastery, yet we shall have cause to rejoyce, that we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that we have, wherein though we have gone on but slowly, yet
sincerely: Original sin is not a cistern, if it were, we would never leave
till by the grace of God we had emptied it;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> but its a spring, when we
have pumped out all we can at night, at a Fast, at a Sacrament, yet it
will come in again quickly; there will still be more, whereat not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
we must not be discouraged, and give over, but out with
all again, for the longer we tarry, the fuller it will be, therefore we
are to set upon it both quickly and continually.</p>
                  <p>3. That its no easie thing to be a Christian,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> its no plain, nor easie
life or work,<note place="margin">To be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is a work of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> but a very difficult, sore and painful life, for a man to
renounce those sins which be so neer to him, and he so wonderfully
given to, <hi>to deny himself, and take up his cross,</hi> therefore we are bid,
strive,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 23.</note> labor, study, give all diligence hereunto, mortifie our earthly
members, pluck out our right eye, cut off our right hand, &amp;c. so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
affections as be within us, so many armed soldiers we have to fight
against; therefore is our life compared to a warfare, as who are to
fight against three sore Adversaries, the Devil, the World, and our
own Lusts, the worst of all: O how hard it is to resist the multitude
and example of the vulgar and most! how hard to despise the baits of
unlawful Honors, Profits, Pleasures! how hard to overcome the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
troubles for well-doing! how hard to resist the Devil! but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our own corrupt heart is a rebellious traytor, subtile and wicked,
which few overcome, and great is their reward which doovercome.</p>
                  <p>1. They that finde themselves in an easie way,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> are not in the state
of grace: Its easie to follow the course of the world, and our own
will, but he that doth thus, is in the broad way; but to deny these,
and obey God, we shall finde hard, it will cost much labor, many
prayers, sighs, tears, much hearing, meditation, partaking of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and the like.</p>
                  <p>2. For them that wrestle,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and finde themselves beset, and therefore
are fain to take pains, let such be of good comfort; this is the way
to heaven, be not discouraged, go on; the work is hard, but the crown
and reward is wonderful eternal.</p>
                  <p>4. That under those corruptions here named,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> all others are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">Vnder those here named, all other corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note>
and the first word may be taken very fitly for all naughtiness in
general, the rest being particular branches thereof, elsewhere more
are set down: Therefore a Christian must not renounce onely some
evils, but all, all being hateful to God, he must cast away every thing
that presseth down,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 5.</note> we must cleanse our selves from all filthiness of
flesh and spirit:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> The Spirit of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> and the love of any one sin, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be together in one heart; and here he names onely those wherein
they were most faulty, and which were contraries to that love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
unto in the former Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:65522:113"/>
Therefore wheresoever there's the love and practise of any one sin,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
assuredly the Spirit of God dwells not in that man, neither is there
any work of Regeneration in him.</p>
                  <p>5. That most of those here mentioned be inward corruptions,<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
which we must as well avoid,<note place="margin">Most of the corruptions here named are inward.</note> as the outward, the sins of the tongue,
and the like: Its not enough to pare away the outward sins, but the
heart also must be purged; we must be sanctified throughout, our
whole Spirit,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 26.</note> Soul and Body,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 23.</note> must be kept blameless.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth those that will look to the outside,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and yet in
the mean time suffer their hearts to boyl full of Lusts, and swarm ful of
Corruptions, of Pride, Envy, Impatience, Unbelief, &amp; the like, making
no conscience of these; This is an ill sign: These haply may bridle
themselves awhile, but they wil surely break out one time or other; if
they should not, yet were they but painted Sepulchres in Gods sight.</p>
                  <p>2. This may comfort Gods Servants who groan under their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
corruptions,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and when men think they have done well, yet they
shake their heads at themselves, at their dulness to good, at their Pride
and Hypocrisie therein, at their unwillingness thereto, at their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings:
This is the minde of Gods true Servants, and this also may
much comfort them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore laying aside]</hi> Now of the vices themselves, or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
rather as they are in the Regenerate.</p>
                  <p>I remember I requested in the beginning of the Chapter to attend
to it, because we knew not whether we should live to the end of it,
or no; and is it not proved true? Some that were at the first Sermon
(there being but a little intermission from the course of my Ministery
here) are now at their long home;<note place="margin">The Author was absent at this time three weeks.</note> not Ancient alone, but Yong
and Lusty also, that might have lived to see the most of us buried:
Therefore I see we had need take heed not to Chapters onely, but
to every Verse, every particular Sermon, this very Sermon, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
making the best use and benefit thereof, seeing no man knows
whether he shall hear another, so vain a thing is man; and I pray God
we may so do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All malice,]</hi> The Word signifieth very properly all kinde of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness,
and so may fitly here, as the genus of the vices that follow, and
all others, and accordingly speak we thereof. <hi>Naughtiness:</hi> What is
that that is naught?<note place="margin">Obser.</note> and what makes a thing naught? That which
is forbidden by God in his Word,<note place="margin">Thats naught which is forbidden in Gods Word.</note> as that is good which he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;
for his will is the absolute rule of righteousness: who doth not
see a thing first good, then willeth it, but willeth and commandeth it,
and thereupon it becomes good,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 4.</note> and so on the contrary; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sin is said to be the transgression of the Law.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth us to examine all things, and knowing any thing
commanded,<note place="margin">Use.</note> to conclude that its good, and thereupon to do it; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily,
knowing any thing forbidden, that thenceforward we know
it to be naught, and therefore abhor it; for what good can come of
that which is naught? and what should we have to do therewith?
The Lords will is a rule of Righteousness, all promises made to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65522:113"/>
the obedience of it, and all the threatnings and plagues upon the world
have come because of disobedience, that God would have his will,
and men will not, but have theirs. This is the trouble of the world,
and that which hath cost the world full dear, yet how few knowing
Gods will can be content there to rest, and say, Now I know this is
forbidden, I have done with it, I know this prescribed, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obey it? O this were a happy world!</p>
                  <p>But if by this word we understand malice in particular,<note place="margin">What malice is</note> Its an old
grudge upon some wrong done, or conceived to be done to a
man, whereupon he waits to do some hurt or mischief to him that
did it.</p>
                  <p>Anger is like a fire kindled in thorns,<note place="margin">The difference between it and anger.</note> soon blazeth, is soon out;
but malice, like a fire kindled in a log, it continues long: This is
often forbidden,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 31.</note> and yet as <hi>Esau</hi> hated <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Haman Mordecai;</hi>
so the world hateth Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 8.</note> as being reproved of them,
and who run not with them into the same exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2. If we be overtaken (as a right good man may) take heed it
fester not,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> grow not to hatred, heal it quickly, as we do our wounds:
The Devil is an ill Counsellor, cast it out to night, how can you else
lie down in peace, or pray? prayers be lost, and that's a grievous
loss: Nay further, Cast it out to night, thou mayest dye ere to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
and then shalt thou either dye in malice, or else forgive <hi>per</hi>

may be thou dost but imagine a wrong, and then there's no cause, thou
dealest unjustly: but if there be, wilt thou revenge? Its the Lords
office; Take heed of perking up into Gods place, as if he would
not deal equally, either not revenging at all, or not sufficiently; The
Lord knoweth what is best, let him alone, else thou turnest off his

                     <note place="margin">What we are to understand by guile.</note> Its meant of guile, that is between men and men in
their dealings each with other, as in buying, selling, letting, hiring,
borrowing, lending, paying wages, doing work, partnership, and
the like; when men would seem to do well, but do otherwise; when
one thing is pretended but another practised:<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 14.</note> Guile in the buyer is
naught,<note place="margin">Prov. 11. 1.</note> as not to pay, or to pay in ill coyn; so also there may be
many frauds in the seller:<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 6.</note> These God forbids, and he is an avenger
of such things; we are not born for our selves, but for the good each
of other: we must love our Neighbor as our self, and do to him as we
would be done to; we must not lye one to another, seeing we are
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65522:114"/>
members one of another, as it were monstrous in the natural body, to
see the hand beguile the mouth, &amp;c. and yet how common is this
sin? how doth one spread a net for another? not caring how they
come by their goods, so they be once masters of them.</p>
                  <p>The buyer should look to himself,<note place="margin">Object.</note> his eye is his Chapman, he should have
had more wit.</p>
                  <p>Thou shouldest have looked to him,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and God will say to thee, thou
shouldest have had more love, and more honesty.</p>
                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Object.</note> plain dealing is best, but he that useth it shall dye a beggar.</p>
                  <p>This proverb was never framed in an honest heart,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but in an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
and prophane heart; Its as much as if we should say, men
should speed the worse for obeying God, and they that dishonor him
most shall speed best at his hand.</p>
                  <p>We must maintain our charge,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and except we use our wit, and the best
shifts we can, we shall not do it.</p>
                  <p>Saith not the Scripture,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> 
                     <hi>A man cannot be established by iniquity?</hi> Hath
not our Savior promised,<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 3.</note> that if we shall in the first place seek Gods
Kingdom,<note place="margin">Matt. 6. 33.</note> all other things shall be added unto us; we shall have that
which is meet, and Gods blessing withal, and thats better then never
so much with his curse, an ill conscience, and the loss of our Souls,
God will rifle in it, and scatter it at his pleasure: What if we get
not so much, or so hastily, as they that care not what they do? (and
yet God often crosseth such, and hath ways to defeat them, as to
bless his servants) A Thief robs by the High-way, he steals Twenty
pounds, sooner then an honest man can earn Twenty pence, what
then? would the true man change parts with him, when he sits quiet
on his Loom, or is threshing in the Barn without fear, whereas the other
hath the Countrey raised after him, and being apprehended is haled
to the Goal, thence to the Bar and Gallows? whose part is best?
There's no less difference between goods well and ill got.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All]</hi> This is added to shew (lest any should think none but guile in
great matters or measure forbidden here) that there's a through-Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

My shop is not so dark as others; I mingle not my commodities so
much as such and such; I never deceived in any great matters: All
guile must be abandoned of a Christian that cares for his Soul. A
Christian must shew forth the truth of his Christianity in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Calling, in his shop, Buying, Selling, &amp;c. that men may take
his word, and believe it, as if they had seen it with their own eyes, yea,
count his words as good as a bond, that they dare rest on his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
that he will not deceive: O some smile at this, as if there
were none such, I hope there be some, its pity they be so rare; Its
but that every Christian should do, and must, if he will honor his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and do as God requires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And hypocrisies,]</hi> Not that grossest (as I take it) that our Savior
Christ condemned in the Scribes and Pharisees, and that which is so
common in the world, that come to Church and place all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in Ceremony, and make no account of the power of any part of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65522:114"/>
it in their lives; and yet of this hypocrisie Gods servants have rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
whereby oftentimes they draw nearer to God with their lips,
then their hearts; their knee is bowed, when the heart is not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the tongue goes, when the soul mourns not unto God: But
this chiefly is meant,<note place="margin">Whats here to be chiefly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by hypocrisie.</note> when a man is willing to be better thought of
then there is cause; when he hates sin indeed, but not so much as he
would seem; so loves good, hath some care in his Family, &amp;c. this
often befals good men, and is for want of setting our selves in the
sight of God nakedly, and looking to him with whom we have to
do: Now he seeth what and how we do, so that we are to lay away
all approving of our selves to men, that is not joyned with as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a care to approve our selves to God that seeth our very hearts,
and let us rather do more then is thought of us, or then we desire
should be thought to be in us, then less; that if we deceive the opinion
of men, it may be in the better, not in the worse.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What Envy is.</note> Of this I have spoken in handling the Ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:
Its a bearing ill will, and wishing hurt, not for any hurt
done to us, but because another man prospers, or doth or is accounted
of better then we would have him, or we our selves are; therefore
we seek to disgrace him, cannot abide his commendations, labor his
ruine: Thus <hi>Cain</hi> against <hi>Abel,</hi> the Scribes and Pharisees against our

comes to sow the seed; and having purged the stomack of ill humors,
he comes to prescribe wholesom food, namely, the word of God,
which he would have them seriously and heartily to love and long
after, and the Ministery thereof, being that wholesom means of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
that God hath ordained to this end, that they might grow
and encrease from grace to grace thereby, till they should come to the
full measure of their Sanctification which they were to attain unto
in this life: So that in this verse we have the Affection, the Object,
and the End; or, 1. A duty required, namely, to desire after
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65522:115"/>
the Word of God, which is set down by a similitude from children
new born: and 2. How the Word of God is described, namely,
from the nourishing nature thereof, its called Milk; the purity, its
sincere Milk; and the end thereof, that they might grow thereby.</p>
                  <p>He had before willed them to lay aside all malice, &amp;c. now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the sincere milk of the word: Hereby implying, that</p>
                  <p>The Word of God cannot thrive or prosper in an unsanctified

God is holy, and will not abide in an unclean heart, no more then
Rose-water will keep good in a musty or foul vessel. 2. It crosseth
all our sins and corruptions; whoso therefore loveth any one sin,
cannot love the Word: Hence it is that so few affect the Word
soundly, even because it crosseth that which they love, and so few
grow by it, because their hearts be defiled with some sin.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us abandon the love of all evil and sin from us,<note place="margin">Use.</note> if
ever we mean to finde the Word sweet unto us, or to prosper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
so far doth any man profit in the love of Gods Word, as he
profits in the hatred of sin: The best nourishment taken into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
stomack, yet nourisheth not; so its with the Word: The most
come to Church with hearts over-grown with rank weeds more or
less, therefore cannot the Word thrive in them; and so the carnal
people of the world receive no benefit after long preaching, and they
that have good things in them, yet when they suffer some corruptions
in themselves to wax too rank, do not thrive in grace.</p>
                  <p>The duty required is, <hi>As new born babes to desire the sincere milk of the
word,</hi> so being much conversant both in the hearing and reading
thereof.</p>
                  <p>The desire that new born babes or yong children have after their

ours be towards the Word. 1. Earnest; the new born babe hath not
only an aptness to suck at the first, but makes aym at the dug, wrings
and turns the head, and gapes, which is the wonderful work of God,
nay, desires it so earnestly, as it will cry for it, yea and if it hath it
not,<note place="margin">Iob 23. 12.</note> nothing else will still it; and after it hath been accustomed
thereto,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 1. &amp; 119. 20, 103, 111, 227.</note> no dancing, rocking or gingling will still it, but the Big it
must have, and that satisfieth it. Such must be our desire to the
Word, an earnest fervent desire, so as nothing can satisfie us without
it,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 98, 99.</note> but we esteem it above all, both profit and pleasure. Such as be
new born do thus desire it; and no wonder, for it made <hi>David</hi> wiser

the Promises so comfortable, the very Threatnings also able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

us the way we have to walk in: O there can be no part thereof spared.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth those that have no desire at all to the Word,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>

had as leave be at home, as thereat, no Sermon, but for names sake;
that care not to come to the Word, or if they come for company or
fear of the Law, yet its without any appetite or desire, and therefore
they come no more then they must needs for shame or danger: Tell
whether Papists or others amongst our selves that care not for the
Word, of profits or pleasures, they like it well, but as for a Sermon,
they have no appetite thereto, finde no savor therein; some had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be with their Oxen, and at their Farms, some at Bull baiting,
or some Play; some had as leave be in the Churchyard as in the
Church, love the Word as one would love a Prison: This is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sign of carnal persons dead in their sins; as if a childe after it
were born, or at any time, should lie a day or two and make no aym
for the Big, would not every body say it were dead? Many other
would seem to desire Preaching, and wish they had a good Preacher,
but in the mean time it troubles them not, they seek not to compass
it, nor mourn for the want, nor will they take pains to stir abroad to
hear elswhere till they have one of their own: Certainly these men
have no life of grace in them, if they had, they would not onely
wish for it, but earnestly desire it: Doth the childe onely sometimes
make aym for the big? No, but if it be well it will cry for it: These
profit accordingly when they hear, because they hear not with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
others can be kept from the Word by every trifle, and wonder
that others are not: For this sin of the contempt of the Word, God
may justly visit the Land, as he doth every year with one Judgement
or other, and why rather then for this mother sin, and great unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
for this most precious and invaluable Jewel?</p>
                  <p>2. It may comfort those that long after it,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and so earnestly desire
it, as nothing can please them without it; a fair house, fertile ground,
wholesom ayr, a good farm, all this gives them no content without
the Word, which should sweeten and teach the use of all; O if
they had thought they should not have had the Ministery of the
Word, they would never have come there; and now labor by all
means, not coldly, but with endeavor to compass it, going where it
is, till they have it, taking great pains about it, hot and cold, in winter
and summer, a good sign of health of such as are alive, born again,
when men are not held away by any small occasion, are never so glad
as when they are at it,<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 3. and 8. 17.</note> never so grieved as when withheld therefrom.
These be they that shall profit.</p>

Word,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 20.</note> still hungring after it. Regenerate persons or true Christians
desire it again and again; for why, they seek so much to know, that
they desire still to hear more; they finde their Faith feeble, therefore
desire more still that it may be strengthened: They finde many and
strong corruptions, therefore they would hear that which might sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due

they desire to hear still as often as they can, and all too little; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

a Sabbath is full enough, once a moneth for a need, yea, once a
quarter would serve the turn; Its a sign of clung and starved souls,
for as they that be in health, must eat oft; so they that have spiritual
health in soul, must hear oft; Therefore they that loath, and are
weary of the Word, its a sign of sick souls, having no Stomack to
this food, its a sign they are dead at the heart.</p>
                  <p>2. For those that feel an appetite from Sermon to Sermon,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and
to hear oft, its a sign they see their wants, and finde the goodness of
the Word.</p>

go again to day? must you go on the week day too? Why,
know ye not that growing persons eat oft, are often hungry: They

will serve their turn.</p>

and sincerely, that it may appear good milk.</p>
                  <p>Many look upon pomp and outward complements,<note place="margin">Use.</note> so as they
set light by the Ministery of them that want them, counting them
plain men, simple men to see to; let such know, that not painting
of the Cask makes good wine.</p>
                  <p>These being the duties of the people, thus earnestly, constantly,
and impartially to desire the Word of God, by the way in a word
Ministers must learn their duty, and how to carry themselves.</p>
                  <p>1. As the People be the Children,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> so Ministers be the Nurses,
therefore they must be no dry Nurses,<note place="margin">Ministers must have store of milk for their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Children.</note> then the people shall desire and
miss, but have full breasts, that their Children may have enough to
nourish them: They must Study, Read, Meditate, Pray, that their
breasts may be full, as good House-holders, they must have old and
new for every bodies turn,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> give every one their portion; and as good
Nurses that fear they shall want milk, eat and drink spoon-meat more
then they are willing; so must we study, against our ease to satisfie
our spiritual Children, not woo-meal our Children.</p>
                  <p>2. Ministers as they must have milk enough,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> so must they have

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Ministers must have much patience,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> that though the people,
some or all be wayward,<note place="margin">Ministers must have much patience</note> and take not the breast handsomly, yea,

                     <hi>Milk of the Word]</hi> The Word is here and elswhere compared to
milk (as to wine and bread,<note place="margin">The Word why compared to milk.</note> this being to the Soul as those to the
body) as in respect of the plainness of it to yong children,<note place="margin">Isa 55. 1.</note> which is
therefore opposed to strong meat,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 2.</note> that is, harder Points, and Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Religion,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note> so especially for the nourishing nature thereof.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore they that may hear the Word,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and will not, starve
their own souls, and are wilfully guilty of their own destruction;
They that take away the Word from any place, pluck away the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bread, and leave the people to perish for want of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>2. Christians must desire it,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and hunger and thirst after it, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God to continue it, and that of all punishments, he would not send
a famine of the Word: The Soul hath a life as well as the Body, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
food will do it no good, therefore the Word must be had.</p>
                  <p>3. This also stops the mouthes of those that wonder at Christians
because they hear oft,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> they can never be content; They did hear on
the Sunday, must they go on the week day too? Did not you eat
yesterday, yet will dine to day again? and no marvel, for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live without it; no more can the Soul without the Word, the
Spiritual food thereof: And though your Soul be a small feeder,
and little will content it, indeed nothing at all, because you have no
Spiritual life in you, yet the children of God that are alive, must have
it again and again: We say, They that are growing must eat oft, and
are hungry, so must growing Christians hear oft.</p>
                  <p>Its also compared to milk for the sweetness of it;<note place="margin">Psalm 19. 10.</note> nothing sweeter
to a childe then the mothers breast, so is the Word to a new born
Christian.</p>
                  <p>They that feel no sweetness therein,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> their mouth is out of taste
with sin,<note place="margin">Nothing sweeter to Gods children then the Word</note> as they also to whom it seems bitter; contrarily, they
that finde it sweet, pleasant, delightsom, yea every part thereof, and
to whom even the threatnings thereof are welcom, as whereby their
corruption may be subdued, its an infallible sign that they are Gods
children.</p>
                  <p>Besides,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> as milk is a general food for all Christians rich and poor,
so is the Word the common food of all Christians,<note place="margin">The Word is the common food of all Christians.</note> the means of their
begetting and edifying; the greatest must look for no other, so neither
the poorest, none must neglect it, its the common food of all that
shall be saved: Happy is the Land therefore that flows with <hi>Peters</hi>
milk and <hi>Davids</hi> honey, they have the best Spiritual complexions
that be fed therewith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sincere]</hi> That is,<note place="margin">The Word why called sincere.</note> Pure, Unmixt, a borrowed speech from honey
that is not mixt, but <hi>sine cera,</hi> without wax; and its so called, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     </gap>ght to
desire it the more earnestly) but because there be such as will deal
with the Word, as Hucksters that sell milk, and mingle it with water;
so some mix the Word with Errors, and deliver it not sincerely,
whereof accordingly they were to take heed.</p>
                  <p>

Hereof he had great cause to warn those Jews, because there were
false Teachers, that labored to draw them from Christ altogether;
others joyned Law with Christ, as if Salvation were not by Christ
alone: This was to put poison in the milk.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth Ministers to preach the Word sincerely without
mixture:<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> For matter, all must be according to the Law and the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the Ballance of the Sanctuary, so that they may boldly
avouch thereof,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 20.</note> that <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> they must speak as the words
of God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 11.</note> and his Oracles: And for maner, it must not be carnal, in
humane eloquence, and curious words of mans wisdom; such teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
darkens the Word. The Lord hath left us marvellous things in
his Word,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 129, 130.</note> and yet in a very plain maner, He saith <hi>they be wonderful</hi> in
one Verse, and in the next, <hi>That the entrance into them giveth wisdom
and sheweth light:</hi> So must Ministers deliver it in an holy kinde of
plainness, not mingling therewith carnal and fleshly eloquence, fine
conceits, and I know not what witty sayings out of Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to garnish the same, but handle Spiritual things spiritually, not
being ashamed of the simplicity and plainness of the Gospel, for this
foolish and plain preaching shall be blessed, and be the wisdom and
power of God, when that wisdom shall remain unprofitable and vain;
What is the chaff to the wheat? all that vain Ornament doth but
disgrace the Word, and it may be seen that God is displeased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
for that he blesseth it not to win Souls, as he doth that other
which is despised of many of the world, and counted plain English
preaching, a good English Sermon.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth the people to avoid all vain and humane corrupt
mixtures,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> accepting onely that which is sincere milk: For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
They must take no erroneous Points for truth, but be able (with
the <hi>Bereans</hi>) to try all things by the Scripture,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 17.</note> and so rejecting the
rest, keep that which is good; they that through ignorance slap us all
together, will be poisoned in stead of being nourished: It is the safest
and best dyet which is most simple, and therefore some render this
as a reason why our Forefathers were stronger, and lived longer then
we do, even because of the simpleness of their dyet; this Spiritual
mixture hath been the cause of all Errors, wherein some truth is used
to help away the falshood: So for the maner, They must affect a
plain and Spiritual kinde of preaching, when the Text is clearly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
aptly divided into his parts, the Doctrines maturely gathered,
strongly confirmed for the setling of the judgement; and lastly, Uses
are made of Admonition, Reprehension, Consolation, Confutation,
together with Exhortation, all applyed to the consciences of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
Oh, this is sweet! Many simple people desire to hear Sermons,
stuft with sentences out of Authors, and that in a strange tongue,
and highly commend it, though they understand it not; and is
not this a great folly and judgement of God upon them? A num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of idle and vain curious heads, had rather hear fine witty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
ancient stories, pleasant discourses, serving rather to tickle
the ear, then to edifie the Conscience, such are like those that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65522:117"/>
desire sawce, and leave the meat. But Preaching was never ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but to work upon the Conscience, and in such teaching the true
Servants of God finde no favor, but grief; when its kindely, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and spiritually handled, then its sweet to them.</p>

of our Hearing, Reading, Meditating, Conferring thereof, is not
that we might get some knowledge to tip our tongues with, and make
our selves the better thought of in some companies, as some do, or
that we may be able to discourse, haply eavil against it, but that it
may work effectually in our hearts, to humble us, to work in us true
Faith and Repentance, and being wrought, may be increased and set
forward more and more, and hereat we should aim at all times; when
we read a Chapter, or hear a Sermon, we must come with this minde,
that we may be the better thereby: For the Word is ordained and is
apt and able not onely to convert, and beget us, but also to nourish us,
that we may grow up from strength to strength.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 15.</note>

this? Yea, also if those that have some goodness in them came with
this minde, and cast with themselves to go away gainers, and it
would grieve them as much to make an ill market at Church, as at
<hi>London</hi> or elsewhere, surely they would grow and thrive faster in
Grace; They could not then fit and sleep, for who sleeps at his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
while profit drops? Its said of <hi>Agustus Caesar,</hi> that he thought that
day lost, or ill spent, wherein he had done no good to others; so
we should moan our losses, and think that Sermon lost, whereby

in fault; as 1. Pride, when men think too well of themselves:

blessed and spiritual life that is in himself, whereas they were dead
before, and makes them which were an habitation for the Devil, a
dwelling-house for the Lord wherein to take pleasure; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before they were unholy and prophane, he being once come to
them, will make them holy Priests, apt to offer such Sacrifices to God
as he will accept of by Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>This he sets out in a borrowed speech, taken from the Temple of
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was the House of God, wherein he took pleasure, and
in which he dwelt after a sort,<note place="margin">A comparison between the Temple of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and that which Christ maketh of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him.</note> by manifestation of his favors: As that
was built of many fair stones in a magnifical maner, and in it were
Priests that offered sacrifices to God, such as he required and accepted,
such a Temple doth Christ Jesus make of all that believe in him, save
that its every way more excellent: The foundation of that was but
a dead stone, this a living stone, Christ Jesus; all the stones of that
(though fair, yet but) dead stones, of this all living, answerable to the
foundation; those joyned together with morter, these by the Spirit
and Faith; that was an Earthly House, this a Spiritual House; there
were Sacrifices of the blood of Bulls and Goats, but these be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Sacrifices; there the Temple was one thing, and the Priest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
here the Temple and the Priest are all one; there the Priest one,
and the Sacrifice another, here both are one and the same.</p>
                  <p>Now this that he hath said concerning Christ Jesus, the foundation
of his Church, and of the good estate of those that be built upon
him, he confirms out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16. which accordingly he applies, as
well for the comfort of the godly, as the terror of unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>For this foundation, consider what he is, and how esteemed: What
he is,<note place="margin">Christ why compared to a stone.</note> A stone, so compared for his firmness, stability and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;

for thee, and purchased it; But I have no power to do any good? but
I have enough (saith Christ) to make thee a Sanctified man.</p>
                  <p>3. Christ is willing to have us come to him,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> and therefore also
doth earnestly call us:<note place="margin">Isa 55. 1.</note> If one know himself poor, and that such a

yet draw back, set one foot forward, and pull the other back again,
fain would believe, and yet cannot, but fear (Oh, its not for me) and
cannot be perswaded that they be of the number of such whom Christ
will save: Why, what would you have Christ say to you? He bids
all without exception, <hi>that are weary and heavy laden with their sins, to
come to him,</hi> that is, believe in him; its also the end of his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world: You stand in great need of mercy, do ye not? O yes,
above all the world, and cannot indure to think but that I should
have part therein; and Christ hath need of some to shew his mercy

on, and therefore calls thee: Therefore as in a Market, one having
need of a Commodity, another (that hath it) of money, me thinks these
two should quickly agree, the Buyer and the Seller, who both come
for that end; so is it between Christ and the poor sinner, wherefore
else doth Christ set forth his stall of so rich mercies, and call people to
them? to send them away empty? no verily, Christ hath said the
contrary, and so can assoon deny himself, as not save thee; therefore
believe,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 29.</note> which is the great Commandment of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> but I am so unworthy.</p>

but feel thy misery,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 27.</note> then believe Christ will save thee: What was the
Jaylor when he did believe? believing will break thy heart, and
bring Repentence; O that we should so much, so often, and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
be perswaded to believe, and yet do not. If a King shall call
a poor Subject,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and reach him a handful of gold, will he draw back,
and say, I am unworthy that he should call me, or I should come to
him; What am I? I never deserved any such thing, &amp;c. If it be
great, great gifts become a great God; and seeing he will do it, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not thy self, thou shalt be the more bound to love and praise him
here and for ever; yet is it no easie matter to believe: If a man
had this Church lying upon his back, it were not so easie a mater to
rise and stand upright; so, when any have the wrath of the infinite
God lying upon their Souls, what can they do? howsoever, do
your endeavor, strive against unbelief, discern between temptations
that come from the Devil, and the promises of God; those (how
many soever) reject as lyes, but these apply diligently, stand even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one word of Gods mouth, and let that comfort thee more then
ten thousand temptations to dismay thee.</p>
                  <p>3. This Rebuketh the most part of men,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that will not come at
Christ, though he call them, and offer them wonderful fair; He bids
them come, confess their sins, seek to him for Salvation, and be ruled
by him, and he will take all their burthen on him and save them:
But how few give ear to this gracious voyce and offer? how many
go on, and are not at all moved, though Christ be preached daily?
though they need him, he be sufficient for them, and willing to do
them good? and why? few can be perswaded of their danger:
Civil persons, Ignorant ones, and a number of Worldlings are
so glued to these things, that they savor and minde no other
life, nor offer of any such thing; A number of prophane peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will not part with their sins, though to obtain such a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit;
And there be such a number of other Comes, that calls and
carry them away, that though Christ call, Come, few follow him;
The Devil saith, Come, and they flock after him; The World saith,
Come, and they flock after it; The flesh saith, Come, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65522:120"/>
it thick and threefold, even striving who shall follow it fastest:
But if they had wit to see whether these Comes tend, they would not
be so forward; The Devil calls, Come, as the Fowler calleth the
Bird into his Net; The World calls, Come, and serves her follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did <hi>Sampson,</hi> and <hi>Jael, Sisera;</hi> The flesh calls, Come,
but all that follow it shall dye;<note place="margin">Rev. 8. 6.</note> The Harlot also hath a Come,<note place="margin">Prov. 7. 18.</note> but
her Chambers go to Death and Hell, and he that goeth in into her, is
led as an Ox to the slaughter; the like might be instanced of others:
So that Christ by his Ministers might cry, Come, but few hear and
follow: O what woful unthankfulness is this! Did Christ come
down from Heaven to us, and will not we come to him one whit?
Hath he taken so long a journey, and come to offer himself, and do
we refuse? O horrible ingratitude! Yea, what mischief is this to
our selves? Is it not to seek our own destruction? If a King should
send a gracious Pardon to a company of Traytors that had deserved
Death, and they should go on and set light by it, would he not send an
Host of armed Soldiers to destroy them? So may the Lord justly deal
with us. You are told you are undone without Christ, that he can
and will save you, if you come to him; if you will not, you cannot
but perish, and whom then will you blame? O whose heart should
not leap at such an offer, and coming in, yield himself, and say, O its
the first bargain I'le make, the best that ever I shall make! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands would be glad to hear such things as these, that do not,
nor are vouchsafed the favor? Do you think ever to have a better of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?
to make any better of your sins, then to renounce them, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Christ? O consider of this, and renounce all other Comes
which you have already followed, and at last, ere it be too late,
embrace this most blessed offer: O fall down and humble thy
self!</p>
                  <p>O but will he ever pardon and receive me,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> who have been thus and
thus?</p>
                  <p>Its no matter what thou hast been,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> not number nor greatness of sins
can let,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 18.</note> if thy heart could be truly humbled, theres the greatest doubt:
He as the true Samaritan will pour wine and oyl in thy wounds; He
is the true pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> now the water is stirred, step in, and
though thou hast been Thirty and eight years, yea Forty eight and
more sick of deadly sin, thou shalt be cured; Christ is a perfect Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,
what disease is there, that he cannot cure? The Urinals that

labor to see thy misery, understand and apply the Law, to make the

no more of these Preachers and Sermons, they put folks out of their
wits, thats the good they do: People that were honest folks, and
lived at quiet, since they have used to go after them, are grown full
of fancies: But if you come to Christ, he will take pity on you, ease,
comfort, and save you: O be perswaded, will you perish rather then
humble your selves? will you cast away your souls for love of your
lusts? We will hereafter, for we know that else there is no Salvation:

word to be the Redeemer and Savior of the World, yet they so pull
from him, and adde to him, as they leave him but a bare Name and
Title; for then is Christ the Foundation and so acknowledged, when
we acknowledge Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
Satisfaction, Life and Glory to be in him, and in him alone:
Contrarily, they attribute part of these to their own Merits, Masses,
Pardons, Satisfactions, and so they rake together a deal of Rubbish
to joyn with the Foundation, which will not be, for he is an whole
Foundation or none; of them, some few whose eyes God opens in
their end (as finding no certainty nor sure rest in any thing of their own)
do renounce themselves and all in them, and onely lean upon Christ
Jesus for Salvation, and so become happy indeed: They also hold
that <hi>Peter</hi> is the head of the Church and Foundation thereof, who
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65522:121"/>
would not wonder at their wickedness, when as <hi>Peter</hi> himself saith
it here of Christ, and attributes nothing to himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But is it not confirmed by that of our Savior,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon
this Rock I will build my Church?<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Question propounded by our Savior,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> was moved to all the
rest as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and answered of all, though by the mouth of
<hi>Peter;</hi> Christs meaning is, That on himself whom he had confessed,
he would build his Church; Would he build it on <hi>Peter?</hi> then either
on his Person or on his Faith: not on his Person; and how weak was
his Faith, which was so sore shaken by the speech of a Maid? that
could be no meat foundation to build on. 4. Those fools among our
selves, who though they acknowledge no other foundation, yet build
not upon him, but on their civil life, their bare hearing of the Word
(which yet they do, because its commanded by Law, and stands
most with their safety, and as the Papists, but for their purse, so
they would not come to Church, but for shame or punishment) their
doing as others do, &amp;c. foolish Builders that build on the sand; their
house (as every other that is not built on Christ by true Faith) how
fair soever in their own eyes, will fall on their heads; if any storm of
trouble arise for the Gospel, they will quckly yield, and change as
oft as Religion changeth; and if no such change be, yet at death they
shall drop into Hell for want of a foundation, as the five foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
were shut out of Heaven, for that they had no oyl for their
Lamps, no stock of Faith to feed or back their outward Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>They that content themselves with any thing, with any gift, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have got a true justifying Faith, will fall away, will perish,
may prove Persecutors or any thing: They that so hear the Word,
as they never give over till it hath humbled them, and brought them
to Christ, and they have found sure foundation on him, and footing,
and grace to be changed; these build upon the rock: Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not your selves with hearing the Word, nay hearing it with joy,
and reforming many things, nay that you have been troubled for your
sins (as some have wept for their sins at a Sermon, but let it go over,
and wear away, ere they came at Christ) so bearing your selves in
hand that ye are converted persons, for afterward by your falling
away, or at your death, it will prove nothing so, and all for want of
a foundation: There be even now thousands in hell, that have heard
as many Sermons as ever you heard, or ever shall.</p>
                  <p>2. That Christ is a foundation,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and the onely foundation of his
Church, is no small comfort to all that believe on him: They may
quiet themselves amidst the multitude of contrary Opinions in the
world, or temptations of Satan to make them waver; they may
answer, If Christ be not sufficient to save me, I am content to be
damned; I'le never seek other foundation, you may well enough.
Again, being built on Christ, there be many enemies will lay Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
against you to beat you off; but be of good comfort, they may
shake you indeed, but to overcome you, or pull you off the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65522:122"/>
its not possible,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>All the gates of Hell shall not prevail against you,</hi> all
their power shall not quail you. As in a City the strength is placed at
the gates, as the Port-cullis, and the Canon to keep from entrance,
so if Hell should plant all its force against a Christian, yea the poorest
Christian, it shall never be able to prevail against him, he is so sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
joyned to the foundation, by the Spirit of God that lies so fast;
Will Christ suffer his Building to be defaced, or one member, or the
least joynt to be pulled out of his body? Christ that prayed that his
Disciples might be kept,<note place="margin">Iohn 17 15.</note> prayed also for all that should believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Living]</hi> Christ is a living foundation,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> not onely because he hath
life in himself (as he is the <hi>Living Bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christ is a living foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</note> 
                     <hi>the Truth, and the Life</hi>) but
because he giveth life to others, even all that believe in him. Hence
percieve.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 16. &amp;. 5. 21. &amp; 11. 25. &amp; 17. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That Christ differs from all other foundations, he gives life to
his,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but whoso trusteth on any other, shall dye eternally.</p>
                  <p>2. An encouragement for all to come to Christ;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> He is not such a one
as can do them no pleasure, but as he can and will save them, so he will
also put life into them; that whereas before they were as dead as a
stock, to any thing concerning the glory of God, or their own good;
no Wit, Will, Memory, Affection, no Hand, Foot, Tongue, but all
were stiff and stark lame to any good, yea dead; being joyned to him,
he will make them alive,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> give them Wit, Will, and a Heart to that
which is good,<note place="margin">Eph 2. 1.</note> so a Hand, Foot and Tongue, yea so change them,
that they shall be nothing the same, but new Creatures. Hence it is,
that some that were as very wretches as could be to their lusts, that
loved a Sermon, Sabbath, or good Exercise, as a Bear doth the stake,
have yet by the preaching of the Word been brought to Christ; the
case is so altered with them, that now they loath what they loved,
love what they loathed. It is not a strange thing, to see a man that
loved money as his life, and had no savor in any good, to set as light
by it as his shoes, and to love the word that wrought this dislike in him?
So for a man that loved a pair of Cards, and Tables, and to ramble
abroad on the Lords Day, and who could not abide to take a book in
his hand, or to be in any Religious persons company, now to abandon
the one, and to be earnestly affected with the other? yet this Christ
worketh in those that be joyned to him: O come to this Christ Jesus,
humble thy self, believe in him, and give over thy self to him, and
though thou beest as bad as the worst, he will so alter thee, as thou
mayest prove a worthy Christian.</p>
                  <p>3. This serves to uncase a number of Hypocrites,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
stones of this Building, and hope to be saved by Christ, and
to be Believers, and yet have no Spiritual life in them: If you can
shew me that Spiritual life that you have got from Christ, to dye to
sin and live to righteousness, then you say something; but there be
no dead stones in this Building, but living, answerable to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:
Therefore they that remain dead in their sins and old lusts,
or any of them, Christ and they are assuredly as yet two, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65522:122"/>
not one: Shew your Christianity by renouncing all ill, and by
your love to good, Prayer, good duties in your Families, and places
where you live, and in all good Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Disallowed indeed of men,]</hi> Here's shewed how this foundation is
esteemed, both of Men and God: He first speaks of men, and that
by way of prevention.<note place="margin">The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> No marvel you speak of Christ to be such a
Foundation, might they have said, we are sure, when he came into
the world, a number cared not for him, would none of him, and
those none of the fools or simple ones, but Wise, Politick, Learned
Clerks: True, saith he; but what then? yet I have that which will
weigh it down, namely, that he is chosen of God, and precious to him,
and them that shall believe on him.</p>
                  <p>Disallowed he was indeed of men;<note place="margin">Christ disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of whom, and why.</note> They called him the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Son, a Samaritan, Wine-bibber, deceiver; They would have
no other King but <hi>Caesar,</hi> never left him while they put him to death,
with them <hi>Barabbas</hi> was meeter to live then he: What was the cause?
or how should they disallow him, when it was so plain that he was the
Christ, foretold by the Prophets, who came at the same time, in the
same place, and after the same maner, whose Life, Preaching and
Works did well declare him so to be, what might be the cause hereof?
They looked for one that should come as an earthly Prince, to deliver
them out of the hands of the <hi>Romans;</hi> but his Kingdom was not of
this World:<note place="margin">Acts 6, 14.</note> They looked also for one that should have upheld their
Customs, Law, and Traditions, but the date of them was out. (See
by the way what it is to have an old conceit setled in ones brain, O
how hardly is it removed!) Again, How came they to this height of
disallowing him? at the first of ignorance and blindeness, but after of
malice; so men grow (when they desire not to amend and see the
Truth) from one degree of wickedness to another: The Jews dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed
him, and do to this day, though the hand of God be heavily
upon them,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 25.</note> according to their own Imprecation, <hi>His blood be on us,
and our children;</hi> whose case is most fearful: So is the case of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that disallow him, whereof there be multitudes among us.
Why, nay, all we allow him? O most of Pharisees disallow him
and will perish.</p>
                  <p>Yes,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> most among Jews and Turks, but all we shall be saved, unless it be here
and there an adulterer, or horrible drunkard, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Consider that of four sorts of grounds (Professors) three are naught:<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
O most among us disallow Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 3, &amp;c.</note> while they will not come to
him, embrace him as their Savior, and renouncing all evil, take up
his yoke as their Lord; most amongst us allow a kinde of Christ, but
not a true Christ: They allow a Christ that will save them, though
they never be humbled, though they live still in their sins; but Christ
is no such, Christ will save no such: O let all such look to it, that
will not come to Christ as he hath appointed; you think the Jews,
<hi>Judas</hi> and the Soldiers have a fearful account to make, so they have;
and how shall they appear before Christ at the day of Judgement?
but even thousands in our Parishes are in no better case, that break his
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65522:123"/>
bonds, and despise the offer of his blood; Such are all Apostates that
have profest the name of Christ, and fall away, all fearful ones,
that deny him out of fear, and all that will not embrace him being
offered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Disallowed]</hi> Was not this no ill sign of Christ that he was disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
O no:<note place="margin">Such things are often disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of men, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of God.</note> Even that may be disallowed of men, which yet is
allowed, and highly accounted of of God; nay, the more Spiritual
any thing, any course, any person is, the more and the sooner will
the world disallow him and it.</p>
                  <p>For, they be carnal, therefore savor the things of the flesh, not of
the Spirit; they be in darkness, therefore care not for the light; The
more Spiritual any thing is, the higher is it out of their reach: Those
courses and persons that be carnal, the world allow well of; four
hundred false Prophets maintained at <hi>Jezabels</hi> Table,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 37.</note> good <hi>Micaiah</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> abused;<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 35.</note> of those that wandred up and down in sheep-skins
and goat-skins, the world was not worthy, yet did not the world think
them worthy to be among them,<note place="margin">Acts 4, &amp;c.</note> but thrust them among the wilde
Beasts:<note place="margin">See Luke 6. 22, 23.</note> Others also were racked as the vilest Malefactors, yea, our
Savior himself was so accounted,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 18.</note> so the Apostles, men wonder at them
as at a thief.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Hence learn</p>
                  <p>1. That we are not to esteem the worse either of our selves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
because of the worlds mislike; many be so weak, that if they see
the most, and especially any great ones, or any learned cry down a
man or an action,<note place="margin">Iohn 7. 7, 48.</note> &amp;c. they are carried away, and open their mouthes
wide against them; but if that might have gone currant, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had been naught: we must not go upon any such rule, but examine
whether they be allowed of God, or not; if they be, then are we not to
regard what the world saith; The world wil prefer <hi>Barabbas</hi> to Christ,
call evil good,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and good evil: There's no more heed to be given
thereto, then to be judged of a blinde man concerning colours. As
they that have sore eyes cannot abide the clear light and Sun-shine,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 16.</note>
so cannot the wicked abide that which is pure and Spiritual, yea,
the things that they highly allow, are abominable in the sight of
God.</p>
                  <p>2. That they which disallow that,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and those whom God alloweth,
are in a miserable condition, they cross God, and he will cross them:
The time shall come, when they shall finde by woful experience, that
he disalloweth them, when they shall be glad, and desire to be in the
number of those whom they have most despised, but to no purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye also as lively stones are built up,]</hi> Now of the rest of the building
that is reared upon this Foundation; Every Believer is a stone of this
building, a lively stone, and all together make up a spiritual House for
the Lord to delight in, as many stones go to the making up of a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
House.</p>
                  <p>Now in that Christ is compared to the Foundation,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> and believers to
stones built on him,<note place="margin">There's a near Vnion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and Believers.</note> it sheweth the near conjunction that is between
Christ and them; as stones are joyned to the Foundation by morter, so
are believers to Christ by the Spirit: Accordingly he is compared to a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65522:123"/>
head,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 22, 23.</note> and the Church to the body; he to the Vine, and the Church to the
Branches:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 15.</note> Such an Union is between Christ and Believers, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the husband and the wife,<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note> no more twain,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30.</note> but one <hi>bone of his bone,
and flesh of his flesh:</hi> Before a man have Faith, he is as a dead stick or
stone, by Faith he is united to Christ; which is signified by these
and the like speeches,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 51.</note> eating Christs flesh, and drinking his blood,
which is to believe in him, shewing that as the meat we eat is turned
into our substance,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 3.</note> and nearly joyned to us, so are we to Christ by
believing in him: and this is a real and true Union, but a Spiritual
one, not that we are thereby united to Christs soul, but to his body
also, and by his humanity to his Deity, and by both to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the holy Ghost, which is an admirable prerogative: If
any say, How can this be, Christ being in Heaven and we on Earth?
It is so by the Spirit on Gods part, and Faith on ours; Those joyn
things far distant in place most nearly together. If any say, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see nor comprehend how this should be;<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 32.</note> If we cannot, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
for its a great mystery which we are to believe and adore in our
hearts. The benefits hereof are unspeakable (as the honor most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious)
for by vertue hereof, we that were as dead as blocks and stones,
draw spiritual life and Grace to become new Creatures, to dye to
sin, and to lead a righteous life; as the members receive sence and
motion from the head, and the Vine-branches sap from the root:
Hereby also we have title to Christ and all his good things; He also
bears our troubles with us, and hereby our souls shall be as filled with
Grace here, so taken up to glory with him at death, and the body
remains united to Christ even in the grave; by vertue whereof it shall
be raised up a spiritual and glorious body to be glorified for ever:
And this is yet so much the more absolute and blessed a Union, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
its indissolveable; No violence of Satan, nor any other Enemy
can break off the same:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 38.</note> He hath not therefore fastened us as stones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

(saith the Appostle) <hi>they should have continued with us:</hi> What God hath

                  <p>1. This is for instruction to all that are believers,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and so members
of this body, stones of this building, that they walk in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
answerable to such high Dignity, to such an Union: The Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
must be like the Head, the stones answerable to the Foundation,
as the Fruit to the true Vine: Take heed they disgrace not themselves
and their stock by bringing forth sowre fruit, even of the wilde Olive,
of their own sinful and corrupt nature, but mortifie the same more
and more.</p>
                  <p>But how cometh it to pass that they which are graft into Christ should bear
any sowre Fruit?<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>

nature shut out,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> and have through heedlesness and want of care
grown apace, and which we must pluck off by any means.</p>
                  <p>2. Comfort to all believers;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> O admirable priviledge to be joyned
into one with Christ, and with God! What grace or good thing can he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65522:124"/>
stand in need of, that is joyned to such a plentiful and living head?
He cannot but mortifie the strongest Corruptions, overcome the
greatest Temptations, perform the most difficult Duties; Such thou
mayest draw from thy head, but make no obstructions by sin: Keep
open the passages, and by the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and other
like means, fetch Grace from Christ Jesus: He also will strengthen
thee, and even in the fiery Fornace be present with thee, and after
take thee up to glory; neither shall all the power of Hell ever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
thee from him: for though Hypocrites that hang on onely by
the untemperated morter of outward Profession shall fall off, thou
that art saudered into Christ by the Spirit of God shalt never be

                  <p>3. To discard all those that profess themselves believers,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and stones
of this building, and yet have no life in them; let such know, they
have no part in Christ, nor fellowship with him.</p>

hew and square us, that thereby we may be humbled, and mortifie
all our sins and lusts; for if there be but one sin in us unrepented of,
we are not fit to lie in this building: And though all stones be not alike,
some bigger, some less, some more costly, some less; yet happy
we, if we be any true stone of this building; let us now suffer our
selves to be fashioned for it,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it must be now in this Life, or never. As
there was no hammer heard about the Temple, but all was hewen in
<hi>Libanus,</hi> so must we be hewen in this Life, that we may rest in the
Spiritual Temple for ever: Having a house to build, will we lay in a
stone rough, as it comes from the Quarry, or a piece of Timber as
it comes from the Wood?<note place="margin">See 5. H. on Mat. 3. 10 pag. 6.</note> much less will the Lord suffer any to be
joyned into his Spiritual building, till they be squared and hewen by
his Word: Therefore lets be tenderly affected one towards another,
and build up one another, and do all the good we can one to another,
not living to our selves, or having hand in Contentions, Rents,
Divisions, which do so abound among Christians, and that for
toyes.</p>

have, being received of Christ, and united to him, namely, That
whereas they were unholy, now he makes them holy; whereas they
might not come near God, neither their persons nor works, now
they are advanced to this dignity, to be a Priesthood, and every of
them an holy Priest to draw near unto God, and offer him Sacrifices;
whereas before they did nor could do nothing but was abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

great priviledges? and all this comes by the means of Jesus Christ,

                  </p>
                  <p>What,<note place="margin">Object.</note> are not Priests and Sacrifices at an end yet? I thought they had
been onely in the Old Testament, and now abolished.</p>
                  <p>True,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> some Sacrifices are at an end: There were under the Law
Priests ordained to offer Sacrifices daily to God, for their own and
the peoples sins, all which pointed at Christ the true Priest, and that
blessed Sacrifice of his Body:<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 27. &amp; 10. 2, 10, 11, 12, 18. &amp; 12. 25, 26.</note> All these Sacrifices did but tend and
direct to that All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sufficient Sacrifice of his Death. Now when he
had offered himself on the Cross, and dyed for our sins, he put an end
to all Sacrifices propitiatory,<note place="margin">Iohn 19. 30.</note> as who finished all himself, saying, <hi>It is
finished;</hi> so then, there is now no more need of Sacrifices for sin,
Christ once offered being All-sufficient. Which</p>
                  <p>1. Condemns the Sacrifices of the Jews,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and all bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which are to the Devils and not to God.</p>
                  <p>2. Condemns the Blasphemous Sacrifice of the Mass,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> where (as
the Papists say) Christ is by the Priest offered daily on the Altar a
propitiatory Sacrifice for the sins of the quick and the dead: This is
to overthrow Christs Cross.</p>
                  <p>But though there be an end of all legal Sacrifices and Propitiatory,
yet there are Evangelical and Gratulatory; and though those Priests
that offered blood and beasts be at an end, yet are there Priests still
remaining in the Church of God, which the Apostle mentioneth, lest
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65522:125"/>
the Jews should think the former times better then these; thereupon
objecting,<note place="margin">The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> Have we no Sacrifices now to offer to God? he answereth,
We have, though not of the same kinde: We have no Propitiatory
Sacrifices (the date of them being out, and which yet were not taken
away by men, but by him who ordained them but till this time, who
yet is not inconstant in changing them,<note place="margin">Christians now are not without Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which they must offer up to God.</note> as having done away sin
through the Sacrifice of his Son, of whom the others were onely the
types and shadows) but Sacrifices of thanksgiving we have, and that
for the mercy of God in Christ, and all other blessings flowing from
thence: This is no small honor and priviledge. It was an honor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law to be Priests, few were admitted to the Office; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
Christ, they went near and offered Sacrifice, the people
standing afar off; so is it now to be a Spiritual Priest, to have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to come near to God with comfort and boldness.</p>
                  <p>1. They therefore speak they know not what,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that use this as a
name of disgrace, and call Ministers in derision, Priests; and what
is he but a Priest? but its an honor, and a great one, though Mass-Priests
by their filthy lives have brought the same in disgrace; yet is
not this proper to Ministers onely (which we speak not as though we
were ashamed of it,<note place="margin">Re. 1. 6</note> but that every one may have their due) its also
common to all Believers, and they that will none of this, shake off the
name of a Christian, but they that are wise will take their part in it.
This is signified by the name Christian of Christ, which signifieth
anointed; of that anointing by the Spirit without measure, he was
made and fitted our King, Priest and Prophet, and not so onely, but
to make us so; so that every one that believeth in him, he gives him
the honor to be so: As we partake of the benefit of his Priesthood,
and its parts, Satisfaction and Intercession, so of him we also are
made Priests.</p>
                  <p>2. As we are to rejoyce in this priviledge,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> so we must use it, and
improve it carefully in offering Sacrifices; What else becomes a
Priest? he were not worthy the name, that did not delight to offer
Sacrifices to God.<note place="margin">The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Sacrifices.</note> Now the Sacrifices of the New Testament for
Christians to offer, are these, 1. The offering up of our Bodies and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Souls,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> and all that is in us to serve God, having neither Wit, Will,
Memory, nor any thing else, but for the Lords use: Its meet we
should offer this Sacrifice, for its his by right of Creation, Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
and continual Preservation; we owe neither it, nor any part of
it, to any other, all to him, and when we give it to him, we provide
best for it: Its not onely never the further from our selves, but that
is the happiness of it, we should give it, and thank him he will take
it of us; and this is the first Sacrifice to be offered: Till this be, no
other will be accepted of,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 5.</note> Prayer, Praise, or whatsoever; first the
person must please God, then the work, as in <hi>Abel:</hi> And thus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man may try his Cristianity; Do you give up your bodies and souls
for his Service, and would not with your good wills that any the
least part should be withdrawn from him, no not one thought if you
could help it? thou art a good Christian, this is a good Sacrifice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65522:126"/>
it still; But how few do thus? how few which give not their
Hearts and Bodies to Profits and Pleasures, to Sin, the World, and
the Devil? How many Sacrifice to these all day long? Christians in
name, not in deed: They that give themselves wholly to sin are mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as they that give themselves partly to God, and partly to their
lusts, are like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira:</hi> Oh, but though we do not thus,
yet we offer other Sacrifices:<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 13.</note> Fie upon thee and them, they are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in Gods sight, as is the Sacrifice of the wicked: O give
them no more as weapons of sin, to serve the Flesh, the World, and
the Devil (that were too too base) but employ them for Gods service,
not some part, but the whole, all too little, and wish it were better
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for his sake. 2. The Sacrifice of a contrite and broken heart, that is, an
heart grieved and crush'd for sin past,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 17.</note> comforted in Christ, afraid to
offend, careful to please God, touch'd and grieved at the smallest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note>
They that offer this,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 14.</note> scape Gods Judgement; fearing alway,
they are happy; fearing small sins, they escape great ones; being
troubled at the least, they rise, and fall not into security: Such as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this, and would it were softer, grieving and complaining of their
hardness of heart, let such know, that there may be hardness as they
complain, but not such hardness as they conceive, as who could not
feel the same: But there are few broken hearts in any measure, most
are not troubled for their sins past, nor afraid to offend, nor careful
nor humbled after they have offended, being neither melted by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
nor moved by the Word and Afflictions: O the fearful state of
an hard heart; all have not alike tender heart, but assuredly he is no
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Christian that hath it not in some measure. 3. Prayer and Praise for
Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Psal. 141. 2.</note> and all benefits by him past,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 15.</note> present and to come, for
Soul and Body: O what a favor is it, that we worms on earth may
come to the glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth? but where are our
morning and evening Sacrifices? What, a Priest without a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?<note place="margin">Psal. 14 2.</note>
They that pray not at all,<note place="margin">Iob 27. 9.</note> its a sign they are prophane persons,
as they that pray onely in misery are hypocrites: Hath God honored
us to make us Priests by Jesus Christ, and do we neglect the Office,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> not appearing with our Sacrifice?<note place="margin">Heb. 16. 13.</note> 4. Alms, mercy to all in hunger,
thirst,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 22.</note> sickness, prison, <hi>especially to the houshold of Faith:</hi> This we
ought to do; whensoever God prepares an Altar of the necessity of
a poor Saint or Church,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 40.</note> that then we Priests lay on our Sacrifice:
God requires it, its an honor, he counts it as done unto himself; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he promises that he will requite it, and that not as we, a peny for
a penyworth, but as Kings that use to reward a house largely, where
they have found kindeness;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> therefore its compared to sowing: God
and his poor Saints are the best ground can be sown in: O that we had
Faith enough in this Point! If we did believe that we should have
peny for peny, it would make us forwarder then we be, but he
will do more: The world savoreth not this at all, and Believers fall
too short in this Sacrifice; but the more we offer it, and the better,
the better Christians are we.<note place="margin">Why called Spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Acceptable to God,]</hi> It being a great favor to do any thing that may
please God,<note place="margin">The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> they might object, as any weak Christian would; Alas,
I would go and offer these Sacrifices, but doth the Lord regard what
I do? will he once look to such a one, or such service as mine? Yea,
saith the Apostle, we may offer up Spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to
God: Gods Servants shall not then need doubt, but being once Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
their services done Spiritually are accepted of the most High
God of Heaven, yea, of the meanest true Believer; for he that vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to bring thee to Christ, to unite thee to him, to make thee a
lively stone, a Spiritual house, an holy Priest to offer Sacrifice, he
will also accept of the same: Let this encourage us much to these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
what a spur is this? True it is, if one knew he should not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
or if he did doubt whether he should or not; this would take
off all edge; but when we are sure, thats a great encouragement:
For who would not be glad to do any thing, wherewith God would
be pleased? Art thou afraid that he doth not accept thy Sacrifice, as
who hast prayed oft and long, and art not heard? Judge not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that;<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 23.</note> Thy Prayer sent up in truth, was accepted at first, though
not granted by and by, as not being then time; The Lord stays till a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Acceptable,]</hi> Not that God hath any need of them, but it pleaseth
him for our encouragement so to tell us; for if we serve him never so
diligently, he is never the better, but our selves are the better, and our
Neighbors by our good example;<note place="margin">Iob 22. 2, 3. and 35. 6.</note> So contrarily if we do never so ill,
he is not the worse,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 2.</note> as being most perfectly holy and good at first,
and so is and will be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To God,]</hi> Here may seem a secret Antithesis between these words,
<hi>To God;</hi> and these, <hi>To Men:</hi> For indeed</p>
                  <p>Spiritual Sacrifices are nothing to Carnal men,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> but such only as stand
in outward Pomp,<note place="margin">Spiritual sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are not regarded of carnal men.</note> Shew, and Ceremony; But its the Spiritual service
that pleaseth God: He cares more for a broken heart, and for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of praise Spiritually performed, then for Thousands of Bulls,
or all the outside that so much pleaseth the eye: He cares not for the
Papists going on Pilgrimage, numbers of Prayers, Fasting days, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65522:127"/>
service, and curious musick, which doth more delight the ear, then
tend any way to edification; And because we reject these, they cry out
upon us, as having no Religion: And are there not some among us,
with whom its a foul matter to neglect any outward Ceremony, who
yet do altogether neglect Spiritual services?</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and in this worthiness must we offer up our selves, Prayers, Thanks,

                  <p>1. This condemneth them that do these Duties,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and yet are in their

which do them not by the Spirit of God, but by their own might;
Their services are abominable.</p>

which pray for this or that Saints sake, do grievously sin: Oh, but
say they, he is indeed the Mediator of Redemption, others may with
him be Mediators of Intercession: He is belike beholden to them
that will leave him somewhat; but there is no other Intercessor, but
the Redeemer,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 2.</note> he thats the one, is the other also: Oh, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all their Prayers, <hi>per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum.</hi> A good
mends, when they have robb'd him, by joyning others with him,
to conclude with his Name; So those that come in their own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,

Jesus Christ to all that perform them in Faith, and to their uttermost
they are accepted as perfect.</p>
                  <p>1. This serves as to humble us while we live under the daily sence
of the imperfections of our services; So, to warn us to shrowd them

them to their mindes; They must not be dismaid, but believe that
for Christs sake they shall be accepted: This is necessary to be known
and believed, because many a good soul, when they have pray'd or
done any service in the best maner they can, are yet discouraged:
Why? nothing pleaseth God but that which is perfect, and I know
(will such a one say) how imperfect my poor service is, I cannot in any
sort pray as I would, I cannot continue a short Prayer without wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
&amp;c. Well, what thou dost, do in truth, and with all thy
might; and Christs perfect obedience shall make it up; Though thy
service be short, yet it is large enough to cover all; wer't not for this,
we might be dismaid at our best duties: But this is not for the wicked
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65522:127"/>
and unbelievers, they think they will do as well as they can, and there's
an end, Christ shall do the rest: But what right hast thou to Christ?

At the day of Judgement he shall not be ashamed, but lift up his
head with great joy, when he shall see Christ coming in great glory
and power, to save all them that have embraced him, and to receive
them into the glory which he hath prepared for them; then shall he
be our Judge who hath been our Surety and Savior: Contrarily, they

the wisest of them) distracted,<note place="margin">The miserable condition of those that do not believe in Christ, and who they are.</note> and cannot tell when they have done
enough to rest in, and so are ever suspitious and doubtful, tost to and

not in Christ (though some securely flatter themselves) are for
the most part doubtful, having ever and anon thoughts that all is not
well, and so not knowing what shall become of them; and though
they love their lusts so well, that they will not part from them for
Christ, yet often do their thoughts accuse them of their Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Deceits, wicked Courses, their hearts misgive them; and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
their lives be as if one should lie in a bed too strait, and the
clothes too short, and so they cannot sleep; whereas he that is assured
of his happiness, and his heart witnesses his upright care to obey Gods
will, his bed and clothes be large enough, he sleeps quietly, and rests on
a soft pillow, his good conscience: In the hour of death they are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; disquieted, and in death they are confounded, when they see the
Devil ready to carry their souls to hell. At the day of Judgement, how
will the Jews and Turks that altogether reject Christ, be ashamed
and confounded, when they shall finde that their imagined Christ, and
<hi>Mahomet</hi> hath deceived them, and led them into a false hope? O
what a case will they be in, when they shall see the true Christ whom
they have rejected come to judge them? O what wailing will there
be? how will they run up and down, and what would they not do,
if they knew any way to help themselves? then shall they finde it
too late to sue to him:<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 16.</note> Then will they sue to the hills to fall upon

that have had him offered to them, but have not embraced him, nor
believed in him, chusing rather to continue in their lusts, then to
have their part in him, their condition is fearful: O that all would

                  <p>NOw that which the Apostle had cited out of the Prophet, and
was indefinitely spoken of all and every one, he comes to apply
particularly to the Jews that he wrote unto, both believers and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
shewing the happy state of the one, and the miserable condition
of the other, one and the same Christ being to them diverse: To Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
precious, and fruitful to Salvation and all good; but to the
unbelievers and disobedient, a stone to stumble at, &amp;c. though not
of his own Nature, yet through their infidelity, so that they should
not onely have no benefit by him, but destruction, stumbling at the
word that foretold of him, and now testified of him. But least any
should wonder at this madness in men, the cause is set down, that as
God ordained some to life, and so to embrace Christ unto Salvation,
so some others to stumble against him to their ruine: Besides this, he
also removes a common and great scandal and log out of the weak
and common peoples way, and that was, that whereas he had spoken
so much of Christ, they could not see him to be such a one: and their
learned Doctors and Rabbies, Scribes and Pharisees, High Priests
and Elders, they could no way think well of him, they judged him
a deceiver, and pursued him also, which they would never have done,
if he had been the Savior and corner stone, as you speak, &amp;c. But for
this, faith the Apostle, If it were a new thing, that you never had had
warning of, it were somewhat; but this is no other then was foretold
in <hi>Davids</hi> time,<note place="margin">Psalm 118. 22.</note> so long ago, therefore it needs not seem strange to you;
yet their strugling was in vain, for in despite of them he was made the
head stone of the corner: This had been indeed a great temptation, if
they had been to consult onely with reason; For what should they
have thought, but as they were taught and learned of their gave
Teachers, of whom that People had a very great and high opinion;
But considering Gods decree, and that he had foretold it should be
thus, and that God would save his Church by such a way that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wise men thought not of, and would effect his purpose not
onely without the help, but even against the will of the great men of
the world, it could not much trouble them.</p>
                  <p>And in that the Apostle doth apply that which was indifinitely

which is to Salvation, signified by eating and drinking: and Faith is
compared to an hand; and in our Creed every one of us is particularly
bound from our hearts, to say, <hi>I believe.</hi>

And though there will arise, through remnants of unbelief, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doubtings and fears, yet this grace of Faith rooted in the heart,
will never quite fail;<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 1.</note> as, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for saken me?</hi>
The last words savor of distrust or dispair, but yet so, as Faith still
held her hold: So is it with every Believer in their temptations;
though they speak some words of doubting, yet some do come out by
and by, that do argue a measure of true Faith: O lets never leave till
we have a particular perswasion, and that upon good ground, that
the promises of salvation especially (and other particulars) belong
to us; some think they do, and are very bold, that yet can render no
reason thereof, but their perswasion is vain: some being put to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
can say nothing thereto, and so can never have comfort
or joy while they live.</p>

is most blessed and good in himself, but that that which is in him is
to be communicated to others, or else what were it to us? nay, he
sheweth also by what means others may be partakers hereof, namely,
by Faith; For what were it, though there were never so much in
Christ, and that for others too, if we knew not the way to come by
it? therefore he tells us, its made ours by Faith: As, what were it
if there were never so much water in a Well, and no bucket to draw
it out? or a very good Medicine, and no knowledge how to use it?</p>

he shall not have a dram of benefit by him; Therefore Faith
is compared to an hand to lay hold on Christ, to a mouth to feed on
Christ, &amp;c. As a mans hand chopt off can take nothing, his mouth
closed up can eat nothing, so without Faith, no benefit by Christ;
for Faith is the onely instrument that God hath ordained to convey all

and makes him ours, without which he will be a rock of offence to
our condemnation: This Faith is not every idle perswasion of the
brain of a carnal professor without ground, and never humbled, or
any whit reformed, but it must be a work of the Spirit of God,
which hath so much depending upon it, which few truly enjoy: And
the rather are we to labor for this grace, because as it makes Christ
ours, so all things else to work to our good, without which all turn
to our destruction.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> As the Word by Faith is the power of God
to Salvation, and the savor of life unto life; so is it to unbelievers
the contrary, even to their Condemnation; as the sun-shine to good
eyes is comfortable, but to weak and blear eyes offensive and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
Thus are all other holy things; Thus the Sacrament; Thus also
our meat and drink, &amp;c. To believers that are not onely perswaded
by the Word, that they are Gods creatures appointed to nourish us,
but that we be such as having lost our interest in <hi>Adam,</hi> have it restored
in Christ; we using them also with prayer, may with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
make use of them, whereof those that have not this Faith are
usurpers: Yea, that which is a part of the curse in its own nature, yet
by Faith is made a blessing; as our sicknesses, crosses and troubles
which came in with sin as punishments,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> yet to believers, them that
love God, all things (even these) work together for the best; but to
unbelievers they are the beginning of their sorrows. And</p>
                  <p>As Christ in our sense is precious to the Believers, namely, that
they make most precious and high account of him, and so of the
means that have brought them to him, the Word, and the means
that yet still bring them tidings of him, the Word and Sacraments;
so also in this, that he is fruitful and blessed to them: Therefore never
leave till we be in the number of these believers.</p>

                     <hi>But unto them which be disobedient, &amp;c.]</hi> now to the other sort: The true
and direct opposition had been to have said, But to the unbelievers;
Why then not so, but to the disobedient? namely, to shew who they
be that be unbelievers,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> by the effect, disobedience: For as Faith is
the mother of obedience,<note place="margin">Such are unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers which are disobedient</note> so Infidelity the mother of disobedience
and rebellion: Unbelief hath the seat in the heart, who then can
know it? the Lord who seeth it, sheweth that they which be diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to the Word be unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>Hereby may every man try himself,<note place="margin">Use.</note> whether he be in the state of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
or not; Thou art, if thou beest in the state of disobedience.
Thus are they that live in the open breach of Gods Law, and are taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with foul sins;<note place="margin">See also Iohn 3. 36.</note> they are in unbelief to this hour, whom (if they
should thus dye) this Scripture would send headlong to destruction:
Thus are they, who though they reform some, yea many things, yet
maintain themselves in the love and practice of some one sin, either
by doing some forbidden evil, or neglecting some known required
duty, which they will not reform, nor desire to do: Let these know
(whatsoever they are) that they are in unbelief until this hour, and so
stand in the state of wrath and condemnation: O that this might

                  <p>
                     <hi>The stone which the builders disallowed, is made the head of the corner.]</hi>
This Text alleaged out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 118. 22.</note> is meant 1. Of <hi>David,</hi> who
by <hi>Sauls</hi> Courtiers was rejected, whom they would not have had
King, yet God had so appointed, and would have it so. 2. Of our
Savior Christ, whom the great learned men of his time did reject,
and would not embrace as the Savior of the world: Where Christs
Kingdom is compared to an house, and Christ to the foundation
thereof, or corner stone, and the learned men of Christs time to
builders, who should have built the Church of God (by their place)
but they rejected the best part and foundation of this building: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were like to make a bad building.</p>
                  <p>These indeed were Christs chief Enemies, and could not away
with him, persecuted him, prefer'd <hi>Barabbas</hi> before him, crucified
him, forbade his Disciples to preach in his name, yea imprisoned and
scourged them for so doing.</p>
                  <p>How came this to pass? They had a strong conceit that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah
should be an earthly Potentate,<note place="margin">Acts 6. 14.</note> and that he should continue <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
his Law and Ordinances: When therefore they saw the contrary,
they would none of him; but for all they were so expert in the Law,
yet they fulfilled it to their own destruction, in rejecting him that was
the fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets. See what a strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and prejudicate opinion will do.</p>
                  <p>Now their rejecting of him was,<note place="margin">Why the Iews did reject Christ.</note> 1. To shew that God had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Salvation of his Church and building of his kingdom by a
way that the wise men of the world never dreamed of. 2. That their
malice might appear to their punishment, and Gods power in resisting
them. 3. To shew, that great men are not always the greatest main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of the Truth, but miss the cushion oftentimes; they be not
always friends and furtherers of the Truth, but often great lets and
arch enemies thereunto: Thus it hath been for the manifestation of
Gods power, who can do his will not onely without the help, but
against the might of great persons.<note place="margin">Ier. 20. 1.</note> Thus was it in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time;
Thus in <hi>Jeremiahs;</hi> Thus in our Saviors: They that should
have been the first and chiefest entertainers of him, preaching to the
people,<note place="margin">Iohn 7. &amp; 9.</note> hated him, excommunicated him, and persecuted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for believing in him; so hath it been of long time, and is at this
day with the chief of <hi>Rome:</hi> Oh, they boast themselves to be the
onely Church, and all that vary from them to be Hereticks, and that
they have all the marks of a true Church, Unity, Universality, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
with a perpetual succession of Bishops from <hi>Peter;</hi> when
yet they are the Enemies of the true Church of God, and have still
so been; a pack of erroneous and pestilent Doctrines they hold, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65522:131"/>
to Christs Truth, whose Church they persecute with fire and
sword: The Church never found greater Enemies, nor any so great,
as they that profess themselves to be the Church of Christ. For
their succession which they boast of from the Apostles, its very idle,
and makes no more for them, then that <hi>Ahab</hi> was right owner of
<hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, because he came into the possession of it; or that
a Thief having kill'd the master of the house,<note place="margin">Succession is of Doctrine or Person.</note> sits down at Table in
his chair, and eats of his meat. Succession is of Doctrine or Person:
Succession of Doctrine is good; Therefore that company that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
in the Doctrine of the Apostles, and Fundamental Points
thereof (though some errors should be mingled) and hath the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
pure for the substance, that company is a church of God, though
there be defects in maners, for so Christ said of them that sate in
<hi>Moses</hi> chair; for though both Doctrine and maners be necessary in a
good Pastor, yet if he hold the Fundamental Points of Doctrine
(though he erre in life and maners) we reject him not from being a
Pastor. But as for succession of Person and Place, its nothing: For
Place; Where hath God ever in the New Testament, tyed himself or
his Church to any particular place? or doth he not call it Universal,
as being in the parts of it spread into all places?<note place="margin">Acts 20. 29.</note> For Person; as
though Thieves may not succeed good men, and Wolves faithful
Pastors: Therefore, though they could prove that there hath been
ever since <hi>Peter</hi> a continual succession of Bishops in <hi>Rome,</hi> yet this
would do them small pleasure; but this their Personal succession they
cannot prove, they agree not among themselves who was first after <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Again, it was broken off sundry times, when some of their Popes
were condemned for Heresie, when there were many Antipopes, and
in the days of Pope <hi>Joan;</hi> unless they will say that these were true
successors of the Apostles: But say they could prove this, yet what
would it avail them, seeing they are altogether degenerate from the
purity of the Apostles doctrine, and are become enemies and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the same? They have overthrown the foundation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all the Fundamental Points of Religion, and left nothing sound,
brought in errors, and laden the Church with an infinite rabble of
idle and most frivolous Ceremonies; by their Doctrine overturning
almost every Article of the Faith, and thereby violating every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the Law: and for the Sacraments, they have altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abolished one, and turned it into a Sacrifice and blasphemous
Idol; and the other they have so besmeared with their filthy inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that its nothing like it self. Not at all to speak of their filthy
maners, that besides all other sins, are wholly sold to blood and
murther, as being not from above, but from the Devil, <hi>Who is a
murtherer from the beginning;</hi> we therefore conclude, that they are
none of the Church of God, but a Synagogue of Satan: They be
the rightful successors of the Apostles, that being rightly called, do
build upon their foundation, teaching the purity of Doctrine, and
administring the Sacraments for substance sincerely, whether they
have had long succession, or have but lately come to their places.

Thus we see, that they which boast themselves to be the Converters
of the world, the onely Church, are the deadliest enemies thereto;
they which would challenge to themselves to be the great Fathers and
Builders of the Church, have not onely not built themselves, but
(as the Scribes and Pharisees,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 13.</note> that kept back the key of knowledge)
have been the greatest lets to the building; whose case is the more
fearful, seeing they both may and ought, and profess to do great
matters, yet are so far from doing, that they altogether hinder.</p>
                  <p>1. This serves to teach us,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> not to stand upon great mens opinion,
or hang upon their mouth, approving and disallowing upon their
testimony or example: We must herein look onely to the Word of
God; yet the common saying is, Do you think that such great or
learned men would say or do so and so, if it were not good and
right?</p>
                  <p>2. To magnifie the power and wisdom of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that hath used to
build his Kingdom, and uphold it, not onely without the help, but

                  <p>
                     <hi>Builders]</hi> They would be so called, so reputed; But what did
they build? Errors, their own Traditions, and humane Ceremonies,
for which they were very zealous, being enemies to the true Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Builders: They are so called, not because they were so, but
because they should have been so, their place and office did so require:
These should have taught the Law, and offered Sacrifice in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of Christ till his coming; and being revealed, they should have
preached him the Foundation, and built up the Church on him: But
they did quite contrary. Hence note,</p>
                  <p>1. That none will take so great names to themselves,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> as those car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
minded men who do least good of all,<note place="margin">Such as do least good, challenge to themselves the goodliest titles</note> nay rather do hurt: Yet will
these ever challenge most to themselves; as the Popish Priests, I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
you, ascribe more to themselves, then the most faithful Pastors;
and so do a number of lazy Ministers at this day.</p>
                  <p>2. That such have been ever greatest enemies to faithful Builders,<note place="margin">Obser.</note>
which have challenged to themselves the name of Builders,<note place="margin">Such as would be reputed Builders, are usually great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enemies to true Builders.</note> being
indeed nothing less: The Churches enemies are often in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som;
and godly Ministers (as <hi>Micaiah, Jeremiah,</hi> the Apostles)
have lightly no greater enemies, then those of their own coat and
calling; so the Popish rabble hate all good Protestant, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
godly and painful Preachers:<note place="margin">Ezra. 4. 2.</note> The Jews had no greater enemies
then they that seemed desirous to help them in building.</p>
                  <p>3. That its the duty of Gods Ministers to be Builders of Gods
Church;<note place="margin">Observ.</note> so they are stiled,<note place="margin">Ministers must be Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> they are also called Laborers and
Workers.</p>
                  <p>We must build by all means,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 10.</note> with both hands, Doctrine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 1.</note>
All must be done to Edification, and not to Destruction
in the Church; all must be done for, nothing against the truth: We
must build by preaching Christ the Foundation, and build thereon
not Wood, Hay, Stubble (false Doctrine) but Gold, Silver, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones, answerable to the nobleness of the Foundation.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65522:132"/>

                  <p>1. This rebukes those that build with neither hand,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 1.</note>
like the foolish woman in the <hi>Proverbs:</hi> Thus the Papists, who
be woful Builders: They overturn sound Doctrine, and build trash
of their own devising; as if one would come to an house to build,
and would put up the groundsels, and rear up a house of leaves, sticks
and boughs, so do they Toys and Ceremonies: So also those that
would build with one hand, live honestly, but Preach not: These be
willing guides, but know not a step of the way: A man cannot be
an honest man in that calling, that is not an honest Preacher; His
goodness must appear in his particular calling:<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Doun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and duty of Ministers, <hi>pag.</hi> 97.</note> A Minister ought not
only to be a Sheep in the Fold, but a Pastor of the Flock; not only
a stone in the Building, but a Builder: So those that build by Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

yet pull down; The curse will light on such: No Minister can do
this as he ought, Who is sufficient for these things? O lets labor to

O happy is he that layeth but one stone into the building, and holds in

about mens bodies or goods, we about their souls; others build houses
for men (what though for Kings?) we a Spiritual house for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
who would not be encouraged hereby, against whatsoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
this world (theirs especially which should most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
us) gives us?</p>
                  <p>3. We must pray to God to furnish and send out many wise and
able Builders into his Church,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that may be workmen that need not
be ashamed, that may lay the Foundation well, and build an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
thereupon;<note place="margin">See Mat. 9. 38.</note> The Lord send such into his Church.</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> though Ministers be chiefly Builders of the Church, yet we
are to know,<note place="margin">Every man must be a Builder.</note> that every man also must be a Builder, and help the
work forward, both of himself, by working the things that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
delivered on himself in private,<note place="margin">Iude, verse 20.</note> and by other private means;
as also one of another,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> by Admonition,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 18.</note> Exhortation, Consolation,

only, but to help to save as many as possibly we can: Every man must
put his hand about this work: Being converted, we are to help forward
the conversion of others: As formerly we drew others to vanity, so
must we now draw them to grace.</p>
                  <p>But alas, great is the Impiety, and carelesness of the times this
way.</p>
                  <p>Impiety;<note place="margin">The Impiety of these times.</note> How few seek to build up, but rather to destroy by their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65522:133"/>
vile example, yea, by reproaches, discouragements, and logs laid in
the way of any that would come forward, and desire to do better
then they have done? O how few helpers do Gods poor servants
finde? There's none so simple, but hath somewhat whereby to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and hinder them; yea oftentimes even Husbands and Wives
prove lets and discouragements to each other: O these wicked scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
from Christ, <hi>That will neither enter into the Kingdom of Heaven
themselves</hi> (nor serve God) <hi>nor suffer them that would:</hi> If they that win
men to God shall shine in Heaven, what shall become of the enemies
of Christs Kingdom, which do daily turn men from God? he will
be fearfully revenged on them; These be like Devils, that turn'd our
first Parents out of the way. Herein I may yet go more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
thus, 1. By example they destroy altogether. 2. For admonition
for any thing amiss, they are rather content thereat, and if men did
otherwise, these would not like it so well: If any of Gods servants do
amiss, their admonition is, to blaze it abroad in hatred of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and profession. 3. For consolation, if any be afflicted, they
can say little to it, but I pray be of good comfort, nay haply utter
much idle talk: If any be humbled for sin, either they give it out
that they are mad, and that through running to Sermons; or at the
furthest, bid them be merry, put away melancholly thoughts, ride
abroad to their Friends, Drink, Play, &amp;c. Miserable comforters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indeed.
4. For Exhortation to them that be going on well, they do
quite contrary; though they loved them never so well before, now
they hate, revile, and discourage them all they can.</p>
                  <p>Yea the carelesness even of those that profess Religion,<note place="margin">The careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these times.</note> is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented:
Its a very lamentable thing to see how every one casts off the
care of others, as though it concern'd them not who admonisheth,
comforteth, exhorteth, &amp;c. And for example, is it not grievous
that some that make great profession of Religion, yet walk so loosly,
or have so foul things fall from them, as that in stead of edifying, the
godly are wounded, the weak daunted, the wicked hardened in their
courses against goodness, nay occasioned to speak ill of the Gospel
and Profession, and professors thereof? Such have lived to an ill pass, it
had been better they had been taken away at the best, if ever there were
any soundness in them: These had need not onely to repent between
God and their own Souls heartily, but labor ro recover by all wise,
godly and most holy carriage of themselves, that which they have
lost,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Else it were better a milstone were hanged about their necks, and they
thrown into the bottom of the sea:</hi> O what evil examples are some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
for promise breaking, ill payment of their debts and work-folks;
as others for extream covetousness, hastiness, and the like?
Christians are as a City set on an hill, and have many eyes set on
them (the Canaanite also and the Perizzite dwelling in the Land) and
therefore must take heed and be watchful over themselves:<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 7.</note> Oh, God
hath done great things for them, therefore they ought to shine as
lights in the places where they live, to gain men to God; If they
will not, we have openly discharged the Gospel and our selves of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65522:133"/>
their sin, and testifie that they never learned so in the Word of
God: The Gospel is good, let them be what they will, and we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defend nor like them.</p>

                     <hi>Is made the head of the corner]</hi> namely, The Foundation of his
Church, or the Head, that is, the principal part of the same, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
Satans rage, and his instruments rejecting of him; these
great Rabbies and Doctors would none of him, yet he was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his Church for all that, he had still the place that God
appointed him to, though these great men rejected him, and cast
him off. So</p>
                  <p>God will do with his Church and Ministers,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> and build up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as he hath appointed,<note place="margin">The enemies of the Church shall not be able to hinder the Lords building thereof.</note> do his Enemies what they will or can, fret,
rage, gnash their teeth, and gnaw their tongues: There is no wisdom,
counsel nor strength against the Almighty; The Lord will do it, and
who can let it? he hath decred a thing, and who shall alter it? Men may
account of Gods faithful Ministers as they please,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 9, 10.</note> and cast them out
as rubbish, but God will set them in their own place, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
account of them. As if a man had a house to build, and a great
many fair well hewn stones to build it with, and the Workman of
spight would cast away these good stones, and build the house with
rubbish, will the master of the house put it up? No, seeing he hath
been at the cost to get and fit those stones, he will have them laid in
their own place in his building, as is meet; so will the Lord in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Church. How often do great men and others fret, and seek
to overturn goodness, but God will do his will in despight of them:
Thus he did in the Apostles time, though the Scribes, Pharisees and
Priests gathered themselves oft together, and plotted to stop the
course of the Gospel; but they might as well have gone about to
stop the wind, or hide the Sun, seeing God had set them on work: So
in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, all raged against him, yet God kept him, and by him
gave the Pope such a deadly wound, as he can never recover; though
Turk and Pope and all fret, yet Christ is and will be the corner stone.
So the Papists fret at us, and have sought by many Treasons, and
blowing us up, to overturn our peace and being; yet by Gods
goodness we continue a Church, and if our own sins undermine us
not, shall do still in despight of our adversaries. So in a Town, God
will have his Word come and continue, and prevail to gather out his,
and do that which he hath purposed, though hand joyn in hand to
thrust them out; <hi>He hath the key of David, and openeth, and no man
shutteth,</hi> and till his work be done, no might of men or Devils can
shut the door.</p>

as its in the former Verse. Now is shewed what Christ
proves to the disobedient &amp; unbelievers, <hi>A stone of stumbling, and a rock
of offence,</hi> even a let and hinderance that they should not be saved; and
lest they should except against it, and say, They stumble not against
Christ (as many unbelievers will) yet saith he, Ye stumble at the Word
and Gospel that preacheth and offereth him: Not we, say unbelievers,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65522:134"/>
we stumble not at the Word, God forbid we should; yes, saith the
Apostle, that you do, both against Christ and his Word, while you be
disobedient to them both; whereat that none might wonder, he shews
that this came to pass through the wise and just councel and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, who had before ordained that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that as some should embrace and obey them to Salvation; so on the

deceive themselves; that they that be Believers may know
it, and walk chearfully, and give glory to God by a life answerable;
and they that be contrary may know it, to humble them, or leave
them without excuse: Thus did <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, our Savior, and
his Apostles: And this thus set down in the Word, and Preached
by Gods faithful Ministers, is a certain foregoer of their righteous
Sentence, which Christ himself shall give at the last day to the good
and bad. Those that now the Ministers of God according to the
Word pronounce to be Believers and penitent persons, they shall
then be found such, and have the reward of Believers on the right
hand: Those on the contrary, that they shall thus mark out for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,

sheweth us every thing that belongeth to our happiness, which is
therefore called the Word of Life, and Kingdom of Heaven; but
through the default of the parties themselves, even the unbelievers and

                  <p>And are there not many also among our selves that stumble at Christ?</p>
                  <p>1. All ignorant persons,<note place="margin">So Ignorant persons.</note> that take no knowledge of the misery or
danger they are in, but if they see any thing amiss, yet they trust by
crying God mercy, to do well, and so know no need of Christ, nor
seek after him.</p>
                  <p>2. Civil persons,<note place="margin">Civil persons.</note> that like the Pharisee trust to their just and true deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and honest living above a great many others; These cannot think
that they are so wretched, as the word saith we all are, namely, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, servants of sin and Satan, and that there is no good thing
in us, and we unable to think even a good thought: This they cannot
away with, nor do believe; but like the yong man think they have
kept the Law (though in the mean time, they understand not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
meaning thereof) who therefore hearing the judgements of God
denounced, put them off from themselves to Whoremongers,
Drunkards, Blasphemers, &amp;c. and so when Christ is Preached with
his benefits (which glad the hearts of some, more then all the world)
they take no comfort therein. These stumble at Christ, for he came
to save the wretched, miserable, poor, blinde, naked, lost, laden mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
wounded ones, and the like; and as long as a man hath any thing
of his own, Christ will not meddle with him.</p>
                  <p>3. Prophane persons,<note place="margin">Prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> who hearing that all that will have part in
Christ must be truly humbled, &amp; must be throughly changed, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
all sin, and embracing the contrary good, think this very harsh:
Some like the <hi>Gaderens</hi> will not leave their excessive covetousness, and
gainful sins, as that which they get in their shops, by lying, cozening
and deceiving, who cannot finde any time for the Word, their Farms
and Oxen carrying them away; others like <hi>Esau</hi> for their unlawful
pleasures and filthy lusts reject Christ: How often is Christ offered to
them, who yet will not renounce their sins, and turn to God with all
their hearts? Is not this fearful? But were it not an happy change, to
lay down and abandon their sins which will bane them, and take up
Christ, who would save them? Is it not monstrous that sin should be
preferred before Christ? Is not this to spare <hi>Barabbas</hi> and crucifie
Christ?<note place="margin">Such as will not part with some beloved sin.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Such as go yet further, and have been professors and hearers of
the word long, and done some commendable things, who yet have
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65522:135"/>
some one lust or sin, that they will not part with: Thus some stand
cheapning many years together; They would fain do well and be
saved, but have something that they cannot finde in their hearts to do
away, and so at last come to nothing, perish as unbelievers; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall have part in Christ, must be like the wise Merchant, who
will part with all that he hath, to get the Pearl: He will part with any,
with all his sins whatsoever, that he may have pardon in Christ: He
will take up his yoke not in what he list, shaking off some part at his
pleasure, but in every part thereof: O poor fools, that will lose
Heaven for some one lust! Are not such worthy to perish?</p>
                  <p>1. This is an exceeding comfort to those that are holpen against
all lets that hinder most,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and do not stumble at Christ, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
themselves utterly lost without Christ, that earnestly long after
him, prize him above the world, and are content to part with any
thing for him: O you are blessed! Why should so many stumble at
Christ, and not you? O its Gods unspeakable mercy! Flesh and
Blood hath not so taught you; well may you rejoyce for him, the
joy and rejoycing of your souls: He will be a sure Foundation of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to you, that will never fail you in this Life, in Death, or at
the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>2. Terror to all that stumble at Christ,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> upon what occasion soever,
that will not see their need of him, nor part with any thing for him;
To these he will turn to their destruction: For they hurt not him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
but themselves; as one stumbling at a great stone, hurts not it, but
himself; or one running a Ship against a great Rock, hurts not it, but
splits the Ship in pieces: so wil it be to all that embrace not Christ, for
missing him, Who shall save them? There is no other to be saved by,
but they must bear their own burthen, and shall undoubtedy perish:
They shall not escape destruction; and no marvel, For if they that
despised <hi>Moses</hi> Law, escaped not unpunished, What shall become
of them that despise Jesus Christ himself? O how happy might we
be that have the Lord Jesus, the blessed Savior of the world Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us so graciously, when as few have that favor, but most sit in
darkness and blindeness!</p>
                  <p>3. Whatsoever hath made any of us stumble at Christ,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> endeavor
we to remove the same, that so we may embrace him with both arms
as our Savior, and stoop to him as our Lord and King, who will be
to us a sure Foundation of Salvation that will not fail us: If any will
yet go on obstinately and carelesly, he shall surely bring destruction
upon himself eternally: And is it not a grievous thing that Christ
should be a cause of mens Damnation? and yet he is to all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him not, as they that come unworthily to the Sacrament, eat
and drink Damnation to themselves: We say its pity fair weather
should ever do hurt; but is it not wonderful pity that ever Christ
should do hurt?<note place="margin">Observ.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Such as stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Word, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at Christ.</note>] Some will say, they stumble not
at Christ; If they stumble at the Word, that brings news of Christ,
and will not embrace it, or be obedient thereto, its all one. And
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65522:136"/>
                     <hi>For the Word,]</hi> Most men take occasion to be offended at it, that
either they will not profess it at all, or at least no more then they must
needs; but to love it, delight in it, attend on it with diligence, and
be obedient to it in all things, O this few do! Why, doth the
Word give any just occasion to men to stumble? O no! Its the
the Word of Life, and Gospel of the Kingdom, able to make us
wise unto Salvation to save our Souls; Its our Light to guide, Food
to nourish, Armor to defend us, Pearl to enrich us, all in all: Yet
will men through their own default and forwardness, take one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or other not to embrace it, being herein stark fools; for if they
take any occasion to quarrel with this, or to shake it off, or be
strange to it, they must needs perish, yet there are too too many
such.</p>
                  <p>The occasions that men take, are either from the Word it self, or
from the Preaching of it, or the Preachers and Professors thereof,
or from themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Against the Word it self,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Offences taken against the Word removed See <hi>Downhams</hi> Christ. war. pag. 329.</note> Be these, 1. Some say, if they knew indeed
it were Gods Word they would (as good reason they should) believe,
and be ruled by it, but that they cannot tell. But he that hath not a
prophane heart, and willing to doubt, but is any thing humble and
teachable, may see enough, even by the Scripture it self to satisfie him
fully, and such arguments as hell it self is not able to gainsay. 2. Some
finde fault with the Translation of the Scriptures, for whose satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> and others have written largely. 3. Some curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Heads and nimble Wits, no less prophane then proud, stumble
at the plainness of the Scriptures, the homely and low stile of the
same: But this is one great argument to prove it to be of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is such fulness of Majesty in simplicity of words, which
is not to be found in any other writing: It savors of a man, and of
weakness, whatsoever else is written; or if any thing work admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is that which is strained out into some lofty and eloquent
Stile.</p>
                  <p>Unto the Prophet Gods Testimonies were wonderful,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 129, 130.</note> a
giving light and understanding (even) to the simple; yet in some
parts of Scripture is not only admirable Eloquence, able to set down
the proudest and ripest Wit (so also we could have spoke it all) but
some be dark and obscure, as may take up the deepest and greatest
Learned; which the Lord hath done, that there might be taken away
offence from the wise, as the rest is plain, to take away offence from
the simple. 4 Some stumble at some points of Doctrine which
they cannot conceive of, as of the Trinity, the worlds making
of nothing, the Resurrection, that Christ being Man should save
us, that being dead he should rise again, &amp;c. This comes of
Pride, when men will reject that which they cannot conceive: But
we must be fools in our selves, that is, captivate wit, reason, and all to
God, adoring that we cannot understand, and knowing that Gods my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
are no more fit to be comprehended in our shallow reason, then
a man can span the whole Earth with his hand; for Christ as he was
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65522:136"/>
Man and mortal, so also is God immortal: He that was God dyed,
but not in his Godhead (that had been impossible) but in his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and by his Godhead raised up himself being dead, and in both
natures saved us. 5. Again, some points be too harsh for some, as that
of Predestination, that God should appoint most men to damnation,
and that then its in vain to strive, or do any thing, for that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alter; But of this we shall have occasion to speak in the end of
the Verse: We allow a man to kill a Worm or Flie at his pleasure;
Why, may not the Lord do so by man, who is much less to him, then
a Worm to a man? God ordained to pass by some men, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
none but for his willing sin. 6. Again, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, wholly sold under sin, slaves of Satan, having no
good thing, but altogether filled with all evil, have no right to a bit
of bread, that the childe in the cradle is the enemy of God, and hath
deserved Hell; this mans proud nature cannot brook, but its too
true, the whose Scripture tells it, and we shall finde it: And we are
worthy to be in this case, that were so happy in our Creation, and
could not hold it; and now we may willingly acknowledge we be
thus vile, which will be the better for us, seeing all that is wanting
in us, is to be had in Christ: We must swallow this pill, that we
may have such a piece of Sugar follow it. 7. Again, that we must
renounce all our sins, and be crucified to the World, and take so strait
a course; this carnal people count bondage, which is indeed true
liberty, and that which they are in (as sweet as it is) is most slavish
bondage to Satan: They think they may not so much as laugh,
and that this course tyes them so short that they may do nothing;
but it tyes us from nothing but evil, and gives us liberty enough in
that use of Gods benefits, so it be without sin. 8. Again, that they
that will be Religious and Christs Disciples, must suffer persecution;
this they cannot away with, even because they are wholly carnal,
and savor of the flesh, and are so given to their ease, profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and honors of the world: If they knew what the end of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for well doing were, they would not be so addicted to the
world;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11.</note> for our Savior himself affirmeth, that such shall have a great
reward in Heaven;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 26.</note> hereat <hi>Moses</hi> aymed, when he entred into this
course: This must we undergo; by troubles we must go to Heaven,
for they humble us, make us pray more, exercise our Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
weary us hence, and make us shine brighter, drive us to God,
and that end will be happy. 9. Some again take occasion from the
Scriptures to be licentious, as from the falls of Gods servants, and
that promise in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>When the wicked man turneth away from his
wickedness, &amp;c.</hi> and the example of the Thief upon the Cross; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
delaying their repentance, and living in sin boldly, through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
partly and prophaneness, especially they abuse the Scriptures
(not a letter therein countenancing sin) and wresting them to their own
condemnation: These Examples and Reasons (among others) are
onely set down to comfort and uphold them that being oppressed
with their sins, are ready to sink under the burthen thereof: If thou
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65522:137"/>
beest not in this case, wo unto thee if thou thus medlest with the
Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Here I will adde also some of the scandals of the Papists against the
Word;<note place="margin">Scandals of the Papists against it.</note> for though they will lay it upon our interpreting and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same, yet seeing we know we preach it according to the true
meaning thereof, therefore they indeed blame the Scripture it self.</p>
                  <p>They cry out of our Doctrine, that its a Doctrine of Liberty; and
that under the colour of Christian Liberty, we establish carnal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and let every man do what he list: This is as if the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Strumpet should charge a modest grave Matron with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chastity;
for to be sure theirs is a Doctrine of all ease and liberty to
the flesh, yea those very things wherein they seem most harsh, feed
the flesh, and give liberty to sin; It enjoyns outward duties, which
an Hypocrite may perform as well as the best; It appoints bodily
punishments and penances as satisfaction for sin, and that by such
and such works (which an Hypocrite may do) they merit Heaven;
and for their Service, what can be said of it, but that it pleaseth well
the eye and the ear? yet we cannot be rid of their fooleries.</p>
                  <p>But why and wherein is our Doctrine to be charged?<note place="margin">Why and wherein they charge our Doctrine.</note> 1. Because
we teach free Justification by Faith onely, without works of our own:
But is this a foolish slander, we establish works as well as they, &amp; teach
the necessity of them, as inseperable companions, and necessary fruits
of Faith, and that there is no Salvation without them; onely their
blasphemous assertion, That we are justified by them, we dare not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
do not believe. 2. That we take away Auricular Confession
(that notable mean to kill sin, and to keep the people in awe) and Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
days, and give liberty to all sorts to marry. To answer them
severally:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Auricular Confession,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">About Auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> We know no such thing out of Scripture,
its but a carnal device, and its so far from killing sin, that it gives life
to it; for having once discharged themselves of all their sins into the
Priests care, and he enjoyned them what pennance he lists, thereupon
having received Absolution for them, they are ready to sin afresh,
and so do: As a drunken man goes out and vomits, not that he may
be sober, but that he may go to drinking again, even so do they in
their confessing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For fasting days,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fasting days.</note> 
                     <hi>and difference of meat for Conscience sake,</hi> We know
no such thing in the New Testament; The Apostle calls them a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Devils: They fast indeed from the Butchers Shambles, not
the Apothecaries Shop.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Marriage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Marriage.</note> Its the Ordinance of God that he hath appointed
for all, that they may keep themselves undefiled members of Christs
body; and since God hath appointed to give the gift of continency
but to few, therefore he hath appointed the remedy to be enjoyed of
all: And for the Papists, which do herein fight against God, and
against Nature, yet they do most filthily defile all their places
with most abominable Whoredoms: Therefore they are wicked
slanderers. Our Religion is too strict for such Libertines as they be;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65522:137"/>
All theirs is meerly in shew and bodily exercises (which the veriest
Hypocrite may do) not in mortifying the lusts of the heart; They
meddle not so far. True it is, we have too many licentious persons
of our Religion, but so doth not our Religion teach them, which
theirs doth: And that Original sin is done away in Baptism, that
some sins be Venial, that man hath some good in himself, and that
he can take away by penance the temporal punishment of sins, and
can merit, &amp;c. Its impossible therefore for their Religion to humble
a man aright, and make him fit to receive Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At preaching the Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Offence at preaching the Word.</note> There be, that either cast it off, or at least
hear negligently, and for fashion, without any serious care to be
guided thereby.</p>
                  <p>1. Some say, they did well enough before there was such preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and if there be such need of it, what is become of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
they were honest people, and had no such stir about hearing
of Sermons? I Answer, They were in woful danger, lying in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and unbelief, which because they saw not, they thought not
thereof; but some whose eyes God hath opened, bless him who hath
brought them out of that state, and wonder that ever they could be
so careless in such deadly danger; and plainly see, that if they had so
dyed, they had gone to Hell, who yet then thought their case as good
as you, wherein they would not now be for all the world. As if one
in a dark night, or asleep on his horse, should come over a narrow
Bridge, standing on a deep River, or a steep dangerous place, then
he fears nothing, for he sees no danger; but when he views it in the
day, his heart is ready to fail him, and he would not so go again for
the whole Town: And for our Fathers, we know not what their
state was; but know, that God let in light to sundry of them by small
means, as by reading some small parts of Scripture, some small
Books, Primmers and the like, so by conferring with others,
&amp;c. which (how small soever) God was pleased to bless; but if they
had no light and true knowledge of Christ, we know that they could
not be saved: We cannot say this or that, we may not belye the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
for their sakes; but whatsoever became of them, it behoves us
now, to whom God offers greater grace, and such blessed means as
preaching, that we take hold and embrace it, that we may come out
of ignorance, to the true knowledge of our Savior Christ Jesus, who
is indeed the way to Heaven: The time of that ignorance God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
not, but now he admonisheth every man every where to
repent.</p>
                  <p>2. Others say, This preaching brings stirs where it goes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the Towns and places that were very loving before it came
there, after fell into divisions: Its wonder that the Gospel of Peace
should breed Dissention, and that that which makes Peace between
God and man, should break Peace between man and man; Indeed its
an occasion through mans corruption: no marvel though it breed stirs,
considering what maner persons we are to be wrought on to good;
how hard to convince our judgements and consciences of the things
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65522:138"/>
of Gods Word, and the Truths therein contained; how hard to
work upon our crooked wills and rebellious affections; no marvel
though men startle when they be put out of their byas: But its good
when the Devil stirs, for then there is some hope and likelihood that
he will be cast out. And for Divisions, its true our Savior said, <hi>He
came not to bring peace</hi> (namely in evil) <hi>but a sword and debate;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 20, 21.</note> but the
fault is not in the Gospel, but in them that embrace it not; for they
that do not,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> S. H. <hi>on</hi> Mat. 3. 10. pag. 11, 12, 13.</note> but are obstinate, they fall out and contend with them
that do, because they by word and deed reprove their ill works;
whereas if all would obey,<note place="margin">Acts 4. 32.</note> it would make a blessed peace, as it doth
between good Christians, that were as Lyons and Tygers; but better
this Division yet, then that all should go hand in hand to Hell, as those
do that consent easily in evil; better two Souls of five saved, though
they have much unquietness withal, then all five perish. Where the
Gospel is embraced, it breeds not such a carnal love as was in Popery,
to consent in Superstition, in Vanity, Pastime, Good-fellowship,
Belly-chear, and the like, but a Christian and godly love in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
furthering one another to Heaven, and in the setting forth of
Gods glory; howsoever, a just War is better then an unjust Peace.
Hereto this Objection may be added, That if a man be never so well
beloved before, if he become a Professor, and goer to Sermons,
he shall be hated of most men; therefore I would be none of those,
will some say, I would have the goodwill of my Neighbors: But
let such know, that that is a wicked love and a woful, which a man
gets by living in sin;<note place="margin">Iohn 7 7. &amp; 15. 19.</note> better be hated of men for good, then of God
for ill-doing, yea to be thus hated is a good sign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. I cannot tell, say some, but since there hath been such preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and such a stir for preaching, and running after Sermons, I see
people never a whit the better, but there is more sin now then was
before; now such Pride, Covetousness, Craft, &amp;c. whereas before
there was Love, Good-neighborhood, Plain Dealing, &amp;c. <hi>A.</hi> 1. The
Devil had them who lived in Popery and Blindness so fast in the
main, as he did not greatly strive to bring them to gross sins, because
he was sure enough of them otherwise; now he fears he shal lose them,
therefore labors this way, &amp; the rather, because he would discredit the
Gospel: He knew their civility could do their Souls no pleasure, and
that being void of Faith it pleased not God, therefore he let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and the rather, that that Religion might be the better thought of;
now to disgrace the true Religion, he perswades many to rest in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet drawing them to all evils. 2. There is not more, nor so much
as seems, but because the Gospel and Light hath discovered sin
more; for a number of things that were counted vertues, now the
Word findes to be vices, and rebukes; as Carnal good-fellowship,
idle and vain spending of time, Idolatty, and blinde Superstition:
None were counted bad then, but those that were notoriously so;
now the Word descryeth many smaller things, so that the Gospel
is no more in the fault, though it discover faults, then a Looking-glass
is to be blamed, for shewing any the spots in his face; the fault
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65522:138"/>
is not in the glass that there be spots, they were there before: If in a
dark night we come into a house, we see nothing out of order, though
there be never so many things amiss, which in the light we do, yet is
not the light in the fault, as only discovering that which before was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen.
3. No marvel though there seem more evil, because when men are
forbidden evil, and call'd upon for good, they are more eager on sin
then before; as a melancholly man hath most minde to those meats
that his Physician forbids him. 4. No marvel also though some prove
as bad or worse then ever before, through Gods judgement on them for
the contempt of the Gospel: For if God gave up men to a reprobate
minde,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> for despising the light they had, though but the light of nature,
and that which they had by the works of God, what will he do for the
contempt of the light of the Gospel? 5. Yet theres no cause of offence
at this, though there should be more sin now: for there be many infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
amended, who before were ignorant, superstitious, &amp; prophane,
but now zealous Christians, True and Religious worshippers of God,
and such as live justly and righteously with their Neighbors, and are
merciful and ready to every good work, and do more true good by
many degrees, then was done in the time of Popery: Then they fed the
bellies of all comers, and nourisht the people in idleness, and now in
many places the poor that can work, follow their calling, and either eat
their own bread, which is best of all, or else are relieved by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of their neighbors, their souls also, and the souls of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
being lookt to: where it is otherwise, the people be all for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
which the word teacheth not, and so is not to be blamed, but
their evil hearts that will not be ruled thereby: So its no marvel that
some be worse since the Preaching of the Gospel, but its a wonder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and a great work of God, that any be better, and yet through
Gods goodness many thousands are converted by the Word, that
were wretched persons, to become good christians, worthy servants of
God; who do more good, and better please God, one of them, yea in
a day, then many of the best of the Papists in all their lives: Take heed
you be not worse by Preaching, but labor to be converted thereby.</p>
                  <p>4. Some see not why there should be such regard had of Preaching; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
They can profit as well by reading, and they can read the Sermons of
Christ, the Prophets, and Apostles, &amp; I hope wil such a one say, These
be better Sermons then any body else can make, and if Sermons be so
needful, will we condemn all that have had none, or now have none?
<hi>A.</hi> 1. Private reading of the Scriptures and other godly Writings, is
commendable and of great use, whereof one branch may be to make
men fitter to profit by Preaching. 2. For publike Ministerial Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
its ancient and profitable: But let men take heed how they cast
aside Gods Ordinance, to set up any other in the stead; such pride he
will not indure, Gods Ordinance is that which carries blessing, and
from which we must look for good: Men shall thrive by it, and not
otherwise;<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 24.</note> when <hi>Israel</hi> kept Manna all night, it stank, if on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
even, it did not, Why? because of Gods Ordinance: so why
doth some mens knowledge rot as it were and come to nothing that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65522:139"/>
they get by reading,<note place="margin">See Neh. 8. 8.</note> and others that they get by reading and hearing
comes to good?<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 7.</note> even because the one attend upon Gods Ordinance,
the other not:<note place="margin">Luke 4. 16.</note> This is the way he hath sanctified in all ages to save his
people.<note place="margin">Acts 19. 15.</note> We see how little and slowly people conceive of Religion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
our Catechizing and Preaching never so plainly, What
would be without it? and what though they be the Prophets or Christs
Sermons? usually there is but a small sum which must be opened and
applied:<note place="margin">Acts 8. 31.</note> The Eunuch could not understand without a Guide and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter;
Reading is like a fair Carpet folded up, Preaching is the same
opened; Reading like whole loaves, Preaching as bread cut in pieces for
to be eaten: <hi>Paul</hi> bids that his Epistles be read in other Churches, and
without doubt Ministers did Preach out of the same, opening and
applying the same by Confutation, Consolation, Exhortation, Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
that every one might have their due: And for that which they
say, what became of them that had no Preaching, and yet were godly?
God is not tied to means, and can work in extraordinary times as he
pleaseth, but in ordinary times he will work by ordinary means: The
<hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness where they could not Plow, had Manna,
but if they had looked for it when they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> they might
have starved: Therefore we shall see that God curseth the reading of
those that do it with contempt of Preaching, that either it turns to vain
jangling, or if there be any soundness in it for truth, yet it swims only
in the brain, and soaks not into the heart to reform. Again, if reading in
the Church were enough in a Minister, then it were not so great a
work, and so weighty an office to be a Minister as the Scripture makes
it, so might Universities, and a great deal of cost and labor be spared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Some will pray, and they think that as good as Preaching. <hi>A.</hi> Its
monstrous wickedness for any to put down any Ordinance that God
hath set up,<note place="margin">Neh 8. 6, 9, 3.</note> under colour of setting up another: These two, Preaching
and Prayer, be inseparable companions, and must go together, &amp; none
pray more, then they that make most conscience, and have profited
most by Preaching; and how can any pray without Faith? and how
comes Faith, but by Preaching? The Word Preached shews men
their wants, without which they cannot Pray, but babble: Therefore
its said,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He that turns away his ear from hearing of the law, even his prayer
is abomination:</hi> and what Prayer is it that they talk so much of, but
Book-prayer to serve a turn? which though it be not amiss, as a staff
till a man can go of himself, yet its not as conceived Prayer, much less
to be set up with the casting down of Preaching,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Hierous</hi> Preach. Plea. 220.</note> whether it be done
privately, yea, or reading of Prayer publikely, which is lawful in it self,
but to thrust out Preaching, that were abominable; Pray as much as
you will, but neglect not Preaching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Some stumble at often Preaching; They see no such need of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
they be not so bad, that they should need so much, one in a
moneth were enough: They could be content to hear now &amp; then, but
every Sunday, especially in the afternoon is too much; but for weekday
Sermons, they utterly mislike, that people leaving their work should
frequent them, and think that they which Preach so oft, cannot Preach
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65522:139"/>
soundly.<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 4. and 11. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Soundness and diligence in Preaching may wel stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
Disuse makes men less willing, yea, less able to Preach; If a
man conscionably give himself to the service of the Church, he shall
be fitted indeed to it: Its not rare Preaching that makes men Preach
well, no more then seldom milking of a Cow makes her give more or
better milk; If men be given to profits, pleasures, &amp;c. they wil not much
trouble themselves this way. 2. Men have need often to hear, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
careless to attend, slow to conceive, having bad memories that had
need be helped continually, as also rebellious and untoward hearts to
obey; Therefore we are bid to Preach instantly, in season and out of
season; If any should be weary of often Preaching, it should be we that
Preach, but wo unto us if we do the work of the Lord negligently.</p>
                  <p>7. Some say the Ministers Preach so harshly, and such fearful things
as they cannot abide; They have come sometimes, but cannot away
with such things; They cannot be content though people be
civil, and quiet, keeping their Church, following their calling, and
doing no body hurt, but require them to live so strictly, and telling
them that if they live but in one sin they shall be Damned; and
they call for such duties, and they must be done in a Spiritual maner;
They cannot tell what they would have. <hi>A.</hi> Alas poor people, they
would fain hear all is well and peace, that they might make an easie
matter of being a Christian, and go to Heaven with ease: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they cannot endure to be put out of their Byas, especially
being Ancient, and having all this while thought their case
good; and withal having been somewhat civil, now to be told
all is out of the way, and nothing as it should be, and to hear
such duties required, and to be done in such a Spiritual maner,
and that it will not serve to huddle them over as they have
been wont: O this is such a disquieting that they cannot away
therewith, therefore they count Preaching harsh. But better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
again, then still go wrong and perish: If any hath gone
out of his way half the day for want of asking, and at Noon
one tell him he is out of the way, will he say, Nay, seeing I have
gone so far, I will not go back now, but go on? Or though it be more
grief, will he not rather return then go further out, and so never come
to his Journeys end? he were else mad: Our case is such, and it is best
to be told of it, and herein Ministers should deal faithfully, laying
this as the Foundation of all their Doctrine,<note place="margin">See Deut. 27. 15, 16, 17-26.</note> that in themselves
men be utterly lost;<note place="margin">Psal. 9. 17, &amp; 11, 6.</note> thereupon denouncing Judgement, whereby
they may be brought to seek mercy; They must herein follow
those which have gone before them,<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> the Prophets, our Savior
himself,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 36.</note> and his Apostles: As they must take heed they break not
the bruised Reed,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37, 38.</note> nor quench the smoaking Flax, so they must
not give Childrens bread to Dogs; We must not give Pearls to
Swine, and lavish out the mercies of God to Proud, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
Impenitent persons. First, the Law must Arrest mens
Consciences, and they must be rowsed up by it, else they will
never seek unto Christ for pardon: It is necessary we should
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65522:140"/>
thus Preach, that we may be free from mens blood; and that their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or slackness in repenting be not imputed to our coldness in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,
such as more like or approve others, wil one day curse the day
that ever they heard such sweet-tongued flatterers, or unskilful daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and they shall finde most favor at the last that deal most plainly:
Howsoever, thus we shall please God, and keep a good conscience.
Neither must thou stumble at those many marks and signs that they
lay down whereby to try Faith, Love, Repentance, Sincerity, and
the like, for Gold fears not the Touchstone: And they that hear
grievous things in the Word, if they would tarry by it, should hear
as comfortable and joyful, whereof in time they might have their
part, but they must taste of the bitter, ere they come to the sweet;
Such as are otherwise, would be as it were lulled asleep, even to
their final destruction: If any shun, and say we would bring them to
desperation, they nor we shall not need fear that, people be not so
easily moved; if Preaching humble them, we fear not, but it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
comfort them: Holy desperation I would we could help men to,
but there's more fear of desperation and horror for not believing and
regarding the threatnings of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. Some stumble at plain Preaching; If there were any witty
conceits, or Eloquence of words, or plenty of Quotations of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that in divers Tongues, or ancient Stories, &amp;c. I could
like it well, will some such say, which now I do not. <hi>A.</hi> They that
have itching ears to hear the painted words of mans wisdom, rather
then the plain evidence of the Word of God, and seek to delight
their mindes, rather then edifie their conscience, if ever they receive
any good, its of Gods exceeding mercy, not the course they take:
These be commonly such, as get something into their heads to talk
of, but yet live licentiously and at large; and hence it is that they
love such Preaching as is fair and far off, rather then that which
comes home to search their Conscience, and sift them like a sieve:
But whatsoever they would have, Gods Ministers must learn to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
the Word as becometh the Word, and to give that which
is most wholesom and profitable for the peoples Souls: They must
Preach Christ Crucified in a Crucified Phrase: The foolishness of
Preaching God hath Sanctified; Its better to speak five words with
understanding, which may convince the Judgement and Conscience
as it may search the heart, and so edifie the Soul in true godliness, then
Five thousand, to no edifying, but to fill the brain onely: Its the
true learned Preaching that open the Scriptures soundly, and gather
Doctrines naturally, to confirm them strongly, and apply them wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 2.</note>
and in all this to be so plain, as that which is in the Teacher, may
be conveyed into the Hearer; Its true Learning to make another
Learn, that's Preaching which may pierce the Heart; we may not
deal Huckster-like with the Word, as men do with their Wares, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to beguile, then profit the buyer: How little do most conceive
when we speak the plainest? Assuredly for the plainest Preaching,
people ought to be most thankful.</p>

9. Some take offence at us and our assemblies, and refuse to joyn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
with us publikely and privately, because they say our Church is not
rightly governed, our Ministers be not true Ministers, and that there be
many foul abuses among us, and that we are no Church of God, but
an Antichristian company,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 16.</note> &amp;c. <hi>A.</hi> These are they that be too
wise, and over just, that either would imagine a company more pure
then is to be looked for on earth, or condemn the Church of God
to be none, because of some wants and blemishes. But</p>
                  <p>That company that hath the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
soundly preached in all substantial Points,<note place="margin">Which the true Church.</note> and the Sacraments
for substance according to Christs institution, is a true Church of
God, though there be blemishes therein: If it overturn the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it is none; as if one want a head, heart, liver, he is no man, but
a carkase; who though he have scars and moles in his face, yet having
the other parts, nay, though he should want a leg or an arm, yet he is
a man. Christ never forsook the Synagogues of the Jews, though
they were greatly corrupted, and both Doctrine and life was foully
faulty: Sometimes two High Priests in one year, sometimes others
of other Tribes then of <hi>Levi</hi> came to the place by corruption, yet
seeing they held the foundation, Christ forsook them not. Again,
That Ministry which God hath used to convert many thousand souls,
is not Antichristian. <hi>Ye are the seals of mine Apostleship:</hi> We think a
great deal more charitably of them, then they do of us, as that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foundation of Religion, they may be saved: And though
we know that numbers of them be proud and idle persons, and such
as look not much to govern their hearts and lives, and are more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in points of Church Government, then in points of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
yet we doubt not but some true servants of God have been
misled, and their tender consciences have stumbled, whom God hath
enlightened, and brought from among them, and who have
had more peace in a day, in coming to the Word from them, and
joyning with the Church again, then they had before in a whole
year.</p>
                  <p>10. Some say, There be so many Religions in the world, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
they cannot tell which to take; There be Jews, Turks, Anabaptists,
Familists, Papists, Protestants, Lutherans, Calvinists, Brownists,
&amp;c. every of which say they have the truth, and what should such
plain men as I do? for my part, I think it the wisest course to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with none of them all, but follow my own business, till they all
agree which is the Truth, not troubling my self at all with any thing
they say; I may come to Church because of the Law, but I will
never greatly regard what is said or spoken there. <hi>A.</hi> A bad excuse
is better then none at all, but this will not serve mens turn: Though
there be many that say, They have the Truth, yet there is but one
Truth,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> and this is to be found out of such as are not willing to be
ignorant (as these Objectors commonly be) Its no marvel that there
hath been ever, and will be that envious one, that soweth Tares
where the good husbandman soweth Wheat; There have ever been
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65522:141"/>
Hereticks and false Teachers in the Church, that they which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
may be known; but by the light of the Word, which is
able to shew men the Truth, the servants of God willing to learn
the same, have found it out: <hi>Zachary, Elizabeth, Mary, Nathaniel,</hi> and
thousands of others found it out, though the Jews at that time were
rent into many Sects, Scribes, Pharisees, Sadduces, Essenes, &amp;c.
They did the will of God,<note place="margin">Iohn 7. 17. &amp; 10. 27.</note> and were Christ sheep, therefore heard
his voyce, and were instructed in the Truth. And it is extream
madness in any to neglect the finding out of the Truth, because there
is some difficulty, seeing without the knowledge hereof they perish
eternally: The more falshood there is, the more it stands them in
hand to search for the Truth, or else they shall perish in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 23.</note>
as others do in their error: We must buy the Truth, we must
strive both to finde it and maintain it; The Truth must be had, else
we dye: In worldly things men be wiser. As if one dwell some
distance from the Market, and in the way to it, he must go over a
great Common, where lie a great number of by-paths, some to one
place, some to another; will he for this stay at home, and want ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
and say, I will never go, lest mistaking my way, I lose
my Market? No, but he will rather get one that knows the way to
conduct him therein, whereto he will take good heed, that he may
not mistake at any other time; Or will he neglect to buy necessary
provision, because there be so many deceitful people in the world,
and so starve at home? No, but he will say, There be false wares
and deceitful men, but Ile learn skill to know the one from the
other, to discern the good from the bad; so that some difficulty taketh
not away mens care, but rather whetteth and increaseth it: This
worldly wisdom will condemn mens folly and madness in heavenly
things; We must therefore get skill in Gods Word, whereby to try
Doctrine, and that by earnest prayer unto God; there be plain places
of Scripture that will confute the errors that shall be broached, by
them we must be judge. These things I speak, because I would have
all get over these logs, if they have hitherto stumbled; and if we
have got over, we may be able by good Arguments to help over
others, our weak brethren, that are willing to learn, that they may
be able to confute any caviller, or answer any that shall kick at these
things: And I pray and beseech you look to it, let there be none here so
ill minded toward himself, that having stuck at any of these, he be
willing and still content so to do, concealing the same, neither desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to be rid out of the fetters thereof: This is dangerous indeed,
especially take heed that there be not such an ill minde, and vile dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in any, as not to be content alone to cast off Religion upon
these occasions and pretences, but labor to lay them in the way of
others to draw them from God: O fearful thing! Cannot you your
selves be content to cast off God, but will you labor to bring others
also to destruction? O these enemies to God and his kingdom! what
will be their end? and where shall they appear? For if they that
win souls shall shine as the stars,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 3.</note> what shall they do that destroy souls?
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65522:141"/>
As the ten Spies that went with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> bringing up an
ill name and slander upon the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereby they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
their Brethren from going toward it, were shut out and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished;
so they that bring up an ill name upon the zealous Profession
of Gods true Religion, and discourage their Neighbors from it, will
assured perish in endless confusion.</p>

                  <p>1. Some say, There is a deal of preaching indeed, and crying
out against sin, and calling men to this and that strictness of life, and
that it is such an hard matter to be saved; but you must give us leave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to regard none of this that is said, for we see none worse then the
Ministers themselves; they must say somewhat when they be in the
place, but they are as proud and covetous, and as bad as any other;
and were there any such matter as they teach, would they dare to go
clean contrary? <hi>A.</hi> It cannot be denied but that some in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,

live so grosly and dissolutely, contrary to their teaching, that they
give a grievous offence to those that wait for such things; yea, and

and think that Religion is no such matter as we tell them of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they observe the contrary in their Teachers: But what though
they do thus? yet notwithstanding is the Word of God holy

man? or the meat, because the Cook is a swearing hasty fellow?
There is no calling wherein there are not some bad: But there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ministers that make conscience to live according to that they teach,
and as well to be examples to the Flock in holy conversation, as to
preach (which is but one part of a Ministers duty) and who (setting
humane frailties aside) may bid their adversaries write a book against
them. For common frailties, who can say his heart is clean? even

are reported of godly Ministers, usually upon tryal they have
proved lyes, raised of Malice, and not deserved by them; And
shall the whole calling of Ministers be blemished, because some be
bad? And though it were as they say, that Ministers were like Cooks,
that prepare good meat for others, and taste not of it themselves;
yet the Word is good, and it may be profitable to others, as Gods
Ordinance, which is appointed for the Salvation of his people, the
blessing whereof dependeth not upon the Ministers good life, but
Gods blessing. <hi>Noah</hi> was saved in the Ark, whereof the makers

and they cannot agree in points; What then shall we do?
Ile see them agreed, ere Ile regard any of them. <hi>A.</hi> Its not to be
wondred at, if there be differences in some things, for here the best
know but in part, and there still remains scales to be rub'd off, and God
doth not reveal all his will in all points at once, but by degrees, and
in time; and if any would tarry to be Religious, till all men jumped
in all Points, they should never be Religious, but perish; and will
this serve mens turns? But what contentions and differences are there
between the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> True, its pity
there should be any; and we should desire God, to cause his truth to
break out, and to remove the occasions of strife, and till they
can agree about those few things, to proceed by one rule in peace:
But what differences are they? not about the Essential points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or matters of necessity to Salvation, but of matters besides
the main, namely, The Government of the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

persons by whom, and the maner how the same is to be govern'd,
about which indeed there's diversity of opinions; So about Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which are not of the Essence of Salvation, neither doth the
Kingdom of God stand in them: So that as the Church is a true
Church that is governed either way, so may they of each and both
opinions, yet be the servants of God, and be saved, both holding
the foundation, though differently building thereon: If therefore
they shall agree in all Fundamental Points, and all things necessary
to Salvation, as in the Doctrine of their own Misery, Christ, Faith,
Repentance, and the like, though they leave the other till God shall
further reveal, they shall do well enough; and its more seemly for
Christians to minde the Doctrine of Faith, Sanctification, Love,
&amp;c. then to busie themselves about the Government of the Church.
The Devil calls them from things most needful, to other things less
needful, more uncertain and dangerous: If because of some smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
points of difference, they shall shake off all Religion, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
shall they make? What if Clothiers should all agree in the
main points of Cloth-making, till they came to the maner of making
up, and to the Tillers, and herein they should differ, should any need
stumble hereat, and say, Ile be no Clothier, they cannot agree among
themselves? Why, they may be good Clothiers, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in this and that of both fashions: Let a yong man then go and
practice as far as they agree, and when they come to the winding
up, do as he is perswaded best, and he shall be Clothier good

there be that take offence:</p>
                  <p>1. Some say, There's but a small number of these Professors that
be so precise, most be not so; and such as are usually, are of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
not of the greatest and wisest men, of whom but a few are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
after these Preachers, to run after Sermons, or be so precise in
themselves and their families, and a contemptible company they
be,<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 4.</note> hated of all for the most part. <hi>A.</hi> 1. For their number, its
small if they be compared with the multitude, but by themselves
a worthy company; and being such a small number, its an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they are approved of God, and walk in that way which
leadeth to Heaven: And hath not this been always told, That the
way to Heaven is strait, and few finde it; and so on the contrary?
The greatest number have ever been deceived, and joyned in evil;
most cryed against Christ, <hi>Crucifie him;</hi> for one <hi>Elias,</hi> one <hi>Micaiah,</hi> there
were Four hundred Priests of <hi>Baal.</hi> 2. For their baseness, that's not
always true, though the Church consisteth most of them that are
mean, yet God hath had and will have of all sorts, not excepting the
greatest, as <hi>David, Solomon, Asa, Jehosaphat, Hezekiah, Ahikam;</hi> and
before them, the Patriarchs, <hi>Job,</hi> and others: So hath not our own
Land wanted worthy men of the greatest place, as there are at this
hour many right godly Noblemen, Knights, and others of great
state and place:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note> If this will draw them to the love of Religion, there

3. For their contemptibleness, they are not the worse, but the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be liked, for the Devil and wicked men will ever hate that
which is good: They did so by the Prophets, our Savior, and his
Apostles, and will do so by their followers; let this therefore
be a mean rather to draw men on to Religion, then set them off
from it.</p>

while, and after they fall off, and become as others, as bad as
who is worst, which we think is, because having begun, they see
nothing in it, and so they return to their old courses, as that which
is better. <hi>A.</hi> You might have guessed many truer Reasons: Its
not that a true Christian is fallen away, or one that hath tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tasted of the goodness of the Lord, and finding no sweetness
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65522:143"/>
in it, returns to his old byas as the better state; but it is, that he that
was but an hypocrite, though he made a shew, is discovered now,
he hung to the bark, but was never ingrafted, <hi>went out from us, but
was not of us;</hi> and Christ coming (as is foretold) shal make the thoughts
of many hearts to be opened: Its the easiest thing in the world to be
deceived, and few build sure; and God will have some such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters,
both for the good of his servants (which are thereby made
the more wary to build sure, and look to themselves better then
otherwise they would) and for the just falling of the wicked, that
they which will take no benefit by any thing, as by Preaching,
and by the godly lives of the servants of God, but rather seek
for lets, may meet with such blocks falling in their way to their
Destruction: If some fall away, what then? The Word hath
foretold there shall be hypocrites in the Church; yet there be some
have held out constantly,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 35.</note> yea to the death, in Prison, and flames,
and loved not their lives so well as the Truth, who have found
indeed the sweetness of that Christian life, from which they
would never part: Let us therefore begin in Truth, and we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fall from it, as the hypocrites do; lets look to our selves, there
may be times of tryal, wherein many will fall away.</p>

they, but they be as bad as other folks, and seeing they make
a shew of forwardness more then others, I would have them
shew it by their lives; but they are as Covetous as others, as
Froward, Hasty and Furious, if they be stirred. <hi>A.</hi> I see you
can tell how others should live, though you have no minde to
it your selves: True, they should lead their life answerable to
their Profession; and do not a great many so, even their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
that live by them with Eagles eyes, yea, even their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
being Judges? Why doth not this provoke them and
you? and what if some having boisterous natures, and strong
corruptions, which for want of heedfulness and care, prevail
over them for a time, and so they fall to do something uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yea, and for a long time walk not so watchfully as they ought,
is this matter enough for you to mislike Religion? The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
teacheth not this, but the contrary, therefore is it not in
fault that you should fall out with it. Doth any man dislike a Trade,
because some of the Trade be bad persons, and are at sometimes
overshot therein? Christianity and the denying of our selves is
not so easie a matter, as that it should be expected a man should
straightway, as soon as he hath entred upon the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
be perfect, although we ought to look and labor thereto
diligently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Some stumble at the great humiliation of some Professors, who
by going to Sermons have been even at their wits end, and so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
as that all their friends could not comfort them, yea some have
been in such dispair, as they have been almost besides themseves, and
some have made away themselves by drowning, hanging or otherwise;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65522:143"/>
and they that have not been so, yet though they were as merry
before they went to Sermons as one would wish, after have been so
dumpish and heavy, as that they would never be merry; and I would
be loth (will some such say) to come to this pass, therefore I do not
mean to trouble my head about such matters. <hi>A.</hi> Many through Gods
goodness be truly humbled, and yet in short time finde comfort; others
more deeply cast down, and longer held without comfort, whom
(though they walk heavily as they have cause, yet) God sustains, and
in due time they get comfort; who if they should be held under all
their life, and yet obtain it at last, were much bound to God, and their
estate infinitely more happy, then to live as before in security: Yea,
if any should be so deeply cast down, and for want of means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
living in desert places, wanting publique and private helps, or
having them, be troubled also with the humor of melancholy, and the
Devil subtilly watching his advantage when both these meer, should
draw them into some temptation, to lay violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet I had rather a thousand times be in the case of such a one,
that being lost, hath sought after mercy and salvation, and had it in
chase, and yet were held off by unbelief, Satans temptations, and their
own distemper: Being in seeking of it, their state could not but be
good, what ever became of the body, For, <hi>Blessed are they that hunger
and thirst, &amp;c.</hi> Better, I say, is the case of such a one (though it be
somewhat grievous) then either of prophane ones, or civil persons,
that never make question about their salvation; but (God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
such examples are few, and very rare: Many indeed there be that
make away themselves by hanging, drowning, cutting their throats,
&amp;c. (of whom we hear ever and anon) but not one of a thousand of
those upon any such cause, but upon Covetousness, Pride, Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Worldly grief, meeting with such Afflictions and Persons as
cross their Wills; and having no Grace nor Faith to bear them up
in them, they sink under them, and yield to the Devils temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as <hi>Achitophel:</hi> So that you need not keep away from Sermons,
lest you should be troubled in your wits, and make away your
selves, but rather hear the Word, and labor for Faith, or else
you may be more likely a thousand times for want of Faith, when
Afflictions come, to hang your selves, then otherwise: And is it
not strange, that if one of an hundred upon trouble of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
come to such an end, that should be a stone to stumble at,
and all the other should be leapt over, and be no means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
people to the Word, and to Faith? a sign they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to stumble: And whereas there are some that are upon some
occasion, or naturally distracted in their Wits, and craized in
their brains, and so miscarry, people must be so wise as to know,
that this is no trouble of Conscience; yet a number are so foolish,
that they put no difference: Therefore never fear, being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the Word, for if thou beest not troubled in this World
for thy sins, thou shalt howl in Hell for them eternally. And
where you say, They that go to Sermons be so heavy, whiles
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65522:144"/>
they are seeking, and have not yet found, pardon them if they be
heavy, having obtained, they have warrant to rejoyce in the Lord,
and so both may and do; though they dare not giggle, and be merry
in folly and lewdness, which is accounted the onely mirth with the
world: So that preaching is the means indeed to make men first heavy,
but after truly merry for ever.</p>
                  <p>From themselves also arise lets,<note place="margin">Offences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from mens selves hindring their zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> why they do not profess Religion

                  <p>1. Some from a supposed sufficiency in themselves, say, They
know as much already as the Preacher can tell them, namely, That
they must love God above all, and their Neighbor as themselves,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and so they do, and they can tell them no more. <hi>A.</hi> O poor blinde
creatures that can be so deluded: If they were not willing withal, it
could not be; For is it enough to know these general things, and no
particular belonging thereto? But alas, in their wilful blindeness
they think they know and do all, when indeed they know and do
just nothing. Would not he be accounted a wilful fellow, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perswaded to learn the Trade of Cloathing, should say, Why, I
know that well enough already, its but to buy Wooll, and make
Cloth and sell it? But are there not so many particulars and turn-agains
belonging hereto, as they that be Apprentices thereto seven
or eight years, if they give not the more heed, they are yet at the
end but bunglers? So of a Carpenter, Its nothing to build a house,
its but to lay the groundsels, raise up the sides, and set on the roof,
&amp;c. There's more then so required, as skill in contriving, skill in
chusing materials, and the like; so to the love of God and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
belong innumerable things: When we have attained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our duties to each, we have not then done, we must also
know our misery; and to help us thereto, know the Law, and then
know Christ, and what he hath done; and then know Faith, and
have it wrought in us: These must we have, ere ever we can truly
love either God or our Neighbor; therefore they that content
themselves without these, abide in ignorance, and will perish in
Hell, as those that are wilfully guilty of their own destruction.
Thus in these days, do not many say, They know they be sinners,
and hope to saved by Christ, and saith not the Scripture, <hi>Whoso be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in Christ shall be saved, &amp;c.</hi> If this would serve the turn,
God then might have spared all the rest of his pains in leaving us the
Word (onely those two Precepts would have been enough) and
his labor in fitting Ministers to it, which he calls such a worthy work:
No man alive can say, that he loves God above all, and his Neighbor
as himself, onely that he endeavoreth thereto, which endeavors also
hath and will cost much pains.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Some say, They mean as well as any of those that go to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and though they do not shew it by that or any such things, yet
they have as good a heart to God-ward as the best of them all, though
they cannot talk so well. <hi>A.</hi> These bewray themselves to be naught
at the first dash, for whereas they say, they have good hearts, even
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65522:144"/>
the best complain of the badness of their hearts: Thus Hypocrites
desire to hide themselves out of mens sight, and having nothing to
say for themselves, they flie to the heart, which they think men know
not; but alas herein they play the fools, for if men do not approve of
them, do they think God will? and that they can stand before him?
They think also men cannot judge of the heart, but the Lord hath
taught us ways to judge of it by the outward behavior, as the Tree
by the Fruit.<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> Besides, grant their heart were good, Is that enough?
doth not God require a good outside?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> Let such as wanting this, boast
of a good heart while they will, its a rotten and stinking heart they
have; for without knowledge the heart is not good: Hypocrites boast
of a fair outside, when as the heart is naught, as others having no
good parts of obedience, say, that all's within, they have a good
heart; but the ones outside, and the others inside (both being indeed
stark naught) will carry them to Hell, not to Heaven: Learn we to
submit our selves to the Ordinances of God, and by the Word
Preached to get Faith, that thereby our hearts may be purged, and
made clean.</p>

Morning and Evening, much less let their work to go to Church on the
week-day; Nay, I promise you they can scant spare the time on the
Sundays; They must be at home (without it be now and then) to bake,

and our Savior saith, <hi>What shall it profit a man to win the whole

if you have more grace, is not your state better? And would you
offer a Sacrifice that costs you nothing?<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 24.</note> or cannot God, who knows

the poor, let them know, their great charge will not excuse them:
Have they not souls? That's the greatest charge, and to seek the
Salvation of these; and one would think their poverty should be a
spur hereunto: Is there not the same way of Salvation to them that
is unto others? They had need hear the Word to get knowledge and
faith, that they may go through their Temptations comfortably.
And first for the Sabbath, let them and all others take heed they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not with it to their worldly uses, God hath sanctified it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and the matters of Salvation: This ought every one to spend
conscionably, which if we would do, we might get a competency
of saving knowledge; wo be to them that dare prophane this: God
hath said, we shall do all our works on the six days, that which we
cannot, God will supply without breach of his Sabbath; and for the
poor that live in the same Town, or near a Sermon on the week-day,
I make no doubt its their duty, without some great let to attend on
it,<note place="margin">See Hag. 2. 19.</note> and God will recompence it, if they do it conscionably; let
them thus do, and thereupon return to their work, and follow their
calling with diligence, and see what they shall miss by the weeks end.
Neglect of Religion indeed hath brought want, but I never knew
any that heard conscionably and thirstily, that were put to the more
want by their hearing, or any such so miserably poor, as careless
persons: If any shall under colour of hearing neglect their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

the time. <hi>A.</hi> Have they so much to do for themselves, as God can
have nothing done of them? and so much for the body and this
world, as that they have no leisure for the soul, or the world to
come? Remember the end of them who being invited to the great
Supper,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 24.</note> came not, but preferred their Oxen and Farms thereto,
they were shut out, and had no part in that blessed Feast: Others
might also pretend it as well, if they knew not that one thing to be
needful: What? are all they idle persons, and have nothing to do
that attend on the word diligently? No, but such as both have
business, and in like maner a Christian care thereof, yea, and those
that dispatch it well enough, and finde Gods blessing thereon, no
less, nay, much more then they, that have care of nothing else: If
they wanted something of that they get, yet it shall be better with
them in the winding up, when they shal have that which will stand by
them, whereas all that the others have got shall be taken away; else
as they had no leisure, and could finde no time to serve God, so God

need take the more pains in hearing, as also learn and labor to be
book-learned: Its possible, if you will give your minde and endeavor
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65522:145"/>
thereto; If not, yet many that never knew letter in the Book have
attained to good knowledge, and been most excellent Christians,
and laid down their lives for the Truth, and others to competent
saving knowledge, and lived well as the servants of God: But this
may be a warning for Parents to bring up their Children in Reading,
as in many other respects, so that they may not have this block to
hinder them from goodness: and rich men should do well to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
Learning upon poor mens children, its a mercy indeed to their
Souls.</p>
                  <p>6. Others say, They be so dull, and its such an hard thing to learn <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
Religion, as they shall never attain it. <hi>A. The slothful man saith,
There's a Lyon in the way,</hi> but its as easie to learn, as many other
things are:<note place="margin">See Psal 119. 130.</note> You can learn to play at Cards, you can conceive your
own business,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 4. and 14. 6.</note> and are wise enough to save your selves from being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled,
if you would willingly in humility come to learn, knowledge
is easie to him that will understand: And though you get no great
measure, yet if you get knowledge of the main points and Faith, and
desire more, and be willing to be ruled by that which you know,
God will accept of the will.</p>
                  <p>7. Others say, If they should follow Sermons, &amp;c. they should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
be so hated, mockt, and nick-named, as they should not be able to
endure it, their Land-lords would fall out with them, and turn them
out of doors,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11.</note> &amp;c. <hi>A. 1. Blessed are ye when ye shall thus suffer,</hi> you

they must <hi>remember their Creator in the days of their youth.</hi> 2. For the
rich and wealthy, they are no more exempted from serving God, then
the meanest, nay, are more bound and tyed thereto, by reason of the

                  <p>9. Others think they do well, and please God, though they be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
not so precise as some be; for they thrive, they thank God, and have
as few crosses as the best of them all, and if God did not love them,
he would not so bless and prosper them as he doth. <hi>A.</hi> This is an ill
argument,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> seeing God afflicts those whom he loves, and suffers his
sun to shine, and his rain to fall even on the unjust; This is but the
wicked mans portion: <hi>Ishmael</hi> had the fat of the Earth, <hi>Esau</hi> the dew
of Heaven; Our Savior suffered <hi>Judas</hi> to carry the bag, but <hi>Peter</hi>
and the rest carried away the grace; <hi>Jacob</hi> had many crosses, <hi>Esau</hi>
many blessings, yet was <hi>Jacob</hi> loved of God, <hi>Esau</hi> hated: There
can be no worse sign,<note place="margin">See Psal. 50. 21. and 55. 19.</note> then to live in a careless prophane course,
and yet to meet with no crosses, but to have all prosperity: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of sins, and a little Faith, and Sanctification, is more worth
then all the world,<note place="margin">Iob 21. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>But the wicked is reserved to the day of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>

                  <p>10. Some say, They have a Minister of their own, though he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
cannot Preach, yet he is an honest man, and quiet, and means well,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65522:146"/>
and doth his good will, and what can one desire more of a man?
<hi>A.</hi> These be notable persons, If Salvation were put in their mouthes,
they could be content to take it, but to seek after it, they see no such
cause: It will serve no mans turn to excuse himself by another mans
fault, If the Minister do not his duty to Preach, people must seek
after the light (being its come into the world) compassing even sea
and land to obtain it: Neither would they be so simple in other things,
as to put their Suit for Goods and Lands into ones hands that hath
no skill at all in Law, and being so told, make answer. Ile look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
no other, he will do his good will, and I can desire no more of a
man: The like might be instanced in a Physitian for our body, nay,
a Shepherd or a Keeper for our Cattel; Nay, will men take it well,
if such as through want of skill have spoiled their work, should say,
Why, we did our good will, and you can have no more? But will
you not say, You should not have taken it in hand, except you could
have done it; If I had known it, I would have sent it five miles,
or sent five miles for a Workman, rather then had my Stuff
spoiled.</p>
                  <p>Thus there is no end of devices that the Devil hath to put in mens
heads,<note place="margin">No end of the Devils devices.</note> to keep them from regarding the word and matters of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nay, that people will seek out for themselves, even to wrong
their own souls.</p>
                  <p>And this is one main cause why so few people be saved,<note place="margin">Why so few be saved.</note> because
none so simple but he can finde a shift, nor none so worldly wise,
but he can suffer himself to be held back by one of these or the like
hinderances. In our earthly journeys, we love smooth and plain way,
and finde fault with the contrary; but as if the way to Heaven were
too plain, men seek out blocks to lay in their own way; but all these
things will no more serve their turn when God shall come to judge
them, then a Breast plate of brown Paper against a Musket-shot:
For alas, they be but devices, and false causes in stead of the
true.</p>
                  <p>For the very reason indeed that people have no minde to Religion,<note place="margin">Why people have no minde to Religion.</note>
is, because it crosseth their humor. 1. Discovering their sins which
they would have still hid, and rebuking them. 2. Striving to pluck
them from their sins, wherewith being in love, they are unwilling to
part. 3. Laying duties upon them which they have no minde to stoop
to, but count it a being tyed, and shortened to yield obedience to the
same, which is indeed the main reason, and true cause: If it were
not for such and such things, will they say, we would you should
know, we would be as forward as the best: Well, let us, as many as
have been thus foolish, learn to be wiser, and devise no blocks:
No, though we meet with some things otherwise then ought to be, let
not that make us fall out with Religion. In worldly things people be
so eager, as if they have a minde to a thing, its no small matter shall
beat them off, as from a Lease, Farm, Purchase, or Bargain; but in
Heavenly things, not a cause, but a shadow of a cause will keep
men back: O how happy might we be here in <hi>England</hi> and in these
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65522:146"/>
parts, if we were wise, that have the Gospel so graciously Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto us: Many Nations have it not, and they cannot be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
and we have it, and yet through our own froward hearts,
deprive our selves of the benefit thereof: If we have been weak,
lets labor to be strengthened against these, and lift up our feet over
these logs that the World layeth in our way, neither rest we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
therewith, as too many are. In our ordinary ways, if any
Lewd and Drunken Companions in the Night should tumble
Logs, or lay stumbling Blocks to stop our passage by horse or
foot, we finde great fault, and that justly; but we are content to
have Logs laid in our Spiritual way, lest we should be happy: And
lets labor to strengthen others, and help them over, and let none
of us be any longer hindred hereby, much less let there be a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
heart in any of us, to lay them in others way to hinder
them, but go on our selves roundly in the way to Salvation, and help
as many others forward as possibly we can: Notwithstanding these
lets, we must not be loth to enter this way, but labor to bring our
hearts to this, to see and confess, and forsake our sins, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in every thing to be ruled by the Word: And what thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
owe we God, that have passed over these Blocks, and
are in our way to Heaven, whereas so few scape them? It was of
him alone. O pray we him to help us also against all those that yet
remain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being disobedient,]</hi> Here he proceeds to shew the bad estate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
They are disobedient to the Word of God, which is given
them for a rule and light to guide them to Salvation: And this is
indeed the very Reason of their much stumbling at the Word,
because men have no minde to be ruled by it; They think it tyes
them too short, therefore they have no minde to stoop to it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are willing to take any occasion against it: for if men had
a minde, its not those idle pretences should keep them from it, as
in worldly things we see. The lesson we learn from hence is,
That</p>
                  <p>God hath therefore left his Word amongst us,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> not that we should
onely hear it,<note place="margin">Gods Word is therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on us, that we may be guided thereby.</note> or make an outward profession thereof, but that we
should take it as our Rule and Law to guide us, and in all things
make Conscience to yield obedience thereto; what it forbids to
count as a cursed thing; what it commands, to esteem as holy and
good, and necessary to be obeyed: This is that which God evermore
requireth in his charges. This keeping is not a Legal Observation,
which no flesh can attain (Christ hath fulfilled that perfectly for us) but
an Evangelical,<note place="margin">How we are to obey the same.</note> which is, when believing in him that hath done it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6.</note>
we do our unfeined endeavor constantly to be obedient thereto;
and that 1. In one thing as in another,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 6.</note> having with <hi>David, Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> respect to all. 2. Freely, and not by constraint;
not as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> let <hi>Israel</hi> go. 3. Not outwardly, but inwardly with
the heart and minde, ayming at Gods glory. 4. Constantly, and
to the end: Yet more particularly, 1. We must not give good words
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65522:147"/>
onely, but follow Christ, as the Apostles, who forthwith at his call
left all to wait on him. 2. Our obedience must be shaped after
Christs, willing in all things to do Gods will, as do also the Saints
and Angels in Heaven. 3. It must be like <hi>Abrahams;</hi> as he left
his Country and all when God called, contrary to all temptations,
and that readily and simply, without reasoning or indenting; so
must we forsake our sins, though never so natural, and never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
it thus, Its my nature, my Predecessers have done so, I have
been long accustomed hereto; He left his Countrey so natural
to him, and that in his age: We must obey against all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Profit, Pleasure, Ease, Father, Mother, Wife, Children,
though all these hang about our necks, we must yet readily obey.
4. Throughly, not as the Devils, who if they must needs out
of the man, yet would tarry in the coast: The obedience of the
wicked, is like their Fathers the Devil, its but in part; as the
Devil entred into the Swine, so they will tarry in some sin:
They say (as the Olive and Fig Tree in <hi>Jothams</hi> Parable)
<hi>Shall I leave my Fatness?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 9, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall I forsake my Sweetness?</hi> Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 22.</note>
Deceit, Lying, Fornication, Adultery, and the like? so
must not we,<note place="margin">Deut. 6. 1.</note> we must be doers of the Word; All other duties
do but tend to practise, which is the end and perfection
of all.</p>
                  <p>1. God is our Soveraign Lord and King,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> and we be his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and these his Laws, and by these means doth he speak to
us, gives every body leave to read his Laws and Statutes, yea,
requires it,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> and besides, sets Expounders thereof: This is the Word
of GOD, This is the minde of GOD, He that despiseth this,
despiseth GOD himself; This Bible shall save or condemn
the World, and by this we shall all be judged: He being our
Soveraign, and we such poor Worms, we should count it our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to obey.</p>
                  <p>2. He is exceeding bountiful towards us,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> he who both gave us life,
and continues to maintain it by so many mercies, which all ought to
binde us; neither doth he thus for us, to strenghthen us to rebel and
fight against him, but to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>3. His will is a perfect rule of Righteousness,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> and he doth not first
see a thing good, and then wills it and commands it, but first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it and wills it, and so it becomes good: Whatsoever is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this, is holy and good; whatsoever is contrary to this, is
wicked, and to be abandoned.</p>
                  <p>4. All creatures in heaven and earth obey:<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> The Sun runs his course
ordinarily that God set it at first, and slacketh not; and not so onely,
but if it be put out of course, it resisteth not: If he bid it stand still,
it doth;<note place="margin">Ios. 10. 12.</note> if he bid it come back, it doth: He appoints the Sea to
flow,<note place="margin">Isa. 38. 8.</note> and it doth; but if he bid it stand up, and let his people
pass, it obeyeth, and stands as two Brazen Walls; so when
he sets it on work, it rageth to toss <hi>Jonah,</hi> and whom God will;
and when he bids it and the winds be still, they obey, as to our
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65522:147"/>
Savior:<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 13.</note> He commanded the east wind to bring in the Locusts, and
another wind to carry them out; how much more then should we
obey, that ought to be best of all, being Lords of the rest, and all
they to serve us? Summer and Winter obey the Lords Word, and
why not we? These may rise up against us.</p>
                  <p>5. Obedience exceedingly pleaseth,<note place="margin">Reas. 5.</note> all else is to no purpose, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 22.</note>
burning of Incense, observation of Feasts or Fasts, &amp;c. <hi>Unto
the wicked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 3.</note> saith God, <hi>What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that
thou shouldest take my Covenant in thy mouth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm 50. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>seeing thou hatest instruction,
and casteth my words behinde thee?</hi> Nay, its so far from pleasing him,
as it incenseth and provoketh him, <hi>He that turns away his ear from the
cry of the poor, shall himself cry unto the Lord, but not be heard; They are
blessed that hear the Word and keep it; If ye know these things,</hi> saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
<hi>happy are ye if ye do them;</hi> yea, such as do the will of God, he
accounts as his Mother, Brethren and Sisters; by this we may know
that we are the Lords:<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 1.</note> This also opens the storehouses of all Gods
blessings, and musles the mouthes of all the Creatures, that they can
do us no hurt.</p>
                  <p>6. Disobedience is that which hath ever troubled the world:<note place="margin">Reas. 6.</note> At
first in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> it put all out of course, and so hath done ever
since: This is the cause of all Evils, Plague, Pestilence, Famine, and
the like,<note place="margin">Lev. 26. 16.</note> yea, of the increase and continuance of those and others
more grievous;<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 15.</note> yea, this is that which brought all Judgements, not
onely upon <hi>Israel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 4. 3.</note> but upon all the world, and that which sends men
to eternal confusion.</p>
                  <p>1. This is an exceeding comfort to all those whose hearts the
Lord hath inclined,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> bowed, and humbled, to be obedient to his will
in all things, and that have no greater grief, then that they can obey
no better,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 25.</note> but glad when they can obey, and most, when best; let
these know, its a brand of Christs sheep, and mark that they love
God, that they are of the blessed ones, that hearing, also obey, that
they shall never fall,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 24.</note> as being built on the rock: This is a certain band
to tye the Lord to you,<note place="margin">Ier. 7. 23.</note> he can fail you of no good thing; <hi>Obey my
voyce</hi> (saith he) <hi>and I will be your God;</hi> yea, and a certain assurance of
eternal life, is gained by obeying: Herein continue and encrease your
care, its perfect freedom it brings, sound and true comfort here and
hereafter; when they that disobey, have a corrasive and gnawing
Conscience.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemns all sorts of disobedient persons,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> which are many;
and this is the reason that Hell is fuller then Heaven, because so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that are set to cross God; what he commands, they will none of it,

to any; who will not learn Gods ways, but with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> say, <hi>Who

is the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Do these poor woful creatures know what they do?
alas no; Knowest thou with whom thou hast to do, and against
whom thou rebellest? against the Lord of Heaven and earth, that
made the world, that toucheth the mountains, and they smoke, that
thundereth with his voyce: But who art thou that strivest with thy
maker, that darest rebel against thy Soveraign, who is able to cast
thee into the Jail of Hell for ever and ever? O consider this you
that forget God,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 22. &amp; 9. 17. &amp; 11. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>The wicked shall be turned into Hell, upon the wicked
God will rain snares and fire, &amp;c.</hi> Dost thou think to speed better then
thy Predecessors? <hi>Adam</hi> was cast out of Paradise, the old world

could not hold it out, nor <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> nor <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> nor <hi>Herod,</hi>
dost thou think to get any thing by wrestling with thy maker, by
casting out thy gantler, and as it were bidding battel to the Lord? O
therefore humble thy self on thy face, fall flat at his footstool, and
crave pardon, send out messengers of Peace, and submit thy self,
saying, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou that I shall do?</hi> obey and that gladly, or
else he will lay thee where thou shalt have small joy, yea, he will make
thee obey in spight of thine heart: There will come a voyce that thou
shalt nor resist, <hi>Go ye cursed of my Father;</hi> and if thou wouldst bring
thy minde to obey, thou shouldst finde it every way thy safest course,
thou shouldest save not onely thy soul which is the greatest, but even
thy body, thy good name, thy goods; for how have many by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Word, saved hundreds and thousands this way, that they
began to waste, and others do? How do many bring untimely death
upon themselves by wretched courses? How many do the gallows
catch in a year? how many stab'd, and dye fearfully, which might
have lived long, if they would have been ruled? Innumerable sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
do men bring upon themselves, for want of obedience to God
and his Word, which that would save them from: At least if thou
wilt not obey throughly, and in all things, yet come into some civil
order and course, so shalt thou at least if thou beest not saved, yet
have the less torment in Hell.</p>
                  <p>2. Civil persons,<note place="margin">The meerly civil.</note> which disobey both commandments of the
Gospel, do neither believe nor repent; and for the Law, they do some
duties to men, but of the first Table make small Conscience, nay
they have no skill, neither savor of the spiritual maner of performing
duties: What talk they of giving every man his due, when they
give God no part of his as they should? or of keeping promise with
men, if they shall break their vow with God?</p>
                  <p>3. Ignorant persons of all kindes,<note place="margin">The ignorant.</note> as the Heathens, that worship
they know not what; and Papists, that toil themselves about their
will-worship, how good soever their meaning may be, yet they do not
that which God commands; yea, numbers among ourselves, that either
have or might have the means, but neglecting them pull in their heads.</p>
                  <p>4. Hypocrites,<note place="margin">Hypocrites.</note> that obey in some things, yea some in many, and
go far, yet either never digged deep, and laid a foundation sure, or

3. This may be for instruction to us all,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> especially that profess the
fear of God, that throughout our whole course, and in all our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
we cast this with our selves, not what our profit, or our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or our minde saith, but what the Word of God saith: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
Christians, and will bring comfort, and will prove the surest
way at long run: we must not (following our own reason and conceits)
cast off and disobey the Word; we think it may be better thus and
thus, or hope its no great matter, or that its but once: O take heed!
This cost <hi>Saul</hi> dear;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 26.</note> He would go offer Sacrifice, He said he was
bold, so he was indeed, as we many times; But take heed of being
bold with the Word, and taking leave of sin, though but for once:
Thou knowest not what that once may cost thee: To Travel on the
Lords day hath many fair pretences, but what evils hath ensued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?
So Usury is a hasty way to get gain, but fair and soft goes far,
What if we get much, and put it in a bottomless purse, and God
blow on it and melt it? One man gets slowly in his Office and Trade,
because he dares not lye, Dissemble, break the Sabbath: Others care
for nothing, and they grow rich apace; with the one it holds, and
his Children enjoy it, and he dyeth with Peace and Credit, but the
other dyeth with disgrace and a guilty Conscience, and God scatters
that he hath; for God will take pity of the honest labors of men,
and give of the fruit thereof to their Posterity, but no pity of that
which was got with the price of his glory: Hereby many a man
loseth soul and all. So many a man seeth not into some one thing
(who is otherwise good) and so haply is too hard to his workfolks,
will make bold now and then with the Sabbath, &amp;c. though his soul
be faved, yet God sets the print of his hand on him in some outward
affliction, Body, Goods, Children, and the like.</p>

other interpretations) by the consent of the soundest, is the plain
meaning of the words; and I come not to tell you what men say,

Salvation, so hath he some to stumble and come to destruction,
which are the two parts of Predestination: This is that most holy
and just decree of God, whereby he hath in himself eternally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably

                     <hi>He doth all according to the counsel of his own will:</hi>
The means of effecting this are, the creation of man in innocency,
and the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was also of him decreed: It hath these
two parts, Election and Reprobation; for though it be put some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the one onely,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 31.</note> as for Election, yet is it common to
both.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine will appear both lawful and meet, to be taught
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65522:149"/>
upon these grounds;<note place="margin">Whether it be lawful and meet to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods decree.</note> 1. Whatsoever is written, is written for our
learning, and the whole Scripture is profitable to teach, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

ought to be taught. 3. Its of very great use to the people of God, their

assaults,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 27.</note> even the unchangeableness of Gods counsel.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> 4. The holy

of their Epistles.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> 5. Many Errors have been broached about this
Doctrine,<note place="margin">Iude, verse 4.</note> by Satan and men of corrupt judgement, whereof the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Treatise speaketh in his Epistle.</p>

If I be elect, I shall be saved, let me do as I list; and if I be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>What if some take hurt by this Doctrine,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> shall it not therefore be
Preached? What Doctrine almost can be taught, but mans vile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and heart will take occasion by it of ill? as of Gods mercy,
whereupon men wax bold and secure, shall not the Doctrine of Gods
mercy be taught?<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 1.</note> so of Christian liberty, (which was the reason of
those preventions which the Apostles used) so of the Doctrine of
Justification by Faith onely;<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> yea, Christ himself is a stumbling stone
and rock of offence, Shall he therefore not be Preached? Its not
the fault of the Doctrine, but their own wicked corruption, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
malice, that turn holy and wholesom things to hurt; as a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick
stomack doth good meat into ill juyce; and the Spiders gather
poyson from the same flowers from which the Bees gather honey,
Do we therefore wish there were no flowers? Shall the Childrens
bread be kept from them, because some unruly Servants will riot
and abuse it? Shall the use of a Knife or a Sword be denyed to all
sober men, because a mad man will hurt himself and others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?
The wicked do abuse the Word and Sacraments and all to
their hurt, Shall therefore the people of God be deprived of them?
as the Papists do most wretchedly keep away the Scriptures from the
people, lest they should read them: The like may be said of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Doctrine, But who are they that take hurt? even such as
would take hurt, and perish though this were not: But one of Gods
people is more to be respected, then ninety and nine that care for no
goodness: And this is of great use to the people of God; It stays
them well when they see great professors fall away, else they should
ever be in a slavish fear, and so it makes the true servants of God go
on comfortably, and strengthens them in all persecutions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
that they shall never fall finally.</p>
                  <p>It makes men bold and secure,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> because they know they can never fall
away.</p>
                  <p>Not at all,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but the more careful to please God; for they know
they may fall dangerously, and that holds them in awe with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of Gods love together: It further stirs up men to labor to get
marks of Election to themselves: Its also a matter of great thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to God, that having passed by so many, he hath had mercy on
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65522:149"/>
us; so that its profitable to more then its hurtful to: It comforts
many, What if some stumble when they have no cause? Yea, its
matter of Humiliation, that Gods grace, not our goodness is the first
cause of our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>It will make men shake off the use of all means,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> and say, What need is
there of Sermons and Exhortations, if the number be appointed who shall
be saved, and who damned?</p>
                  <p>What are they but desperate and wilful persons that will so do?<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
that will neglect the means, because they know the end is certain and
unchangeable? we fear not to teach men Gods Ordination in other
things, as that he hath set the period of mans life, which he cannot
pass; yet this doth not make men neglect their meat, nor desperately
make them cast themselves from the tops of houses, or run upon a
naked Sword, because their time is appointed; therefore we may
teach it, provided it be taught modestly, and according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures:
But its Sacriligious modesty to keep back this or any part of
Gods counsel; this were to be wise above God and the Scriptures:
the Papists have a number of such carnal conceits, which shew they be
not led by God. If a King should give unto any of his subjects a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mannor, and appoint by what way he should go to it, would not he
be willing to learn the way? accordingly should we in this particular.</p>
                  <p>For the Doctrine it self, consider we briefly four things, which
are most material for the edifying of the Consciences of them that
are desirous to learn the minde of God herein, wherein I will rather
endeavor to shew the truth and some uses thereof, then by entring into
curious questions to please itching ears, or to stand long in confuting
the contrary errors; The first is this, That</p>
                  <p>God hath ordained some to destruction:<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> This appears by plain
places of Scripture which cannot be avoided,<note place="margin">God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained some to destruction.</note> as <hi>Rom. 9. 17. For this
same purpose have I raised thee up, &amp;c.</hi> Jude, verse 4. <hi>Who were before of
old ordained to this condemnation, &amp;c.</hi> So for Election, we have <hi>Eph.
1. 4. 1 Thess. 5. 9. 2 Thess. 2. 13. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 12. Now there is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
reason of contraries; If he chose some, then he refused others;
If he had taken all, then no Election; If not all, then some refused:
And if the Lord ordained those whom he Elected to eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Did he not then ordain the other to destruction whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
or left he them at uncertainty? Things fall not out at adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but according to Gods Decree and Eternal counsel, What
wise Workman doth not propound an end to himself,<note place="margin">Acts 4. 28.</note> ere he begin
his work? and think we the Lord did not determine the final state of
all men?<note place="margin">See <hi>Willet</hi> on Rom 9. 11. <hi>pag.</hi> 4. 16.</note> Yes; ere he went about the making of a world he decreed
the least matters, therefore much more this.</p>
                  <p>1. This confuteth that erroneous platform of the Papists and others,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
which defend universal grace:<note place="margin">See <hi>Perkins</hi> 3, on the Creed and Pred.</note> This makes the will of God (which
is the high and soveraign cause of all) to be subject to mans will;
whereas its said,<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatsoever he will, he doth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But is not the Lord slow to anger and of great kindeness,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and how can
this be,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> having ordained most men to damnation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:65522:150"/>
That's true,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> yet makes it nothing against this. 1. Its true of the
godly, but he is severe towards the wicked; Both <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi>
sinned, yet was the former punisht severely, the latter pardoned:
Neither is he so slow to wrath, but that he is also just (many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of either might be instanced) and is as much honored in the one
as in the other.<note place="margin">See Nah. 1. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>7.</note> 2. Its true also in part of the wicked, for its of his
patience towards them, that they live and enjoy so many of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
in such abundance, with the Gospel, and that he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
them at once, who yet provoke him highly every day.</p>
                  <p>Its said in Ezekiel,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in
the death of the wicked,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 11.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He doth not delight thereat,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> as its the destruction of the creature,
but as its a mean to set forth his glory; For he aimed not at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
and ruine of his creature in his Decree, but at a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
end, even his own glory. Besides, God wills many things
which yet he delights not in, as the afflictions of his servants at the
hands of ungodly men.<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snels</hi> Sermon of this point.</note> As good and merciful Judges, they delight
not in the blood and pains of them that are Executed and by them
condemned, which yet must be for the defence of the good, the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off and terror of the bad.</p>
                  <p>God will have all men to be saved.<note place="margin">Obj.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its to be understood of all kindes of men in this last age of the
world,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> by the means of Christ Jesus.<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord is not willing that any should perish,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The wicked mocked at Gods promises,<note place="margin">2 Per. 3. 9.</note> and the godly began to
think long;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> therefore the Apostle sets himself (and that's the scope
of the place) to comfort the faithful: So this place <hi>of all men to come
to repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Rev. 6. 11.</note> is meant of the Elect only. <hi>Is patient towards us,</hi> saith
the Text, shewing that God defers not of forgetfulness, but because
he waits till the rest of the Elect uncalled and unborn be added, and
then it shall come at the just appointed time: Its not deferred that all
men should be saved, for then it should never come, for all men shall
not be saved, but for the Elect onely.</p>
                  <p>If God hath ordained most men to destruction,<note place="margin">Object.</note> then is his justice greater
then his mercy.</p>
                  <p>We must not measure his justice and mercy by the number of the
one or of the other;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for if there had been but one onely saved, it had
been as great mercy, as his justice in condemning the rest: for if but
one had been saved, it must have cost the death of the Lord Jesus,
such was our misery. Now what a mercy it was, that the eternal
Son of God, equal with the Father, and in whom he was well pleased,
should not onely abase himself to our nature, but to our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
yea, to sorrows, and great indignities, nay, to death, yea,
a cursed death: O who can express this love! It was a wonder he did
not rather suffer us all to perish, then his Son to endure the least of
these!</p>
                  <p>Then he hath ordained the means of their condemnation,<note place="margin">Object.</note> namely, sin, and
so is the Author of sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:65522:150"/>
True, he ordained and decreed that there should be sin in the
world, as he did of the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> but not as is sin and evil,
but as whereby and out of which God draws glory to himself: and
it was necessary that there should he evil in the world, as well as good,
that a way might be made for setting out Gods mercy in pardoning
some, and his justice in punishing it in others, but so as the Lord is
no way faulty: He ordained willingly to permit it, as it hath respect
of good in it, but as no actor of it: He put no evil in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any
man, but onely willingly permitted his fall, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. This should and may stay our mindes,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> when we see any great
Professors, and men of excellent parts fall away: Its no other, then
that an Hypocrite, and one that never was sound nor elect of God, is
now discovered; and let none that can prove their election be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
troubled, onely walk reverently, but never be dismaid with
deadly fear: They fell, because they were not elect, and you being
elect, shall be therefore sure to stand: and thus our Savior comforts
his Disciples,<note place="margin">See 1 Ioh. 2. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>That none was lost but Judas, who was the son of perdition;</hi>
so did <hi>Paul</hi> the Christians, notwithstanding the revolting of <hi>Hyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,
Philetus, Alexander,</hi> &amp;c. If it were not for this, what a deadly
fear might this breed in weak Christians, to see those so far their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
in knowledge and gifts to fall away. Thus of the first.</p>
                  <p>The second is this,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> That</p>
                  <p>This was of his own will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">This was of his own will, and for no cause out of himself.</note> and for no cause out of himself; for the
Lord infinite in wisdom and holiness, needs not as man to fetch the
reason of his purposes forth of himself: <hi>He will have mercy on whom
he will have mercy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 15.</note> and whom he will he hardneth; He doth all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the counsel of his own will.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it not said,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> O Israel, thy destruction is of thy self; and, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveth
not is condemned; and, Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish.</p>
                  <p>Cursed be the mouth that saith not so,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> even that every mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is of himself, and his own just desert; but we must put a
difference between the decree of God, and the execution of it; God
condemneth no man upon his bare will, but his own just desert: Sin
comes in between the decree of God, and the execution of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
as the cause of Damnation.</p>
                  <p>If then it be asked,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> Why is any man condemned?</p>
                  <p>For his sin.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why did God decree to condemn any?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because he would.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> As no man is saved but by Faith in Christ, and
Sanctification of life (which yet is not the cause why God appointed
him to Salvation, but because he would) so there's none condemned
but for his sin; yet God ordained him not thereto because of sin, but
because of his own will.</p>
                  <p>If any ask further,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> and why would he?</p>
                  <p>That a note too high for man or angel to sing,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but there in humility
we must rest, and not put the Lord to render a reason of all his decrees
or doings, which even princes will not do to their subjects: he raised
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65522:151"/>
up <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp;c. even because he would get glory out of him, and
by his means.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the Opinion of foreseen works,<note place="margin">Use.</note> good or bad, as
of this, because he foresaw some would be bad, and refuse grace, he
therefore Reprobated them, &amp;c. but God loved <hi>Jacob</hi> and hated
<hi>Esau,</hi> not onely before the had done good or evil, but before there
was any thinking of good or ill: If foreseen sin be the cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
then on the contrary, foreseen grace of Election; but
the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> sheweth the contrary hereof:<note place="margin">See Eph. 1. 4. &amp; 2. 11.</note> Faith and
Sanctification followeth upon Election, as fruits thereof, therefore
go not before as any causes; so do Infidelity and impenitency fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after Reprobation: If foreseen sin had been the cause of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,<note place="margin">Iohn 9. 3.</note>
then we should all have been refused, for he could not
see us, but all sinners: But as the blinde man was not so born for
his own or Parents sin, but that the work of God in curing him
by a Word might be seen, so was it in this business. Thus of the
second.</p>
                  <p>The third is this,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> That</p>
                  <p>The Lord hath done this most justly:<note place="margin">The Lord hath done this most justly.</note> His will is a rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and he can do nothing but most holily and justly; <hi>Is there
unrighteousness with God?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>God forbid;</hi> Though we cannot see into the
justness of it, yet we ought to acknowledge it: The Sun may shine,
and that brightly too, though a blinde man see it not: Man was made
holy, and having free-will, by his willing sin lost his state, and still
sins willingly.</p>
                  <p>It seems cruelty in the Lord to appoint most part of mankinde to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He did it not,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> as ayming at their Damnation, but at his own glory,
which is more to be regarded then all the World: <hi>And shall the
Clay say against the Potter, Why hast thou made me thus,</hi> and thus?
may not he do as he list? So may not the Lord get glory by his own
creatures which way he will? And do men for their pleasure hunt
the Hare and Partridge, or kill, not onely Flyes, and baser creatures,
but also Fowls with their grins, in like maner appointing Sheep,
Oxen, &amp;c. for the slaughter, and shall not the Lord have as much
Soveraignty over men, the work of his hands? we cannot make a
Fly or Flea; yea, its more reason that the Lord should be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
if he would, with the Damnation of all mankinde, then that
the killing of a Hare, nay a Fly, should serve to the honor or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the greatest Potentate of the world: What if he had ordained
none to Salvation, who had had cause to complain? Besides, with
what patience bears he with them, and their blaspheming of him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day? What marvellous benefits, and comfortable good things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
he upon them, houses, lands, wealth, health, peace, who might
destroy and send them to hell at the first?<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>He suffers the Vessels of
wrath with patience.</hi> Thus though there had been no sin in the
World, God might justly have appointed most men to Damnation,
and cast them away also for his glory; but now God doth not cast any
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65522:151"/>
man away, but for his own willing falling away, and sin, for he
made man Righteous, but now sin comes in, and for this is every one
condemned, that is condemned. Besides, is God cruel to them? He
never makes their finger ake, till they have deserved Hell, never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dmns
man or woman, till they have deserved it a thousand times,
and in the mean time ceaseth not to bestow manifold blessings on
them.</p>
                  <p>But as it were tyranny in a King to appoint many of his Subjects to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon his will,<note place="margin">Object.</note> so were it in God, said a Papist.</p>
                  <p>Its a most unequal comparison;<note place="margin">Solut.</note> they be not the Kings creatures,
though his Subjects committed to him to rule, not as he will, but as
God commands; but God hath power, because they be his creatures.
As if a Potter having made many pots, commits them to a servant
to be looked to, if he burst any of them, at his peril he doth it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be not his own, but if the owner should break any, who
shall blame him?</p>
                  <p>But its partiality in God,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and respect of persons, to take some, and refuse
others, being all equally guilty, and in estate without difference.</p>
                  <p>Not so;<note place="margin">Solut.</note> respect of persons is, when many being in one case, one
is preferr'd: For what? for something in their own person; as a
Judge having two Malefactors equally guilty, executes the one, and
spares the other, because he is his Kinsman, Countreyman, &amp;c. But
a Prince hath two Traytors equally deserving death, and he without
respect, but because he will, pardons one, and cuts off the other,
as it may be <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did by his Butler and Baker; or a man hath two
Debtors, and without respect he requires it all of the one, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives
all to the other, Who shall let a man so to do? This is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons: But if a man be to adopt a Childe out of five or six,
and chooseth one, because he is Witty, Fair, Proper, &amp;c. this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons; but so it is not in the Lord, for he respects nothing in
them that he elected, nor in the other, but because he would. Thus
of the third.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is this,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> That</p>
                  <p>The Lord hath done this unchangeably.<note place="margin">The Lord hath done this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably.</note> Those that are ordained to
destruction, cannot possibly be saved, as it is not possible for the elect
to be deceived:<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note> The foundation of the Lord remaineth sure, His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
are as himself,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> without alteration; for if it should be otherwise,
it must needs be, either that he seeth further now, and so wanted wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or that he is inconstant, whereof to think but a thought were
blasphemous, or else that he were over-ruled by some power which
he could not resist, which were as horrible. <hi>Balaam</hi> could say, <hi>That
God was not like man, that he should lye or repent:</hi> It seemeth to us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as though God did change, as in <hi>Nineveh</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> but its
not so, for though he concealed it, the threatnings were conditional:
His secret will is ever the same, firm and fast, and no contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
it and his revealed will, though there may seem so to be; yet not
so, as if Gods decree put a necessity upon man of offending: for as
<hi>Adam,</hi> so every man sins willingly without constraint, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65522:152"/>
Gods decree bindes to a necessity of condemnation, but
mans sin comes in of his own will: O the infinite and unsearchable
wisdom and righteousness of God!</p>
                  <p>Seeing they whom God hath ordained to destruction can never be
saved (who yet may be enlightened,<note place="margin">Use.</note> go far, and have many gifts and
outward benefits) we should never be quiet nor sleep good sleep till
we can prove we are no Reprobates: O its a most fearful state, able
to make the heart ake, yea, the thought of it to torment a man;
therefore we must labor to know we are not such: Hence is that of
the Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Examine your selves, whether ye be in the faith: prove your

at Christ and at the Word, upon occasion pickt, as we see in this
Text. So Apostacy, impenitent living in any known sin, especially
after much warning and means, hatred of Gods servants, hardness of
heart, security, and the like. Now is it not fearful that men can go on,
and are not troubled about this? that they can carry their black marks
about them, and yet be merry? O fearful and desperate mirth! If
one should be condemned to be hang'd drawn and quartered, and had
an iron hang'd on him as a mark of it, and were let go up and down for
a few days, if he were merry and jocund, what would we say?
yet thus doth the world: O awaken your selves! Doth not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

have!<note place="margin">See Mat. 7. 22.</note> I tell you they may go far, and have so gone, therefore look
well about you: A number have not gone so far as a number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
(in Knowledge, Utterance, Profession, hearing the Word
with joy, reverence to the Preachers thereof, Reformation in many
things, &amp;c.) who yet think well of themselves: O fearful, that men

Faith, true and particular, and Sanctification throughout, make a
man a Christian; this an Hyprocrite hath not: So an humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
heart, a vehement longing after Christ, an high prizing of him, a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65522:152"/>
vehement desire to turn to God in all things; these an Hypocrite
hath not.</p>

so be whatsoever I do; Ile never hear Sermon more while I live, for
all the Sermons of the world will not help me, if I be ordained to Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>O the folly and falshood of this blinde and desperate rage!<note place="margin">Solut.</note> Its
not possible for him that is ordained to life to live as he list: If thou
give thy self so to do, thou hast then indeed a mark to thy self of thy
Damnation; yea, what a desperate wretch is he to resolve himself
to live like a reprobate, before he know whether he be one or no?
as if one should run to the gallows, and put the rope about his neck,
before he know whether the Judge hath any purpose to condemn
him. Again, know you not that whom God ordains to the end, he
ordains also to the means? Therefore these must be used. As for
Gods decree towards you, the Preacher knoweth not, therefore he
must preach and call all to Repentance; neither do you know, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must you hear and follow the revealed will of God, and by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, you shall in time come to know his secret will: We must
not live by the secret, but by the revealed will of God; and we must
not stand upon that desperately and blindely at first, If I be ordained,
&amp;c. but meekly hear the will of God in his Word, which being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of us, it will be in time an Argument that we not are onely
no Reprobates,<note place="margin">See a Sermon of Mr. <hi>New-house,</hi> on 1 Thess. 5. the Epistle to the Reader.</note> but such as are ordained to Salvation: But if thou
wilt desperately shake off the revealed will, and onely run upon the

sin and means of destruction, then thou hast a bad sign of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Whoso stumbleth at Christ, and at the Word, and live in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,

as if he should have said, They stumbled, because they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

Thus he comforts them, and reckons up a number of priviledges,
whereof Gods election was the ground; <hi>as, that they were a royal priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,

<hi>You a royal priesthood,</hi> they a prophane and base company; <hi>You an holy
nation,</hi> they (whether Gentiles or Jews) an unholy company; <hi>You a
peculiar people,</hi> they the servants of sin and Satan: Then sets down the
end of all.</p>
                  <p>In general observe we two things,<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That the Apostle not onely divides the people into good and bad,<note place="margin">Ministers must speak comfortably to the good, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to the bad.</note>
and sends the Sheep to their fold, the Fox to his den, but he speaks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
comfortably to the good, exceeding terribly to the wicked;
setting forth the ones happiness, and the others misery; and so must
the Ministers of God do.</p>
                  <p>2. That he delivers the Word so warily,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> that the godly might
not be dismaid at the threatnings against the wicked:<note place="margin">They are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to deliver the Word, that each may take his due porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Hence may
Ministers learn wisdom, to give every one their portion; and this is
to divide the Word aright, to cut and part it, not to rend it. Thus
the Prophets having vehemently threatned, by and by, lest the godly
should be cast down, adde comforts and promises: When they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
comforts, they must bid the wicked stand off; so when they
speak of judgements, they must so speak, that the afflicted in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may not be troubled, for people are ready to misapply that they
hear: Wicked men when they catch hold of the Doctrine of Gods
mercy, they snatch that which no way belongs to them; and for
humble ones in affliction of Conscience, Oh, all terrible things they
can apply, and they work on them, but the promises and comforts they
cannot fasten on.</p>
                  <p>In particular consider we the priviledges here mentioned, and the
end of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A chosen generation,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What election is.</note> This is the first priviledge. Election is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of God, whereby in himself, and for his own glory, he hath
unchangeably ordained some men to Salvation and life Eternal:
Where consider,</p>
                  <p>1. That God before the world hath ordained some men to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
This is plain from these Scriptures,<note place="margin">God before the world hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained some men to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>Luke 10. 20. Eph. 1. 4. Phil.
2. 12. 1 Thess. 5. 9. 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 13. His election is compared to a Book,
and the Lord to a General, that books his Soldiers names, or a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
where they book all the Freemens names. Again, we see
some men be saved, therefore were it so decreed; for whatsoever is,
was eternally decreed of God.</p>
                  <p>1. This sets out the infinite love of God to mankinde,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> who might
have been glorified in the Damnation of us all.</p>
                  <p>2. This confutes that Opinion,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> That God elected none before the
World, but that he generally appointed all to be saved alike, and
therefore gave Christ to dye for all, and when any receive grace,
then God elects them: Doth every wise man set down certainly his
end, before he begin his work? and onely the God of Wisdom go
uncertainly to work? And did Christ lay down his life for any other
but his sheep? vouchsafeth he intercession for any other? nay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
he not all others? If Christ had dyed for them, then they
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65522:153"/>
should have been saved, for his death is infinitely meritorious: If
he dyed for any, and they not be saved, he should miss of his
purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ are two common persons,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and roots; therefore as <hi>Adam</hi>
lost all, so Christ restored all.</p>
                  <p>They are indeed alike in many respects,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> as namely in this, That they
communicate to others that which was in themselves; <hi>Adam,</hi> sin, and
death; Christ, righteousness and life, but not to both alike: <hi>Adam</hi>
lost all, Christ recovered but some.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Adams</hi> sin was of more force then Christs death and obedience.<note place="margin">Obj.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not so,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for its easier to destroy, then to build: If Christ had saved
but one, it had argued more force then <hi>Adams</hi> sin to destroy all: A
childe can break a glass, which all the men in the Town cannot make
up again, yet the childe hath not more force then they.</p>
                  <p>Why then is Christ preached to them?<note place="margin">Obj.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Christ must be offered to all,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for we know not who they be for
whom Christ dyed; let us take knowledge of Gods Ordinance, all
be not saved, for there is no Election where all are taken. Besides,
if he did Elect all, and all be not saved (as we know they are not)
then is God hindred of his will,<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 3. &amp; 135. 6.</note> which were impious to imagine: He
doth whatsoever he will, and man cannot over-rule his will.</p>
                  <p>2. That the cause why God ordained some men to Salvation,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> was,<note place="margin">The cause hereof was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would</note>
because he would; <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> saith he, <hi>on whom I will have mercy;</hi>
Its according to the good pleasure of his will, nothing out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 15.</note>
He saves no man but by faith in Christ and new obedience,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5.</note> but
this was not the cause of Election, but the will of God onely; for we
must put a difference between the Decree of God and the execution
thereof.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes that opinion of foreseen Faith and Works;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Faith
and Sanctification are the consequents of Election,<note place="margin">See Eph. 1. 4. and 2. 10.</note> and not any thing
precedent: God could not see any difference between men, that some
would of their own accord receive grace, believe and obey; for there
is no such thing in our nature, we are all alike: And could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lord as well chuse men to Salvation freely before the World, as
in the World to bestow grace upon them, denying it to others:
and hereof not mans Salvation, but his own glory is the further
end.</p>
                  <p>2. This ought to binde us to thankfulness and duty to God for ever,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
that of Free grace hath loved us, and to walk humbly before him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
nothing in our selves but wretchedness, and that all our

<hi>By grace we are saved.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>3. That the number of Elect is small;<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> 
                     <hi>Many called, few chosen:</hi>
Christ calls his <hi>A little flock</hi> that shall have the Kingdom.<note place="margin">The number of the Elect small.</note> True, by
themselves they are numberless: The true Israel of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
that already are,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 14.</note> or hereafter to be gathered by the Preaching of
Christ and the Gospel,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 32.</note> is to man without count,<note place="margin">Rev. 7. 4.</note> yet if compared to
the wicked,<note place="margin">Hosea 1. 17.</note> they are onely an handful: As may appear before Christ,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65522:154"/>
when onely the little handful of the Jews was Gods Church, and
among them most Hypocrices and Idolators, few true worshippers of
God: Since Christs coming, and at this time, what vast Nations
know not Christ? What a breadth under Antichrist, that know him
corruptly? and among our selves that have him truly Preached, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Word and Sacraments, yet how few believe and obey, and
have the inward calling which should make Election known? And its
certain and determined, the number can be made neither less nor
more.</p>
                  <p>How ought this to whet on our care and diligence to know our
selves of this number?<note place="margin">Use.</note> That which all have, no man greatly esteems;
but that which few have, most strive after, as Wealth, Honor, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
&amp;c. so should we in this: If of Twenty Traitors a Pardon were
but for six, what earnestness would be in all to know whether they
were of that small number? Is it not therefore fearful to see how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
the world is, that this being so, yet so few lay it to heart, but
rather are so secure, as if very few were appointed to miss of Salvation,
and as if all mens names were written in the book of life?<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>But we must
give diligence to make our calling and election sure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. That they which be Elect cannot but be saved,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> they cannot perish:
God will certainly call them out of the world and their bad estate,<note place="margin">They that be Elect cannot but be saved.</note>
and being effectually called, he will keep them to Salvation that they
shall never perish: He will not lose one, but call them either ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
by his Word Preached, if it be in the Church, or by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
means, if it be among Gods enemies: Among our selves
they that belong to God shall at one time or other be brought to the
Word, or the Word to them; and hence comes the removing
of the Gospel from place to place. How many have been brought
to the Word upon occasion of a Marriage, or to see their Friends,
or to wait on their Masters, or to speak with some body at
Sermon, or to make their Market, or being provoked by some
Neighbor, &amp;c? And hence it is also that when the Word is
Preached, some have their hearts opened, humbled, converted;
others remain blinde and impenitent, namely, because God hath
elected those, not these. True it is, that the Elect before their
calling are as other men,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> as bad as the worst; yea, commit any
sin that a Reprobate doth,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 11.</note> save that against the Holy Ghost:
What were <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Paul?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13. 48.</note> the one an Idolator, the
other a Persecutor?<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> Hence the World lasts still to gather up
the Elect behinde;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> Whosoever belong hereto, shall certainly be
called.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes that blinde and desperate speech of them that
say,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> If they be Elect they shall be saved howsoever they live: This
cannot be, for whom God hath Elected, he will call, they shall have
the means, and they shall be effectual; therefore thou must come to
the means, and pray they may be effectual: If thou contemnest the
means, and wilst not be obedient thereto, its a certain argument of
no Election; for whom he Ordains to the end, he Ordains also to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65522:154"/>
the means; so also having once effectually called them, he will never
lose them:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> His gifts and calling are without Repentance: <hi>The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of God standeth sure, having the Seal, The Lord knoweth them that
are his:</hi> They may indeed stumble and fall, but by vertue of Gods
Election they shall rise again, as did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> Their falling
shews their own weakness, their rising the unchangeableness of Gods
Election.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle speaketh to whole Churches,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that they were Elect of God, and
yet many fell away.</p>
                  <p>1. He so speaks in respect of the better part,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the true Elect
among them. 2. In the Judgement of charity, for that they
did outwardly profess the Word of God and live within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
and so we do, and must esteem of such till they shew the
contrary.</p>
                  <p>Its said,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> Him will I blot out of my book.</p>
                  <p>Its no more,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 33.</note> but declare by my Judgement, that they were
never written therein,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> by discovering them to be but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Moses</hi> his wish was,<note place="margin">Object.</note> To be blotted out of the book of life; and <hi>Pauls,</hi>
To be accursed from Christ.<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 32.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were but to shew their fervent affection to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note>
and exceeding zeal to Gods glory,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> not that they could
so be.</p>
                  <p>But saith our Savior,<note place="margin">Object.</note> I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a
Devil.</p>
                  <p>This is meant of an outward choyce to the office of Apostleship,<note place="margin">Solut.</note>
and not the eternal decree of Gods Election. And</p>
                  <p>2. This is matter of exceeding comfort to all that can prove
themselves of this number:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> They must not be dismaid, though
they be weak, and see great ones for gifts revolt and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
They fell, being ordained thereunto; thou shalt stand, though
weak, by vertue of Election: This also comforts when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our own frailty, Satans subtilty, malice, and diligence,
and his great conquests in the World; though there be matter
from hence to make us humble, and fear, and stand on our
watch, yet no cause of despair that we shall fall finally. True,
if we were in <hi>Adams</hi> case, and our Salvation were in our
own hand to lose, we might so fall; but we are kept of God
the Father, he Elected us, and committed us, and gave us to
the Son to be Redeemed, and the Son having so done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

making them believe, it were presumption to be assured: but they
must be of good hope (say they) and for the effecting of it, they must
go on Pilgrimage to such and such Saints, do such Works, make
Vows to build such a Monastrey, repair such a Church, and give thus
much to the Priest for Trentals, Masses and Dirges, that if they
come into Purgatory, hereby they may be speedily holpen out:
O what thanks owe we to God that we are delivered from such
Tormentors! And if any of our Consciences be wounded, we
we are led to the Free-grace, and all-sufficient Merits of Christ,
and so are bound up and soundly comforted, finding that whereon
firmly to rest; whereas they leave any in as bad or worse case then
they found them, who having done as they were by them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
are at as great uncertainty as they were before: So that
we under the Gospel save the extream toil of our Bodies, the
robbing of our Purses, and that which is worst of all, the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of our Souls (which they under Popery and Popish Teachers
undergo) and are faithfully dealt with by the mercy of God and
Merits of Christ: God hath not appointed his Servants to wrestle
with Flesh, World, and Devil, and all opposites, and left them
onely a blank and uncertain hope, but an assurance of their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
past, and Salvation to come, which carries them through all, and
is the foundation of a good life.</p>

If we upon tryal of our selves can prove by these and the like
infallible arguments that we have found it, then may we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
above all rejoycing, yea, more then if we were Crowned

Well, you say well, that is a good sign. Are you utterly lost

                     <hi>Blessed are the poor in spirit:</hi> Dost thou mourn under

to take up Christs yoke, though yet thou findest little power? Why,
these be good signs and marks of Election as well as the other; every
thing must have a beginning: Never leave till thou come to such a
pass, that thou canst prove thine effectual calling, and shew it by good
fruits: But if thou hast none of these at all, no sight of misery, no
burthen of sin, no purpose to come out thereof, but hopest to do well,
though thou livest after thine old lusts: O hang down thy head, go
mourning all the day, as one that hath lost his only Son! Thou hast
no mark of Election, but of the contrary: we pity them that have
Tokens of the Plague upon them, but these are infinitely in a worse
case; these have Gods Tokens upon them, even of Gods Enemies
and Reprobates: whether these have cause to be jolly or no, judge
you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Certainly we cannot by the same certainty that we may be of
our own;<note place="margin">Whether we may be certain of anothers Election.</note> but probably we may, and very strongly of some, as we
may be sure in every true visible Church there be some Elect, also we
may know particular persons,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 3.</note> as <hi>John</hi> the Elect Lady, and <hi>Paul,
Clement</hi> with others: But for certainty we cannot, as we know our
own by the witness of Gods Spirit to ours, and by the assurance of
Faith; therefore they are proudly conceited; that think they have
so much discerning, as if they be in a mans company a few hours, they
can judge whether he be the childe of God or not; fie upon this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy:
The Disciples could not do so by living with <hi>Judas</hi> a good
while together,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 22.</note> but askt, <hi>Is it I?</hi> There have been some have gone
so far, and carried it so smoothly, as for sundry years they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
many, not onely of the people, but of wise and faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stersts;
God knoweth the heart certainly, we may guess, and the more
godly wise any is, the better he can discern; but very probably, and by
the judgement of charity, we may judge more strongly of some then
others, according to the grace of God, and continuance in one duty as
in another, at home as abroad, in prosperity as adversity, yea, suffering
for the truth, abiding constant in a godly course: They that have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and knowledge what is necessary to Salvation, will look for
these, and rest in nothing else: This we may have of others, and this
every man ought to labor to lay up in the hearts of his Neighbors. A
man must not onely lay up good evidence in his own conscience of
his Election, but give as full a Testimony to the conscience of others
as may be: This is a Crown to a man while he lives, an Honor
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65522:156"/>
when he is dead, better then a good ointment, then silver and
gold,<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1.</note> a comfort to his Friends, a credit to them that are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns them that so walk,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as charity it self cannot speak
well of them, or esteem them in the state of grace, or any of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
What shall be said of these when they be dead? There's an old
bibbing carnal man dead, a proud yong man, a wicked woman of a
very malicious heart, &amp;c. To speak well of these were to sin against
conscience and the truth it self.</p>
                  <p>2. Them also as walk so odly,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as though in some things they give
good hope, yet they are either suspected to abide in some known sin,
or take their liberty so much in gaming, or give such way to some
notable corruptions, be so unreasonable hasty, so covetous and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as men have no sound perswasion; but being asked of them living
or dead, they that are of understanding can give no confident or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
but a lame and imperfect Testimony. This is indeed a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
thing: O leave something to comfort thy Wife, Friends, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
when thou art dead, that they may not mourn excessively, as
without hope, but may with others be perswaded thou art gone to
God! O leave behinde thee a sweet memorial of thy self!</p>

                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note>] Here's a second priviledge of Believers, cited
(as it seemeth) out of <hi>Exod. 19. 5, 6. By Christ they are made Kings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christians through Christ are made Kings, Priests and Prophets.</note>
                     <hi>Priests, and Prophets:</hi> O what a priviledge and admirable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
it is, that being by nature servants of sin and Satan, they
should be made Kings, and so prophane, that they had nothing to do to
draw near to God, may now be Priests, and offer Sacrifices to God?
where may be noted by the way, that even in the time of the Law,
Christ and the Gospel was also Preached to the Jews,<note place="margin">Christ and the Gospel preached in time of the Law.</note> for they could
not come to these priviledges, by the legal Sacrifices, but by the Lord
Jesus: And therefore wickedly do they, that imagine God fed the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
onely with outward benefits, and that they had no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1, 2.</note> which is contrary to the Scriptures:<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 56.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christs

Again,</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Moses</hi> spake indefinitely to all the people,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> the Apostle here
applieth the same particularly to Believers,<note place="margin">The promises and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges laid down in the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to Gods Elect.</note> Gods Elect, to whom only
the promises and priviledges appertain, and they ought to apply them
and make them their own, wherewith the wicked are not to meddle.
To a wicked man there's not a comfortable word spoken in all the
Scriptures, while he so abides: Me-thinks he should be weary of
his part,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 25.</note> and begin to turn in truth to God; for then begins he
to come within compass of these blessed promises and priviledges,
not before: Nothing belongs to the wicked, but sin, and thereby
the curses of God here, and Hell hereafter; as it was <hi>Judas</hi> his own
place.<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This priviledge flows from our Election,<note place="margin">Election is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the good which comes to us.</note> which is the foundation
of all good that comes to us here and hereafter: And to become
Kings, Priests and Prophets, who were by nature slaves of sin, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable

to God, and altogether darkness in matters of Salvation; we
obtain by the means of the Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">Christ how our King, Priest and Prophet.</note> who was our Mediator, and
anointed King, Priest and Prophet, and discharged by the fulness of
the Spirit, which was in him above measure, these offices for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
Our King, to gather, guide, defend us, and overthrow our
Enemies, Men and Devils: Our Priest, to offer up himself a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to God for us, and to make continual Intercession on our behalf:
and our Prophet, to teach us all that is necessary to know to Salvation;
and not this onely, but he was King, Priest and Prophet, to make us
such by conveighing a measure of that Spirit which is in him above
measure, to enable us hereto. As <hi>Aaron</hi> being anointed with the holy
oyl, it ran down on the skirt of his Garment, so did this from Christ to
all his Members;<note place="margin">on Rev. 1. 6.</note> But of these three dignities I have elsewhere spoken.</p>

as they be in their own eyes, and as Kings they conquer and over-rule
those that conquer and over-rule the Devil, the World, and the
Flesh: They are also Priests, and may come with confidence into the
presence of God, and bring Sacrifices that through Christ Jesus
shall be well accepted of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shew their Faces where the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

in all godly humility, but yet with notable courage and all true thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to God:<note place="margin">See <hi>Calvin</hi> on this place.</note> This yet remember, that though Kings, yet its Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,

and Magistrates; which I speak, because Anabaptists do by such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
elude and take away the authority of Magistrates, and exempt
themselves from them:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> So Servants are to be obedient to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

shall be condemned at the last day for not doing them good, what
shall then become of thee, if thou do them any hurt? Ile tell you a
far better way, Take knowledge of their happy estate, and labor to
be one of them, though despised in the world, yet of account with
God and Angels:<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 26.</note> Its well said, <hi>The Righteous is more excellent then his
neighbor, &amp;c.</hi> on the contrary, consider the woful estate of the wicked;
For what be they? be they Kings, Priests or Prophets? no such
matter, Believers be so: They be Kings, Priests and Prophets,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65522:157"/>
but the wicked are the slaves of sin and Satan, slaves to the flesh, to
their own lusts, to the world: What though they be rich, yea,
though they be Emperors, and not Believers, they are the vassels of
Satan, and have nothing but their drudgery in sin, and Hell for their
own place as their desert: Neither are they Priests, but prophane ones,
let them stand off, for the holy God cannot abide unholy persons;
they and their Sacrifice are abomination to the Lord: They offer no
Sacrifices at all of Prayer, Praise or Alms, or if they do, its abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
because they offer not themselves soul and body to God first;
but they offer themselves to the Devil, and him they serve with body
and soul, might and main: Neither are they Prophets, but dumb
beasts, not savoring of the mysteries of Gods Kingdom, or if utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing thereof, yet their ill lives disgrace it again: O that
such considering their own base, and the others happy estate, would
have an holy emulation to be as they; and indeed nothing in this
world is worthy to be envied but a Christian: Humble therefore thy
self for thy sin past, turn to God for thy pardon in Christ, and labor
to have thy part in him, and by him, and by Faith in him, thou shalt
attain to be a Christian, and so consequently a King, Priest and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and be enabled to the duties of the same.</p>

                  <p>True, but it might be said, that they onely had them, which had

others had them not, which had no fruit and benefit by them. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were sanctified and set aside by special grace to be holy
ones to the Lords use.</p>
                  <p>Note then, That</p>

2. Seeing thou art set aside for the Lords use, and sanctified in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soul, never defile thy self again, or put any part of thy body
and soul to any common or unholy use of sin or Satan. In the Law
it was ever most fearful to take any Consecrated thing, as the Holy
Oyl, Shew-bread, or Vessels, and put them to any common use; so
is it that we should put Hand, Foot or Tongue to any use of sin or
corruption, for any part of our souls or lives: Oh, many contrarily
can let loose their tongue to impatient, proud, and most unseemly
speeches, yea and their bodies and mindes; some to excessive follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world, as they were wont, and as worldlings do; and some
after their pleasures and vanities: O that we would grow and
abound in Sanctification, that here having our fruit in holiness, we
may have the end everlasting life.</p>
                  <p>If not, but contrarily you either live in prophaneness, the open

a number of old Folks, or such as have a counterfeit holiness in the

or contrarily civil persons, that seem very just in the second Table,
but savor nothing of the duties of the first Table: Know you are yet
unsanctified persons, and therefore out of Gods number; you may
be members of the visible Church,<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 1, 2.</note> where good and bad, chaff and

sets great store by, called therefore his secret ones, whom he keeps

ones, his Spouse, his Love, his undefiled, as the Apple of his eye,

he saved his Church, when all others were drowned; he saved <hi>Lot,</hi>
when <hi>Sodom</hi> was destroyed; he makes more account of one Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
then of thousands of others: If one of them pray, its so
forcible, that he says, Let me alone; and if thousands of wicked,
its but as the howling of Dogs, an abomination: They are his glory,

but their drudges: They as a wisp scour the Church, to make it
bright in the eyes of God, but the wisp is to be cast into the fire;
they are Gods rod to bring it to obedience; when thats effected, the
rod is to be flung into the fire. And</p>
                  <p>No marvel though the Lord set such store by his Church,<note place="margin">No marvel though he set much by it</note> seeing he
hath been at such cost therewith; as to Redeem it with the blood of
his Son, and to give his Spirit thereto to graft and unite it to Christ,
and to sanctifie and make it like himself: How dear are our children
to us? God hath made us sons, nay heirs; the Lands we purchase
be dear to us, we are Gods purchase; our members be dear to us,
God hath made us members of his Son.</p>

who and what we are: O how doth this tax the coldness
and carelesness of many Christians, in whom who can view any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
thing? but we ought to be singular persons: They omit duties
in their Families, or slubber them over, as many Hypocrites, who
can upon any occasion be as froward, impatient, worldly, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Is it not requisite that such as the Lord hath been at such cost
with, as to Elect them, Redeem them, call them by his Word and
Spirit, Sanctifie them, &amp;c. should be extraordinary persons? we
should be much in those duties that the World and Hypocrites do not
meddle with, as private Prayer, Examination, Watchfulness, yea,
against secret corruption, and in those we do, we must perform them
after another fashion then heretofore.</p>
                  <p>2. This is a comfort that God makes such special reckoning of his;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
therefore though we have many and mighty Enemies, yet we need not
fear: God is on our side, he is about us, as the Mountains about <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
they must dig down God ere they can come at his, overcome
God ere they can conquer his.</p>
                  <p>3. Terror to the wicked;<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> How dare they meddle to hurt or perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
any of these little ones,<note place="margin">Iudges 5. 23.</note> lest their Angel be let loose to destroy
them? If <hi>Meroz</hi> were cursed for not helping them, what shall they be
that harm them? They that rail on them, mock and misuse them, would
do further if opportunity served.</p>
                  <p>4. The wicked are of no reckoning with God,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> for they be like the
Devil, and do nothing but sin against God, and are his Enemies; The
wicked are as chaff and darnel, the godly as wheat; the good as the fish
in the net, the wicked as weeds and frogs; the good as the vine, the
bad as the nettles and brambles; the good as the tree planted by the
rivers of waters,<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 3.</note> &amp;c. the wicked as barren, nay, hurtful trees; the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65522:158"/>
godly be like good ground,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note> the wicked like that which bears thorns
and bryars: This should make them see their base condition, and set
less by themselves, seeing God sets nothing by them, and joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Lords people, and labor to be such.</p>

                     <hi>That ye should shew forth the praises of him, &amp;c.]</hi> The end of all these
priviledges and this cost is, that we might shew forth by word and
deed all the vertues of God, his Mercy, Patience, Wisdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp;c. shewed in our Election, Redemption, Vocation, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp;c. Where note.</p>
                  <p>1. That God hath not bestowed this cost on us in vain,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> but that
we might both sound out his praises with our mouthes,<note place="margin">Gods glory the end of all the priviledges bestowed on us</note> and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
out whole life shew forth the same: O how infinitely stand we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to him; But where is our zeal any thing answerable to the least
of these unspeakable mercies vouchsafed unto us?</p>
                  <p>2. That he did not Elect us,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> because he foresaw we would shew
forth his vertues,<note place="margin">We were Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of God, that we might shew forth his praises.</note> but that we might so do; If he had foreseen any
works in us, we might then have shewed forth our own Merits, as
his Vertues, but thats contrary to this Text and the whole course of
Scripture:<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> Therefore we may say herein, <hi>Not unto us, but unto thy name
give the glory.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That he Elected us,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> not to be idle, but to shew forth his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;<note place="margin">We were not Elected to be idle, &amp;c.</note>
and this confuteth the Opinion of those that hold the Doctrine
of Election, and the unchangeableness thereof to be a Doctrine of
Liberty,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and a gap to all licentiousness: But he chose us, that we
should be holy,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> and that not in shew to please men, but before him,
even so as he requireth and accepteth.</p>
                  <p>4. That the furthest end of our Election is Gods glory,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> not our
Salvation.<note place="margin">Gods glory the furthest end of our Election.</note> True, he propounded that too, but not as the furthest end:
So he ordained some to Damnation, not that simply he takes pleasure
in their destruction,<note place="margin">See Prov. 16. 4.</note> but to set forth his glory, even the glory of his
power and justice in their just condemnation;<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 23.</note> so would he be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in his mercy in the Salvation of the Elect.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5, 6.</note> Hence learn we</p>
                  <p>To make the glory of God the end of all our actions,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, not profit, not pleasure, not preferment, no not the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our own souls; we must not Hear, Meditate, Pray, keep the
Sabbath, flie from Sin, do good to save our Souls, (for then we seek
our selves) but that God may be glorified; the other must be minded
in the second place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who hath called you,]</hi> He describeth God by a special benefit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them, namely, their effectual calling from sin to grace;
and this he doth to confirm them in their Election, whereof he had
spoken before,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> by which they might prove the same.</p>
                  <p>Note then that effectual calling is a certain argument of our
Election;<note place="margin">Effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain argument of Election.</note> I say effectual calling, because there is 1. An outward calling
common to the Reprobate (<hi>as many are called, but few are chosen</hi>) and
2. An inward and effectual calling,<note place="margin">Two sorts of calling, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> when the Spirit goes with the
outward means, and boars through the ear of the heart, and opens
the eyes, and breaks through all lets, and enlightens and changes a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65522:159"/>
man admirably, who before was not at all moved when he heard the
very same things: when God deals with the Reprobate, he calls them
outwardly, but when with his Elect, he goeth to work with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 18.</note>
which passeth the power of Man or Angels; the work is the
Lords.</p>
                  <p>The outward instrument of effectual calling,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> is principally the
Ministery of the Word;<note place="margin">The word the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> other things may prepare (as the fire heats
the iron, but the hammer fashioneth it) as affections, the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of others, and the like: Thus the Jailor was by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 1.</note>
some are gastered, and first smitten (yet rarely) by some fear
in the night,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 26.</note> or at some other time fearful thoughts lay hold on them:
But this is not conversion (its no other then may be in a Reprobate) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they are brought by counsel to the Word, where it may be they
receive conversion, and even that terror of conscience though it were
occasioned by some outward thing, yet it is the Word that indeed
works it, as which tells them both of their sin and danger.</p>
                  <p>The parts of it,<note place="margin">The parts of effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> are 1. An enlightening of the understanding,
with a distinct knowledge of the principal points of Salvation. 2. The
opening of the heart to believe. 3. The changing of the whole man
from that ill nature that was in him to a quite contrary: The Law
prepares and make them see their deadly danger, and by the Spirit,
makes to feel it grievously, and then the Gospel works by little and
little, hope to comfort, and so a change.</p>
                  <p>The cause that moves the Lord to do this to any,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> is his meer mercy,
and no desert,<note place="margin">Gods free mercy the cause hereof.</note> as is Election and Redemption, so is our effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
free: And this inward effectual calling is an infallible argument
of Election past,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> and glory to come: They are links of the golden
chain of mans Salvation,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> that cannot by all the Devils be sundred,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note>
but have one and have all.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon me thinks every mans heart should burn within him to
prove his calling,<note place="margin">Every one must endeavor to prove his calling.</note> that hereby he might have a mark of his Election:
They that can prove it, may have exceeding comfort; and they must
also beware,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> lest being calling out of the world to God, they look any
more back,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1.</note> or be more and more defiled with the fashions and maners
thereof; and every day in hearing the Word, obey every part thereof,
and walk worthy of your holy Calling: Much are they to be blamed
that do no more honor their Calling, but drop into things like men of
this world, yea, are overcome of the world and covetousness.</p>
                  <p>But haply thou doubtest of thy Calling, because thou findest not
these fruits, or not so plentifully as thou would'st; be not discouraged,
though thou beest dull, and full of infirmities, and strong corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet unfainedly hating and resisting them, and being grieved at
them, and using the means against them, thou art not to call thy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
into question; yet must thou humble thy self, and as occasion
requires, set on more earnestly, use the means more carefully, and daily
renew thy repentance. But for those that shew no fruits of their
Calling, but though they have had the Word, and been Hearers,
yet remain prophane and impenitent altogether, or seeming to go
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65522:159"/>
some steps, yet are not changed throughout through Faith, they are
not yet called; for never imagine that every one that hears Sermons,
yea usually, and with joy, and mends many things, and lives in some
good fashion, is straight truly called: not onely the high-way ground,
but even the stony, yea thorny, which went far, and beyond most
in Congregations, yet were not effectually called; and numbers among
our selves, that think well of themselves, are not truly called, are
not Believers, nor turned to God: Well, let every man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
throughly; being not called, I dare not speak a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to you in this case, you have not onely no mark of Election,
but the contrary, when God hath by all means called, as by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
threatnings, &amp;c. and none have prevailed: O now use the means
with all diligence, and though hitherto you have disobeyed the words
of Gods calling, yet let them now open the doors of your hearts!
If you do,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 28.</note> God will be merciful and blot out all; if you will not,
when you shall hereafter call, you shall not be heard: and you which
would not obey this gracious voyce of the Gospel, to believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that you might be saved, shall one day hear another kinde of
voyce from him, which you shall obey, nill you will you, to your

                     <hi>Out of darkness into his marvellous light.]</hi> Here are the parts of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
both from whence and whereto.<note place="margin">What to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by darkness.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By darkness is meant ignorance of Christ Jesus, and sin, which
are the works of darkness, and tend to utter darkness; In this case
they were.</p>
                  <p>How could these Jews be said to be in darkness which had the Law,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> and were
skilful therein,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 17.</note> and stood not a little upon it?</p>
                  <p>They had knowledge of the Law,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3.</note> the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of the Law, they knew not, to know whom aright is life
everlasting: All knowledge without this is nothing but darkness still;
so that he means not, that they were without the means of knowledge,
as the Gentiles were, for one may have the means, and yet be in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
nor that they were called out of ignorance to some knowledge
by the means, for one may have much knowledge, and yet be in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but that they were called out of darkness, that is; out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Christ and Salvation by him, out of the state of corruption
and sin, and working the works of darkness, and going to utter
darkness.</p>
                  <p>To his light,<note place="margin">What by light.</note> that is, to know Christ by a saving particular, and
effectual knowledge to Sanctification and Holiness of life, which are
the works of the light, and so to the hope of the eternal light of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
Hereunto they were called out of the state of unbelief and sin,
which tend to death; for so sin is called darkness, and holiness light:
Sin is termed darkness, because it comes from the Devil the Prince
of darkness, loves darkness, and goes to darkness: Holiness comes from
light, even God the Father of lights loves and can abide the light,
and goes to light,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 5.</note> and God the Fountain of Holiness is called light.
Here note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:65522:160"/>
What every mans estate is till he be called,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> even that we are not
onely darkened,<note place="margin">Every unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate person is darkness.</note> but darkness it self: We were all made light in <hi>Adam,</hi>
full of knowledge and holiness, since the fall we are all darkness, and
when God means to save any,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 17. &amp; 5. 8.</note> he pulls them out of darkness: Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath a power indeed,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> which were it not for the Almighty power
of God delivering us therefrom,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> would hold us under for ever; and
as long as we be in this darkness,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 6.</note> we have no right to the Kingdom
of God, nay we have nothing to do with God, we are neither his
sons, people nor servants: The man that is not effectually called and
sanctified (what gifts soever he hath) is yet in darkness, and never
wrought other then the works of darkness: He may do good things,
and the works of light, but they be not so in him, being darkly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by corrupt nature, without Faith or the Spirit, neither tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the right end: This may be said of every unregenerate person,
though never so old, civil, or of good parts.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that teach that there are some such
pure Naturals left in man, some Free-will to goodness, which if
God stir up a little and help, can work; and that they can merit of
Congruity, which crosseth both this and other Scriptures, as, <hi>That
the thoughts of mans heart are onely evil continually;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>That the wisdom of
the flesh is enmity with God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> and,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That we are dead in trespasses and sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This should make the world weary of their part:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> O that a man
had but wisdom enough to perswade all ignorant persons that they
be in darkness, and going to Hell; nay, all persons of what parts so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that being void of Faith, and not sanctified, they are in this
case: Its not because they are not so, but because they are so deep in
darkness, as all that can be said to them from God about the same,
cannot so perswade them, <hi>but that they love darkness more then light,</hi>
cannot away to be called out of it, think their case as good as others;
<hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and stand up, Christ shall give thee light.</hi> Who
would abide in a dark Dungeon, that might be abroad in the light?
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he might be in <hi>Goshen</hi> with Gods children? Men think
because they have the light of the Sun, and their eyes to see, they
think that they be not in darkness, but their Souls be in most woful
darkness: Never think to work the works of darkness, and yet come
to the light of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Into his marvellous light.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Observ.</note>] This is opposed to darkness; therefore
hereby is meant saving knowledge of Christ,<note place="margin">Every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is brought into the saving knowledge of Christ.</note> which is life Eternal,
and true Light, Holiness, and Sanctification, the hope of Heaven,
and the inheritance of the Saints in light: This is not onely light,
but marvellous light, either in respect of the contrary darkness, or in
respect of it self. This is the estate of every Believer, of every san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified person.</p>
                  <p>1. This shews the infinite oddes between the true Christian,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and
those that be not so; and that not onely between Pagans that have
no means, who be deep and every way in darkness, but even between
Christians, and them that have both means, and it may be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
yet are still unconverted and unsanctified persons: The one
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65522:160"/>
is in light,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 7.</note> the other in darkness;<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> the one have fellowship with
God, the other with the Devil: O that men saw the oddes! they
would not onely not judge their own case so good, and despise the

of their skirt, and say, We will go with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth Christians brought into this marvellous light,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> how
to walk as children of the light, and to have nothing to do with

                     <hi>Which in time past, &amp;c.]</hi> Here the Apostle alludeth to <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 10.
where the Lord setteth out both the sins and punishment of the ten
Tribes under a Typical marriage of the Prophet with a notorious
Strumpet, which was not a thing verily done, but to set the more
lively before their eyes their Sins and Idolatries; as under the name of
those supposed children, were set out the punishments that God meant
to send upon them for the same; as, That they should be scattered
abroad, That God would have no mercy on them, and lastly, which
was worst of all, That they should not be his people; all which were
accordingly fulfilled: For first they were carried Captive of the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrians,</hi>
and there retained some remnants of the Worship of God
in a corrupt maner, and kept together; but after when the <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Persians</hi> prevailed over the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> they were then scattered over
the Nations so far and wide, as they had no part of Gods Worship
remaining among them, but were so mingled among the Heathen,
as they became no people of God at all, but altogether wrapt in all
the maners of the Heathen Nations with whom they lived: This is
that here meant, when he saith, <hi>They were not the people of God, &amp;c.</hi> And
lest the good among them should be altogether dismaid, as though
God had broken his Covenant, he promiseth, That the time should
come, that he would receive them into his favor again, which was
now accomplished, as the Apostle saith, <hi>When by the Gospel they were
gathered to the Faith of the Lord Jesus.</hi>

That for a people or particular persons to look to their beginnings,<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
is of good and singular use:<note place="margin">For a people or particular persons to look to their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings is of good use.</note> As for us, who since Christs coming are
admitted to the same priviledges with the Jews, have the Gospel
Preached, Christ Jesus offered, Grace given to receive him, the Word
and Sacraments to assure us of him, Heaven opened to us as well as
they; for us, I say, being thus, and having the truth, and onely way
of Salvation Preached to us by Jesus Christ: To consider what we
were will be of great use, <hi>as that we were aliens from the common-wealth
of Israel,</hi> Strangers, drown'd in Idolatry and all Sin, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the true God, but woshiping the Devil in stead of the true
God; that in the days and under the Tyranny of Antichrist, we were
held in blindeness, made to worship Images, taught to believe that
we must be saved by Masses, Mans Merits, Popes Pardons, scared
with Purgatory, thinking that then we did God high service, when
we most dishonored him: So to consider with our selves what we
were before our Calling, Ignorant, in Unbelief, Prophane, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Sin, slaves of Satan, in Darkness, loving Sin as our lives,
hating the Word and all goodness, &amp;c. and what we are now through
Gods mercy, will be of great use. For</p>
                  <p>This serves,<note place="margin">Reason 1.</note> 1. To make us humble, and take down our pride:
Therefore, when the Israelites would so brag of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
or <hi>Israel,</hi> that they were their Seed and Posterity, the Lord by
his Prophets would tell them, and what was <hi>Abraham,</hi> but a poor
Idolater in the Land of <hi>Ur</hi> of the Caldees, and a lone man, a dry stick,
and <hi>Sarah</hi> barren? and what was <hi>Israel?</hi> was he not a fugitive, as it
were, fain to flie for his life into <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and so poor, as he
went onely with his staff in his hand, there served for wages, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the sheep, at his return ready to be devoured by <hi>Esau?</hi> what great
cause then have you to brag of your Progeny?</p>
                  <p>2. To stir us up to thankfulness,<note place="margin">Reason 2.</note> when we see we were most
wretched, and miserable, poor, and blinde, and naked, having no dram
of any good in our selves; this is a great cause of thankfulness: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if we think we have ever been as now, or that we had some good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in us before, as the Papists teach, we cannot be truly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
thankful to God as we should: Therefore the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi>
That man is not so miserable,<note place="margin">See Rom. 6. 17.</note> but that he hath some good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 10.</note>
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 3.</note> will never humble a man as he ought to be, nor make him
so thankful as he should be: <hi>David</hi> was put in minde that he was taken
from following the Ewes with yong, that thereby he might be the
more thankful.</p>
                  <p>3. To strengthen our faith to believe in God for afterwards,<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> and
for all blessings needful to Salvation:<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> He that hath already done thus
much for me,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5.</note> will not now fail me.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore we should do well oftentimes,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> especially when we
feel our hearts lifted up with pride, to enter into a deep considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our former estate, and what we were before God shewed
mercy to our souls in enlightening, converting, and effectually calling
us; for we are ready to be puffed up, as though we had not received it,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65522:161"/>
and lift up our selves, and contemn others; now alas we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
such were we, and once as far from Salvation as they, and so
pity them.</p>
                  <p>2. When we finde our selves dead or dull to duties,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what he hath done for us, and from what a base condition he
hath pulled us, and into what dignity he hath advanced us, and this
will make us shake off all laziness.</p>
                  <p>3. When our faith is weak,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and we begin to fear the time to come,
consider, He that freely before the world chose us (passing by most
others) gave his Son to dye for us, his Word to tell us thereof, his
Spirit to assure us thereof, and so Sanctifie us, he will not now leave
his work imperfect.</p>
                  <p>O but our sins be so many,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and we be so unworthy!</p>
                  <p>If thy sins could have turned away Gods favor,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> he would have kept
his mercy away at the first; but seeing they could not keep God from
shewing thee mercy at the first, they shall never take away the favor
of God from thee, now that he hath vouchsafed the same, they shall
never take it away wholly and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Here the Apostle alludes (as ye heard) to <hi>Hosea</hi> 1. 10.<note place="margin">Observ.</note> God there
threatned to cut them off from being his people,<note place="margin">No priviledges can exempt the contemners of the Word from Gods wrath.</note> which after fell out.
Whence learn, that</p>
                  <p>No priviledges can exempt men from Gods wrath, but if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
his Word, he will take it from them, and cast them off: Thus
he did with the posterity of <hi>Abraham;</hi> a very lamentable spectacle to
see the ten Tribes carried into <hi>Assyria</hi> Captives, thence by the <hi>Medes</hi>
chased into many Nations, and dispersed, that had sometimes been the
people of God, and now nothing less, but became no people, were as
the Heathens; thus hath it fallen out to many Nations since our Savior
Christ, as to the Churches that the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> wrote to,
and divers others.</p>
                  <p>This may terrifie us,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and hereby we may learn to stand in awe: If
God did not spare them,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 21.</note> will he spare us? we stand upon our good
behavior; the sins of our Land be many, not onely Bribery, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
Whoredom, Drunkenness, Pride, Covetousness, but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
prophanations of Sabbaths and Sacraments, fearful contempt
of the Word, and abuse of Gods Servants, and with most, Religion
grown to a mock, and a reproach to those that be any thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
therein then others.</p>
                  <p>If any shall say,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> We have enjoyed the mercy of God, and the Gospel, a long
time.</p>
                  <p>Not so long as the Israelites did.<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what then should God do for a people?<note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As when God cast off the Jews,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> he took us Gentiles in, which they
thought could never have been, even so can he finde him out a people
among the ignorant and wilde people, which are no worse then this
Nation sometimes was, though he should utterly cast us off.</p>
                  <p>In making them a people again, see both the mercy, power, and
truth of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:65522:162"/>
1. His mercy in receiving them in again:<note place="margin">Gods mercy in making the Iews a people again.</note> Where learn, That
Though God should forsake some of the seed of a godly man, yet he
will extend mercies on others for their fathers sakes, and remember
the next or third Generation for the good old father, or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father.</p>
                  <p>Let Parents be godly,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that all their children may be so; or if the
Lord should frown on any of them, that yet he may remember his
Covenant to their Posterity.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> though God be angry with men for their sins, yet if they
unfeignedly turn to him and humble themselves, he is gracious and
merciful.</p>
                  <p>As this should provoke Gods Servants when they have offended,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
not to fly from him and dispair, but come humbly to him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that though they have shaken off the nature and part of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
yet he retains still the nature of a father; so this may provoke
lewd Wretches to come unto God,<note place="margin">Apply 1 King. 20. 21.</note> hearing he is so merciful. But
contrarily, they abuse the same, and go on in their sins.</p>
                  <p>2. His power:<note place="margin">His power.</note> Though they were thus scattered, and so unlikely
ever to be gathered again, yet did the Lord effect it. If men say a
thing, or have a minde to a thing, they may hap to do it, but if God
minde a thing, he will do it, neither shall any, or any thing let him.</p>
                  <p>This may comfort us in all Gods promises of protection of his
Church,<note place="margin">Use.</note> against the proud adversaries of the same:<note place="margin">See Psal. 74. 12.—18.</note> And let such
take heed how they oppose God in his Church, or stand in his way,
lest they receive that which they shall never claw off again. Though
the Jews at this time be so scattered, as that they be in all Nations,
yet God will finde a means to gather them under the knowledge and
scepter of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. His truth:<note place="margin">His truth.</note> That was verified and came upon them, which God
had threatned in the time, and by the ministery of <hi>Hosea;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there it was foretold, that yet afterward they should be called home
again, and be made the people of God: See the truth of his promises
as of his threatnings;<note place="margin">Use.</note> for his promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> he took them
in again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Were not a people]</hi> He saith not,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> they were not the people of God,
but,<note place="margin">Impenitent persons not worthy the name of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> 
                     <hi>they were not a people;</hi> What then? heads of Swine, not worthy
the name of a people or of men, but of Beasts; for such are they
which live without the knowledge of God and Christ; nay, evil
Beasts, as Horse and Mule without understanding, Oxen and Asses
may teach them wit:<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 12.</note> The Sork, Crane and Swallow know their
times,<note place="margin">Psal. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> which they do not, nay worse then Beasts: Hence the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
compares them to Dogs,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 3.</note> Lyons,<note place="margin">Ier. 8. 7. &amp; 50. 27.</note> Foxes, Tygres, Cockatrices,
&amp;c. as wicked rich men to fed beasts. If a Horse have drunk his fill,
let him come through the clearest water that is,<note place="margin">Amos 4. 1.</note> and he stays not; but
numbers having already drunk too much, must needs drink at every
Alehouse they come at. Its grace that puts excellency in a man,
without which he is worse then a Beast, for he is degenerate from his
Creation, hath understanding, but serveth not his Creator, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belleth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65522:162"/>
against him, and his end will be a thousand times worse then
a Beast: A wicked man is called in Latine, <hi>Nequam,</hi> which signifieth
no body, and so he is indeed in Gods account, No body; and happy
were it with him, if he were indeed no body, but he hath a being here
to sin, and hereafter to be tormented.</p>
                  <p>Do not we therefore rest contented with our natural state,<note place="margin">Use</note> but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
for grace in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But are now the people of God]</hi> Though scattered,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> yet became they the
people of God:<note place="margin">No outward affliction doth nullifie Gods Church.</note> So that no outward affliction doth nullifie Gods
Church, as no outward pomp nor living together in wealth make a
Church; Gods Church scattered, is yet one Houshold, one Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.
Further, in that he reckons it for a great priviledge and blessing,
that they were the people of God, Note, That</p>
                  <p>Its the greatest blessing in the world for a Nation to be the people
of God,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> even to enjoy the Word and Sacraments,<note place="margin">To be the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God a choyce bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> and other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, the means of Salvation: so for a particular person to
be one of Gods true people;<note place="margin">Psal. 147. 20.</note> for as for all outward things, they are
common to the wicked, yea the Beasts partake of many of them, but
the means of Salvation they are happy things: Its the fearfullest thing
in the world not to be the people of God; for if we be in Poverty,
Trouble, Captivity, under Tyrants, yet its nothing, so we enjoy the
means of Salvation; and if a Nation have all Plenty and Peace, yet
want the knowledge of God and Christ Jesus, its nothing: So for a
particular person, if he be never so Poor, Sick, Imprisoned, Hated,
yet if the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus be in his heart, and true
holiness, he is not misrable; and if all Wealth, Honor, Health, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
can be put upon a man, if he be not the childe of God, its no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
St. <hi>James</hi> bids the poor Christian rejoyce, because he is made
a Christian, exalted; and the rich man to rejoyce, because he is by
the grace of God made lowly, not because rich.</p>
                  <p>1. This may stir up in us thankfulness to God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that hath vouchsafed
to make us his people in this Land, for which we cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
thankful: But most regard not that which makes the Land hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
namely the Gospel; This is that which makes this Land the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and nothing else.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth us particularly to labor to be of his true people ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
Called,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Justified, Sanctified, Zealous of good Works,
loving the Word, affecting it, <hi>and finding it sweeter then the honey, and
the honey comb, more precious then gold and silver,</hi> delighting in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and Prayer, walking in true Holiness, &amp;c. thus shall we be
happier then Kings without it. He that is one of Gods true people is
dear to God, he will protect him &amp; provide for him, that he shall want
no good thing here, and be glorified with him hereafter; every one
will be challenging this to himself, the worst of all will take the best
names to themselves, and be termed Christians, but let them win it
and wear it.</p>

                  <p>HAving laid Doctrine for his ground, he follows now with Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
both these go necessarily together to the doing of good,
and may not be sundred: The Doctrine was about the great things
that God had done for them, and therefore hereupon he Exhorts them
to holiness, and purity of heart and life; before he shewed what God
had done for them, now he shews their work; before he shewed that
the end of those priviledges, was, that they should shew forth Gods
vertues, now he shews how that should be done, namely, in labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be pure in heart and life in token of thankfulness, and so that
being advanced to such dignities, they were not to be idle, but work
for God, and walk according to the benefits bestowed: In this verse
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65522:163"/>
he exhorts to purity of heart, in the next to holiness in conversation,
and these he joyns together.<note place="margin">Holiness in heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation must accompany one another.</note> Holiness in general, is and must be the
life of Gods people: These two parts of it, in heart and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
must go together, one as the Mother, the other the Offspring,
that as the Root, this as the Branches; like two Twins that are born
and dye, weep and laugh together. In vain doth any man boast of
purity of heart, whiles his conversation is naught; In vain doth
any man strive to have a good conversation, whiles his heart is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to boyl with corrupt lusts: First, he begins with cleansing the
heart, as from whence must come good conversation, the onely true
discerner of the purity of the heart.</p>
                  <p>The parts of this Verse are two: 1. An Exhortation, where we have
both the maner wherein its delivered, namely, by way of beseeching,
and the matter exhorted to, namely, <hi>To abstain from filthy lusts;</hi> whereby
we are to understand, not such sins as be acted by the body, but the
lusts of the heart, for even body and soul is flesh naturally, that is,
sinful and corrupt. <hi>Fleshly lusts,</hi> that is, sinful and carnal corrupt lusts;
such as have place in the heart, ere they break out, from those we are
to abstain, even to take heed they prevail not in us, but resist and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the same. 2. The Reasons thereof, 1. Because they fight against
the Soul. 2. They were and we are Pilgrims here; not of this world,
therefore not to follow the lusts of this world, but to minde Heaven
and be Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dearly beloved]</hi> We must know he dissembled not, but spake as he
thought, and meant, and felt. Hence note,</p>
                  <p>What affection of love Ministers ought to bear to the people they
have taken charge of:<note place="margin">Observ.</note> If people have chosen one,<note place="margin">Ministers must love and affect their people.</note> and entrusted him
with their souls, he is then to be between God and them: O what a
near conjuction, and what great love must there be! The Apostle
writeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>That he was their Father;</hi> and to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 7, 8.</note> and to
the <hi>Thessalonians, That he was affectioned towards them, as a nurse che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth

                  <p>Love also being so necessary a duty in the people, as without which
nothing can go aright as it should, and that most are full of self-love,

good both to their souls and bodies, and that both by word and deed,

                  <p>But chiefly this is the Reason he should be so full of love to the
people,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> that they may be moved the more by his Ministry, and it may
prevail the more effectually with them; when they see that whether
it be admonition or rebuke, yet it cometh from one that entirely loves
them in the Lord, and is hungry of their souls, and desires above all
to win and gain them to God, which would be above all riches to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65522:164"/>
them; if not, our nature is sickly and full of self-love. If we think
our selves not to be loved, we make little use of whatsoever we are
taught, though this be indeed a fault in us, for the matter it self ought
to move us: But as if the sick person knew the Physitian to be one,
that besides his skill, bears him good will, it will make him willing to
take physick of him; whereas if he thinks he bears him no good will,
he cannot be brought to meddle with him, or take any thing of him;
so its with them that are well or ill perswaded of their Pastors love
towards them: Therefore the Minister ought to provide for this;
for what is the joy of a Minister, but to see the fruit of his labors, and
that he does good, and gains men home to God, sees knowledge and
conscience wrought, and people converted? Oh, what man sows,
and looks not to see it come up, grow, and have a crop? who plants
a vineyard, and looks not for the fruit thereof? and shall we onely
lose the most precious labor, and seed, and study, and preach as we
care not whether it do good or no, and never look after it? God
forbid.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth Ministers their duty to love the people tenderly;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 14.</note> not theirs: By reason of the contrary, there's so little good
done; some live altogether from them, others live with them, but so,
that it were better they were further off.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth people to profit by that which they hear,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> though not
delivered haply with such hearty affection as it ought (for its Gods
Word however) but especially look, that being delivered in love, and
unfeigned care of your good, you take heed that you despise not the
same, lest one day it rise up in judgement against you.</p>
                  <p>He had before described them as Believers and excellent ones, now
here he calls them <hi>Beloved,</hi> yea, <hi>Dearly beloved.</hi> Hence note, That</p>

Lords (haply even such as are yet bad) and love that part or parts of
the Image of God we see in any; but where we see the true Image

                  <p>2. So let people strive to grow and exceed in grace,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that they may get
the highest and largest room in their Ministers heart which be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
which howsoever the world makes little account of, yet they
that are wise know, that their sentence and love is to be regarded, as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65522:164"/>
the Testimony of the Church is a great matter, either for a man,
or against a man; so of a Faithful Minister: and if such a one give
a full and large Testimony of a man, its a Crown to his head above
all his wealth; if his Testimony be against a man, or a weak doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Testimony, its an hard case: If a Minister have joy of a people,
and may give a chearful account of them to God, its profitable for
the people;<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> The contrary is grievous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I beseech you,]</hi> He had power to command them, being from God,
in a thing for their own good, and so necessary, but he saw their
toward disposition, therefore chose rather to use entreaty. Whence
note, That</p>
                  <p>Its the duty of Gods Ministers to be wise in their delivery of the
Word,<note place="margin">Wisdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in the Preachers of the Word.</note> and when they see that loving beseechings and entreaties will
be as profitable, and prevail as much, then so to do, rather then use
any other course. True it is, the Minister hath power to command
the people being in the person of God, and for their own good to flie
from things hurtful, and follow things profitable for themselves:
<hi>Paul</hi> might have commanded <hi>Philemon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philem. 7, 8.</note> but being perswaded of his
forwardness,<note place="margin">See 1 Tim. 5. 21.</note> he rather entreated; so must we, as they that set in a
joynt in a tender body,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 1, 2.</note> stroke,<note place="margin">Acts 13. 10.</note> and stroke softly, and anoint the place,
and so put it in the place ere the party be aware;<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 7. and 23. 13. 2.</note> yet upon occasion
we may both command, and threaten, as the same Apostle elsewhere:
and <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, and our Savior himself; as when we have to
deal with stubborn and disobedient persons, or such as have fallen
into foul sins, or are secure and dead-hearted, or are revolters and
backsliders, then, I say, are we to deal more roundly and severely;
knotty logs must have many and hard strokes, as a rough horse an
hard rider; when we have to deal with toward and well disposed ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hearted ones, or afflicted, then are we to deal otherwise: and here is
required the wisdom of the Spirit of God to discern what is meer, and
this must be considered of before hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abstain from fleshly lusts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What meant by fleshly lusts</note>] Now of the matter of the Exhortation.
By fleshly lusts are meant not onely acts of sin breaking out in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but the inward lusts that are in the heart, though they should
never break out, for even the heart and soul is flesh as well as the
body, and fleshly, even corrupt and sinful, as the sinful lusts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
impatience, hardness of heart, hypocrisie, rebelling against
that which is good, weariness in well doing, pride, anger, envy,
self-love, covetousness, uncleanness, uncharitableness, and the like:
These we must abstain from, even labor against, that they prevail not
in us, yea to subdue them quite. Now in that he gives his Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to such as they were, whom he before described, We may
learn, That</p>
                  <p>There are remnants of sin abiding in the best of Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
and will be while they be here;<note place="margin">There are rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of sin in the very best.</note> They shall not lay down sin wholly,
till they lay down this flesh: They are sanctified, but in part; through
out,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> but not perfectly; corruption is not in one part, and grace in
another, but grace and corruption joyned in every part and faculty of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65522:165"/>
body and soul, and thus it hath ever been. Hence it is, that we scarce
read of any in Scripture, but taxed for some infirmity and weakness,
as <hi>Abraham</hi> with some little shifting for himself, when he said <hi>Sarah</hi>
was his sister; <hi>Sarah</hi> for her unbelief, <hi>Moses</hi> for speaking unadvisedly,
<hi>Job</hi> for cursing his day, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for being stirred the one
against the other: And this the wise and good providence of God
hath so appointed, for he could sanctifie us perfectly at the first, but
its not meet, for then righteousness should not come onely by Christ;
for if we were not onely perfectly justified by Christ, as we are, but
also perfectly sanctified by his grace, then might we stand before God
with confidence, and boldness in our own righteousness, and need
not to have the righteousness of Christ continually imputed to us.
Besides, the Lord would hereby humble us, that we should not be
proud of any gifts or graces that he bestoweth on us, more then we
had or others have, but be kept still humble: when we see these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
lusts sticking in our nature, which may more justly provoke
wrath against us, then our good actions procure favor; as <hi>Paul,</hi> lest
he should be lifted up through the abundance of revelations, had a
prick in the flesh,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 12.</note> even Satan working upon his corruption, and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tempting, and as it were boxing him to humble him: Therefore
no man hath cause to be proud of any grace, not only because he hath
nothing but the meer mercy of God, but also because (if he consider)
he hath such remainders of sin still in him, as if they be laid in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with his graces, might be of more force to condemn him, then
all his graces to procure favor to him. Further, hereby we are held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in exercise, and made see our need of the Word, Sacraments,
Prayer, and the help we have one of another while we live.</p>
                  <p>1. We are not to expect the perfection of any here;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> though Gods
Ministers are still to call on the people to grow towards it, yet they
must rejoyce even in their proceedings to it, and bear with some weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and wants; and people must not think their Ministers can be
perfect without blemish, either knowing or suspecting some infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them, to esteem meanly of them, or their Ministery, or gifts,
so drowning all their graces, God forbid: Its well, 1. We know
no sin our Minister lives in: 2. No corruption he yields to, but that
he is in strife with his corruption, and counts it his burthen; this we
should cover with the lap of our love: The contrary is in the world;
If a Minister have any imperfection, though strived against by him,
and seldom or never shewing it self, and have never so many good
graces, yet the same shall still be cast in his face, and tost from one to
another, and all his gifts neglected, and that oftentimes of those that
live in soul sins, or are an hundred times more foully overtaken of the
same, or some other: Husbands, look not for perfection in your
Wives, nor Wives in your Husbands; thank God they be godly,
hating all foul sins, and striving against corruptions, look for these,
and cover them, else lovingly help to cure them in time convenient,
but look on their graces: some man that is himself carnal, and hath a
professing wife, so narrowly views her, as if he spy the least imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65522:165"/>
its cast in her teeth, as if she should be perfect, though he
be never so far off from perfection: Let none look for Christians
that profess the Gospel, that they can be altogether without blame;
yet let none take up this as a good excuse and shelter for them; yea,
say they, Its true as the Preacher said to day (which I liked well)
that we are all sinners; some make themselves so holy, and profess
such zeal, as if they were without sin, or wiser then all their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
when they be no less sinners then others: Well, let not these
carnal or prophane and civil persons, think to scape away with this,
or be hid in the number of sinners,<note place="margin">Two sorts of sinners.</note> and scape as well as others; God
will finde two sorts of sinners, such as live and lie in sin, indeed
workers of iniquity, and such as having been unfeignedly humbled,
and obtained pardon of sin, and truly repented, have yet corruptions
which they hate and strive against, and are heartily sorry when they
have been at any time overtaken thereby; and yet the world bless
themselves herein, What, are not all sinners I pray? yea, and you
shall have them that will dilate of any infirmity that a Christian hath,
and stretch it on the tenters, when themselves are polluted with
foul sins.</p>

against our pride, self-love, unbelief, hypocrisie, earthliness, weariness

                     <hi>If we live in
the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit:</hi> For us that are Christians to be led
and overcome of our lusts, is base, as for a Prince to be led of a base
person; and here is the power of Religion, and proof of a Christian,
that denyeth himself and crucifieth his lusts, that not onely keepeth
his hand, but purifieth his heart, that hath it at command in some
measure: We must labor to know these corruptions, and our own
hearts, and which of these we are most prone unto, and discern of
them, which many do not, but are most strangers at home, and
have many corruptions which they discern not, for the heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful:
Know both the ugliness and danger of them, then repent
of them, be humbled for them, crave pardon heartily, unfeignedly,
seek to mortifie them, apply the edge of the word against them, even
any thing we read or hear out of the Scriptures to this purpose: Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
also the benefits of God, as means to subdue them, so also afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont;
put on the whole Armor of God, and on every occasion set
against them, pray against them also, especially when we humble
our selves upon occasion of the Sacrament, &amp;c. always be baiting
at them, hacking at the roots of them, grieving we can prevail no
further, crying and making our moan to God to help us; so shall we
get mastery more and more (dealing faithfully) even over those that
we thought sometimes we should never have prevailed against: In
the mean time lets not be dismaid that we can get no more mastery,
be humbled and yet comforted that we strive: But here is the great
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65522:166"/>
fault of many Christians, that suffer their corruptions to bear such
sway in them, as they break out shamefully, and often to Gods disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
their own shame, and the Gospels infamy; where is our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
when we be so proud, that we will contend, and being out,
will never be reconciled, but break out into bitter speeches? so being
so covetous, so lazy also in goodness, that either we neglect duty whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or slight it over carelesly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fleshly lusts,]</hi> Hereby are yet further meant all evil thoughts, and
the least rebellings of this nature of ours, against the holy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God: These are fruits of this concupiscence and evil nature
of ours,<note place="margin">Evil thoughts cast in by Satan or from our selves.</note> and of the flesh, and are sins against God. But here know
that evil thoughts be of two kindes, 1. Such as be cast in by Satan,
as into <hi>Judas.</hi> 2. Such as arise from our own corrupt nature, as
Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>Why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</hi> For
the former, they either fasten upon our nature, and tarry to tickle us
with a kinde of pleasure, or else are immediately cast out with deep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation:
If they tarry never so little to parley with our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they are our sins, as well as Satans; but if cast out immediatly,
they are not, then are they our crosses, not our sins, but the Devils,
and shal also be laid to his charge, not ours; for so he cast in thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Savior Christs minde of distrust, presumption, idolatry, &amp;c. but
they fastened not at all on his nature, therefore he was never the worse;
so for us: for if any shall come and entice me to Murther or Treason,
and I detest the very first motion thereof, Shall I be counted guilty?
This is needful to be known, lest we be too much overwhelmed with
grief, for these the Devil troubles every one withal at all times, and
no man alive is free from many of them daily, if he did take notice
thereof; but some men are troubled extraordinarily this way: God
lets Satan loose at some time, and for some space to buffet them most
grievously, and cast in bad thoughts of all kindes, but especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, most foul, unholy, prophane, and blasphemous thoughts
not to be named; as that God is not holy, just, good, or deals hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with some men, cannot do this or that, with other more vile then is
meet to be named, which is sometimes the state of civil persons, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the true children of God, which are cast into their mindes
as thick as hailstones, and are by some called the foul Temptation,
by some the Temptation of Blasphemies: This doth so wonderfully
perplex the parties, that it fills them not onely with fears, but even
drives them almost to despair, makes them weary of their lives, that
they could wish themselves as far under ground as they are above;
yea, many to think of making away themselves, haunting them in all
places, night and day, that they cannot rest, so weakening their body
and minde exceedingly; concerning this state, we must know it
comes to pass by Gods providence, and permission to Satan thus to
torment them.</p>
                  <p>The cause may be either to humble them to repentance for some
coldness or slackness they are fallen into in the worship of God,<note place="margin">The causes of evil thoughts from Satan.</note> and
their course which God thus punisheth, or else he punisheth the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65522:166"/>
of their hearts, and idleness of their mindes, that care not how
they spend away their time,<note place="margin">How to be rid of them.</note> their mindes roaving unprofitably, which
God often chasteneth: the way for these to take, is 1. To examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if there be any sin lies unrepented of, or not throughly repented
of, to confess and crave pardon of it, and repent of it from the heart: If
any coldness or slackness, or declining in care, or idleness of minde,
and unprofitableness, then are we to pray against them, and keep our
hearts still in hatred and detestation of them, and therein comfort
our selves, that the Lord knoweth our hearts, and will not lay them
to our charge. 2. Set light by them, let them go as they come, for
the more we strive with them, the more we snarl and trouble our
selves, and if we make a great matter of them, the Devil will still
delight to vex us, but if we set light by them, he will the sooner be
weary. 3. Let them avoid solitariness (which yet they so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire)
and keep in company rather, wherein the time may be spent in
holy conference, singing of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the like; but if they be alone,
they must be very earnest in doing something thats good. 4. Though
some may come after all those means used, yet we are to comfort our
selves that God will not lay them to our charge; as if our Childe
should be about our business, and some unhappy Wretches would not
let him alone, but throw stones at him, pluck him away, trip up his
heels, and he cry and complain to us he cannot do our work, will we
be angry with him?<note place="margin">How to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them from those which arise from own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> The Lord is much more equal and wise. Now
to discern these foul temptations from those which do arise from our
own nature, these notes may be observed, 1. That they come sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.
2. Violently, being even forced into us. 3. By their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
being as thick as hailstones. 4. That they come with such
fears, as often cost sickness, faintness, and the like, which things usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be not of them that come of our selves, which also come more
leisurely, and with more moderation. 5. Such as be in such a degree
of blasphemy against God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Perkins Cases of Consc. pag. 163.</note> usually rise not of our selves, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
but in a Reprobate, or one that hath sinned against the Holy
Ghost, as the Devil hath. 6. Such as are against nature, as to kill
our selves, our wives or children: For the latter that arise from our
nature they be sins, whether they tarry so long, as that they have got
consent of will or not, or so much, as they have but inveigled the
minde with some bait-like allurement, yea, but so as that either they
do presently vanish so soon as they do arise, or be cast out by us, yet
these I say be sins; if with consent against other Commandments,
if without consent against the Tenth, which ransacketh the heart more
narrowly then any of the other: Its true, the longer they stay, and
the further they have prevailed, its the worse; but the least and
first thought against the Law of God is a sin, and deserves the wrath
of God; as all Impatient, Blasphemous, Unbelieving thoughts, all
wandering thoughts when we be at the Word, Sacraments, Prayer,
or any good duty, or any such on the Lords day: all ill thoughts, as
that its in vain to serve God, &amp;c. so also Disobedient, Angry, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful,
Unclean, Uncharitable thoughts; God made us pure
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65522:167"/>
without any, and may justly punish the contrary in us: These first
of all come from Original sin, and who can bring good out of evil?
These bring forth bad effects, and withdraw the heart from God, to
consent to and commit evil: These are forbidden in the tenth
Commandment; else what? This the heathen Philosophers never
knew, nor <hi>Paul</hi> himself a learned Pharisee, till he was instructed in a
more Spiritual understanding of the Law.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which teach, That ill thoughts with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
be the least sins, and that without consent, they are none: What
is that then which <hi>Paul</hi> said,<note place="margin">Rom 7. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>I had not known that lust had heen sin, but
by the Law;</hi> he knew that ill thoughts with consent were sins: This
Doctrine of <hi>Rome</hi> doth derogate from Gods glory, and doth not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a man to the purpose as it ought, neither letteth it him see a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of such sins for which there's cause he should be humbled.</p>
                  <p>2. This sets out the absolute perfection and purity of the Lord,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
who requires the purity of the heart and thoughts, he made us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and requires that we should love him with our whole hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. It serves notably to humble us on our knees every day to God,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
for who knows how oft he offends this way? O the innumerable
vain, foolish, idle, and bad thoughts that arise in our mindes in a day?
how in a Sermon or Prayer-while, and on the Sabbath? O if God
should deal with us in justice, he might condemn us for the least of
these; we should repent us seriously of these, as of ill deeds: This
is that made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am;</hi> and that makes
the dear servants of God hang down their heads, and humbles them
continually; and when others think highly of them for their graces,
they have matter to abase their vile nature and rebellious thoughts,
whereof some tickle the minde, some get consent, and are then cast
out as, some presently are repelled: But how infinite numbers of
them come through our heads as motes in the Sun, as sparkles from
a Fornace? The want of the knowledge of these, makes many
a Christian when they look back at night, see little to repent of,
which if they marked, they might finde: This is the Reason why
civil persons be not humbled, even because they take no knowledge
of these thoughts, whereof they have thousands on the Lords day,
in the times of Duties, and against every Commandment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they take no knowledge, or scarce of one of twenty; and those
whereof they take knowledge, they think to be no sins, as long
as they break not out into words and actions. Thought is free, as the
world thinks, and judged at no Bar, pay no Tribute: True, not in
mens Courts, because they cannot know them, but before God they
are and will be called in question, who knows the thoughts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to be loved with the whole heart.</p>
                  <p>4. This sets out the wonderful patience and abundant mercy of
God,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> that upon our repentance pardons so many thoughts.</p>
                  <p>5. Its our duty to prevent them to the uttermost of our power;<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> and
to this purpose we must labor,<note place="margin">How to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent evil thoughts.</note> 1. For the Spirit of God to be more
and more abundant in us, to mortifie this corrupt nature of ours, that
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65522:167"/>
so this root being more and more killed, may send forth fewer
shoots; this brand more and more quenched, may send forth the
fewer sparkles. 2. To be ever doing some good, to be in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or some thing answerable thereto; for if we be idle, the minde
will be ranging: An idle person must needs have a corrupt heart,
swarming with ill thoughts, for if the minde be not occupied about
good, it will be about evil; its like Quicksilver, ever stirring: if we
be riding, working alone, walking, waking in our beds, let our mindes
be on some good: And in duties we must keep our mindes earnestly
bent thereto, that being full already, there may be no place of by-thoughts;
as when a vessel is full, no more can be poured in: Let's
covenant with our eyes and ears, that they let in no ill thoughts,
especially in holy duties, and on the Lords-day, shut up all windows
and doors; so in praying, whether conceived, or read by our selves,
or heard of another, our hearts must be set thereon, that to every
Petition they may say, Amen. So in hearing the Word, we must
be earnestly bent, and fix our eyes on the Preacher; and for the Lords-day,
be wholly in doing good, and that earnestly: In the time of the
Sacraments both joyn with the Prayers then used, and withal, have
holy thoughts by way of preparation, and in the mean time have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meditations about the matter present, as long as we can, then
joyn in singing; it must needs be a weary toil to them that cannot.
3. To pray earnestly to God for his assistance, but labor what we
can, all will not be prevented; therefore must we grieve for those that
come, casting them out, and that speedily: They are as a flock of
birds, that we cannot let from hovering over our heads, but may
hinder from lighting on our heads; if we nip them betimes, then we
prevent evil actions: The worst action was at first a thought, which
if it had then been resisted and cast out, would not have proved so
deadly, as we now finde by woful experience; for want of this, sin
grows from one degree to another, till it be ripe: If we thus resist
and cast them out, though they be our sins, God will not impute them,
but pardon them in Christ, and this may comfort us; but yet because
it were best not to be troubled with them, or commit them at all, we
should even long to be with God, when having laid down our bodies,
we shall be wholly freed from them: But in the mean time, let us thank
God in Christ Jesus, and say, <hi>Its not I, but sin that dwelleth in me;</hi>
when we do to the uttermost of our power prevent them, and those
we cannot, yet we resist earnestly: The world make little account of
thoughts, but let them flie out, and the heart range whither it will,
whether on the Lords day, or at other times when duties are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and no marvel, for they make no conscience either of their words
or actions, even on the Lords-day: But they shall one day be called
before a Judge that knows them all, and made them without them,
who will condemn them for them.</p>
                  <p>Which fight against the soul: The first Reason, and that of greatest
force; that which fighteth against our principal part, we had need
resist manfully, but thus do fleshly lusts: for 1. They hinder the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:65522:168"/>
good thoughts we should have in stead of them,<note place="margin">How fleshly lusts fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the soul.</note> and so make us do
duties untowardly. 2. They egge and entice us to evil, and steal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our hearts from God and his obedience; as an Adulterer enticeth
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and draweth a mans wife out of her husbands company, so do these
draw us from God; and so pollute our souls, which made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to complain,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 14.</note>

                     <hi>we shall dye;</hi> It will not spare us, we therefore must not
spare it, we must admit of no reconciliation, no ransom; this is holy
and lawful revenge: But contrarily, there are not a few Christians
1. Which do not watch against their lusts and thoughts, but let them
come and go at their pleasure, and take little or no notice of them, or
not as though they sought their destruction; nay, how few once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their thoughts, especially such as have no consent? How many
come and go, and no account taken of them? 2. Which rather mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

anger, to wandring thoughts, by letting their eyes and ears be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
3. Which do not mortifie them, nay, bear with them, and
speak favorably of them, and not as if they were deadly Enemies?
Oh, people little think of the danger of these lusts, else they would
otherwise do! If any lie in wait to hurt us in our bodies, we watch
to resist them, and its wisdom; or if any come to rob us, we cry
out, Oh, he seeks to rob me and get away my goods; or if one should
sue us for part of our Land, What a stir and opposition do we make?
What a madness is it then, that these which fight against our souls, we
suffer to go in and out at their pleasure without any check, entertaining
them rather as friends then enemies? If one should strike at our leg, we
would fence it if we could, but if he drive at our head, then much
more; If one would thrust us into the arm, we would avoyd all we
can, but if he go about to stab us at the heart, then much more; so
should we most of all for our souls: These lusts pretend friendship,
but they are Enemies, fighting Enemies, an Host (as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
against our souls: O let us be wiser, and deal with them as
deadly Enemies! O our fault herein! If some come and tell us, this
night some be pointed to rob us, or there is one lies in our field armed,
threatning to kill us as we come that way: O I thank you good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
say we, that you would tell me, I shall love you while I live;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65522:168"/>
but if any come and tell us of a Lust, Pride, Covetousness, Hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is in us, he had need behave himself wisely in the doing of
it, that shall have any thanks for his labor, nay, not one of many but
will take it ill, and snuff, and think the worse of him: O what folly
is this to bear with such deadly foes!</p>
                  <p>4. If these inward lusts fight against the soul,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> if these ill thoughts,
yea the least of them be enemies to the soul, and must be resisted,
What then do the ugly sins and abominable speeches and actions of
the wicked? These wound and pierce the soul most deeply; their
Oaths, Cursing, Drunkenness, Prophanation of the Sabbath, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Oppression, Lying, gash the soul most fearfully, and kill it at
last eternally: What mad people then be most of the World, which
love and live in the practise of these, thus murthering their own souls?
As <hi>the man that was possessed of a Devil broke all fetters,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 5. 4, 5.</note> so do these; <hi>kept
among the graves,</hi> so do these in Alehouses; <hi>cut himself with sharp stones,</hi>
so do these with ugly sins: If a man seek to make away himself, stab
himself, or cut his own throat, we say, He is beside himself, its
time to binde him; when the World therefore gash themselves,
and stab themselves with their vile sins, are they not mad, yea
so much more then the others, as the soul is better then the body?</p>

they shall rest for ever without sin and sorrow, in the perfect fruition of

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:65522:169"/>
of Heaven walk in some measure: Many lay claim to Heaven,
having no right thereto, as by their very walking in this world
may appear. To discern the one from the other, consider these
Notes:</p>
                  <p>1. A Pilgrim follows not the fashion of the Countrey he is in,<note place="margin">Properties of Pilgrims.</note>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nor runs after every thing he sees other do; He observes some ride
to Markets and Fairs, some running to Plays, others sitting in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
drunk, others running to Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting, and the
like; he regards none of them, but keeping his own Countrey fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
goes on his way homewards; and if he happen to be drawn
away by the sight of them, and linger a while, he repents himself,
and saith,<note place="margin">Applyed.</note> What a fool was I? I have cast my self behinde; so do
Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 4.</note> they follow not the evil guises and maners of this
world: The world swear, contemn the Word, and Ministers thereof,
prophane the Sabbath, Rail, Curse, Whore, be Drunk, Backbite,
Cozen, Dissemble, Lye, be Proud, and the like; these they will
none of: These be proper to the men of this world, we may not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with these; and this is the Reason in the Text, <hi>We must abstain
from fleshly lusts:</hi> Why? These be for worldings of this world to
follow, we that are Spiritual may not follow fleshly lusts, but leave
them to them that be but flesh; but our conversation must be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
Holy, according to the Laws of our Countrey, Zealous,
Fervent, Pure, Chaste, Innocent, Merciful, Patient, Godly, and the
like; To Love, Fear, Trust in God, Worship him, Delight in his
Word and Saints, These be the fashions of Heaven our Countrey;
therefore these we must follow,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> and so the Gospel teacheth us
to live.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. A stranger lays not out his stock on House and Land, but traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks
in things transportable, that he can send home before, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
out of the Countrey with him into his own: It were no wisdom
to lay it out and spend his time about things he must leave behinde
him:<note place="margin">Applyed.</note> So the true Christian Pilgrim, he spends not his time, nor sets
his heart on things of this world, all which he must leave behinde,
but trades in Grace, and purchaseth Pearls of Knowledge, Faith,
Repentance,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 19.</note> Patience, Peace, Joy, and the like, and Trafficks in
the fruits of Faith,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 27.</note> his good works, which he sends before him into
his Countrey,<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> and in such Graces as he shall carry with him: Oh,
how many have taken much pains for belly, and back, and earth, but
never prized the Pearl with the wise Merchant,<note place="margin">Psal. 17. 14.</note> nor the means how to

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Pilgrims will take and use all that may further them in their
journey, as their Meat, Drink, Sleep, and whatsoever else; but what
would hinder them,<note place="margin">Applyed.</note> they cast away, or meddle not with: So a true
Christian useth all that will help him in his journey, the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,<note place="margin">Luke 21. 34.</note>
Prayer, and all such Spiritual Repasts, good Company,
and such baitings and refreshings as God offers him in his way;<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> as
for worldly cares, or whatsoever presseth down, he avoids, as all sin
which hinders in the way: He takes the benefit of the things of this
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65522:169"/>
life indeed, but sets not his heart on them, neither overloads himself
with worldly businesses and cares, which might hinder him from good
duties, or a right performance of them, much less that make him
run into evil: For a man then goes on his journey to Heaven, when
he awakes with God in the morning, assoon as it is convenient goes
to Prayer, then to his calling in Faith, and through the day neglects
no Spiritual duty, much less runs into evil of any kinde, but walks
on uprightly, and with a good conscience useth the world as if he
used it not:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 31.</note> Such as regard not these, have no meaning to come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
For how should they come there? As men cannot go on in the
earthly way without baits and refreshings, so neither the heavenly
without these: They overload themselves so with worldly business
and cares, that they cannot go one step towards Heaven. O how
simply do many Christians walk in these days of Peace, not hasting
at all to Heaven! for if they did, they would not take such loads on
their shoulders, as make them go so stooping and staggering, as they
can scarce go a right step all day long.</p>
                  <p>4. Pilgrims travelling towards their Countrey, will be asking the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

very glad.<note place="margin">Acts 3. 37.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Christians that minde to go to Heaven indeed, will be asking
the way there: They will go to godly Ministers, and experienced
Christians, and ask how they might know the way, and whether
they be in the way, and then finding these and these marks in them;
as, an hatred of all sin, a true desire in all things to please God, seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in secret, as well as openly, with a true love to God, his
people and Word, they are not a little glad, but rejoyce therein above
all riches: O how many deceive themselves, <hi>The way to heaven is
straight, and few finde it:</hi> Most never ask the way, but go on at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
if they be in the way, so it is, if not, they shall shift as well
as others; and most please themselves that they are in, without asking
the way, as if it were a very hard matter to miss the way to Heaven,
and which but few do miss.</p>
                  <p>5. Pilgrims will in a long dangerous way, through a Wilderness,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
where the path is narrow, where there are many by paths, little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to beat the path, and dangerous for wilde beasts, not onely be
asking the way, but because they know themselves apt to go astray
(though they fare the harder) have and hire a guide continually to go
along with them in the way, to be sure that they may not lose any
time,<note place="margin">Applyed.</note> or grieve themselves by going out of the way at all, if it may be:
So will every wise Christian besides asking, get a continual guide,
which is the Word of God, to go along with him, to direct him in
every particular through the day, yea his whole life: This <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
and therefore did so often study and meditate in the statutes of
God,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>That they might be a light to his pathes, and a lanthorn to his feet,
and his Counsellors:</hi> This therefore we must read, hear, study, that
it may dwell plentifully in our hearts, in all wisdom, that we step not
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65522:170"/>
awry for want of knowledge, or knowing the way, go contrary to
our guides direction: we cannot in every particular action and our
dealings go and ask counsel, therefore we must have the guide and
counsellor within us, to teach us to Buy, Sell, Let, Hire, to deal with our
Neighbors in Peace, Equity, Mercy, Truth: Therefore <hi>David</hi> prays,
<hi>Lead me in thy way,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal 25. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord, and let thy good Spirit lead me into the Land of

                     <note place="margin">Psal. 27. 11.</note> as one that would not go a step, but as he was led by
Gods Word and Spirit. The common sort therefore that dare do
any thing, and never look for guide, hereby shew whether they are
going: Gods Servants also herein are wonderfully to blame, that
sometimes for want of knowledge, sometimes for want of care, go grosly
out of their way; one step in the way, another out; in some things like
Christians, in some things like worldlings; some actions good, some
nothing less, When will such come to their journeys end? What
travelling is this, backward and forward, and then backward again?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. A Pilgrim, if he be told he is out of the way is glad, being
grieved at his mistaking and loss of time, and returns with speed, and
thanks him that told him; so also must Christians in their journey to
Heaven:<note place="margin">Applied.</note> They that cannot at all endure to be admonished, nor haste
to amend, are not in their way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. Pilgrims make much of their Fellow-travellers and Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
if any be out of the way, they call them in again; if any faint,
they stick to him and rub him, and with the <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> bottle that they
carry along with them for such purposes, they comfort him, and go
not from him, and leave him behinde them; they also chear up, and
encourage one another, What chear my masters? go we merrily? &amp;c.
So do true Christian Pilgrims,<note place="margin">Applyed.</note> they love all that set their faces to
Heaven-ward with them, they call in any wandring out of the way;
If any be afflicted in Conscience for sin, or in Body, or otherwise
with any cross, or hath met with hard measure from the world,
and begins to be discouraged, when Landlord or some great men
frown, or is fallen into some troubles, they encourage and hearten
him with words of gracious consolation out of the Word, the <hi>Aqua
vitae</hi> of Gods promises; But the world cannot abide them that go
that way.</p>
                  <p>Its a great fault in Christians that they walk no more Pilgrim-like,
love not one another, are not able or careful to admonish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but let one another alone till the wicked cry out on them and
the Gospel; and for Consolation, few are able, few careful to look
thereto. The rich encourage not the poor, one heartens not on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but every man goes by himself, and so are the weaker; as
when the Brands are pluckt one from another, the heat departs: O we
should cleave together as Burs, for we have both Devil and World
against us!</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. A Pilgrim bears his troubles quietly, looking for no other whilest
he is thus from home; though he be stopt here, stockt there, mockt
at as he goes, yet he comforts himself with this, that he shall ere long
be in his own Countrey where he is known, and loved, and shall
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65522:170"/>
meet with no more such, but all good usage that his heart can desire;
So true Christians bear their troubles patiently,<note place="margin">Applyed.</note> if from the hand of
God, or for his sake, sickness, losses, crosses, they look for no other
in this vale and Pilgrimage: This comforts them that they shal one day
come to Heaven, their resting place, where they shall live with God in
all blessedness for ever; and if other troubles come one after another,
they think them no other then they made account of, its Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that it should be thus, that Heaven might be the sweeter, we
might long the more for it, and be weaned from hence: If an Englishman
should be highly advanced in a strange Countrey, he would the
sooner forget his own; but in trouble, longs for his own, and is so
glad of it, as many Souldiers having met with much hardness in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countreys have fallen flat, when they arrived and set first foot in
<hi>England</hi> again, and kissed the very ground, with O welcome sweet
<hi>England!</hi> If Christians meet with hard measure from the world, they
bear out in hope of Heaven;<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>If they were of the world, the world would
love them:</hi> They will not deny, but confess Christ, here suffer for him,
that hereafter they may reign with him: Thus did the Prophets,
Thus did the Apostles suffer; Therefore for those that being put to,
and in danger of displeasure, or trouble, flinch, joyn with the world,
and give over, they be no Pilgrims, they mean not Heaven in good
earnest, for if they did, they would not lose it for a few troubles: Its
therefore a sign they doubt whether they have any resting place or
countrey provided for them or not, for else they would not lose it, and
men cannot have Heaven both here and hereafter:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> But the true Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim
is confident he undergoes troubles constantly and boldly, as
knowing that he hath a countrey which will pay for all.</p>

but be content so long here to stay, as God shall see meet: The
world cannot abide to think of death, or of the day of Judgement,
would buy them off, yea but to be deferred, with much money, an ill
sign; nay, many of Gods Servants be much to blame, some so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to the world, as not willing to part with it: O ye be of little
faith! Its base that any thing here should take up our affections from
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65522:171"/>
longing to be with our true Inheritance: Nay, thus some Christians
are held lingring indeed, and that for wife and childrens sake especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
namely, to see them brought up, and kept from evil courses,
seeing often the contrary, through the want of Parents, the wrack
of many children.</p>
                  <p>As for the most part, this argueth weakness of faith in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
especially if their desire be excessive, for God can provide
for them without us; moderately to desire life for this cause, or only
to do God some other service, is tolerable; always provided, that it
be the love of nothing here below that detaineth our affections, but
that we so esteem of the world, and all that is in it, as we see no
cause in it, why it should take up our hearts, and make us linger here:
The causes that should make us desire to be hence, should be sin, and
the desire to be with God; sin to chase us hence, and the love of God
and Heaven, the excellency of that place and state should allure us
thither: Some desire to be gone, but its most ignorantly and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
for its onely because they be in trouble, full of pain, have
many crosses: Thus many make away with themselves, others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
wish to be gone; poor mad fools, not knowing what is a
coming, onely looking to be eased of the present grief: O our poor
folly also, and the earthliness of many of Gods people that are not
wearied hence by sin, and by their corrupt nature, and continual
spring of sin, that they cannot be rid of, but annoys them daily and
continually! Therefore God is pleased to send them sorrows and
pains, and with a week or fortnights pain, they are made willing to
dye, that were not so before: A great fault of sundry Christians that
have their hands and heads so full of business, as they cannot desire
to be gone, nay, had need of a twelve-moneths warning to set their
matters right: This is not Pilgrim-like, they may hap not have a
week;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> therefore so walk, as you may ever be willing to be gone, and

and that they were yong again, &amp;c. but thank God they draw nearer
the shore, where they shall arrive at the Haven of rest: Ancient
Christians near their end, have this advantage, that they have almost
past the Pikes; yong ones know not what remaineth for them; yea,
every day a Christian at night should thank God, that hath brought
him safely one days journey nearer his end then in the morning: Many
think they grow old too soon, too fast; if they could make their
years stand still as <hi>Joshua</hi>'s Sun, they would be glad.</p>

                     <q>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that
whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good
works which they shall behold, glorifie God in the day of visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</q>
                  </head>
                  <p>VNto the former Exhortation of purging the heart, he adds this,
of looking to our outward behavior and conversation among
men; namely, that it be honest, good, godly, and every way such
as may not onely not be offensive, but may be of good example, yea
to the very wicked, that though for a time they speak evil of us (as
our nature is to do of every one that differs from us, thinking our own
courses still to be best) yet at last they looking more narrowly, and
seeing our constancy in well-doing, may be enforced to think well of
us; and whensoever God shall touch their hearts with his grace, they
may glorifie God, and say, This is the onely true way of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, and thank God for it, and all the means that have brought
them to the sight of it.</p>
                  <p>The parts are two, 1. The Exhortation. 2. The Reasons thereof.
The Exhortation is to godly life, and that is inlarged by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of persons or company, before whom, namely the Gentiles,
that is, the Idolatrous, Wicked, and Unbelieving. The Reasons,
1. That they may be prepared to their conversion, by beholding our
good life, which is set forth by the contrary in former time, namely,
their speaking ill of us. 2. That they may glorifie God, which is set
out by the time, namely, when God shall please particularly and in a
special maner to bestow his grace upon them, so that by our innocent
godly life led among the wicked, we shall provide for our own credit,
their good, and Gods glory, which is the thing we should chiefly aym
at in all our actions.</p>
                  <p>Here observe we first our Apostles order: He begins at the right
end; as a wise Builder he lays a good Foundation, then builds on it;
as a skilful Chyrurgion he first purgeth out dead flesh, then heals;
which else would heal, and break out again.</p>
                  <p>Reformation (if ever if be good) must begin at the heart:<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> No man
can have a good conversation whose heart is Unregenerate,<note place="margin">Reformation must begin at the heart.</note> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified,
for from the heart proceeds the life; if sin and lusts be
nourished there, they will break out as fire hid in straw or dry wood;
for our bodies are as apt to execute,<note place="margin">See Ier. 4. 14.</note> as our hearts to broach evil: For
one to purge the Channels,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33, 34 &amp; 15. 19. and 23. 26, 27.</note> and leave the Fountain foul, were to lose
his labor; for one also to pull off the tops of the weeds, and leave
the roots still,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note> were to no purpose:<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11, 12.</note> The heart must be washen, kept,
cleansed from inward lusts, else no godly life.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes the Papists that talk of good conversation,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and yet
regard not the heart,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> either seek after true justifying faith whereby to
purge the same.<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. This shews and rebukes the folly of those that think to frame
a good life as civil persons, and yet never knew the corruptions of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65522:172"/>
their hearts, nor what Faith means that purifieth the heart, nor
make Conscience of their inward lusts: Hence it is, that they
shamefully deceive themselves, especially in the first Table, and in
the sight of a true Christian, that can tell what belongs to good
conversation. Numbers think upon occasion they will never do
as they have done, but promise great amendment; as upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something out of the Word, or after some affliction, or
after they have been ashamed with some sin, O they will do
thus and thus, who alas never labor with their heart; Some
say, Give me but a shilling from you, and Ile never come at
such a place, never game more, &amp;c. but alas, its not so soon done
as said: They dig not deep enough, they work not under ground,
the heart's let alone all this while; they think to cut off the sprouts,
but while the root is whole, they shoot our again. Many at variance
are made friends, and promise, and think for the present so to continue,
yet not conscionably looking to the beginning and root, Pride, Self-love,
Wrath, and such lusts, but suffering them to abide there still,
alas they break out again presently:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 22.</note> Our Savior saith, <hi>He that is angry
with his brother unadvisedly, shall be in danger of the judgement, &amp;c.</hi>
Hence comes <hi>Racha</hi> (fool) and murther; now if a man think to keep
his hand from murther, and his tongue from <hi>Racha,</hi> and such distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
speeches, and yet suffer wrath in his heart uncontrolled, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
and unpurged, the other will break out. Hence is it, that
many make such fair promises, but perform nothing nay while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because they have not the grace to seek the washing of their heart
from all sin.</p>
                  <p>3. It teacheth Christians to be much occupied in searching and
knowing their hearts,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and the corruptions and lusts thereof, and still be
purging out of these, so shall we do much work at once; else though
we covenant not to be so worldly, &amp;c. as before, yet if the root of
Covetousness, Unbelief and Pride be let alone, we will to it again:
So if one should say, I will not break out, but live peaceably with my
family and neighbors, yet if high mindedness and anger continue,
we shall be deceived, and shame our selves; and thus do many
Christians.</p>
                  <p>Having your conversation honest,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> &amp;c.] <hi>This is all one with that of St.</hi>
Paul, To live holily, righteously, and soberly. <hi>So that</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its not enough that we have or pretend to have a good heart and
pure conscience,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> but we must also have a good conversation outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;<note place="margin">Christians are also to have a good conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
we must not onely approve our selves before God and Angels,
but also before men; we must have a good outside, as well as a good
inside;<note place="margin">See Mat. 5. 16.</note> we must so walk, as men may see by our actions, speeches,
and our whole behavior,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 17.</note> that we be the servants of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 21.</note> and minde
to go to Heaven:<note place="margin">Isa. 4. 3.</note> Thus walked <hi>Abraham, Job, Zachary, Elizabeth,</hi>
with others; we must thus walk both for the winning of others on,
and for the good report which we should be careful to procure to our
selves,<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1.</note> it being better then much silver:<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 1.</note> not that we must do good
Pharisaically for the speech and praise of men onely, which is base
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65522:172"/>
and hypocritical,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 8.</note> for we are first to aym at Gods glory; yet we may
desire also so to live, as we may give good example, and get good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

in both.</p>
                  <p>1. This stoppeth the mouthes of carnal men,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that being dealt with
for faults in their conversation, either ill done, or good not done,
they straight rid themselves with this answer, and blinde them that
deal with them that they cannot see to take them as they think, O we
have as good an heart as you or any, and God knows my heart, and
I have a good conscience, God knows all, and he shall be my judge;
yea, he will indeed so be, and that too soon, except thy conversation
be better: for deceive not thy self by thinking thy heart is good,
which affords an ill conversation, a merciful heart, that hath a niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hand, a chaste heart, that hath a wanton tongue and behavior, a
godly heart, that can prophanely spend the Sabbath in worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
But what if one should grant your heart were good, is that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?
Is it not meet your hand and whole conversation were so?
<hi>Did not he that made that which is within, make that which is without also?</hi>
Numbers care little for their conversation, are not over nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
about that; so that they be none of the worst, they think their
condition good enough.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebukes those that blame men,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and reproach them for their
profession of Religion, O you are of these Professors! O what a
wretch art thou, that darest controle another mans, nay Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,

us, <hi>that our light should shine, and that we should confess him in our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Lord will one day profess he never knew thee, and bid thee depart as
a worker of iniquity: And what dost thou profess thy self, that
railest on him for professing himself the servant of God? The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Devil, and one of the Malignant company, the son of the
Bondwoman, even persecuting the children of the Promise, therefore
one that shall never be heir with them, but shall one day wish to be
shrowded under any of them, but shall not be able: And what is his
fault?<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> he is a Professor; The Apostle saith, <hi>They profess they know

                  <p>This rebukes those that would be counted honest men,<note place="margin">Use</note> and yet do
but what they list: Some will yield in all great matters, but in some
small things as they take them; as when they say, By their Faith and
Troth, they must be born with, especially if true; so a game or two
at Tables or Cards, and if it be on the Lords-day, in company of
their equals, especially of their betters, talk thereon of worldly
businesses at their pleasure,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>But he that breaks the least Commandment,
shall be little counted in the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Some again will yield in
little things, the Word shall so far prevail with them, but in some
great beloved sin,<note place="margin">Mark 6. 20.</note> they will not, as <hi>Herod;</hi> Some cry out against
Covetousness,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 23.</note> and be Proud and Masterful; and so on the contrary,
Some seem very devout and forward in the first Table, and make lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
conscience of the second Table; Some in their Shops and Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
deceitful, hollow, and unjust; Some in the state of servants, that
shew some forwardness to good duties, hearing, good company, and
the like, who yet fail exceedingly in the duty of subjection, diligence,
trustiness, and the like; Some profess the like also, and men say, they
be honest persons of good gifts, but they follow no calling, borrow
here and there, and never mean to pay, deal hardly with poor work-folks,
&amp;c. A man must shew his Religion in his particular calling:
no man is a good man, that is not a good Minister; if he be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
so a Magistrate, Father, Husband, Dealer: Some contrarily
seem very smooth in the duties of the second Table, and yet have no
savor of the first; as 1. Papists, which are profest Idolaters, and
make no conscience of an Oath, nor of the Sanctification of the
Lords-day, who yet keep a good house, and seem merciful and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
which yet they do corruptly to merit by; and hence they get
the commendation of a company of carnal people, that measure all
by the belly, and can look no further: Its not possible for an absolute
Papist, to be an absolute Christian. 2. Our civil persons that give
men their due, but God can have no part of his in any Spiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of duty, either on the week days or Sabbath days: Let
all that know its thus with them, know themselves but hypocrites,
and let them halt no longer, but if God be God, serve him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and let him be whole, and not either quarter or half-master, yet
many men be good at plots: Would we like in our field to have here
a taste and there, and a great breadth after nothing? No, but to stand
so as we may spread a sheet and receive the fruit; when mens obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
comes by fits, such aguish obedience Gods likes not: But if
we would approve our selves sound, and have true peace, let there
be some proportion between our actions; not some very forward,
some quite another way; in some things hot, in some as cold as ice;
else like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 33.</note> Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, Clay,

for a man to avoid all occasions, as to live among occasions, and not

                     <note place="margin">Reasons to provoke to a godly life.</note> Now follow the
Reasons to provoke to godly life; 1. We shall cause the wicked to
speak well of us, and of the Gospel of God, yea, though they have
spoken ill of us and it before, yet upon a serious consideration of our
innocent and constant conversation, they will change their mindes.
2. They shall by that means be brought to glorifie God, and both
like, and speak well of the truth, which they shall then do, when
God shall graciously visit their hearts, and work by his Word and
Spirit true conversion in them; then being prepared before by our
good life, they shall be made to glorifie God for his truth, and for us,
and for opening their eyes, and moving their hearts to embrace it:
Forcible Reasons. We shall by our constancy in a good life, 1. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
well for our own credit, the credit of the Gospel, and the wickeds
conversion. 2. Which is the main, we shall provide for the glory
of God.</p>

it crosseth their humors and vile lusts which they set so much
by, See <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18. and 19. 13. and 19. 6. and 24. 5. To come down
to the Primative Church, were they not most horribly slandered, as
if they had been Canibals, and lived of mans flesh, and eat their
own children, That they met in caves in the night to worship, and that
then the candles being put out, they committed filthiness promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
without respect of Kindred, &amp;c. and if any plague came, as
that <hi>Tyber</hi> did overflow to great hurt, and that <hi>Nilus</hi> did not overflow
her banks as it used to do, or any the like, it was because of them, and
by their means, thereupon they fell upon them, and killed them like
Dogs: Thus have they used always to incense great persons against
Gods servants, with such false suggestions, and to make them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the common people: It hath ever since been the maner of the
Church of <hi>Rome, which hath a mouth that speaketh blasphemies,</hi> to call
the Truth, Error, and the Gospel, Heresie; and with them, we that
profess it be all Hereticks, cursed to Hell, and who should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but fire and faggot if they could help it; and the sincerest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
and godliest men, they hate most, and have ever particularly
devised horrible lyes against the great men in the Church, whom
God hath raised up to be hammers of their false Religion, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

worse, then such as be in the bosom of the Church; How are they
traduced, ill spoken of, railed on universally in great places, in mean
places,<note place="margin">Note.</note> on Alehouse-benches, where not? If they can finde any
fault of theirs, its that they rejoyce in above anything, and they lie
in wait for the same: If they can observe no sin, but understand of
any infirmity, which yet they strive against daily, yet this shall be
set abroad and encreased, as some ugly thing, when themselves and
theirs have many filthy sores running on them, horrible sins, which
yet they account nothing: If any of themselves have never so many
faults, if he have but a little odde good quality, as to be somewhat
courteous, a Good housekeeper, and the like, O he shall be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as a right honest man indeed: If any of Gods children have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many graces, and but one infirmity, this shall be set on the
tenters, all the other hidden: If they can know nothing, they will
devise something; if not, yet if they do but hear any thing flying,
though never so unlikely, and from no ground, yet it goes for good
wares with them, and is received; nay, though they turn their own
vices into vertues, yet the vertues of Gods servants they make vices,
for want of other matter: If they be couragious in a stout cause,
they be stout and stomackful; if they be patient and gentle, then
they be blockish; if wise and prudent in handling their matters,
crafty, subtile fellows; if diligent, very officious; if they take

pains in the offices they be called to, they be busie fellow, meddlers,
and trouble their neighbors; If they differ from others upon never
so good ground, they be Scismaticks, Proud, Singular, Humerous,
Giddy; If they dare not run with others into the same excess of riot,

we should give all diligence to look so to our ways, as we give them
no just occasion so to do,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 12.</note> but take away occasion from them that seek
occasion (for is it time for us to be heedless, and our Enemies as it

words, they think they be cheap, and themselves will speak any
thing, and therefore think others wil do so too, and what can words do
while the works are not seen, or are contrary? Thus <hi>David</hi> confuted
<hi>Saul,</hi> and quitted himself a good Subject: How? not by telling
<hi>Saul</hi> he meant him no hurt (he might have said so as long as he
would, it should never have been regarded) but by his good works,
and innocency towards him, that he never sought his hurt, no not
when he might, as when he cut off the skirt of his Rayment, and
took the pot of water from his head;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 17.</note> This made <hi>Saul</hi> say, <hi>Thou art
more righteous then I,</hi> and for the time broke his heart: This often
doth good, The constancy of mens carriage, overcomes them that
have thought and spoken ill: Many are carried away easily to think
and speak ill of Gods Servants, that know not why, as upon false
suggestions, that after having observed their lives, have changed their
mindes; as a Papist having heard that <hi>Junius</hi> had a cloven foot (as it
was currant among them) coming to the sight of it, and that it was
contrary, he began to suspect their Religion, and it was one means
of his conversion therefrom.</p>
                  <p>This rebukes them,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that being evil spoken of will take it very hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by great words or protestations clear themselves, or shift,
when it may be they are faulty, and give glorious speeches, when
deeds answer not; and such as will be very angry, and rate others,
even before company.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be a matter of great weight, and that the Gospel hear ill
also, we may so do; but yet that is not all nor the most, we must
confute them quietly by a good life, and by all contrary good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>

do any good work, for we are justified by the Righteousness of Christ,
which is absolute and perfect, then follow good works to declare we
be persons justified, by true Faith, apprehending the Righteousness
of Christ; to declare our Election, our Faith to be living, our
selves justified persons, and in the way to Heaven: And are they so

can be expressed! This is the happy day for a man; then Salvation
comes to his house, where none was before: Thus was <hi>Zacheus,</hi> thus
three thousand at one time, thus the Jaylor, thus many among
us are visited;<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 3.</note> O happy visitation, and day to be remembred! We
never see good day, till this day come; we may see merry days, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
days, but never good day till this, without this undone.</p>
                  <p>Let those that have felt it and obtained it,<note place="margin">Use.</note> for ever give glory
to God.</p>
                  <p>3. That a man can never glorifie God,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> till God thus visit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
his Soul;<note place="margin">No man can truly glorifie God till he be converted.</note> for so saith the Text, <hi>That they may glorifie God,</hi> When?
when God shall visit them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore labor for this, for what can we do without it? nothing
but dishonor him,<note place="margin">Use.</note> do not at all glorifie him: O that this were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered!</p>
                  <p>4. That when a man is converted,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> then he will glorifie God;<note place="margin">So soon as a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted he will glorifie God.</note> yea,
he cannot chuse but in heart admire Gods goodness, and love him; in
tongue, break out into his praise of his truth and service; and in his
life seek to glorifie him:<note place="margin">Luke 22. 32.</note> Then will he also do all he can to gain others,
as Christ to <hi>Peter;</hi> as good hide fire in straw from breaking out, and
hold oyl in your hand, as not thus glorifie him when once converted:
They see their case so happily altered, as they never took so much
pleasure in sin, but now it vexeth them as much, and they are as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to glorifie God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when men in heart are not moved,<note place="margin">Use.</note> have no tongue to
praise God, speak of his Truth, call upon others, nor in lives study
to please God, let such know they are yet in their sins, and not in the
number of converted persons.</p>
                  <p>5. That even such as have been ill speakers of the Truth and Gods
servants,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> may yet be converted,<note place="margin">Even the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the Truth may become Converts.</note> and prove good Christians; for
why? God draws his number out of the Devils rabble, for so we
are all by nature: So was <hi>Paul,</hi> yet proved an excellent Christian,
so no question there are some in this company,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 13.</note> that would not now do
that they have done for all the world.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Never despair of them that be very bad,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note> but pray for them,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 3:</note>
give them good counsel;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Who knows what God will do, especially
being come of good Parents? Above all, lead an innocent life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, which may so work with them, as in Gods good time
they may be happily changed.</p>
                  <p>2. This may be an exceeding provocation to the worst,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that they
may prove good and be saved, as unlikely as it is: Me thinks it should
wonderfully move vile wretches to fall down and humble themselves
before God, and never cease till the Lord do as much for them, as for
the Jaylor, and others, seeing it is a thing that may be, and God
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65522:178"/>
hath set down such examples to that end:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13. 16.</note> Thy disease though grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
yet is not irrecoverable, so thou seek to the Physitian of thy
soul in time;<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 18.</note> therefore dispare not: They that seek earnestly, labor,
strive, give all diligence, study, call for wisdom, cry for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and that early, <hi>to day while it is called today;</hi> (and when
God call men to repentance, and points no time, he means the time
present, as in writings between man and man) They that thus seek,
shall finde.</p>
                  <p>3. Yet let none in stead of good take hurt by this,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and heart to go on in
sin, seeing vile persons, and the worst may become converts, and saved
ones (so they may, as they may handle the matter, seeking the Lord
humbly and speedily) for if any think they have not done enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and therefore will go on to adde new sins unto their old, and
that its too soon, and will put off, and presume that they may repent
when they will, and so shall at last; let such know, they shall finde
God a just and severe revenger of all such proud contemners and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptious
persons: O many such shal rounce at Gods mercy-gate, that
shall never come in;<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 12.</note> as the five foolish Virgins; and <hi>Esau,</hi> that sought the
blessing,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 17.</note> though with tears: how many be now in Hel, that had thought
to have repented before their death, and so enjoyed Heaven? No, men
shal know, they shal not despise his mercy at their pleasure, and yet have
it at command:<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Then shall they call upon me</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>but I will not

                     <hi>they shall seek me early, but they shall not finde me:</hi> Therefore,

chiefly of the duties of Inferiors towards their Superiors, namely,
of Subjects to their Magistrates, Servants to their Masters, and in the

                  <p>These Verses,<note place="margin">The parts of these Verses, and that which followeth.</note> with that which followeth, contain the Subjects duty
towards their Magistrates; wherein we have</p>
                  <p>1. An Exhortation, in these words, <hi>Submit your selves to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. An Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> That is, whatsoever kinde of Government you shall
live under, (for all Kingdoms, Countreys, Provinces, Cities, be
not govern'd after the same sort) termed the Ordinance of man, not
because its ordained by man, (for its Gods Ordinance) but because
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65522:178"/>
its proper to man, and is so much for his benefit: This submission
consists as well in our willing bearing their Superiority over us, and
patiently bearing our inferiority under them, as in doing all the
duties of our places to them, and that whether they be worthy of it,
or not: Those are distributed into the Principal and Supreme, the
King, or those that are Subordinate by him, Governors.</p>
                  <p>2. Reasons to enforce the same:<note place="margin">2. Three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to enforce the same.</note> 1. The Lord is the Author of
Magistracy, and requireth our subjection, therefore we ought to yield
thereunto. 2. They are appointed for the great good of Church and
Common-wealth, the punishment of evil doers, and praise of them
that do well, without which no Society or Kingdom can stand. 3. Its
Gods minde that hereby we should put to silence the ignorance of
foolish men.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to the words in particular, consider we two things
in general; The first from the Coherence: As before he would have
them in their whole conversation to behave themselves as Christians,
and exhorted them to a godly life; so he doth now require them to
shew the same in their particular callings, and in those special places
wherein they were put. Whence note, That</p>
                  <p>Every mans duty is to shew his godliness in his particular calling;<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
As the General of a Field appoints every one their places and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,<note place="margin">Every man must shew forth his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in his particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note>
Horsemen, Footmen, Gunners, Pikemen, &amp;c. accordingly
requiring and expecting of each the performance of his duty in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
place: So hath the Lord appointed some Superiors, others In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors;
and accordingly every man must shew his goodness as in all
things, so in his particular calling especially, and be faithful in the trust
reposed in him therein, as one friend should be to another, especially
in great and weighty businesses: Every place whereunto a man is called,
as to be a Husband, Magistrate, Minister, Housholder, &amp;c. hath a
special trust going along therewith; so that whoso will shew himself
godly, if he be a Magistrate, he must be a godly Magistrate; if he
be a Minister, he must be a godly Minister, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was a
godly man, which he shewed in being a godly Housholder; So <hi>Joshua,</hi>
in being a godly, zealous, couragious Captain; So <hi>David, Jehoshaphat
Hezekiah, Josiah,</hi> in being godly Kings, suppressing Idolatry, and
setting up the true worship of God.</p>
                  <p>1. This sheweth and unvizardeth many to be bad which would be
counted honest men;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> They being Magistrates, do (alas) either take
against goodness, and defend evil, or at least like <hi>Gallio,</hi> care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
So being Ministers, have no will, nor skill, gifts or ability
to teach the people, nor give example of true godliness: So Houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
if they be not ill examples of swearing, idle-talking, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning
the Lords-day, and the like, yet make no account to govern
their Families aright, in reading the Word, instructing them therein,
Praying with them, and the like: Therefore let none so think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as of honest men and godly, which be not godly in their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Calling; neither let others commend such for such, though haply
endued with some good qualities: O he is a very honest man!
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65522:179"/>
Its a foolish and lying commendation, whosoever is a godly man,
will be good in his particular Calling: Before they enter thereinto,
they will finde themselves fit for the same, or if they must needs take
the same upon them, they will labor to fit themselves, and therein
(for all are not fitted alike) do their utmost endeavor: So if a man be
godly, he will be a good Housholder, and where Gaming and the
Devils Books were wont to be rife, there have Gods Books read, and
Prayer exercised: Therefore whereas the godliest Preachers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are wont to be blamed, as men that cannot abide Government,
and would pull the Scepter out of the Magistrates hands, (as <hi>Korah</hi>
with his companions) this must needs be a foul slander; for be they
godly men, yea in the conscience of their adversaries, then can they
not but be good Subjects, and are indeed the best Subjects, who pay
to the King according to their ability most willingly, that pray for the
King most often, and heartily, that break fewest of his Laws, and they
lead a godly life, to keep Gods wrath away from the King and Realm,
whereas others live badly, and thereby provoke God against
both.</p>
                  <p>2. Its necessary that men labor first to be godly,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> ere they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their particular Callings: O then would they be godly Magistrates,
Ministers, Housholders; and the contrary is the cause of so much
wrack in Church and Common-wealth. Why be there so many wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Husbands, and lewd and disobedient Wives, so many careless
Housholders, that care not for the souls of their Servants and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and why so many bad Ministers? even because they be bad
men, and have not first endeavored to be holy.</p>
                  <p>The second, The reason why the Apostle is so earnest with them
for duty in the place of Inferiors; Its twofold, partly upon a conceit
that was in the minde of the Gentiles, that Christs Apostles and their
followers were Enemies to Government, and could not abide <hi>Caesar</hi>
(which came to pass as well through wicked men, raised up by the
Devil) which feigning themselves to be holy men, did rebelliously set
themselves against <hi>Caesars</hi> Government,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 37.</note> and drew the people away;
as <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> who feigned himself to be Christ, and was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and perswaded the people, that seeing he was an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Emperor, they needed not pay him tribute: Hereupon when
Christ came,<note place="margin">Matt. 22. 17.</note> he was asked, <hi>Whether it was lawful to give tribute to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
or not;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 23. 2.</note> and notwithstanding of his wise and Subject-like answer,
yet at his arraignment he was accused as an Enemy to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he said he was a King (as indeed he was, though no worldly
King, and his Kingdom and <hi>Caesars</hi> might well enough stand together)
they thought he could not but be <hi>Caesars</hi> Enemy; as for that the wicked
and Heathen Emperors would try their obedience in unlawful things,
as by commanding themselves or their Images to be worshipped (so
were <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children tried) which they not daring to
obey, though they yielded patiently in the punishment inflicted on
them, were therefore counted Rebels (though to try men in bad
things, be no true tryal of believers) and partly, because of a disease
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:65522:179"/>
of the Jews, whereof they were somewhat sick, and in part faulty
(which notwithstanding was not occasioned either through Christ,
his Apostles, or the Gospel) even that they thought they should
not obey these Heathen Magistrates, and the Romane Empire under
which they now were, and that not onely for that they came in
wrongfully, ruled wickedly, and besides were bad men, but by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiving
of the freedom purchased to them by Christ: They
were made free, therefore (thought they) ought not to be bound;
were the children of God, and heirs of HEAVEN, therefore
not to be subject to bad men: For those causes, I say, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
is so earnest, even that hereby he might remove as well
that conceit of the Gentiles, as cure this disease of the Jews.
Hence note,</p>
                  <p>1. That its the duty of Ministers to prevent offences,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> or remove
false conceits out of mens mindes;<note place="margin">Ministers must labor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move false conceits out of mens mindes.</note> and in this particular to teach
the people subjection, to provoke thereto, to practise it in all lawful
things; for the world still hath this conceit of Gods Ministers and
Christians, and that upon the very like grounds (some having risen
up from time to time, that have either had ill causes, or if good, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them very ill, and have been of a railing, scoffing spirit) but let
it be known to all that be so minded, that the faithfullest Ministers and
Christians usually thus slandered, are as true lovers, &amp; as much subject
to Government, as any other whatsoever, and so teach the people, by
whose Ministery people are both brought to be good Subjects, and
likewise to continue in subjection.</p>
                  <p>2. Ministers must speak to the purpose,<note place="margin">Obs.</note> and apply themselves to
the state and necessity of the people they live amongst,<note place="margin">Ministers must apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the state and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of their people.</note> observing
what duties be most neglected, and what sins be rifest among them,
accordingly perswading to the former, and disswading from the latter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man,]</hi> He saith not, Love, that
had been too familiar,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> nor Obey, that had been too straight, but
<hi>Submit</hi> (as elswhere,<note place="margin">The duties of Subjects to their superiors</note> 
                     <hi>be subject</hi>) which comprehendeth both, and
all other duties of Subjects: Those may be referred to these four
heads, Reverence, Obedience, Thankfulness, and Prayer; of every
of which I have heretofore spoken at large. These we had need to
hear of, for whose heart must not needs accuse him, that he hath fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much in them all? needful they are to be known and practised,
that we may procure honor to our Profession, when we declare it by
subjection in all parts thereof, and herein exceed those that know not
God, nor have had the like means of Salvation, as we have: And
had we done our duties better to our Magistrates, no question we
might have enjoyed more good by their means, and so shall for the
time to come, if we make more conscience hereof; yea, its necessary
that women should hear these things, that being Widows, they may
pay such dues as are required of them, or Wives be helpful to their
Husbands in perswading them hereunto, and that willingly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
This condemneth the Anabaptists, as flat opposite to Magistrates
and all these duties.</p>

                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:65522:180"/>
                     <hi>For the Lords sake,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to move us to subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the same.</note> The first Reason to move us to subjection,
God will have it to be so, who hath ordained Magistracy; therefore
though there be nothing in the person to deserve it (yet are they very
bad Magistrates that be not better then none) and though they abuse
their calling, yet do the forenamed duty, for Gods sake who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them: Neither must we do the same, either for fear of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the one side, or hope of reward on the other, but for the
reverence we owe unto God; we must not onely do good things, but
do them on a good ground, and in a right maner.</p>
                  <p>This rebukes the most part,<note place="margin">Use.</note> who, were it not for fear of after claps,
and that they should hear of it, would do nothing, but this is not
thank-worthy; Slaves do thus, and they that thus do, their service
may be beneficial to the Magistrate, but themselves shall have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of their doing, as not proceeding from a right minde: We ought
not to curse (or speak ill of) the King or Magistrate in our thought,<note place="margin">Eccles. 10. 20.</note>
or in our bed-chamber, which yet they cannot come to know, for
God knows it, who will revenge it: We must submit our selves for
conscience sake. This is indeed right obedience, and whereof we may
have comfort.</p>
                  <p>Further,<note place="margin">How the Laws of Magistrates binde us.</note> Magistrates Laws binde us by vertue not of them, but of
God; we must obey them, and all their good Laws binde our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
But why, and how? because they be mens Laws? No;
for no man hath power over the conscience, but by vertue of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the Lord, who hath set them, and given them power
to make Laws for his Worship, and for Civil things agreeable to his
Law, and bid us obey them; so that their Commandments binde
not our conscience by vertue of them, or any power they have over
our conscience, but by vertue of Gods Commandment, and not
otherwise. Again, when any that have no authority from God, shall
give Laws, they binde us not, as not being the parties allowed of
God to make Laws: Thus are not we to obey the Popes Laws, we
are not to obey the Laws which a company of Rebels gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under some great man (as say, <hi>Absolom</hi>) do set forth, they
touch not the conscience; yea, if even right Magistrates that may
make Laws, make wicked ones, contrary to Gods Law, those their
Laws do not binde the conscience.</p>

was it not with the Word of God? This makes nothing for his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

and when he was desired to divide an Inheritance: So these speeches
of our Savior,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 26, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath no Sword, let him sell his Garment and buy
one; and when they said, Lord here are two Swords, he said unto them, It is
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65522:181"/>
enough:</hi> But hereby our Savior doth onely put them in minde of the
danger of the ensuing times, and that they should prepare themselves
for troubles, not that they should otherwise resist then with the
Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God; for afterward when <hi>Peter</hi>
used his material Sword against the Officers,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 52.</note> our Savior willed him
to put up the same: Whatsoever therefore the Pope, or any for him
can alledge, we may safely take the Oath of Supremacy; They that
will not, are not to be trusted for good Subjects.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth the Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that exempt themselves
from all Princes Authority,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> whereas God hath said, <hi>Let every soul
be subject to the higher powers:</hi> If they have souls they must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
But how do they exempt themselves? 1. As they say, <hi>Jure
Divino,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> from that of Saint <hi>Paul, He that is Spiritual, judgeth all things;
yet he himself is judged of no man:</hi> An horrible abuse of the place,
which ayms at no Civil Judgement, but onely at judging by the Spirit
of God of things Divine, which a natural man cannot attain unto;
meaning, that as a Natural man cannot judge of Spiritual things, so
none can judge of a Spiritual man, but he that is indued with the same
Spirit. 2. By the Donation of <hi>Constantine;</hi> but its not in the power
of Princes so to do: They may exempt them from Tribute, if they
will,<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 22.</note> as <hi>Pharoah</hi> took not the Priests Lands to gage for Corn; but to
exempt them from subjection, they cannot. This were to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
wiser then God, who hath put them under their Authority,
yea, the too much indulgence and favor of Emperors, hath been the
bane of the Church, and helpt up the Pope into his stirrop; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its wisdom in them to hold their Authority which God hath
given them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Or unto Governors,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Subordinate Magistrates are also to be obeyed.</note>] A King is but a man, and cannot rule a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by himself, and therefore must have others under him for the
same purpose; in War, Generals, Captains, Lieutenants, &amp;c.
and in Peace,<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note> Judges, Justices, Majors, Baliffs, Sheriffs, Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,<note place="margin">Deut. 16. 18.</note>
&amp;c. accordingly was <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Counsel,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 16.</note> questionless by Gods
direction; accordingly was Gods own prescription, and by him do
they also rule: Such did <hi>Jehoshophat</hi> set throughout all the Cities of his
Land,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 19. 5.</note> City by City: These be the Princes eyes to see, and hands
to execute Judgement, who therefore must be obeyed, even the
meanest of them.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth them that are afraid to commit Treason against
the King,<note place="margin">Use.</note> but for other Magistrates, they care not for them, set light
by them, sometimes outface them: An Officers gown hath been
heretofore more feared, then his person now, so proud and insolent
are youth grown in these lewd times, that with the Judge in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 2.</note>
                     <hi>they neither fear God nor man:</hi> In <hi>Jobs</hi> time, the wicked would
flie from him,<note place="margin">Iob 29. 8.</note> when they saw him; but now tell a company of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards
in an Ale-house, that the Constable comes, what care they;
yea, they will not onely sit still there, but with vile speeches outface
him: This comes to pass partly through the coldness and remisness of
Magistrates, whereby they lose their authority, which is Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65522:181"/>
on them, and partly through the boldness of youth, over in
times past: Let them look to it, they resist not onely the King in
the meanest Officer, but even God and his Ordinance, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to themselves judgement, whom God will pursue, though men
connive at them: Such contemners of Magistrates for the most part
come to the gallows, or such fearful ends.</p>

<hi>The second Reason of the foregoing Exhortation,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its taken from the end of Magistrates,<note place="margin">The end why Magistrates were ordained.</note> appointed for the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of a Commonwealth, even to punish evil doers, commend and
defend the good, without which no Kingdom could stand; as there
could be no garden, if all the Hogs in the Town were suffered to root
it up; no orchard, if Cattel were suffered to eat it off the buds, and
bark of the trees, &amp;c. so that unless we be vipers, and seek the ruine
of our Countrey, we cannot but acknowledge the benefit we get
by Magistrates, and accordingly perform our duties towards
them.</p>
                  <p>As they are to make good Laws,<note place="margin">Use.</note> both for the worship of God,
tending to his glory, and the Salvation of their peoples Souls, and
the preservation of Justice and Peace (wherein Mercy and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are to meet together) and are to justifie the Righteous,<note place="margin">Psal. 101. 1.</note> and
condemn the wicked (as good gardiners pull up the weeds,<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 1.</note> but che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
good herbs) whereby vertue may flourish by due encouragement,
and vice may be suppressed by due punishment: So must we accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
behave our selves towards them for their encouragement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the punishment of evil doers,]</hi> God is a just God, who both hates
and punisheth sin;<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 7.</note> so must Magistrates do, they have not the Sword
for nought:<note place="margin">Magistrates must punish evil doers.</note> It must not be as a childes Dagger, never drawn out, or
rust in the scabberd, as those hanged up in our houses in the times of
Peace: <hi>Samuel</hi> hewed <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces, <hi>Joshua</hi> put <hi>Achan</hi> to death,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65522:182"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> was zealous this way:<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note> Magistrates must be men of courage,<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 2.</note> and
must punish the wicked according to their fault;<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 30. and 29. 15.</note> This is the ready
way to bring them to repentance (as the rod and correction gives life
to a childe) and keep others from the like faults.<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 21.</note> Thus was the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
son to be stoned, that all <hi>Israel</hi> might hear and fear: Hereby
also they stay the cry of sin, and so provide for Gods glory, and safety
both of Church and Commonwealth: If they smite not, God will,
as <hi>Elies</hi> sons and <hi>Agag.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh the wonderful coldness of most Magistrates,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
that care not whether they have any ill doers brought before them, if
they can shift it off; or if they be brought, yet handle them so gently,
that not onely that are not the more reformed, but the more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
in their wickedness, and such as complained of them quite
discouraged;<note place="margin">See Eccle. 8. 11</note> a fearful thing. Thus under colour of mercy, sin is
encreased, God dishonored, the Commonwealth marred: Thus
whereas they might do much good, they do much hurt to others,
they hurt also themselves; as <hi>Saul</hi> in sparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> in
sparing <hi>Benhadad:</hi> How will Magistrates answer this? God calls,
Who is on my side?<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 126.</note> Who? he looks who will help him against the
mighty; assuredly its now time for him to work: O let Magistrates
look to this, they shall provide well for themselves against the time
of need, they may look for help from God, and say as <hi>Nehemiah,
Remember me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 13. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord my God, in goodness, according to all that I have done:</hi>
This is also the sin of Headboroughs and Constables, that are not
zealous to finde out such, and complain of them, but rather cold, loath
to stir for being counted medlers,<note place="margin">Ier. 9 3.</note> &amp;c. so that we may say, men have
no courage for the Truth,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 4.</note> and no man calleth for Justice: And thus
they make themselves work while they shun it, for so sin encreaseth,
and will set them on work whether they will or not.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh also all such as take part with persons and causes;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
There's no Town but hath vile persons in it; there's none so vile, but
lightly one rich man or other that should joyn to punish him, takes
part with him: If they cannot scape the curse that help not the Lord
against the mighty,<note place="margin">Iudg. 5. 23.</note> what shall become of them that help the mighty
against the Lord, and all that seek to punish them? a threefold curse
waiteth for them, and where shall they appear?</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Magistrates should stand for well-doers</note> God loves and rewards well
doing; so should Magistrates, they must defend and advance such;
their eyes must be upon the faithful in the Land,<note place="margin">Isa. 32. 1, 2, &amp;c.</note> and with <hi>Cornelius,</hi>

come with complaints to them,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> neither shew any countenance to
such.</p>
                  <p>2. Much more them that set themselves against those:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> O its a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
time, when the best be most afraid and punisht! As <hi>Micaiah</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned

in a Dungeon, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> deprived of his means, <hi>Daniel</hi> cast into

do well, yet its often so; so it was in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest

should lead and binde us, I have heretofore proved at large on the

other particulars, so ought to prevail with us in this duty of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That with well doing ye may put to silence,</hi> &amp;c.] Of good works what
they be, and how needful they are, I have spoken on verse 12. adde
we here one end more; Namely, that</p>
                  <p>Good works,<note place="margin">The godly through their good works stop the mouthes of bad minded persons.</note> or a godly innocent life in obedience to Magistrates,
and all things else is of necessity to stop up the mouthes of bad minded
persons that wait for offences: Every one that professeth, must know
that he hath many eyes on him, that watch him narrowly, and some
very badly minded, our duty is to take away all matter of ill talk from
them; as if the wood be taken away, the fire goeth out; and if the
water run not, the Mill goes not: By well-doing we stop up their
mouthes, as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Sauls,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> his accusers: Or if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stop their mouthes, but that they will needs talk, yet that they
may have no just cause to speak ill of us, but though in general terms
they make a railing, yet being urged in particular to tell what we have
done, or with what they can chargeus, or what sin we live in, or what
corruption we yield to, which we strive not against, they may be
driven to silence.</p>
                  <p>This rebukes the wonderful carelesness of some Christians, that
walk so losely, and lie so open, as the wicked have their will, even
matter enough to talk of their covetousness, of their wonderful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
and the like; such had need to repent much, and by the
contrary to labor by their well-doing to stop their mouthes, which
they have justly opened against Religion and the professors thereof:

ready to rail and speak ill of Religion, and open their mouthes
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65522:183"/>
against the Professors of the Gospel, even ignorant foolish
men.</p>
                  <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> but many be great men for Wit, and Parts, and Learning, that
do thus.</p>
                  <p>Its all one,<note place="margin">R.</note> such they be, and no other; They that will rail at a
Trade for the fault of a Tradesman, and condemn all of a Trade, for
the fault of some one of that Profession, might they not be taxed of
ignorance and folly? So what ignorance and foolishness is it in a
number to speak ill of the way of God, and of the Word Preached,
and of the Preachers thereof, and all for the fault of some that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess

not; one brings Religion thus complaining, I Religion am a meer

He is a fool that being condemned of Treason, and yet in possibility
to get a pardon, defers to sue for it till it be too late; such are the
wicked that put off their repentance: He is a fool that will laugh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in extream danger, or being told he is going to execution, doth
jest at it, yea, if it were but to the stocks, or house of correction; yet
thus do the wicked every day go nearer and nearer the place of their
torment: A fool hates those that tell him he is in danger, and would
help him out of it, and can sleep soundly, though it be told him the
house is on fire over his head; yet thus do the wicked, being told of
their sins, and their danger thereby.</p>

natural man to do any good, as for a bramble to bear grapes or figs;
nay, which is worse, and makes up our bondage, we cannot see we be
in this case, believe when we be told it, desire to come out of it, as
being weary thereof; nay, we delight in it, think it the onely liberty,
spend body, goods, name, soul, and all in the service of it, the basest

this yet is worst, that we like of it, and liberty being offered, we loath
it. No vassal among the Turks that hath been there never so long,

way to free us,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> and that was by Jesus Christ, who hath procured our
liberty and makes us free.</p>
                  <p>This is called Christian liberty,<note place="margin">Believers are made free by Christ.</note> because its purchased by Christ
for Christians, namely Believers, and no others: Its a Spiritual and holy
freedom, not Civil, such as the Jews looked for (even great advancement
in an earthly Kingdom) or the Anabaptists dream of, which shake off
Magistracy; nor Carnal, such as that of the Libertines, which live
as they list in all silthiness;<note place="margin">Wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty consists.</note> and procured it is by Christ alone, no
other could do it: It stands in these four things, 1. Through Christ
we are freed from the wrath and curse of God, and all the punishment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of our sins here, and hereafter; and this he hath done by his precious
blood,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 19.</note> having redeemed us, and became also a curse for us:<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 4, &amp;c.</note> He was
arraigned before a worldly Judge,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> that we might not be arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judge of the whole world; He was condemned, that we
might be absolved; He dyed, that we might live; He hath become
our surety, and so freed us from the wrath and justice of God, and
his payment was most royal, because he was God, and by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
he declared that it was full and perfect;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> So that now to all
that believe in him, there is no condemnation: It hath nothing to do
with them; for though God be just, and will have it once paid, yet
not unjust to require it twice. 2. We are freed from the service of Sin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and the Devil, which he hath done by the vertue of his Word and
holy Spirit, working faith in our hearts: So Regenerating and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
us, washing us in his blood, enlightening our understandings,
renewing our wills, reforming our affections and whole man, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a quite change from that was before, an hatred of the sin that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was onely loved, a love to the good that before was not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yea of all sin, and of all good, with some power to resist and
overcome the one, and perform the other; so that though Satan tempt
us, yet shall he not have us at command as before, though our heart
and flesh lust after evil, yet the Spirit resisteth it, and provoketh to
good, and sin reigneth in us no longer: Thus were <hi>Zacheus,</hi> the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> quite altered from that they were before:
So among our selves, through Gods goodness, they that understood
nothing to purpose, are now enlightened and ashamed of themselves
in respect of their former conversation, hate their sins and old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and are turned to love God, and to delight in his Word,
Saints, Prayer, good Duties, have tongues that cannot now speak
for their liyes as before, but are ready to speak gracious words, which
before they could not;<note place="margin">Isa. 32. 3, 4. &amp; 35. 4, 5.</note> and where before they were lame to any good,
now they are active, and can finde their legs now to carry them to
goodness; but we are only thus freed in part: we cannot do what we
would, &amp; as we would, and oftentimes also we do also what we would
not, yet shall we draw vertue from God by his Spirit in the daily use
of the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, to be more and more freed
therefrom, till at last we shall attain the same, even perfect freedom
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65522:185"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in glory for ever. 3. We are freed from the rigor of the Moral Law,
and the uttermost extremity of it, which of the unbeliever is exacted,
but on the behalf of Believers is taken away by Christ, so that though
in them there be many wants, yet God in Christ Jesus will accept the
will for the deed; he will accept of their hearts, and of the truth of
their actions, pardoning their infirmities: Hence it is that now they flee
not from the Law as a cruel Tyrant, but come thereto, as to a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
to instruct them in Gods will.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> 4. We are freed from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Law, whereof the Sacraments, Sacrifices, Rites, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings,
&amp;c. were meer shadows till the body came: So from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,<note place="margin">See Gal. 5. 1.</note>
in all things indifferent, as meats, drinks, days, and the like,
which were rudiments serving for the minority of the Church:<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note>
There is now no indifferent thing we are bound in for Religions sake,
or from which we are to abstain for conscience sake; much more are
we freed from all mens Traditions, which serve not to binde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
wherewith notwithstanding the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to hold people in base and deadly bondage (as the Scribes and
Pharisees of old) and that for Conscience and Religions sake: <hi>The
Kingdom of God is not meat nor drink,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> neither if we eat are we the
more acceptable, or if we eat not, the less.</p>
                  <p>1. This is a wonderful consolation to every Christian;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> whoso
can prove themselves Believers, they are the onely happy persons in
the world, they onely are free: Art thou such a one? be of good
comfort, there's no condemnation to thee; though thou hast been
stung with sin, yet seeing thou hast had grace to look up to Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
thou art cured, Christ hath dyed for thee, thou shalt not perish,
but have life everlasting, Who shall lay any thing to thy charge?
Christ hath paid thy debt to the uttermost farthing; when therefore
the conscience of thy sin troubles thee, with the danger thereof, and
the Devil pursueth thee with temptations, O then look up to thy Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
stick to him, he hath perfectly discharged thee! Though there be
a Hell wide and large, and the burning thereof as it were fire and much
wood, which the breath of the Lord as a River of Brimstone doth
kindle, and wherein thou hast deserved to have thy portion, yet there
thou shalt not come, Christ hath given a discharge for every one that
believeth in him: Thou art humbled, the Spirit of God beareth
witness to thine, that thou art Gods, and thou findest in thy self the
fruits of faith; be of good comfort, God can as soon deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as that thou shalt perish: O what cause have we to thank God
for Christ Jesus, and all the means whereby we came to faith, and
to be Christians! we can have no curse in this world (crosses for
good, are no curses) death shall do us no hurt, yea turn to our espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
good: Art thou a Believer? then art thou no longer the Servant
of sin, to be at the command, and follow it in the lusts thereof; though
thou canst not do as thou wouldest, yet having thine understanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,
thy will and affections reformed, and thine heart changed,
&amp;c. thou hast a blessed freedom, a pledge indeed of that perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
thou shalt have in Heaven; yet labor every day to be more freed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65522:185"/>
from the bondage of thy corruption, and set at liberty to serve God;
And is it not a wonderful comfort, <hi>that we may offer up Spiritual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ?</hi> and that we are enabled
in some measure to do the will of God, and that with delight; and
that our works, though imperfect and done in weakness, yet being
done in Truth are accepted of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>who hath compassion on us, as a
father on his son:</hi> He that is indeed a true Believer, is the onely free
person in the world, so free as nothing can make him otherwise;
let him be bound with sickness, with poverty, with imprisonment,
let him be tyed hand and foot, let him be chained about the neck to
a prison wall, &amp;c. yet is he free; free from sin and damnation, free
from the bondage of the Devil, is a conqueror over temptations,
hath a free minde to serve God, and even then with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and
the three children, can sing and laud his name: O praise God for
this, walk thankfully and joyfully, love the word, and search it,
where these blessed prerogatives and priviledges be enrolled: Its a
great fault we rejoyce no more herein, especially considering the
price that our freedom cost.</p>
                  <p>2. For them that cannot prove themselves Believers;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> O let them
labor to have a part in this freedom.<note place="margin">Acts 22. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome</hi> had great priviledges, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many sought and that with great sums to be free of it: When
the Jews were freed from <hi>Hamans</hi> conspiracy,<note place="margin">Ester 8. 17.</note> and had the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
many become Jews; O so, me thinks, many should desire to
become Christians, that they may partake of this freedom, which is
more to be desired then the whole world: Till you be freed by Christ,
you are in woful bondage;<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>When the Son shall make you free, then shall
you be free indeed,</hi> till which time you are bound indeed, and that in a
fearful maner; the curse of God follows you whithersoever you go
or ride; you go not over a stile, but you may break your neck; get
up on your horses, but you may receive some deadly blows to send
you to Hell; take tools in your hands, but you may mischief your
selves thereby, you may be swallowed up as <hi>Korah,</hi> drowned as
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> burnt with fire from Heaven as <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> eat up with
worms as <hi>Herod:</hi> Being unbelievers, you have no warrant to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
every minute you hang over the pit of Hell, for whom it gapeth:
You are also slaves of the Devil, at his command, and do base work
for a woful master, whose wages will be accordingly: But this the
world will not believe, they dream not of Spiritual bondage, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consider that their hearts are fast locked in unbelief; were they
sensible hereof, they would seek by all means to be rid of the same,
they would be afraid even to sleep this night, lest Hell should catch
them ere they awoke, lest their souls should be fetched from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this condition: O never be quiet till you know your selves
freed by Christ; to this end humble your selves, confess your deadly
bondage, bewail it to God, cry for pardon, rest not till you receive
a gracious answer; never leave waiting on God in his Word, and
craving his Spirit, till he change your hearts, and make you free,
whence will spring peace of Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost:

not they should stretch their liberty further then was meer, or abuse

creatures of God, but even his holy Ordinances, and the very best
things are subject to be abused: The Gospel was foolishness to the
world, and Christ Jesus himself a stone whereat many did stumble:
Thus the Doctrine of Predestination, many turn to a desperate course
of doing what they list: The Doctrine of Gods great mercy most
take as an emboldening to sin; so is the Doctrine of Justification by
Faith onely, and of Christian liberty abused unto licentiousness:
Even the Apostles writings were by some wrested to their own
condemnation.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Seeing our nature is so apt to abuse such things,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> it behoves the
Ministers of God to pray to God for wisdom, that they may deliver
wisely and warily as all points of Doctrine, so especially those that
are most apt to be abused: They must so handle the Doctrine of Gods
judgements against the wicked, that the godly humble be not dismaid;
and so comfort the godly, that the wicked be not emboldened, but
each have his portion that's due to him.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh as in general all such as shall thus abuse any holy
things of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> so in particular all abusers of Christian liberty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such as turn it into carnal licentiousness (as the Familists and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,
and too too many in this Land, in solemnizing the Feast of
our Saviors Nativity) or such as turn it into civil liberty, and freedom
from civil subjection,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 6.</note> as of old the Jews (which looked for earthly
priviledges and immunities by Christ) and of late the Anabaptists:
How many hearing that we are freed by Christ from the rigor of the
Law, make no more account of it, as though a believer freed from
the curse and rigor of it, were not yet under it while he lives? How
many make Religion a cloak for their naughtiness and whoredoms,
being very diligent at Sermons, and outwardly very devout, that
they might be the less suspected? as the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>which
devoured widows houses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and under colour made long prayers?</hi> How many
hearing that the Ceremonial Law is abrogated by Christ, will not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65522:186"/>
therefore read any part thereof; nay scarce any of the Old Testament,
shaking off the Testimonies cited out of it, ignorantly saying, O the
old Law is abolished. How many now hearing that we be not under
the bondage of any thing indifferent, rush out into all excessive
and vile abuse of the same, without keeping any bounds, or going by
any rule? They will eat and drink excessively at all times, wear what
apparel they list, without respect of their degree for the matter of it, or
the fashion for the maner: So for recreations, they dare run unto those
that be unlawful, and use those that be lawful without all bounds of
moderation.</p>
                  <p>But of the use of things indifferent,<note place="margin">Three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strainers of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</note> there be three restrainers, Gods
Words, The Laws of Magistrates, and the rule of Charity: Gods
Word, where are rules whereby to guide us in the use of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
as that they be decent, of good report, done to edifying, used
in sobriety and modestly, tend to the glory of God; and to make us
fitter for duties.</p>
                  <p>The Laws of Magistrates, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical; for if
they command in things indifferent, and be so in their use also as well
as their nature, and be according to the rules of the Word, then
they are by the Magistrates commandment made necessary,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 28.</note> as for
abstinence from flesh not for Religion, but civil respects: So if
they forbid men to wear silk upon some special causes, or to hunt
within such a compass; these were before indifferent, but now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
                  <p>The rule of charity; we must not use indifferent things to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of our weak brother,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 13, 15, 19.</note> or to cause him stumble, or hinder him
any way in the course of his Salvation: Indeed for obstinate ones that
will not be perswaded,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 2.</note> we are not bound to respect them;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 28.</note> as <hi>Paul,</hi> that

                  <p>Our Christian liberty is an holy thing, precious indeed and dear:
O let's not abuse it, let's not suffer our selves to be intangled again with
sin, or the works of the Devil, and fashions of the world, from which
Christ hath freed us! Neither let us suffer our selves to be made the
Servants of men,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 23.</note> or to be brought into subjection of mens Traditions,
or the superstitious use of things indifferent (as the Papists thus hold
poor people in bondage) it cost Christ a dear price to purchase our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:<note place="margin">Col. 2. 16.</note>
Contrarily,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> Take heed we abuse it not to wantonness and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,

doth not exempt us from subjection to Magistrates: Christian liberty,

no bondage, but the happiest liberty that may be; Comfort and joy
accompanies this service for the present, whereof the end will be life
everlasting: Not to serve thus, but to be under the service of sin, is
of all others the basest bondage.</p>
                  <p>As therefore we would serve the Lord with all our might,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and shake
off all tediousness and wearisomness that comes upon us in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of any duties, whether private or publique, and would zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
and chearfully run the way of his commandments, do we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our freedom (who were sometimes the lackies of the Devil) from
what, and by what price are we freed; let's remember what service
we have done for sin in the days of our vanity, and now as much, or
rather more for the Lord; we thought it no burthen to sin all day
long, and must not now to be godly all the day long; we have
forgotten our meat for play, and yet thought the time short; yea,
have sate up whole Nights at Cards and Dice, and have spent a
good part of our Goods, and taken great pains to do evil, and
should it now be irksome unto us to serve the Lord? far be it
from us.</p>

concern the duties which we owe each to other, which following
upon that which we are to perform towards Magistrates, implieth this
much; That</p>
                  <p>To reverence and obey our Governors is not sufficient,<note place="margin">They are good Subjects which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey their Magistrates, but live well one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> no not to
make us good subjects, except we also live well one with another; for
as the members both of the Natural and Spiritual body are not onely
coupled and joyned to the head, but also each to other, so according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are we in duty bound to both: Not onely do Children obey their
Parents, Servants their Masters, and Subjects their Governors, but
they must also live orderly and respectively between themselves one
with another:<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 28.</note> He that doth not thus, cannot be a good Subject; He
that shall deal injuriously with his fellow-subjects, wrongeth his
Prince (whose welfare dependeth on the multitude and flourishing state
of his Subjects) whether it be in body, goods, name or life; he wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

much they wrong them; How will some prophane desperate wretches
of brazen faces, by their songs and lying Libels misuse both rich

And are there not others close fisted (like the rich man in the Gospel)
that will be careful to keep out of danger of the Magistrate,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 20.</note> and do
their duties to them, but despise all others; partly blessing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this; that they live of no body, are beholding to none,
have no need of any, and partly of a base minde, onely seeking
themselves, and regarding no body else, oppressing and griping whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they catch? Neither of these be either good Christians or

contention or vain glory: This is indeed one of the hardest things
in the world,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> because of the pride that is naturally in us, but if we
look for this grace of humility, it may be obtained, even by seeing
others vertues and our own frailties and infirmities, we shall come to
this in truth, esteeming others better then our selves. 2. We must in
giving honor go one before another;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note> modesty is a great cherisher of
love, neither is there a more deadly poison to peace and agreement, nor
greater mean to stir up contention and hatred, then when any shal think
themselves despised: What a folly and madness is it in numbers that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65522:188"/>
so strive for seats and places, or that sometimes they cannot contain
even in the publique and holy place, to justle for the wall, or the way?
What deadly hatred ariseth between many about such things, that
they can never be reconciled? Alas, This is not the way to honor,
as which flieth further from those that do most run after it: If in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty

be heirs of glory as well as we. Besides, as the meanest member of
the body could not be spared, so could not we be without them; they
toil, dig, delve, card, spin, &amp;c. Thus will they do their duty the
more chearfully, and bear the place of their Inferiority, when they
shall see themselves, though mean, yet not despised, which else might
occasion in them discontent and impatience, and increase their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
which they do already think to be heavy enough; we must be
so far from being harsh, cruel, or strange to them, as that we ought to
hear them speak, and regard their counsel; if they be persons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and good carriage, as often as the Lord-will, let an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior

the other:<note place="margin">2 King. 5. 13.</note>

when they contended with him: True it is, Superiors are not to

                  <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Our selves.</note> a man is bound to honor himself, for he is the workmanship
of God, he may not therefore defile or abuse himself at his pleasure:
He must therefore keep his hands free from cruelty and oppression, his
tongue from lying, swearing, railing, mocking, as his whole body
from evil and filthiness:<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 4.</note> Its Gods will that we should possess our
vessels in holiness and honor, we must not disgrace or deface the work
of the Lord;<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 27.</note> they that thus do, shall not enter into Heaven, for no
unclean thing shall come there: And as we desire to procure honor
unto our selves, we must labor in all things to honor God, and in all
our doings aym at his glory; them that thus do, God will honor:
Contrarily, they that seek themselves, and not God, in that that they
do, living even openly to his dishonor, and not regarding at all to
glorifie him, disgrace and shame shall be cast on them; the honor
they seek flies furthest from them, yea, such have often fearful and
shameful ends: Dishonoring God, he dishonoreth them; and as we
are to labor to be approved of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 2.</note> so also to have good report in
the Church of God;<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 7. and 22. 1.</note> for a good name is greatly to be respected,
is of much worth, and an especial blessing of God. Thus as men
are to us.</p>

we are to honor:<note place="margin">We are to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor both good and bad according to their places.</note> 
                     <hi>Honor all men</hi> (saith the Apostle) good, bad, Jews,
Gentiles, Believers, Unbelievers, Regenerate, Unregenerate, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
Pagans, &amp;c. for the good there is no doubt, and that is to be
spoken of in the next Exhortation, but the doubt and difficulty is of
the bad, how and why we must honor them: We must have a good
respect to all,<note place="margin">Even in them that are most bad, there's something to be regarded.</note> though not to all alike; and there are none so bad, but
there is something in them to be regarded, some scratch of Gods
image; if ancient men, an image of Gods eternity, reverence that,
and speak to them as to aged men; if wealthy, an image of Gods
infinite abundance; if wise to manage matters of the world, reverence
Gods wisdom; if a Father or Master, an image of Gods Fatherhood
and Authority: Besides, they have many active parts of good use, for
Peace or War, by Sea and Land, are skilful in the Tongues, in Arts
and Sciences, are Civil, Kinde, Courteous, Pitiful, and the like;
for every of which we are to honor them, to reverence them, to give
them their due,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>so much as in us lies living peaceably with them:</hi> In
their prosperity we must use them friendly in all points of Neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
Lending, Borrowing, Commercing, Dealing Justly and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
with them, to bring them to the love of Religion; in their
adversity we must be helpful to them; if hungry, give them meat; if
thirsty, drink; if naked, raiment; at all times give them a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
pray for them, and give them their due for any thing that's in
them,<note place="margin">Iames 3. 16.</note> that they may see themselves regarded, not despised, and so
keep peace, holding out contention, which is the floodgate of all
evil: Thus dealing well with them, and walking wisely towards
them, we may bring them in time to a liking and love of Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore for Christians,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> let them not reject men altogether
whom they see to be bad, but give them their due, we know not what
good may come by our amiable and wise carriage towards them; but
if we shall despise them, we do thereby harden them against us and
Religion too.</p>
                  <p>2. For them that be yet carnal,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> let them labor for grace, which
deserves true and large honor: If God will have you regarded for
your natural parts, how will both he himself honor you, and cause
you also to be honored of others, having grace? ye see Christians
use you kindely and respectively for your common and natural gifts,
O how should they embrace you, if they saw the lively image of
God in you?</p>

to godly men, to the true servants of God: These we must embrace
with an intire and hearty affection; we must love all, and do good unto
all, but especially unto the Brotherhood; brotherly kindeness, which
is a very natural and intire inward affection, is due to the children of
God. Speak we first of love to their persons, then to their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Company.</p>
                  <p>For their persons;<note place="margin">We are to love the persons of Gods children</note> We must love them with a more then ordinary

the same Savior, our eldest Brother Christ Jesus, and look also for the
same Inheritance in Heaven, and is not this very near? They are also
members of the same body that we be, fellow-members with us,

glory, the world was made for them, and abides for their sakes: If
a man saw the honor of a Christian and Childe of God, he would
fall down before him, and kiss the ground he stands on.</p>

and hath rebuked even Kings for their sakes; He that toucheth

we should also love, yea whatsoever is done to them, good or ill, he
counts it as done to himself.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those that are so far from thus affecting them,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as
that of all persons they cannot away with them, but mock them, as

Tales of them as <hi>Doeg,</hi> persecute them as <hi>Saul,</hi> seek to entrap them,
as the Scribes, Pharisees, and Herodians, yea and like <hi>Judas</hi> betray
them; of this sort all places are full, neither is there any so base in a
Town, or so ignorant that he cannot say the Lords-Prayer, but he can
mock and rail on them that make conscience of their ways; yea, the
Devil is such a cunning School-master, as that though we can beat
nothing into some mens heads they be so blockish, yet the Devil can
teach them to be very expert to jest at them that fear God; and this
hath ever been the fashion of the world: They hate men for their
goodness, and the better they be, the worse they like them; whom
whil'st they were prophane, companions with them in disorder, they
were the onely men with them, Why were <hi>Abel, David,</hi> our Savior
himself hated, but for their goodness? If they pretend that they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
them, and speak against them for this or that fault, its but for a
colour, for why then do they like and nourish the same things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and those like themselves? Neither can such things be found
in Gods people, as are daily palpable in them and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
Its therefore because the light of the godlies good conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
discovers their ill deeds, which (were the others like them) would
not be seen, or taken knowledge of: O the fearful condition of such!
If he shall dwell in Gods Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4.</note> in whose eyes a vile person is

people: Though ye have no minde to be as they are, yet misuse them
not, for he that loveth them and will take their part, is mighty, and
hath been revenged of Kings for their sakes: But if you will be wise
indeed, labor to be such, who are therefore set up, either that you
should follow them, or else that they should be your Judges, as <hi>Noah</hi>
in condemning the old world: If you will needs continue to despise
them, yet know that the time shall come, when you shall desire to be
as they, but it shall be far from you: Haply even in this life, when
you shall be visited with sickness,<note place="margin">Num. 23. 10.</note> or in some other extremity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,

selves cast out into eternal torments, you would be glad hereof:
But you must not think to be as <hi>Dives</hi> in this world, and as <hi>Lazarus</hi>

ye see it, and the people of God, though never so poor and mean,
yea, more then them that are in gold Chains without grace! Shew
your inward affection towards them, by rejoycing in their welfare,
grieving at the contrary, living peaceably with them, doing them
all the good you can, or they stand in need of, whether in soul or

one member from another? and is it not a great distemper, when one

nor Ministers: But we have not onely a true, but a worthy Church,
that maintain all Principles of true Religion as soundly, as any
Church in the world, as in our Articles of Religion appeareth. We
have also Ministers inwardly called of God, with competency of
gifts, and graced of him by the fruit of their labors, in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of thousands of souls, which is a good seal of their Ministery
from Heaven; and if these have any good in them, where had they
it, but from those Ministers, and that Church from which they now
separate, and on which they most unchristianly rail as Antichristian?
to whom our Church may say indeed, Give me that which you have
had of me, and then go your ways, and see what will become of you:
What an ungracious part were it in a Son (if being grown to some
years, and able to shift for himself) he should turn, and miscalling his
Father, spit on his face, calling also his Mother Harlot and Whore,
and then running away from them, when he should shew his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to them? No less ungracious are these men.</p>
                  <p>2. It rebuketh those prophane ones,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that cannot abide the company
of Gods people, think an hour there as long as a day elswhere, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
such a Family a prison, wherein theres reading the Word, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing,
Prayer, and the like duties; yea, when they should be in
the house of God, they will be at home, or in some Alehouse, or
walking abroad in the Fields, or loytering in the Church-yard; or if
they come, its to no purpose, as being against their mindes: such
straglers are in danger of the Devil, out of Gods protection, and
may fall into any evil; What blinde beasts be these, that count that a
prison, that is comfort and joy, true and sweet liberty? Well, if they
will not walk with them while they live, their end shall not be like
theirs; sever'd in life, sever'd in death.</p>
                  <p>But what? have they no company then? Yes, to swagger, swill,
swear, game, and to all maner of disorder, as well on the Lords-day, as
other times: There's a great deal of such fellowship in this Land, falsly
called good fellowship; indeed hellish fellowship, whereof not God,
but the Devil is the Author, and Master of the meeting; little bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
fellowship, except it be as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> brethren in evil:
O the drunken fellowship of these times! Some are mad and beastly
drunkards,<note place="margin">Isa. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.</note> others (to whom there's also a wo) strong to pour in
strong drink, glorying in making others drunk, but their glory is to
their shame, and their end will be damnation. How few Gentlemens
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65522:191"/>
houses can you come to, wherein its not the glory of Serving-men to
make those drunk whom they can get into the Cellar, and thereupon
rejoyce? Poor woful Creatures, that little think, that for this they
shall one day come to Judgement, and their jollity be requited with
everlasting torments in Hell: If they must answer for every idle word,
and for such pleasures (though in themselves not unlawful) wherein
they have regarded neither time, place, person, measure, nor end,
how much more for their wicked companionship, in Swearing, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheming,
filthy talking, Prophaning the Lords-day, and the like?
Such would one day give the whole world, if they had it, for one
hour to repent, but in vain: They now treasure up wrath to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and as they now delight in evil company, so shall it be said
unto them, <hi>Go ye cursed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. There, there shall they enjoy
their company in whom they have so much delighted, but to their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Torment.</p>
                  <p>3. It rebuketh a marvellous fault in Christians,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that so little regard
one another, so seldom meet together, or when they do, spend the
time to small purpose, not edifying one another as they should do:
Some through Pride are so conceited of their parts, as if they did not
stand in need of any, as others think themselves too good to converse
with any, and others through covetousness, will not spare any time
this way: But time was, when Christians made much one of another,
and often in simplicity and plain-heartedness, met together to talk of
good things, and to further and strengthen one another, and then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
prospered, and people grew in grace; but now, though there
be more knowledge, there is less zeal, and true-heartedness, and this is
the cause of the decay of goodness amongst ancienter Christians; when
the brands are pulled in sunder, and the heat decays, the fire goes out:
Welfare our yonger Christians which cling together. Beware, you
that have been long professors, lest they that set out after you, outstrip
you, and go far before you, which many may see to your shame: O
is it not pitiful that when Christians meet, the time should be spent
in worldly talk without ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, or in vain idle frothy talk of News, or
other folks matters, and things of no edifying! This comes to pass
sometimes through want of matter, their hearts being barren of good
things; sometimes for that their hearts and mindes are earthy, and
delight not in those things: Hence it cometh to pass that Christians
become the worse one for anothers company, not a few leaving an ill
example and savor behinde them to the poysoning of others; this is
hard in Christians, let us strive by all means that this may be amended.</p>
                  <p>To this end these Rules are to be observed by Christians in their
private meetings:</p>
                  <p>1. That they do not hereby neglect their Callings to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
of their families (except it be an extraordinary case of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viness
of minde,<note place="margin">Rules to be observed by Christians in their private meetings.</note> when a poor soul for a while will borrow a little of
the body, as he hath beguiled the soul before, so to procure comfort)
for thus shall they open the mouthes of bad people against Religion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
as if it made men idle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:65522:192"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Break up at reasonable times, and that for avoiding of offence,
especially if there be other then our own Family, yet as often we sit
up till midnight at Cards, &amp;c. so at some times we may take more
liberty herein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Keep within bounds for the business in hand; they must not
meddle above their reach, as some in expounding the Scriptures,
plunge themselves over head and ears; they must wade (as the Lamb)
as far as they see ground, to presume further is dangerous, and leadeth
into Error, besides the abuse of Scripture: Neither must they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with Church-Government, and matters of controversie; its the
Devils policy to set such things abroach, to hinder more profitable
matter, and that there may be jangling, no godly edifying: In stead
of these, they must confer about points lately heard, or about their
own spiritual conditions, doubts, temptations, and the like, or about
the lets and means of faith, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Though there should fall out some differences, yet they must
not fall out in wrangling and contention, but (though they are in the
right) break off for the time to avoid contention: Neither must any
be so conceited, as to stand upon their own wit and skill, but refer
themselves unto those which have their senses exercised to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
truth and error.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. That none desire to have all the speech, but be willing also to
hear others, for some that are not so forward in speech, may yet put
in his part to as good purpose, as they that think well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. That they avoid medling with other folks matters, or censuring
others (this is an ill use of meeting together) especially their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Sermons, wherein they should take every thing well that may be
so taken; and before they blame any thing, they must be sure they
understand, and are not deceived or mistaken; yea, and then it must
rather be humility to inform one another, then to censure them with
over-much harshness and boldness, and to blaze the same abroad to
their disgrace: Many through their indiscretion do their Ministers
much hurt, and put them into strange courses of invectives (whom in
meekness they might easily win) and so mar a good cause with ill han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling.

3. Magistrates are to trust those most,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> which do most fear God,
and accordingly to use them kindely and countenance them, as being
indeed their most loyal Subjects; yea, to further the Gospel what in
them lies, whereby people may be brought to fear God, that so they
may prove true and loyal to themselves, and so adde strength to the
Kingdom: Thus of the coherence.</p>
                  <p>For the words themselves, <hi>Honor the King,</hi> I have already spoken
at large of the duty contained herein: Know we onely, that by the
King here, is meant <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was an Heathen Emperor, one that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
himself, ruled tyrannously, and was an Idolater; and by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>
not Divine and Religious honor (for that is due to God alone)
but Civil worship and honor.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Civil honor.</note> The difference between those is not
in the outward gesture of the body, or bowing the knee, but in the
intention of the minde; Divine is, when we bow both knee and
heart, and soul to God, and that for his own sake, as the Lord of
Heaven and Earth, and the Author of all good to us, to whom we
pray when we want it, and whom we praise as the Author of any
mercy for soul or body:<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> Cases of Consc. p. 357.</note> Civil, is when bowing the knee, yea and
the affection of the minde to men, we do it yet for the Lords sake,
and as the Lords instruments,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> on Command. 5.</note> and whom he hath set over us for good,
as excelling us in gifts and graces, to whom we present Supplications,
as the instruments of God to convey many good things to us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
render thanks for the same; yet must not we attribute to
them any thing proper to God, as <hi>Herods</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzars;</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
did, which the three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Children and <hi>Daniel</hi> refused. As our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to them must flow from the fear of God, so must the same Rule
direct and square them, so that they neither come too short, nor go
too far.</p>
                  <p>Under this honor is understood,<note place="margin">What honor comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> the inward reverence in heart to
be declared outwardly by obedience to all their godly Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
chearfulness in payments, prayer and thanksgiving, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now if all this be due to a wicked King,<note place="margin">If honor be due to the bad, how much more to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Kings?</note> as here, and now to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of us, if we had a wicked King, what then is to be done of us
to such a King as God hath bestowed on us? a natural Prince, and
of our own Nation as it were, lineally descended of the ancient
Kings of our own Realm, and a Christian King, that maintains the
Gospel, and sets against Popery, a King honored of God with so rare
gifts and vertues, with so peaceable an entrance, and such an hopeful
Posterity, &amp;c. O do we honor him, reverence him, be thankful for
him, pray for him, chearfully pay such Taxes and Subsidies as shall
be imposed on us (for the maintenance of his Royall Pomp and
Charge) to the encouragement of others.</p>

                  <p>NOw of the duties of another sort of Inferiors to another kinde
of Superiors, namely, of Servants (all Servants, whether Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants
or Maid-servants) to their Masters (Dames and Mistresses
too) they must be subject to them; that is, not onely content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the place of Inferiority they are in, giving them the place
of their Superiority, but to perform all duties to them which they
may justly challenge, and that from a reverend respect of them and of
their place; and that not onely if they be good and gentle (of the best
natures, and that use them well) but also if even they be froward, or
such as use them ill.</p>
                  <p>Before I come unto the words in particular, note we two or three
generals:</p>
                  <p>1. The exactness and absoluteness of the Word of God,<note place="margin">Gods Word teacheth us in all things how to carry our selves.</note> It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us in all things how to carry our selves: No mans place so mean,
no action so common (eating, drinking, sleeping, &amp;c.) none so mean
in the meanest calling, but the Word reacheth thereto, and giveth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
therein; Its a Schoolmaster, able to convince, teach, instruct,
correct all; Its as an Apothecaries shop throughly furnished; Its like
a pure Fountain, that sends water by pipes, not onely into the chief
rooms, but even into the meanest; It doth noth onely instruct us in
our duties towards God, but towards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o our Neighbors also, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Superiors, towards those that are set over us, though in an
inferior degree.</p>
                  <p>This teacheth every man to search the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and to labor to
be acquainted therewith, and to make them their Counsellors and
Guides, <hi>A light and lanthorn to their feet;</hi> They must also hear them
opened by Preaching, for their fuller understanding thereof: If any
shall say, What shall I do at Church? I am a poor Wench in the
Kitchin, I am a poor Plow-boy, its fit for my Master to go, &amp;c. Know,
that its fit and needful for thee also so to do, not onely because thou
hast a soul to save as well as thy Master, but that thou maist learn to
become thy place, and do thy duty aright.</p>
                  <p>2. How Ministers ought to have a care of,<note place="margin">Ministers must stoop to the lowest and meanest of their charge.</note> and stoop to the lowest
and meanest of their charge: The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the midst of all
his great businesses, travels and cares, yet in no Epistle lightly forgets
to teach Servants their duties towards their Masters, that so doing
their duty, they may adorn the Gospel. Thus doth our Apostle here,
and thus must we do in our places. A faithful shepherd will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lose any of his sheep, but tender them all; and we must be so
careful,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 26.</note> as to be free from the blood of every one.</p>
                  <p>True it is,<note place="margin">Masters must not turn this off themselves.</note> that Masters must not turn this off from themselves, and
put it wholly on the Ministers; but do their duty to the uttermost,
pressing upon them at home what they hear publikely taught, both
which are little enough; yet must the Ministers also speak to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65522:194"/>
and apply themselves to the capacity of the meanest, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
taking care that they come not to the Sacrament hand
over head.</p>
                  <p>3. That not onely the Church and Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Even particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar families are to be well ordered and lookt to.</note> but even
particular families are to be well ordered and look'd to, as from
whence will flow either good or ill: They that be good in their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
will be good abroad in what place soever they be set; if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
be godly at home, he will be a good Parishioner, a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
so their Children and Servants? Whats the cause of so much
disorder abroad every where? even for that there be so few families
in any good order and government. Thus in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear,</hi> &amp;c.] Here three
things are observable: 1. The duty to be performed. 2. The maner.
3. Towards whom; where's the removal of a secret Objection, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Servants must be subject even to them that use them hardly,
and deal most injuriously with them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the duty to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rformed,<note place="margin">Servants must be subject to their masters.</note> and the maner thereof, I have
heretofore spoken at large, in handling the fifth Commandment: It
proceeds from that reverent respect which they have of their Masters,<note place="margin">See Eph. 6. 5.</note>
and the parties set over them by God in his wise and merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:<note place="margin">Col. 3. 22.</note>
If they do inwardly reverence them from their hearts,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> and see
God in them, and the face and image of God in their face, they will
also outwardly declare the same by their obedience, faithfulness, care,
diligence, and the like.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth the monstrous insolency of youth in these our
days,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which can abide no yoke of good Government, daily bewraying
their want of inward reverence, by the fruits thereof, in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
gestures, words, behavior, blazing abroad their Masters infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the like: How many even of professors, set light by their
Masters, vilifying their persons, slighting their gifts, and use them
basely, especially if they be poor?</p>
                  <p>2. Let Servants repent for this want of reverence,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> &amp; know, whatsoever
is done against their Masters, is against God himself, whose Deputies
their Masters are; yea let them amend this, and learn to reverence their
Masters, so shall they perform all the other duties they owe them: have
you failed: heretofore? make more conscience for the time to come,
and do your duties chearfully without grudging; for your state is by
far better, then their's to whom the Apostle wrote (of whom many
were bondmen and slaves, whom their Masters might have almost
used at their pleasures) or their's now in other Countreys, who besides
their want of the means of Salvation, live in woful toil and misery:
You have the means of Salvation, and for the most part outwardly live
but at too much liberty; your lots have fallen in pleasant places, walk
thankfully, obediently, and chearfully.</p>
                  <p>3. Let such as are Masters and Mistresses of families,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> learn here
what duties their Servants owe them, that they may the better instruct
them therein, and look for their performance thereof: And if they
have now ill, stubborn and unfaithful Servants, let them call to minde
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65522:195"/>
whether when they themselves were Servants, they were not such,
that so they may repent thereof, in the mean time acknowledging Gods
justice, in paying them in their own coyn, and deal with them, as they
dealt with others.</p>
                  <p>4. For those that are yet yong and in their Parents houses,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> let them
mark these things, that when they shall go to service, they may not be
to learn their duties; but ready and apt therein, skilful in the several
branches thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not onely to the good and gentle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> 
                     <hi>but also to the froward.]</hi> These words
are a comparison between Masters, or the prevention of an Objection,
that might quickly be made by some, to shift off the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation:
I would be content to do my duty, if I had a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or served such a Master as some that I know; but my Master is
so curst, that one cannot tell how to speak to him, and in correcting,
cruel without all reason, and that as well for no fault, as for a fault,
yea, sometimes I am beaten for well doing, and for my forwardness
in serving God: Well, saith the Apostle, you must be subject, and do
your duties in all points, even to such.</p>
                  <p>By good is meant liberal Masters (so indeed Masters ought to be to
their Servants,<note place="margin">What we are to understand by good, gentle and Deut. 15. 13.</note> both while they be with them, and at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from them;) as by gentle, such as care not what they do to
them by Law, but what they may do in equity and good conscience.
By froward,<note place="margin">Froward Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> are meant such Masters which will be pleased with
nothing,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 17.</note> to whom (such was <hi>Nabal</hi>) one cannot tell how to speak;
yea such as will afflict their Servants without cause, or colour of cause.
Whatsoever they are,<note place="margin">Servants must be subject even to their bad and froward Masters.</note> Servants must be subject to them, must reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
them from their hearts, must obey them, serve them faithfully,
and pray for them: They must thus do even to the worst Masters, of
the very worst conditions, God will have it to be so, and they
represent Gods person and place,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> though they are of such bad
qualites: Hereby they shall shew forth their Christianity in a work
of such difficulty (for to serve and do duty to good, kinde and
courteous Masters, is no great mastery) which is indeed worthy of
a Christian: If they do not their duties to us, but be bad, we
must not meddle with it, God will call them to an account, we
shall not answer for their sin, but if we do not our duty, we sin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and make our selves guilty; if in humility and patience we do
our duties, God will take our part in his good time, as he did <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 42.</note>
who served a churlish, harsh, and covetous Master twenty
years together: If we do our duties, though they consider it not,
nor deserve it,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 24.</note> yet do we it to God, who accounteth thereof, and
before whom it shall not be forgotten: Are they froward? Its the
cross God hath laid out for us in his providence, which we must take
up and bear; to shake it off by unlawful means, were to resist the hand
of God: It may be its greatly for our good, even to tame and subdue
our stout, sturdy, proud and rebellious nature; knotty logs must have
hard Beetles, and a rough horse, a rough rider. Besides, it may make
us fitter to govern others another day; for as none prove worse then
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65522:195"/>
those that have been Cockneys, and have known no hardship, so they
that have met with much, will be the better to others, as having
loathed it so much when it was their case; yea, this may be a means
in time to perswade the minde of such a Master to a better course, and
make his heart to smite him,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 17.</note> when he seeth his own unreasonableness,
and his servants patience; as <hi>Saul,</hi> who upon this ground acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that <hi>David</hi> was more righteous then he.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh the common sort of servants,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which if they meet
with a little hardship this way, murmure, shake off the yoke, deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfully,
or run away; What's their plea? Oh, my Master is such
an unreasonable man, my Dame so unquiet, as that there's no living
with them, &amp;c. Well, well, your Master or Dame is unreasonable,
who shall be Judge? If a number of servants (they are so lazy and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded)
that if their Masters do but call them to good duties, rebuke
them for their ill speeches, or for their tarrying abroad at unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
times, and using bad company, few Masters but will be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unreasonable, and such as are not to be endured; yea, to be held
to their business, and kept in, with the licentious youths of these days
will be counted unreasonable: But grant they be somewhat unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
see whether you by your negligence, crossness, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness
have not made them so (as some do) if so, you can do
little if you cannot bear what you have deserved: But say they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
and you have not deserved all you meet with, yet for all
that, its your duty to remember your place, you must not sin for
company; O who can do it? why, is God so unreasonable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of you that which cannot be done? best charge God with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
by and by: True, its no easie matter, but servants
must labor for grace,<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> that they may be able to say as <hi>Paul, I am able to do
all things;</hi> But alas, when we provoke servants to minde goodness, and
to spend their time well, they think this unreasonable; they work hard,
and they must have their pleasure, and they may be godly all in time,
and so they be void of goodness: Hence arise such stirs in families,
which were there grace in servants, might be prevented: Oh! no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
can please them, say they; no careless body it may be, whereas a
little more then ordinary diligence and carefulness would please in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
But though servants must do their duties to such froward Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
yet this is no justification of them that be so, or encouragement
toothers to be such; for though their servants must put it up, God will
be revenged of it, <hi>They have a master in Heaven:</hi> If therefore they
shall abridge them of their necessary food, apparel or rest, hailing them
to work beyond their strength, or shall curse and ban them, shall beat
them without cause, shall be cruel in their correction, smiting them
with what comes next to hand, throwing things at them to spoil them;
or if with things fitting, cruelly, unmercifully, and without measure,
not regarding the offence against God, nor the quality of the fault,
not the best way to bring them to amendment, but following the
rage and fury of their own hearts, God will call them to an account
for the same: He forbiddeth cruelty against beasts, much more against
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65522:196"/>
those that are made according to his own image: They were or are
the children of others, though now your servants, to whom being
fatherless, you had need be the more merciful; and may not your
children also be servants: Do you to other mens children, as you
would others should deal with yours; are they not also your own
flesh, and it may be as dearly bought with the blood of Christ
as your selves? Though you are to keep a good strait hand over your
servants, yet must it be with moderation.</p>
                  <p>2. If servants be bound thus to carry themselves towards bad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
how much more then to the good and gentle? to such as are
careful of their good every way, to such as give them good counsel,
instruct them, bring them to good duties, give them that's fit for
them, teach them their trade, and govern them with moderation?
What shall we say then to the servants of our times, that have such
Masters and Dames, and yet be unfaithful, lazy and negligent?
Where shall these appear? assuredly, its no small favor to be under
such Governors; the times we live in are grown to a strange pass:
In times past, about twenty or thirty years ago, when the light, alas,
was dim, what diligent and painful servants were there, who would
tarry at least seven or ten years in an house, whereas now they are so
unruly, that no house can hold them long? they finde fault for the
most part when there's no cause: Formerly servants were careful to
please their Governors, and glad if they could and would accept of
their endeavors, and be pleased with them; but now, Masters and
Dames are fain to please their servants, if they can do any thing, they
be so teachy and masterly, as they may not be spoken to; belike the
course of things must be turned, the order of nature perverted, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
must be as servants to please, and servants as Masters to do what
they list: Hath God honored the servants of these times with the
Gospel denyed to former ages, and do they thus requite God, and
profit by it? will it not be to their further condemnation? The mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
pride of youths is the cause of all this disorder; the peace and
plenty that God hath given us, hath so lift them up, as they have
forgotten the ancient simplicity and plainnefs that was heretofore,
and have their mindes so high set, as their study is to prank up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
brave, and get gay clothes, to keep company, and have their
swing; this they minde, and not their business: If they thus continue,
they shall never be worth a servant themselves, or else shall be plagued
with such as themselves were, nay, who knows whether for their pride
and unconscionableness, they may not come to rags, and a bit of
bread?</p>
                  <p>3. Now what is here required of servants towards bad Masters,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
must also be performed by us to those we have any way to deal withal:
Thus Subjects are to do the duties of Subjects towards their Princes,
though they should be Tyrants, or deal hardly with them: Thus,
though we live by neighbors that be untoward and contentious,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 18.</note> we
must live quietly; Thus must husbands &amp; wives live together; <hi>We must
not be overcome of evil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>but overcome evil with goodness:</hi> God hath no
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65522:196"/>
where bid us do to others, as they do to us (that's the leaven of the
Scribes and Pharisees) but to <hi>love our enemies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 43, 44.</note> 
                     <hi>and to do good to them that
hate us,</hi> &amp;c. yet must not this hearten any to be bad, but every man
must make his Neighbors yoke as easie as he can, not laying too much
upon him: They must not say (as some husbands to their wives) they
must do their duties to us, whatsoever we be: What! are you so
cunning indeed? know you so well other folks duties, and your own
no better? you should know your own duties best: How great then
is their sin, that cannot live with good Neighbors? How great that
wives, that having a kinde and careful husband, is ever fretting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and vexing him? How great that husbands, that having a
loving, dutiful, careful wife, doth not use her kindely, but hoggishly,
yea it may be loveth others better? He that cannot live with bad
ones, and do his duty, is scarce a good Christian; but he that cannot
do his duty to good ones, is not so good as an Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</p>

any thing displease him but sin? Should we not do that which is
pleasing to him, though difficult? Should we not fly from that
which displeaseth him, though we might get thousands by it? If we
please him,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 29.</note> hath he not a Kingdom for us? If we displease him, is he

Oh!<note place="margin">Use.</note> this may make us hang down our heads, that we are no more
careful to please such a great and good God. Alas! if a thing have
any difficulty, we pass it off, though the doing thereof would please
God never so well: Oh! why do we not pray oftner, and with better
affection? why hear we not the Word more diligently? why are
we not more heavenly minded, more patient, more liberal? would
not God be pleased herewith? and is there any thing better becoming
us, then to please God with all our might? Hath he not made us?
and chosen us to life before the world? given his Son to dye for us,
and save us? given us his Gospel and Spirit? hath prepared a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for us, and will we not please him? yea, if a thing stand with our
profit, though we know it will displease him, can we be content to do
it? O that we should offend so good a God, and so merciful a Father
as he hath been unto us! O do we endeavor to please him, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be thereat displeased, whatsoever we lose, or whatsoever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
we bring upon us! But, O the monstrous course of this world,
that of all things cannot abide what pleaseth God! that so live, as if
God had nothing to do with them, as if they were neither in his debt
nor danger, as if they were not afraid of them, or he could do them
no hurt. Are you not woful creatures that thus abuse God? Are you
not in his debt? Who gave you these Bodies and Souls? who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
them? whence was it that you were not Toads, Monsters,
mad persons, and fools? who hath maintained your lives? who hath
kept you, that you have not been ere this consumed, or are not now in
hell? Art thou not in his debt, who hath let thee live under the Gospel,
the means of saving thee, denyed to most of the world? Should you
not then please him? Art thou not in his danger? Cannot he make
the earth to swallow thee, the worms to eat thee up? Can he not
smite thee with an incurable disease in thy bowels? Can he not strike
thee with madness, cast thee upon thy bed, and there forsake thee, and
give thee up to a desperate minde? Is he not able to send thee to Hell
ere night? Can he not make every joynt of thy body, every tooth of
thy head so to torment thee, that thou shalt be weary of thy life?
Canst thou promise thy meat shall nourish thee, or that when thou
lyest down thou shalt have one wink of sleep, for pain of body or
vexation of minde, or shalt ever rise again? When there is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
hope of fruit, cannot he in one night by a Frost destroy it all? Do
we not stand at his courtesie for every shower of Rain, for the Bread
we eat, and every thing else? and should we not then please him? If
he smile on us, whose frown need we regard? If he frown, whose
smiles can do us good? <hi>Who can stand before him when he is angry? He
rendeth the rocks, and maketh the mountains to tremble:</hi> O that any through

things first, and then of less in their place, and so of the greatest sins;
for God hates greatest sins most, as in <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

rashness to believe <hi>Zibah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 15. 5.</note> yet that against <hi>Uriah</hi> was the worst of all.
Greatest sins rob God most of his glory, do most disgrace the Gospel,
make greatest wounds in our souls, procure most numbness and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of heart, and greatest outward punishment; we must make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of all, but especially of the greatest: Such as seem very earnest
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65522:198"/>
against some small things, and make no account of greater, are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,<note place="margin">Mat 23. 24.</note>
like the Scribes and Pharisees which strained at a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>at, but
swallowed a Camel:<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 6.</note> Such were the high Priests, they made conscience
of putting the thirty pieces of silver into the treasury, which <hi>Judas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to them, but made no conscience of putting Christ to death:
They made Conscience of going to the Common-Hall,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 28.</note> least they
should be defiled, and made unfit for the Passover, who yet made no
conscience of shedding innocent blood.</p>
                  <p>So the Papists stands altogether upon meats, days, and such trifles
of their own devising, making no conscience of Gods great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
of the 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. So many among our selves will speak
very hardly of some small blemishes in a Professor, and, Oh! is this
agreeable to Gods Word? &amp;c. who do yet live in foul sins. Again,
some one hath deceived them or wronged them, and they can speak
very hardly against falshood and ill dealing, who yet can see foul
faults in others (but such as have not touched them) and not speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them at all: Some make great account of their truth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,
and, Oh, they would not deceive their Neighbor, nor carry
away any thing out of his house, and why? fie on it, hath not God
forbid it? who yet will rob the Lord of a great part of his day, which
he saith is his: Some also make conscience to give their Servants vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
enough, but make no conscience to give them any good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
or to pray for them, and with them, &amp;c. <hi>These things they</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <hi>ought to have done, and not left the other undone.</hi> 2. If a man have a care
of all Gods Commandments, hate all sin, and do all good, <hi>always
endeavoring to keep a good conscience in all things:</hi> He hath an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that nourisheth any sin; He that bears with himself in one sin,
shuns none for conscience: Some are very forward to the Word,
Sacraments, good Company; ask why, Because, say they, God
requireth the same;<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 15.</note> but why follow they not their calling, pay every
man his own, deal justly? doth not God require these also? He is an
Hypocrite that doth the former, but makes no conscience of the latter:
Contrarily, some follow their calling, pay every man his own, &amp;c.
who yet robs God of his due and the times of worship, Requireth
not the Lord as well these as those? Again, such a man dares not
do such and such a sin, rob, kill, steal, &amp;c. Why? because of God
and his Word, who yet will swear, lye, rail, break the Sabbath, hate
their Neighbors, &amp;c. Why? hath not God as well forbid these as
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> those? 3. If a man be careful to do his duty zealously, as in Prayer,
not to bow the knee onely, but the heart also; at the Word, not to
hear onely with the outward ear, but from the heart to reverence the
same, with a purpose to be ruled thereby; He that slubbers over du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> coldly, its a sign he looks onely to men, not God. 4. If a man
be as careful to do his duties in private, as he is in publique, as in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
to pray, as he is in publique to hear, so to meditate, to be oft
making moan for sin, begging mercy and grace, wrestling against his
corruptions, &amp;c. Every Hypocrite doth outward duties, true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are in secret the same: How many froward husbands will shew
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65522:198"/>
much kindeness to their Wives before company, whereas he that
makes conscience of his ways, is most kinde in private? So a man
must make as much conscience of secret sins, as of open sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
sins in a corner, of secret corruptions, pride, hypocrisie, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustful,
impatient and lustful thoughts; so of wandring thoughts
in Prayer, and at the Word and Sacraments, and of worldly thoughts
on the Lords-day; He must be grieved for them, pray against them.
5. If a man be not for a brunt, but hold our constantly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
yea and that in persecution; as well where wind and tide is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and he meets with ill will and hard measure for so doing,
as when he hath good countenance, and may so do without control:
Thus <hi>David, Daniel,</hi> and the three Children, though Princes both
spake, sate, and did against them; most part do contrarily: Some
make a shew a little while, but quickly through love of the world,
through fear or favor fall away; as questionless if Religion should
alter, most would go with the strongest side, and many which now
come to the Gospel, would as readily go to Mass, yea, carry a faggot
to burn them that now sit with them in the same seats: These be they
that know not the truth, that receive not the love of the truth, that
live as they list, and will not obey the truth.</p>
                  <p>Examine your selves by these Notes,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and as you are to repent, and
ask mercy and pardon for all thats past, even your best actions, and
the maner of your performance thereof, so for the time to come
do not any duty in Hypocrisie, but all for conscience unto Gods
Commandment.</p>

will needs speak ill of us, let it be falsly, and for well-doing. If any

is a lesson for an high scholler: Howsoever, being simply considered,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:65522:199"/>
its good and commendable; as for any being justly afflicted or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by God or man,<note place="margin">Mic. 7. 9.</note> meekly to submit themselves, to confess their
faults,<note place="margin">Ier. 10. 19.</note> and be desirous to amend thereby: <hi>Aaron</hi> held his peace, <hi>Eli</hi>

for their faults, they must take it patiently, and learn to
amend.</p>
                  <p>But if it be no great matter,<note place="margin">Use.</note> having done a fault, and then being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
justly, to bear it patiently; are not those to be condemned which
be impatient under deserved corrections?<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 9.</note> Some being afflicted of
God, fret, rage and boyl, curse, blaspheme, run to Witches, or use
other unlawful means to get out: What a beast art thou? hast thou
not deserved the same, and yet wilt not thou be patient? Is not this
in effect to say, What hath the Lord to do to punish me? I have not
deserved the same; if I can get out of his fingers any way, I will not
abide to be thus used: thus take they the rod by the end, and pull it
out of Gods hand; What do those but desire there were no God to
see them, or that hated sin, or that would punish sin? Belike they would
have God like, but he will be like himself, who at the beginning
joyned punishment and sin together, and so will do to the worlds
end; you will not get any thing by resisting, by humble confession,
hearty Prayer, and promise of amending, you may. Again, there
are others, who being punished of the Magistrates for their faults, do
as well curse and rage against those their Rulers, as those that informed
against them: Thus when honest men tending the glory of God, and
good of the places where they live, knowing that Alehouses for the
most part are Pest-houses, Devils houses, Breeders of all mischief,
Receptacles of the scum of the earth, and means to encrease the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of sinners, complain of such ryotous persons, as would there
keep Revel-rout, and endeavor to suppress the same; O how do
drunkards and such others,<note place="margin">See Eccl. 8. 4, 5</note> the friends of sin, rage and fume? would
not such wish that there were no Law nor Magistrate to punish, but
that all might do as the list? but this would bring all to confusion:
Are there not some also who being reproved by their Ministers, fret
and rail at them,<note place="margin">1 King 2. 20.</note> fall out with them, and with <hi>Ahab,</hi> account them
for their Enemies? nay, sometimes will sue them at Law to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
undoing? And are there not also such servants and children, which
being corrected by their Governors, will murmure or resist, or run
away, a sign of a proud minde, of a lewd heart, and far from grace:
Such resist God, and shall receive to themselves condemnation; they
provoke the Lord to take the rod, nay scourge in his own hand, or
give them over into the hands of the Magistrates: whence it cometh
often to pass,<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 15.</note> that not a few despising the rod and correction, which
giveth life and wisdom, have been whipt, burnt in the hand, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
yea hang'd up, and that justly: Thus daily too many seek
their own ruine.</p>

                     <hi>But if when ye do well, &amp;c.]</hi> Here's the praise of patient suffering for
well-doing: There's a suffering wrongfully, and without cause,
which yet differeth from that which is here laid down, namely, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for well-doing.</p>
                  <p>Suffering wrongfully,<note place="margin">What it is to suffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> is when men are accused of that they are not
guilty of, or are punished without a fault, whether it be onely in
words, or proceed to deeds: <hi>David</hi> was unjustly censured of his
brother when he came to the camp, <hi>Hanna</hi> unjustly censured of <hi>Eli,</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> of the Scribes and Pharisees; so <hi>Mephibosheth,
Naboth,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> were wrongfully both slandered and punished.
Thus in these days days monstrous lyes and slanders are raised, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
against Christians and godly Ministers: Its an unrighteous
world, calling the best of Gods servants, Proud, Hypocrites, and
laying vile things to their charge, which they never deserved; as, that
they are enemies to the State, would put down Kings, &amp;c. Hence
sometimes men are punished by Magistrates without cause, as also
Children and Servants of their rash and inconsiderate Parents and
Masters. In this kinde Papists are exceeding expert; what lyes have
they spread of <hi>Luther, Calvin, Beza, Junius,</hi> and such others? And
had their horrible villany in the Gunpowder Treason taken effect,
the blame would have been by them laid on the Puritans. But as God
hath at no time done wrong, <hi>but judgeth the world with righteousness,

For them that suffer wrongfully,<note place="margin">What those must do that suffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> its their duty to behave themselves
patiently, looking up to God (as <hi>David</hi> did when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed) not
fretting, or raging, or saying (as its usual) It would never have grieved
me, if it had been so; rather say, It grieves me much less, because it
is not so; I thank God for the same, it might have been, if God
had not kept me; it was of him, and not for any goodness in me, more
then in others; Ile bear it patiently, for though I have not deserved
it of men, yet of God I have, even to be made a threshold for all to
tread on, and a by-word; and though I have not deserved it of men
in this, yet in some other things I have; I have been faulty towards
my Neighbors good name, and now its come home to me, I pray
God I may make a good use of it. Besides, it may be the Lord sees I
might have faln into that or some other sin, and hath sent this to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it (preventing Physick is good) blessed be his Name, or he doth
it to keep me humble, &amp;c. Thus God, that brought light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
teacheth us how to bring good out of evil: Thus we may make use
of a slander. Neither must we think, that because it is wrongul, we
may fret and rage, and make a stir, and rail (so should we make our
selves guilty, who were innocent before) but may open our innocency,
and clear our selves, as <hi>Job;</hi> yea, if it should concern us nearly, but
especially the Gospel, then may we have recourse to the Magistrate
for redress. Thus of suffering wrongfully.</p>

                     <hi>Abel, Isaas, Joseph, Micaiah,</hi>
are pregnant Examples hereof: So <hi>David</hi> met with enemies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he followed goodness; so our Savior Christ, so suffered the
Prophets,<note place="margin">Iohn 7. 7.</note> Apostles, Martyrs: Thus many at this day, even for their
goodness they are hated,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 3.</note> and the better they be, the worse they are
hated;<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>They are not of the world, and the world hateth them:</hi> As sore
eyes cannot abide the Sun, so cannot the ill lives and consciences of
worldlings, who wallow in their works of darkness, abide the light
of Gods Word, or the good conversation of godly men; it makes
their wickedness the more seen, and they must mislike either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or the others; but themselves you are sure they will not, nay,
so wretchedly minded are they, as to hate those that they know not,
but as they have heard of their goodness, and rail on them; and its
pity they live, or are suffered, will they say, who notwithstanding, if
they were put to it, were unable to say one word justly against them.
By this time the Gospel ought to have been so beloved, as that all that
have shewed any good countenauce thereto, should have been the
better thought of; but now (Oh fearful!) thats become a Reproach
which should be every mans glory, Oh, you are a Professor of the
Word, &amp;c!</p>
                  <p>For those that thus hate men for their goodness,<note place="margin">How fearful their condition is that are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of others for their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> its as dreadful a

into Heaven; they are of <hi>Cains</hi> generation, and <hi>Ishmaels</hi> brood. God
loves men because of goodness, and the Angels rejoyce at a sinners
conversion; but these hate them for their goodness, and so are unlike
unto God. If such as <hi>give but a cup of cold water unto a disciple, in the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65522:201"/>
name of a disciple, shall not lose his reward,</hi> shall not they be extremely
punished which mock and despise them, which hate and persecute
them, and that for their goodness? They that do the least wrong to
them in that respect, or <hi>eo nomine,</hi> shall not go unpunished: For they
that will smite with the tongue now, would with the fist if they might,
yea carry to the Prison, and to the Stake, if times would give leave:
Well, let them know, the persecutors reward belongeth to them, and
how hath God from time to time dealt with such? The examples of
<hi>Cain, Ishmael, Ahab, Jezabel, Herod,</hi> &amp;c. witness the same. Besides,
when they would be glad to have part with the Children of God,
they shall be banished, and have their portion with Devils and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
and that in a fearful maner: For if they shall stand on the left

not given them meat and drink, &amp;c. What shall become of them,
and what place shall they have in Hell, that take away their meat and
drink, that cast them into Prison, and do there deal cruelly with them?
The Papists are notable in this kinde,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 6.</note>

they might give glory to him, and a seal to his truth: We must
not flinch away when trouble comes, as many and most have done,
and so save themselves whole, and leave Christ and his cause to shift
for it self; the world count them fools that will suffer any thing for
his cause, and themselves wise that can carry themselves so as they
will be for all assays; but <hi>Moses</hi> was not of that minde, <hi>He chose
rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,</hi>

                     <hi>then to enjoy the

                     <hi>For he that saves his life, shall

                  <p>When we suffer for well doing, we must not suffer frettingly, with
raging against them, and with ill speaking, as it were with revenging
our selves, but in meekness commend our selves, and the cause to God:
Its a fault in some Christians that being hated at some hands for their
profession, and forwardness (and yet some need not be so much if they
would walk more wisely and discreetly) they then fall to taunting of

<hi>David,</hi> that in all his troubles spent his time so holily, and made many

a man is not tryed till affliction comes; as a Soldier in the battel, a

of men, and to whet on others, as the seed of the Church is the blood

and persecuters of his Saints, whereof though the perfection be to
come, yet even here God suffers them not to escape his hand in a
notable maner, which doth not a little strengthen his servants. 4. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
prove the faith and patience of his own children, and to encrease the
same: Spices smell best when they are bruised, and graces appears
most when most tryed. 5. To scour off their soyl that they gather in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
the world,<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 16.</note> and make them bright. 6. To stir them up to every duty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

                  <p>1. When we enter into the profession of Religion,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand

with the baptism wherewith he is baptized, neither with him

come cheap to us, and of Gods meer gift, yet it came not so to Christ,
he paid full dearly for it; Gods Justice, which would be satisfied, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

2. By his admirable patience: Innocency, that he had
no sin, no not so much as ever slipt in his tongue, and so was perfect:
Now if he had no sin, suffered patiently, much more should we that
are sinful Creatures, and do one way or other deserve a thousand times
more then that we suffer: His admirable patience set forth by that he
suffered, and his bearing the same sufferings in word and deed, where's
shewed both what he did not, and what he did: He requited not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not ill words, with ill deeds, but not the worst deeds that were done
to him, with an ill word again, and he committed his cause to God,
knowing that he knew what was to be done, and would judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
between him and them.</p>

                     <hi>Who did no sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christ was free from sin.</note> &amp;c.] He had no Original sin, but was conceived by

of the Virgin was freed from all spot of sin,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 5.</note> and filled with fulness of

                  <p>1. Then he suffered not for his own sins,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as they wickedly imagined
that put him to death,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 4.</note> as was foretold, but from ours altogether, which
should make us loath our selves, that put the innocent Son of God to
such things, which we had justly deserved: Oh! How should we
hate sin, and love God and Christ Jesus for ever and ever?</p>
                  <p>But how could it stand with Gods justice that he should suffer,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> being every
way innocent, and we which were guilty persons should go free?</p>
                  <p>Christ was an able surety to dye, and overcome death, and he was
willing,<note place="margin">R.</note> and the Father could not refuse one in our own nature to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
for us to satisfie his justice, and free us.</p>
                  <p>Here also we may see how we stand righteous before Almighty
God,<note place="margin">How the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stand righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God.</note> though we be not perfectly righteous, though not at all till we
be sanctified, and then but in part; How? even by the righteousness of
Christ imputed to us, and reckoned, and made ours by Faith, which
is not an imaginary thing, as the Papists scoff at it, but a true and real
righteousness: for as Christ was no sinner, yet was counted as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and being so accounted, bare the intollerable weight of our sins;
so we by his righteousness imputed, stand verily and truly just before
God, and shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>2. This should teach us to labor for innocency of life:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> The more
means we have, and the more shew we make, we must be the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to walk warily, as they that have many observers; some that will be
grieved if we do ill, and many, as the Devil and the wicked, that will
rejoyce: Let the forwardest Towns and persons take heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they be innocent in their example; you may do much good
this way, else much hurt, look to your selves, you are watcht; and that
narrowly.</p>
                  <p>3. If he suffered,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and that patiently, who never offended God nor
man, but was the most pure and innocent Son of God, how much
more should we, who never suffer, but our hearts can tell us we have
deserved the same, and ten thousand times more through our sins
against God? we have small cause to be impatient, but must submit
our selves hereto; yea, we have not onely sinned against God, and so
deserved all evil, and that God should make us a Reproach, a By-word,
a Scorn of men, and a Threshold for all to tread on, but we
have sinned against our Magistrates, against our neighbors, yea against
them that misuse us, whosoever they be, for want of reverencing
them, praying for them, doing our duties to them, not carrying our
selves so innocently towards them, nor so wisely, patiently, &amp; unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
as we ought; so that though we deserve not to be thus dealt with
for this that we are punished for, yet in many other things we do:
Submit we our selves therefore in all humbleness of minde and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
What, are we sinful creatures too good to suffer, when as the

of them. True it is, in his publique Ministery, he told them
plainly of their sins, and called them <hi>Blinde guides and Hypocrites,</hi>
and denounced Gods judgements against them, but that was from
conscience of his duty, and of love to win them to repentance, if it
might be, not upon spleen to revenge himself; as the Ministers of
God may rebuke sin severely, and denounce Gods judgements against
them that live thus and thus, and yet not out of any malice or ill will,
but from an earnest desire of their amendment, and therefore they do
wickedly that call that railing; yea, when they posted him from the
place where they took him with swords and staves,<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 57.</note> &amp; brought him to
<hi>Caiphas</hi> the high Priest,<note place="margin">Luke 22. 66.</note> and then led him into their counsel; and then

he was mockt, smitten, scourged, and misused beyond all measure,
yet when he thus suffered, he threatned not; He could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
fire (as <hi>Elias</hi>) to come down and consume them, or Legions
of Angels to destroy them; He could also have served them as
<hi>Corah</hi> and his Company were served, but he did patiently put
up all.</p>
                  <p>Here's a fit patern for our imitation,<note place="margin">Why we must not revenge.</note> we must take heed of revenge;
The Heathens are accustomed hereunto, but Christians must not be
like to them:<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> This is often forbid;<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4.</note> say not, I will do to him as he
hath done to me,<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 22.</note> give word for word, taunt for taunt, blow for blow,
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 20.</note> For 1. This is a work of the flesh. 2. God hath a hand in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is done against thee:<note place="margin">Amos 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> acknowledged it,<note place="margin">Iob 2. 10.</note> so <hi>David;</hi> To use
revenge,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 10.</note> were to resist God, as the dog that bites the staff, would be
willing to bite the man if he could; Its as if a Childe should pull the
rod out of his Fathers hand, and break it before his face, What
would we say of such a Childe? The Magistrate indeed may take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
for wrongs done us, we our selves must not. 3. It were in vain
to fight with the world with the worlds weapons, they will be too
hard for us; Prayers and patience are our proper wepons, whereby
we shall be too hard for them. 4. Thus we hurt our selves more then
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65522:204"/>
them; them a little in body, goods or name, our selves a great deal
in our souls, as the Bee, by stinging loses her own life; we have our
wills a little, but the wrath of God withal, and that's dearly bought.
5. It proceeds of great weakness; If we had Spiritual strength, we
would pass by great things: we do therefore but proclaim our own
weakness, when we revenge. <hi>Moses, David,</hi> and others of Gods dear ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
would not give way hereunto, especially, beyond all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
our Savior Christ, who suffered so monstrous things of
such base persons, and that so unjustly, as one that had never the least
ill thought against God or man:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>French Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> pag. 301. cap. 30.</note> O this ought to move us to great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
yea of the Heathens themselves, there were not a few which
were admirable in patience.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the monstrous practice of the world,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that is set
upon nothing but revenge, give taunt for taunt, blow for blow, &amp;c.
He is no body that will not revenge himself to the uttermost, from the
least to the greatest: Much is spent this way in Law, onely for mens
wicked wills upon stomack and to revenge; Some profess, and are
not ashamed to say, I'le be revenged on him, I'le not leave him worth
a groat, I'le fit in his skirts once in the year, I'le be even with him; who,
that they may have their will of a man, care not what they spend,
though they have the curse of God withal; If they be told thereof,
what's their defence? Had he not begun with me, he should have
gone long enough before I would have wronged him, but seeing he
hath thus done, I'le serve him as well: He is counted an honest man
that doth not begin to wrong another, but he that doth but requite
wrong with the like, O that's very reasonable, and it were no reason
to require the contrary: Thus most have no ears to hear any perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to put up wrongs, a certain sign that they are fleshly, and that
the Devil bears sway in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>What?<note place="margin">Obj.</note> Shall I put up abuses? then I shall be counted a fool.</p>
                  <p>Not of God who bids thee so do,<note place="margin">R.</note> nor of Angels, nor of good men,
who count them wise that so do: <hi>He that is slow to wrath, is of great
wisdom:</hi> For the contrary, none but fools and bad men will count
you wise, neither are they fit Judges, yea, their dispraise is a praise: He is
not strongest that can revenge, but that can up most and overcome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
Its beastly power to subdue others, but Christians must subdue
their own rebellious affections and lusts. But alas, even Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and they that have good things in them are yet greatly taken
herein, as appears in their writings about matters in controversie;
they break out into personal disgraces, and bitter invectives one against
another, a very unseemly thing, me thinks, not savoring of the Spirit,
but of the Fesh, yea the way to exasperate, and so to encrease sin: The
truth may be sufficiently maintained, and error gainsaid and confuted
without such things: That Christians should be stirred one against
another, that they should not bear one with another, that they should
rip up one anothers faults, that they should disgrace one another, that
they should either fall flat out one with another into bitter terms, or
biting them into worse purposes, not forget wrongs, true or seeming,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65522:205"/>
for a great while: O this is wonderful, yea monstrous pride; where
is love that suffereth long? and where is the example of our Savior
all this while? <hi>And where's our forgiving one another, as we would God
should forgive us?</hi> This hinders not but that Magistrates may execute
justice upon ill doers, so it be upon no private grudge; and that Parents
and Masters may correct the faults of their Children and servants, so
it be chiefly in regard of the sin against God, and for the good of the
party: And a man may take the benefit of the Magistrate, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be of weight, and cannot be well ended otherwise; yea, if he be
set upon, and violence offered to him, he may be a Magistrate for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if he cannot shift off his enemies, and by defending himself he
may be freed of the danger; and if he must needs wound or be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
kill or be killed, then no doubt its lawful rather to kill then be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and yet to be as free from revenge, as full of pity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But committed himself, &amp;c.]</hi> Our Savior would not revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
on his adversaries, as knowing that his Father was wise enough,
and knew what to do to them, and being just, would also do right
judgement.<note place="margin">They that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, call into question Gods wisdom and justice.</note> Whence note, That</p>
                  <p>They that revenge, think that God either is not wise enough, or
just enough to requite the wrongs done them, or to determine of their
cases; for if they so thought, they would leave it to him whose office
it is, and who will do it to the purpose: He that revengeth, puts God
out of his place,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 35.</note> and sits down therein;<note place="margin">Psal 94. 1.</note> Should any having no
Authority,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 19.</note> Calling or fitness, intrude himself into the place or seat
of a Temporal Judge, would he not be accounted a Fool or a
Madman?</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore beware of revenge,<note place="margin">Use.</note> seeing it concludes so wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on our parts against God, and know we, that we do always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
best for our selves, when we commend our cause to God, for he
knows how, when and which way to defend his, and revenge them
on their Enemies:<note place="margin">Num. 26. 9, 10.</note> When <hi>Moses</hi> bare quietly the abuse of <hi>Corah</hi> and
his company, how did God right his cause? The like may be said of
<hi>Davids,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 2. 24.</note> in respect of the wrongs done by <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Shimei:</hi> If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
our selves, we turn Gods revenge against our selves, and as we
become partners with them that have wronged us in sin, so shall we in
punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To him that judgeth righteously.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge.</note> God is the Judge of the world, he
daily judgeth, and hath especially prepared one day wherein he will
judge the world,<note place="margin">Acts 17. 31.</note> and give every one according to that they have done:
His judgements are always righteous, as between <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Corah,</hi> yea,
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriam, David</hi> and <hi>Saul, Ahab</hi> and <hi>Naboth, &amp;c.</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
their cause unto God, who accordingly righted them; so did
he right <hi>Hezekiah</hi> on <hi>Senacherib, Peter</hi> on <hi>Herod,</hi> the Holy Martyrs on
their bloody persecuters: Thus doth God revenge himself of the
wicked enemies of Gods faithful Ministers; and thus for our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he keeps as it were petty Sessions, but this is nothing to that he
will do: He reacheth out his hand as it were from behinde a Curtain,
and gives now one, now another of his Enemies a rap, thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65522:205"/>
our weakness, and strengthen us, and to curb the wicked that
they be not too outragious; but here's a day coming wherein he will
throughly judge between his servants and their enemies: Things seem
to go crooked now, when the wicked tread under foot the poor Saints
like clay in the streets, and insult over them; but as a Turner or Joyner
with crooked tools will make straight and even work, so hereby in
Gods wise providence is set forth, as well the constancy of his Saints,
as the malice of their Enemies, the one being thus prepared to glory,
the other to Destruction, both which shall evidently appear on the
great day.</p>
                  <p>O how notably may this comfort Gods servants,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and make them
patient in their sufferings?<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 6, 7.</note> And how may this terrifie the wicked, that

all, when they saw the Gentiles called, and the Gospel Preached so
plainly by the Apostles; yet its said, They be not satisfied, but stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down as it were, they pray and desire to see more, yet is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
more to us then unto them, and therefore how much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
should we be? Herewith our Apostle was so taken, <hi>as that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know nothing else but Christ crucified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 8. 9.</note> and esteemed all priviledges
and advantages that he had of being a Pharisee, an Hebrew, &amp;c. as
dung in comparison of Christ: The Israelites were often told by
the Prophets of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how much more
should we be content to hear of our deliverance through Christ,
whereof that was but a small resemblance and type? But alas, how
quickly are we weary of this argument? Because we have heard often
of it, its now stale, and people have no more minde to hear it, then the
Israelites could be contented with the Manna which God allowed
them, but lusted after other Food: As they that go to Sea, think it
strange, and for a day or two admire the wonderful works of God,
but afterward cease therefrom; so do we in this matter, though
most sweet, comfortable, admirable, and of daily use to make us grow
in hatred of sin, and love of God, and would also be a spur to our
dulness.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the passion it self;<note place="margin">A brief of the sufferings of Christ, set down at large by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</note> Its usually referred to that he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Cross, as here, because that was a great part, and the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to all, and the end of all; but there were also infinite sufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and besides his death: His whole life was a continual suffering,
from his birth to his death, from the Manger to the Cross, all full of
Crosses: His abasement to take our nature was much, and to become
subject to all our infirmities, sin only excepted, and to be in a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
persecuted as soon as born, living obscurely with his Parents
till about thirty years old, in the exercise (as is supposed) of a mean
Trade, strange abasement for the Son of God; as soon as he entred
into his Office and was baptized, the Devil set sore on him: After
this as a recompence to his continual toil and travel for mens Souls
and Bodies, he was not only content to live in a mean condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any House of his own, &amp;c. but he was so vilely railed on and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65522:206"/>
(as is set down in the foregoing Verse) as none have been more,
or so much, yea, as sometimes in policy they sought to entrap him,
so at other times they laid wait, and used means to kill him; At last,
they plotted by one of his own Disciples to take away his life, as
burning with an irreconcileable hatred against him:<note place="margin">See Luke 12. 50.</note> But ere he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 27.</note>
he entred upon his sufferings in a most grievous maner, yea
no doubt even before he thought thereof at sundry times, which
did not a little trouble and perplex him; as a woman thinking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the pains of her travel before they come, is set on a sweat,
and quakes for fear thereof: But after he had finisht the Passover, and
instituted the Supper, he knowing that the time of his death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
went into the Mount of Olives, and there entred into his most
bitter Passion, taking with him <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the beholders
of his transfiguration and glory, and therefore the fitter to behold his
abasement; but alas, pitying them, he left them, onely giving them
a charge to watch and pray, and went from them a stones cast, for they
were not able to behold his agony, nor hear the grievous dolour that
he could not but make, and then began his pains as of a woman in
travel, save that they were a thousand times greater, he fell on his face
grovelling, and cryed out, <hi>His soul was heavy unto the death,</hi> and
was in such an agony that he shed drops of blood (a thing never heard
of) and that through the extream force of his pain: O it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
weight of his Fathers wrath due for all our vile sins, which
was so grievous, as it made him pray to his Father for help, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
that cup, if it might be; which was but the frailty of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, without sin, desiring help, feeling it self almost swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up, and having that which would not onely have taken away
the bodily life of all men, if it had been on them, but even have sunk
them for ever. Thus he went too and fro to his Disciples three times
(they being in the mean time asleep) and here in the Mount drunk three
draughts (as we may say) of this most bitter cup of his Fathers wrath,
which was infinitely beyond all torment his body was or could be put
to: Then comes his betraying, treacherously betrayed of one of his
own Family, whom he had used kindely; thence carried away with
clubs and staves, as a Malefactor, unto <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> where he
was in the high Priests Hall all night misused in most shameful maner,
some smiting him, others spitting on him; and because he said he was
a King, they pull'd off his cloaths, and arrayed him in purple, and
crowned him with thorns; and because he was counted a Prophet,
having blindfolded him, and smitten him, they bid him prophesie
who had hit him: But because they have not the power of death in
their own hands, they make use of the secular power, laying many
things to his charge, and arraigning him at the Bar as a guilty person,
a mover of Sedition, one that denyed to pay tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
who said he was a King: But <hi>Pilat</hi> seeking to rid his hands of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he saw it was nothing but the malice of the Priests, sends him
to <hi>Herod,</hi> who, as if he had been some Jugler to play feats, was
glad to see him; whereof failing, he and his followers misused
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65522:207"/>
him notably at their pleasures, and sent him to <hi>Pilat</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>Before him he was again arraigned, and <hi>Barabbas</hi> prefer'd unto him,
the Jews in the mean time crying out against him, that he might be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified:
Then was he condemned to be scourged, to be carryed away
and crucified, was made bear his own Cross, till he could bear
it no longer; then were his hands and his feet nailed thereto,
himself hanging between to Thieves, many in the mean time
mocking him (as did one of the Thieves also) and wagging their
heads at him, he being as a But for all to shoot at, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Mark for every mans wicked tongue to aym at; On the
Cross he was about three hours: All this while besides bodily pains
which could not but be grievous, he had again a most bitter cup given
him to drink, and he had it poured in so fast, and such load laid on him,
as that he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
Though God did secretly sustain him, yet his Humane frailty felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
almost overcome and gone: Oh! it must needs be so, for it was
that wrath we should have suffered in Hell, though not with the same
quality that the wicked feel Hell pains, namely, with being utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
of God, and despairing and blaspheming on their parts: Oh,
this was most grievous, that the Son should have the Fathers wrath
poured out upon him! Oh, it was more then all the pains that were
ever upon all men together in this world: And from the sixth to the
ninth hour the Sun was darkned, and our Savior all that while abode
in a most grievous perplexity, during which time he uttered but seven
Sentences, and in this while he drunk up this bitter Cup to the very
bottom, dregs and all: Then he gave up the ghost, and dyed, was
buried, and held under death for a space. Behold a little poor draught
of the lamentable Sufferings of our Savior Christ; to express it as
it was fully, no tongue of man or Angel is able: And all these things
he endured for our sakes, and for our sins, for he had none of his
own. They were our sins that brought all this upon him, and had it
not been for this, we had all been damned for ever, as the evil Angels
that fell, of whom none shall be saved: He was arraigned before the
Bar of an earthly Judge, that we might not be arraigned before Gods
Tribunal Seat; He was condemned, that we might be absolved; He
was mockt and spitted on, that we might escape shame here, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of faces hereafter; He was scourged, that we might escape the
stripes of Gods vengeance; He dyed, that we might live; dyed a
cursed death, that we might scape the curse and be blessed: and thus
he had the smart, and we the benefit; our sins the cause of all his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and his sorrow the mean of all our welfare; for by this means
we are discharged, our Surety hath paid every farthing: Neither could
there be any other course taken with our sins, but that a death must be
suffered; for Gods Justice had pronounced Death the punishment of
it, and so required it: He could not remit our sin, but upon a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
therefore they that look for Salvation any other way, or by
their good meaning, good Prayers, good serving God, &amp;c. shall miss
thereof, for none but by a payment paid, and death and infinite wrath
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:65522:207"/>
suffered, can enter into Heaven: No other person or persons could
have undergone this; all men were in our case, none able to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
much less others; all unable to suffer, and to overcome the least
part of this wrath. And for Angels, alas, it was far beyond their
power, for it was an infinite wrath that we had deserved, by sinning
against an infinite God, but their power is finite. This also was a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
satisfaction, being performed by the Son of God; it was
more that he should suffer one moment, then all men and Angels for
ever and ever: He like a rich Creditor paid that in a few hours, that
we poor Creatures could never have overcome; and though the time
of his Passion was but short, and that in respect of the dignity of his
person, and for that he was enabled through his Godhead to perform
this great work in so short a space, yet he suffered so much in that short
time, as would have held us work, and kept us under for ever and
ever.</p>
                  <p>1. This sets out the ugliness of sin,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and that most woful case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we had plunged our selves by our sins, that if God had not put
forth all his wisdom, as we may so say, we must all have perished.</p>
                  <p>2. This setteth forth the most unspeakable love of God and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ towards us vile wretches:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> That Christ should abase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so low,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> to all that he suffered in body, in soul, from men, from
his Father especially, and for us Rebels his enemies, who had no need
of us, nay, might have been glorified in our destruction, O the infinite
depth of his love! And doth not this call for wonderful and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
love and affection from us to God again, to do and suffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he shall at any time require of us, to serve him night and day,
on hands and knees, with the whole might both of body and soul
(not a thought being out of his Service) yea, if it were to dye every
day for him?<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12.</note> Should we not say with <hi>David, What shall I render unto
the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> this above all others? Oh! it rebukes
our cold serving him, which will scarce lay down our lusts at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
who yet laid down his life for us, our proud lusts, revenging
lusts, covetous and worldly lusts, unclean lusts, &amp;c. O fearful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness! And how hardly are we brought to do duties? No
forwardness therein, negligence every way; and when we do them,
how cold and careless are we? O lamentable! Is a cold drowsie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
suitable to such a love as this? we may be even ashamed herein:
And for suffering, alas, we have no will, no not to endure a mock, a
frown of a great person; we will make friendship with the world, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to endure the least disgrace; we will forbear many duties,
nay, to keep company with Gods servants, onely lest we should be
counted Puritans; How shall we then be able to go to Prison and
death for the cause of Christ?</p>
                  <p>3. To all that mourn in Sion,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> to all that are heavy laden, hungring
after Christ Jesus, and willing to take up his yoke, and to all other
Believers, this is matter of most unspeakable consolation: Their sins be
gone, and all the punishment due to them; no punishment shall befal
them here (as on the ungodly) no wrath or condemnation hereafter:
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65522:208"/>
Their afflictions are merciful corrections to further their Salvation;
To them death is no death, but a passage to life, that whereupon their
Souls are received into Heaven, their bodies committed to the earth,
both which at the Resurrection shall be joyfully reunited; O how
should we walk worthy of this in all holiness and honesty! But to
all that shall not have part in Christ, there remains unspeakable misery,
it had been good for them they had never been born; they must bear
their own burthen, and sink to Hell, there to be for ever and ever: This
will be the portion of most, because so few receive Christ, so few are
humbled, so many through pride and profaneness refuse to be guided
by him; O how few will cast away their lusts, and yield up themselves
to be ruled by him and his Word! It will be most woful to the Turks,
Jews and Pagans, that shall perish without Christ; but yet of all
others, their judgement will be most fearful, which have had him
preached daily, and by the Ministers of God have been so often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
to embrace him, and yet have despised him, would none of
him; Oh, it will encrease their torment, to consider that they had offer
of Christ, and many believed in him, and were converted by the
same Sermons, whereat they themselves were no whit moved: O
this will fret hearts! O lets consider this, we that live in this
happy time! One would think every man should receive and imbrace
Christ Jesus, but alas, how few do this? for them that do not, it
will be their undoing: O give no rest unto your selves, till you can
get a discharge in and by Christ, confess, bewail, crave pardon, cry
to God, and resolve to turn to him: The water is now stirring, step
into this Pool of <hi>Bethesda.</hi>

Christ never was any, neither is or shall be; therefore all that reject
him, as Jews and Turks, or embrace him onely to halves, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
are in a fearful case, as all among our selves that trust to any
thing else besides him.</p>

and another great benefit redounding unto us thereby, namely, That

us from the power thereof, and to dissolve the works of the

dyed not to free us of half our misery, and leave us in the other half;
nor to be at a great deal of cost with us and for us, and yet leave us in
a case fit to do him no service (as if one should ransom a man out of
the Turks galleys, and leave him in the midway) but hath done all
this, that we might be fit to do him service, thereupon giving us his

mortified in us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> and we made live: He is not onely made of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

us,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> so hath he purged us to be a peculiar people unto himself: Christ
affords both,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 6. 20.</note> and from him we may as well look for the one as the

the other,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> and in token of our thankfulness, we ought to labor by

talk (say they) that we must be saved by Christs death, and by Faith

but as the Gospel is not a Doctrine of liberty, so neither do we
by preaching give way unto licentiousness:<note place="margin">See Rom. 3. 31.</note> The Gospel requires as
strict obedience as the Law doth, to every of Gods Commandments
(though not in extremity) neither freeth it us from any duty to God

we should live soberly,</hi>

to good works.</p>
                  <p>2. This setteth forth the wonderful goodness of Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that
hath not onely freed us from Gods wrath, and the punishment of our
sins (which is unspeakable goodness) but hath appointed to give us
his Spirit to free us from sin (for if we should all our life here have
lived after our own lusts, or under the power of Satan, what a base and
woful life had this been?) that we might both in heart and body serve
him in the works of holiness, and a godly life.</p>
                  <p>3. This condemneth all those that lay claim to the death of Christ,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
and yet live in their sins, and old lusts: Numbers in these days have
got this by the end, They hope to be saved by Jesus Christ; They be
no Papists, that look to be saved by their works, but they believe in
Jesus Christ with all their hearts, and yet they are not washed from
their old filthiness, but abide still in security in all or some of their
lusts: But let such know, they speak impossible things, God hath
joyned these two ends of Christs death, and they divide them, yea
blasphemous things, that Christ dyed to set men at liberty to live as
they list: O woful wretches, that can say, They hope to be saved by
Christ, and that he dyed for them, and yet can follow every vain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and wicked lust, to redeem them from which, it cost even the
blood of Christ (more worth then a thousand worlds) what is this, but
to set light by Christs death, which none can do, who hath his part
therein? yea, what is it but to crucifie him again, and to make a mock
of his death? what beastly unthankfulness is it, for any to say Christ
dyed for me,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> and yet to live in sin? nay, whosoever have faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
their pardon in Christ,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 3.</note> it purifieth their hearts, and the assurance
of such a love to us, must needs work love again in us, and that love
will constrain us, yet who useth not this shift? who flyeth not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,

found counterfeit, and made under a Bush, are taken from them,
and they themselves cast into Prison; So when God shall come to
examine those, this shall not free them or serve their turn, but they

dying in them,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> and themselves dead to all sin, and the love of any
one, and that they are renewed to live the life of God, and yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to all his Commandments: Though this be not as they would,
yet if their hearts can bear witness with them that this in truth, let
them be assured they have their part in Christs death. Having their
part in the latter benefit thereof, its an argument of the former; For
how come they to be now so changed into an hatred of all the sins,
which before they loved, and such a true and earnest care to please
God?<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Flesh and blood hath not so taught them, but Gods Spirit,</hi> and

                  <p>But many that would not willingly offend God for any thing,
and having failed in the least thing, are more troubled then

                  <p>Its not the mark of such as Christ dyed for,<note place="margin">R.</note> that they are freed
from sin altogether, but that they hate all sin, that they resist it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
prevail against the same; whereof if at any time they be overcome,
yet they rise again by unfained repentance, and stand up upon their
watch; for in the best of Gods Servants, there will some of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanilist
brood remain, as pricks in our sides, but so long as we keep
them Tributaries, we must not be discouraged; though our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
salley out upon us sometimes, yet if we make war upon them,
and chase them home, and so weaken them, they shall not prevail

set himself to mortifie his lusts, and all maner of evil, and that every

being a work of our whole life) yet must we be dead to the love of all
sin, open or secret, outward or inward, and so dye daily; as Christ
dyed, so should we labor, and be more and more dead to our lusts; as
he was crucified, so should we crucifie them, &amp;c. And can we live in
sin, that cost the price of the blood of Christ? Who would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
and cast from him the knife that killed his dearest friend? Thus
did sin to our Savior Christ, it was that which brought him to his
death.</p>
                  <p>1. The thing then that best beseems a Christian,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> is to mortifie his
vile lusts, to finde them out, to hate and pursue them to the death, to
apply all means to the weakning and killing thereof, ever hacking at
the roots thereof, by continual Prayer and Meditation, applying the
Word, Mercies, Corrections, all to the throat of our Corruptions;
for as nothing is more unbeseeming a Christian, then to be carried
away of any lust, so this should be our continual exercise, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
weakning our Corruptions. This is true Religion, it stands
not in hearing Sermons, but in mortifying our lusts, and bringing our
rebellious hearts in subjection to the will of God. And as we are to
labor for the subduing of all, so are we especially of our strongest
corruptions, that have most foiled us, most broke our peace, most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored
God, and have been of worst example.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh a wonderful fault in most Christians,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they have general purposes to resist sin and to do well, yet think
that they are not continually to labor for the mortifying thereof;
wherein failing, they do sometimes yield and give way to their lusts
to break out into open evils, vain speeches, slight oathes, worldly talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the Lords day, gaming, and the like: So for their inward lusts
of pride, covetousness, frowardness, security, dulness to duties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
coldness and customariness in the service of God; Alas, these
they look not after, but almost lay the reign on the neck of them,
so that if they reign not in them, yet they break out at every turn, and
are very rank in them, and shew forth themselves grosly to Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor,
their own discomfort, and the continual breach of their peace,
with much evil example to others.<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> As we would prove our selves

we must be alive to God, and to his Commandments in doing all
good. By righteousness is meant, the whole duty of man in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
throughout his whole conversation to God and Men: When
its joyned with holiness,<note place="margin">See Luk. 1. 75.</note> then it stands for the duties of the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note>

                     <hi>ye became the servants of righteousness;</hi> and to this

Satan, doing base work for woful wages, are now become the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God, employed in holy works, whereof here the fruits are,
peace of Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, and the end everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>We ought therefore to give our selves to an holy life in all things,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
shewing hereby whose we are, and to whom we belong, as its said of
the <hi>Merindolians,</hi> That they were known by their godly behavior,
wheresoever they became. It was a custom among the Romans, that
every one should carry some note of his Trade or Profession as he
went in the streets, a Carpenter his Rule, a Taylor his Yard or
Measure, &amp;c. So ought we to carry a badge of our Profession every
where about us, whether we go to Church, be at home in our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
go to Market, to our Shops, or Workfolks, &amp;c. even holiness
throughout our whole conversation. In prosperity we must shew
forth sobriety; in adversity, patience; at all times the fruits of love,
faithfulness, uprightness, &amp;c. Are we in company? our speeches
must be gracious and godly;<note place="margin">Luke 1. 75.</note> if alone, holy and heavenly minded:
And this we ought not to do a little by fits in a good mood, and when
we list, but we must walk in holiness and righteousness all the days of
our life; we must be continually ready to every good work, we must
be a peculiar people,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> zealous of good works: If these things be in
us, and abound, great profit will redound unto us, and hereunto must
we employ all our endeavors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By whose stripes ye were healed.]</hi> Now he returns again to Servants,
applying the benefit of Christ to them. By stripes, or wales of the
stripes, he means not onely the stripes he had of men, but all his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
he useth the word stripes, in respect of Servants, because
they suffered stripes of their Masters, and that for their especial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
as who did not suffer alone, and whose stripes were healed
through the stripes which Christ suffered.</p>
                  <p>All that Christ suffered for us,<note place="margin">All that Christ suffered was for our profit.</note> was wholesome and saving,
his shame, our glory; his condemnation, our absolution; his
curse, our blessing; his strokes, our peace; his death, our life. The
most grievous stripes that he suffered, have healed the most ugly and
deadly sores of our sins, which otherwise had been incurable: We
ought therefore to be content to suffer some stripes for him and for his
sake, and for the profession of his Name; he was mockt and reviled
for us, may not we then be content to suffer the like for him? What
are we to him? He became poor, to make us rich; if we be cut short
for his sake, shall we not endure it? Dost thou suffer any thing for
Christ? bear the same patiently; and great reason, Christ suffered
much for thee.<note place="margin">Christ dyed even for poor servants.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note further, that Christ dyed even for poor Servants, and that
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65522:210"/>
therefore the meanest are to labor after their part in Christ (and yet
who are more negligent then the poor are for the most part?) and
those poor that have their part in him, are to be highly thankful, and
bear their outward wants patiently, and think that God hath dealt
wonderfully for them, having passed by so many great, wise and
learned ones.</p>
                  <p>In the words also these particulars are implied,</p>
                  <p>1. That sin is a wound or disease;<note place="margin">Sin is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.</note> as a disease weakens the body, so
doth sin every faculty of the soul: As the former also brings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
on the body, causeth pain, and thereupon followeth death, so
doth the latter on the soul.</p>
                  <p>2. That our bodies are subject to many sicknesses,<note place="margin">Our bodies are subject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sicknesses.</note> and the diseases
thereof are oftentimes very grievous; and if those be such, what
are the diseases and pains of the soul? the one may put us in minde

                  <p>3. That Christ is our Physician,<note place="margin">Christ is our Physician.</note> both for body and soul; He hath
both skill, will, compassion, healeth us freely, and is ever near us; he
hath by his Passion purchased all good for us; he wrought many
cures and miracles in the days of his flesh, now he worketh by means,
and his blessing thereon.</p>
                  <p>4. That sin is hateful to God,<note place="margin">Sin hateful to God.</note> as for which Christ suffered
stripes.</p>
                  <p>Seek we therefore help in Christ,<note place="margin">Use.</note> we are sick of many diseases, we
cannot help our selves by any Medicine we can devise, Christ onely
can cure us: This Faith apprehends, for that the wounding of one
should heal another, is above Nature. Oh! how will men being sick
in body bestir themselves, that they may be cured; but being inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diseased through sin, how slack are they? how do they defer it to
the last, when its too late? There be but certain seasons to be cured
in, as the man at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda</hi> observed; miss we not our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,<note place="margin">How we may speed in our suits to Christ.</note>
lest we perish altogether. And that we may speed at the
hands of this our Physician, 1. We must feel our disease, and be
humbled, confess also and bewail the same to him. 2. Earnestly beg
of him to heal us. 3. Hurt our selves no more as near as we can.
4. Believe he will heal us. 5. Suffer the words of Exhortation, the
preaching of the Word being the means to cure our sinful Nature.
6. Take heed of dawbers, that cry Peace, peace. 7. Take heed of
all false cures, as by our selves, Masses, Pilgrimages, Indulgencies, &amp;c.
8. Abide the Lords leisure in the use of the means, though we should
be cured by threatnings of the Word, or by afflictions; yea, being
once cured, do we acknowledge the same to his glory, and be we
thankful;<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 3.</note> for its he alone that hath satisfied for our sins, he alone
through whom our sinful Nature is cured.</p>

that they were healed by Christ, by comparing their former
state wherein they were, with their present state: They were once in
a poor case, in a piteous taking, in a miserable and dangerous case; but
now through Gods mercy they were come home to Christ, who most
carefully did and would protect them to their Salvation: Before they
came to Christ, their case was woful and dangerous (as is the state of all
unregenerate persons) but now having taken hold of Christ, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

                  <p>1. Every Natural man is like a beast,<note place="margin">Every natural man is like a beast.</note> who is therefore in Scripture
compared to several sorts of beasts, for one ill quality or another; as
to Dogs,<note place="margin">Psa. 22. 12, 13, 16, 20.</note> for their malicious barking and biting at them they live with;
to Wolves, for their greedy devouring of the poor; to Lyons, for

them to shame them, and sometimes they are sent to school to
them: nay, all Gods Creatures are more serviceable then Man, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
God in their kind, and abide in their first estate; the Sun, Moon and
Stars obey God in their courses, the huge Sea rageth, and is calm at
his bidding; if he command it to stand as a wall, it doth so, to let Israel

<hi>Pharaoh;</hi> if God bid the Whale swallow <hi>Jonah,</hi> and cast him up again,
it obeys him in both; if he forbid the Lyons to touch <hi>Daniel,</hi> they
stir not, though very hungry, as the fire did not burn the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
&amp;c. But man, that should be best of all, and for whom all were
made, as he for God, yet walk stubbornly and rebelliously, omitting
what's required of him, and doing what's again and again prohibited:
therefore God calls all Creatures to witness against man;<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 2.</note> yea, they
are many times to set themselves against us (as when the heavens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as brass,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 1.</note> and the earth as iron, &amp;c.) and to groan because of us,
as being weary of doing any further service to such as we are.</p>
                  <p>O how ought this to humble all that be such,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that know no mark
of conversion or change in themselves from their unregenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
small cause hast thou to be proud; the Horse thou ridest on is

thou doest not that which the Lord requireth of thee; nay the Dog

then thou art, its serves God in its kinde, thou never didst any thing
that God set thee here for.</p>

O humble thy self before God,<note place="margin">Isa. 11. 6. 7, &amp;c.</note> &amp; crave of him to work an alteration

turning thee into a Christian man, renewing in thee his image, and
working of grace, that so thou mayest serve him in a better maner then
other creatures either do or can do; so shalt thou be more happy then
they, for they as they have no pain, so they shal have no glory, but thou
shalt go from hence to everlasting glory in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But as for all that continue in their Rebellion, as they are worse

<hi>Adam</hi> all went astray;<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 12.</note> we have no minde but of wandering and
roaming further and further the longer we live, till God take us into
the right way; so that whosoever dyes in the way he was born in,
and lived in first, must needs perish; its the way of ignorance, of sin,
the broad way to destruction: Some go out of the way by ignorance,
some by superstition, some by prophaneness, by hypocrisie, by trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to civility, &amp;c. naturally we do all go from God and Peace, to
Hell and the Devil. <hi>Abraham</hi> was out of his way whilest he was an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,<note place="margin">Psal. 58. 3.</note>
so <hi>Paul</hi> whilest he was a Persecutor: The wicked they go astray
even from the womb, they wander from every good work, and do
nothing well or pleasing to God: They delight to wander and take
pleasure in their sins; yea, that they thus wander, may appear by these
signs,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> They refuse instruction and reproof, whether publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
whereas the regenerate account those to love them indeed which
tell them of their faults; they live even in known sins, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
for the world, having no communion with God in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
they have no love to good company, but associate themselves
with others like themselves, and of their own stamp: If they do good
duties,<note place="margin">How they come to be misled.</note> its for sinister respects, not out of conscience: Thus the Devil
misleads some; Antichrist seduceth thousands by false Doctrine and
miracles, as wicked Ministers by seldom or erroneous teaching and
bad lives: So is the world a great deceiver by bad examples, by false
reports of the servants of God, and by the profits and pleasures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
yea, a mans own heart is a great deceiver, as whereby many think
they are in the way to Heaven, when they be in the way to destruction:
Ignorance also of the Scriptures is a great cause of being deceived;
<hi>Ye erre</hi> (saith our Savior) <hi>not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> nay, God in justice
gives some over to believe lyes, as <hi>Ahab</hi> was seduced by false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to his destruction:<note place="margin">Psal. 95. 11.</note> they may provoke God so long by their

                     <hi>What have I done? &amp;c. There's a way that seemeth good in a mans
eyes, but the issues thereof are the issues of death:</hi> To those whom God
means to save, he sends his Word and Spirit, and so opens their eyes
to see that they be out of their way, and that not onely prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but also some hypocrites, that have contented themselves with
some common things, as <hi>Herod</hi> did, and sometimes civil persons, that
thought their state very good, that God opens their eyes to see it to be
woful, and make them hasten out of it, saying as those in the <hi>Acts,
What shall we do to be saved?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2. 37, &amp; 26, 18.</note> we finde we are in the way to damnation;
but most men will not be perswaded of this, but go on with a liking
of their way, though it be to their destruction: To this end Ministers
must preach the Law, and shew men that be out of their way, &amp; people
must take out this lesson; and this is the first, till this be, nothing is.</p>
                  <p>3. As the sheep is most subject to wander,<note place="margin">No natural man can of himself come home to God.</note> but of all Creatures
hath least wisdom to finde the way home again; so no natural man
can come home to God alone: we can go further and further from
God, but to come home one step we cannot; we are blinde and cannot
see a step of the way, have no minde but to wander, <hi>All the thoughts of
mans heart are onely evil continually,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 6. 44.</note> &amp; we cannot think a good thought;

                  <p>If any be come home to God from his wandring state,<note place="margin">Use.</note> let him
give all the glory to God, and know, that there was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and those that yet wander, if God had not sought them,
and as it were fetcht them home on his shoulders; if God had not
thus done for us, we had wandred to this hour, yea to our dying day,
as well as others, therefore wonder and praise God: And for those
that yet wander, let them not bless themselves, as if they could turn
to God when they list, as many think, Oh, they will cry God a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
at their end, &amp;c. but while you have life and time with the means,
entreat God to bless the means from Heaven to be mighty, to open
your eyes, and to bring you home from straying, into the way that
leadeth into eternal life.</p>
                  <p>4. As the sheep that is wandred is in manifold dangers,<note place="margin">The natural man is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual danger.</note> so and
much more certainly is every natural man in inevitable danger, if he
so continue: He is out of Gods special providence, as the stray sheep
is from the tendance of the Shepherd, his eye is not over him: He
hath no certain abiding, as <hi>Cain,</hi> knows not what to do; he is sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from the company of Gods people, and what evil may not then
befal him? As a sheep is in danger to be carryed away by diverse
Lords, into whose several grounds he cometh; so is a natural man in
danger of the Devil, the World, his own lusts, in danger to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every sin (what hath he to stop him?) into any plague or punishment
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65522:212"/>
that ever fell upon any (what promise hath he to the contrary?) yea,
as sheep are apt to fall into the mouthes of Dogs and Wolves, so may
the natural man fall into the paws of the Devil, and be turned into
Hell, he knows not how soon: Is not he in danger that is naked in a
field, and beset with Bills, Bows and Guns, all bent against him to
destroy him?<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 19.</note> so is it with every wicked man, as being subject to all
the plagues of God: Is not he in danger that hangs over a pit by a
twig? so is every wicked man by the threed of his life over Hell:
When a wicked man riseth in the morning, doth he know what may
befal him ere night? can he tell but he may fall even into the foulest
sins? can he tell but that the earth may swallow him, a thunderbolt
may strike him through, he may have any curse befal him or his? can
he tell but he may be in Hell ere night, and at night, ere morning?
and is not this danger enough? Thus hundreds of this Land drop in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell every day, and in every corner some, at one time or another,
by one means or another the Devil lays hold on them.</p>
                  <p>This may make every wicked man weary of his condition,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and to
have little joy of himself, till he be out of this state, who can abide
to live in a continual danger? For them that be gone, and of whom
Hell hath already caught hold, there's no hope or help: You that are
alive, look to your selves, were you out of this condition, you could
not be overcome, you could not be pluckt from God by Angels or
Devils, all the world could not prevail against you, being under Christs
keeping, he would keep you unto the end.</p>

of God, to the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who having redeemed them, will not now lose them, but safely
preserve and keep them to life eternal both in body and soul. So that</p>
                  <p>All that are come to God in Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">All Believers are in a safe condition.</note> be in a most safe state;
for besides that they have pardon of sin (the Robe of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
being put on them) they have the Spirit to sanctifie them from
the power of sin, and to enable them to please God in a new life: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they fall from this estate, nor can fall into any sin unto death;
theres no condemnation to them, neither the Devil nor World
shall be able to draw them to their old state, Christ that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
them will never lose them; Who will lose a purchase dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bought? but so are we to Christ; Who will not keep his Limbs?
we are made Members of Christ; Will he suffer one to be pulled off?
God forbid:<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 11.</note> Christ having redeemed us, commits us to his Fathers
keeping, and who being under his protection, is not in a safe Castle or
impregnible Fortress? Not onely they are sure they can never, fall
finally, but also Christ hath a care of every sheep, to keep him in the
right way, to fetch him in when he wanders, to comfort him being
heavy,<note place="margin">See Psal. 43. 1. and 46. 4.</note> and to binde him up being broken: What Christian findes not

so strong, we have cause to fear, but as <hi>Elisha</hi> said to his Servant,
<hi>There are more on our side,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kings 6. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>then they that be against us:</hi> We have much
opposition against our good and standing, but we are not left to our
selves; Our Salvation now is, not as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> but its in Gods
keeping, and we are by him kept as in a Castle, we are kept by his
power, which is Almighty, above all power, but how long? for a
few years, and then left to our selves? O if we were left the last year,
last day, last hour, we would fall from God if occasion were offered,
but kept we are by the power of God to Salvation, till we come to
Heaven. O let us be thankful to God for this safe and happy state, and
keep our selves close to him, and continually seek him, and commend
our selves to his keeping, and then we be safe. Here is no cause indeed
of security or boldness, for though we cannot fall finally, yet dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously,
and to our hearts smart we may, if we wax careless, as many
times even Christians come to the sheepfold, yet keep not so close to
their shepherds voyce as they ought, but are bold to be straying into
one by-way or other; as of pride, covetousness, contention, and the like,
and this costs them dear, who if they would have been ruled by their
shepherds voyce outwardly in his Word, or inwardly in his Spirit, no
question they might have spared this.</p>
                  <p>2. Let those that be yet wandring,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> hasten to come home to Christ,
and be in this most safe and happy estate; let them confess, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves, and seek for pardon, and listen to the voyce of their
blessed shepherd Christ Jesus, who calls them to him; if they so do,
they shall make a happy change: But when we require this of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
they set light by it, and think they are well enough, and better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;
now they may have their will, and be merry, and speak what
they list, and do what they list, and get gain as they can, but if they
should be convert, and be ruled by the Preacher, they should then be
tyed too short, as they should do nothing, have no liberty, but be in
bondage, &amp;c. O poor Creatures, that think that liberty which is deadly
bondage; little do those consider, that their sweet meat (Sin) will have
with it a great deal of sowre sawce: And the service of God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
freedom, tying from nothing, but from sin, and to nothing, but
that which is good and holy, to our comfort here, and Salvation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
and doth not this shrewdly hurt us? Do not therefore let the
foolish and beastly pleasures of sin keep you from turning to God, for
it will be woful in the end: If we saw a man going to Execution in
brave apparel, with musick, and his companions bringing him bowls of
wine, would we delight herein, or count him happy? would we not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pity him for all this? more need have they of pity that will needs
run on in sin, and following their lusts and pleasures, refuse to return
unto Christ the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Ministers of the Word are Shepherds under Christ.</note> &amp;c.] Christ performeth the office of a Shepherd and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to his people, outwardly by the Ministery of his Servants, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Word, and inwardly by his holy Spirit: His Ministers
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65522:213"/>
be the inferior Shepherds, under the chief Shepherd Christ Jesus; He
useth them to feed his people with green Pastures, to lead them to the
still waters of comfort, to fetch home the wandring, &amp;c. who are
therefore called <hi>Watchmen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 32. 7. 34, 8.</note> and <hi>Shepherds.</hi> Its the duty of all Ministers
that have the charge of souls,<note place="margin">Their duty.</note> to be most vigilantly watchful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
careful over the people committed to their care: As watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
must be careful in keeping the City from their Enemies; as those
shepherds to whom the Angels appeared in the Gospel, were watching
over their Flocks by Night; yea, as <hi>Jacob</hi> in tending his Flocks, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
both the cold by night, and the heat by day; so much more must
they,<note place="margin">See Act. 20. 28.</note> in Preaching in season and out of season, praying, holy living, and
by all means seeking to gain men to God, fetching home the stray ones,
binding up the broken, comforting the feeble, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those Ministers,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that in stead of watchmen, are
blinde, and careless, sleepers, that delight in sleeping, in stead of shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
are wolves, devouring the flock, eating the fat, &amp; cloathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the fleeces: Those as either they cannot feed, or come not
at their flock to feed them; so do they not care to fetch home them
that are astray, but rather by their ill example keep them from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and so far are they from comforting the weak, and binding up the
broken, as they have no skill herein, or list hereto, but rather set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against such: There are but few that make Conscience to hear
the Word abroad, when they have it not at home, yet those are more
baited at for going to the Word, then all they that sit in Aleho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses, or
are gaming or ryoting on the Lords-day: Those are also to be reproved
that feed with froth in stead of sound meat, as those that are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in feeding, feed them to halves, and half starve them: O Lord,
what shall become of those, when the great Shepherd Christ Jesus shall
come to Judgement? where shall they stand? for even they that have
been most careful, yet are far short; of all mens answers that I know, I
would be loathest to have the answer of a wicked and unfaithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to make.</p>
                  <p>2. As the Ministers must do their duties,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> so ought the people like
sheep that wander, suffer themselves to be brought home into Christs
flock and sheepfold, and not let the Ministers labor with them year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
year, and yet they never the nearer being brought home to Christ:
And those that be brought home to Christ, must be careful that they be
led out still, and fed in the green Pastures, that they listen to their shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
voyce, and follow it carefully, that so the Ministers may yield
up their account with joy, and not with grief, and that is good for the
people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Thus if we do, God shall have the glory, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
the comfort, and the people shall save their own souls; And
the great shepherd shall say to us, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father,</hi> and set
a crown of immortal glory upon our heads.</p>

in apparel (faults whereunto naturally women are too much addicted)
ver. 3. he perswadeth them on the contrary to deck themselves rather
with grace, especially meekness and quietness, as not onely being in the

                  <p>Herein our Apostle insisteth the more largely,<note place="margin">Why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle insisteth so largely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the duties of wives.</note> for that upon his and
the other Apostles preaching, That Believers were not to marry with

brake off society with their husbands because of their beastly and
strange lusts; a slander arose, that the Apostles taught, That wives
were not to be subject to their husbands, especially if they were Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels;
against this our Apostle here cleareth himself and his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath it been with Gods Ministers from time to time (even
Christ himself was slandered) and therefore when the like befals us,<note place="margin">Obs.</note>
we must not be discouraged.<note place="margin">Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters have been at all times ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be slandered.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let people take heed how they slander a Minister; for if it be a
wicked part to bear false witness against any man,<note place="margin">See 2 Cor. 6.</note> how much more
against a Minister,<note place="margin">Use.</note> being a publique person, and whereby much hurt
may redound? Such slanderers work Journey-work for the Devil in
an high degree; take heed that you slander them not out of ignorance,
but especially out of malice: Neither censure before you know the
matter fully;<note place="margin">Prov. 18. 13.</note> for, <hi>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it</hi> (that is,
advisedly considereth thereof) <hi>it is folly and shame unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Likewise,</hi> &amp;c.] There's subjection required of Inferiors towards
their Superiors, so of Servants towards their Masters, and here of
Wives towards their Husbands;<note place="margin">The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> but this must be considered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for as much subjection of them, as of any servant or drudge,
which is not the minde of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>be in subjection to your own husbands,]</hi> Here's required of
wives,<note place="margin">Wives must be subject to their husbands</note> subjection towards their husbands; though God made them in
many things equal, yet in wisdom he thought meet to make some little
inequality, and appointed the husband to be the Superior and Head,
and so to rule,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 8, 9.</note> and the wife to be subject to him; yet not so, but that
he hath his Rules to bound his rule,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 13.</note> that it exceed not. It was Gods
will even in the state of innocency, that the wife should have been
subject, though it should have been more willing, free and pleasant,
then it is now (for now its not done without difficulty) but after the
Fall,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> God laid it on her as a punishment, <hi>for being deceived, she was first
in the transgression.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:65522:215"/>
This is often required,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 22, 23.</note> and hence it is that the husband is called the
wives Head,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 18.</note> and for this cause was the vail, betokening her subjection.
Neither is this without Reason;<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> for if all were equals in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
there would be confusion; and if all Bells were of a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and all the strings of an instrument of one size, there would be
a harsh sound, and no melody: So were there not some small inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
between husbands and wives, there could not but be contention.
Its Gods order that wives be subject, as its his order the Sun should
shine, the Earth bear fruit, the Heavens cover us: If these things
should not do thus, it were monstrous; so, unless wives will be Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
they must be subject. Accordingly God hath provided to make
man the stronger, the woman the weaker vessel, that he might be the
fitter to rule; she (feeling her own weakness) the more willing to be
ruled. This she ought to account an especial mercy, as having a Head
to guide her, who else, having had the rule in her own hand, had
been unable to manage it aright; yea, as this is no servile or base sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
but joyned with equality in many things (which is signified
in her making, not of mans head, lest she should be superior, nor
of his Foot, lest she should be much inferior, but of his Ribs,
to shew equality:) So hereby they are freed from all other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
as of Parents, Masters, &amp;c. yea, in many things are not
subject as it were to Law, as for whom their husbands must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p>This subjection must guide the whole Conversation,<note place="margin">Wherein their subjection consisteth.</note> besprinkle
the speech, and cause a right Affection and quiet Spirit. This
stands in reverencing their husbands in their hearts, and shewing it
in words and behavior, as its in the following Verse: She must
also submit her self to the advice, counsel and direction of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
for her dyet, apparel, &amp;c. not doing things of her own minde,
but with his counsel.</p>
                  <p>As the Moon hath all her light from the Sun,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> so must she have her
direction from her husband; and as the great Wheel of the Clock
must guide about all the rest; so must he be to her, and she must not
have a proper motion by her self: If he do any thing, she must take
liking, and not thwart or control the same; nay, if she should know
a thing to be better then that he is about (as concerning removing to
this place ot that, buying this, or selling that, &amp;c.) yet being not in
a thing simply unlawful, she must not cross him (gently perswade
him she may) much less stand upon her own wit and will contrary to
his minde: And if she should see him impatient, yet is it not her part
to requite like for like, neither to carry her self unreverently; nay,
though she see he doth that which is unlawful, she must not check
him at her pleasure, but by fair means endeavor that he may see and
leave the same; she must also be obedient to all his lawful commands,
and frame herself to his nature and liking, so far as she may with a good
conscience: Indeed to consent to his evil, or to do evil at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 29.</note>
that she may not by any means (<hi>for God is to be obeyed rather
then man</hi>) yet even in these she must refuse with humility and due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65522:216"/>
to her husband: Though she have a good cause, yet she may
handle it ill.</p>
                  <p>This rebuketh the contrary unreverence and base esteem which too
too many wives have of their Husbands;<note place="margin">Use.</note> O how unseemly and stout
is their behavior towards them? Not a few having many good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in them, yet are curst, snappish, stand too stifly in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
will carry away the day, and have the last word, especially if
they have a good cause; such do grosly forget themselves: Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
parts a woman hath, yet if she be not subject and dutiful to her
husband,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they are nothing, she is as a curst Cow that gives a good
pail of milk, and kicks it down with her foot: Let such endeavor to
see this fault in themselves, and repent thereof from their heart, striving
against their froward nature; let such know, that as subjection is Gods
Ordinance,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> so its the very being of a wife. Whats an hand, if it have
no power of handling? or any eye, if it see not? so a wife without
subjection: Though there may be Parentage, Portion, Beauty,
Housewifery, &amp;c. yet if this be wanting, there is nothing of a wife:
There are also others which be so unreasonable, so froward, so mad,
and bedlem-like, which do so scold and brawl, as they care not what
they say,<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 4.</note> being a vexation to their Husbands hearts, and corruption
to their bones, that are as it were a whipping stock and house of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to them continually: the contention of such is a continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 13. and 21. 9.</note>
                     <hi>and it is better to dwell in the corner of a house top, then with such in a
wide house:</hi> But hereof I have heretofore spoken at large.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Not onely must wives be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that have good Husbands,<note place="margin">Wives must be subject even unto bad hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> but even they which have infidel hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
cross, unkinde, and most irreligious Husbands; for they are
their husbands whom they have chosen, and are now in covenant of
God withal, and which God hath laid out for them as a blessing or
cross:<note place="margin">See Mat. 5. 41.</note> if any shall say, This is very hard, let such know, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
mnst do difficult things, and such as no other can do, whether
Papist,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Hypocrite, or Civil persons; every Bungler can make good
work of good straight Timber, but he that can make good work of
that which is crooked and knotty, is worthy commendation.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those that except against their husbands:<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Oh, will
some say, if my husband were as such a womans husband, kinde,
courteous, religious, &amp;c. it would not grieve me to do any thing for
him, I could lay my hand under his feet, but mine is thus and thus.
<hi>Ans.</hi> Ye must not look what others be, but what your own is; though
they fail in their duties towards you, yet must not you in yours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, stoppage is no payment, Gods Word must be your rule.</p>
                  <p>2. If they that have such ill husbands,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> yet must do their duty wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
how much more they that have loving, godly, careful hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands?
How great is their sin that do not their duty to such, but are
ever finding fault, complaining, murmuring, unquiet? such may
justly fear, lest God take away those, and send them such as will be
a cross to them: If any have found it so, let it lead them to repentance,
and let others take heed by their example.</p>

themselves with such:<note place="margin">Wives are not to marry irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</note> This were an unequal match, which is often
spoken against in the holy Scriptures; This were to make league with
the wicked and Gods enemies,<note place="margin">See Gen. 6. 2, 3</note> This were the way to pollute our

neglect whereof doth occasion that their Husbands do often despise
their forwardness and profession of Religion, even because they do not

reproach them for Profession, and cut them short of their liberty:
But when after long looking they finde them sound and careful every

we keep our bodies and souls pure and undefiled Temples of the Holy
Ghost, and Members of Christ Jesus; This is to be observed through
our whole life, whether in single or married estate: In single estate
there must be abstaining from all uncleanness, not onely of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
act natural or unnatural, but from all uncleanness of the ear,
delighting to hear beastly speech, of the tongue to utter it, of the eye,
so to behold any object as to lust after it, as also a diligent use of all
good means to preserve from these, till God call to Marriage, and
then to embrace that holy and honorable remedy, which God hath
appointed for many good uses and ends: In married estate, Chastity
must also be preserved; Wives must be chaste, not onely avoyding all
outward and detestable acts of uncleanness with strange men, but
even of tongue or heart, and all the least shews and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances

apparel would have been to mans body as a cloud to the Sun, not to

better then the Taylors workmanship) but when we by sin had wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our selves, God was fain to cover it with a plaister; our apparel
then is a badge of our sin, and ought to humble us in the remembrance

                  <p>3. Its a most unseemly thing for Christians to put excellency in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and to be so careful in these outward toys: It becomes the
the world well enough, that know no better clothing, neither looking
for grace here, nor glory hereafter; but for Christians thus to do, its
base: The other have their portion here, and know no better thing,
therefore no marvel though they be very careful about this, and as the
Gentiles,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 32.</note> seek after the same, and the like; but Christians should
think themselves best when they are modestly and lowly attired, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
with grace. We professing our selves Pilgrims here, ought to
live as Pilgrims, and not follow the fashion of this or that Countrey
in every fangle or garish apparel, and so live as Citizens or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of this world: We professing our selves to be travelling to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Maa. 7. 13.</note>
must be humble, and stoop low, for the gate is straight, we
must not load our bodies and mindes with these things, for they will
hinder us in our journey.</p>
                  <p>4. Its absurd to place excellency in such a thing as apparel, for we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
borrow it of poor creatures which be far inferior to our selves: The
best silk is the excrement of crawling Worms, the finest cloath but
of the fleece of the silly Sheep; so we borrow the skin of one, the
bones of another, the hair or fleece of another. Will any Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
borrow apparel of a mean Yeoman,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or if he were put to such a
shift, would he be proud of it, or not rather be ashamed? seeing we be
put to borrow of the creatures (so far our inferiors) for our clothing,
having nothing of our own but nakedness, we should not be proud
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65522:220"/>
of it: Besides, when we have done all we can, there be sundry Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
have better then we, and many Players, Dancers and Strumpets
have as good and better;<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 28.</note> yea, there's put upon Horses, velvet, gold,
&amp;c. and when all is done we are not so fine as the lilly of the
field.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. When the outside is so much decked, commonly the inside is
neglected, lightly both are not well lookt to; but the soul the inside
should be best cloathed, the body is but the case of the soul, and the
apparel but the case of the body, we never make the case of a thing
so good as that we put up therein.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Presents of good worth are often
lapt up in papers, and so sent: They that give themselves most to
gay clothes, have no leisure nor care to deck themselves inwardly,
therefore are like painted vessels, having a fair outside, but an empty
and mean inside;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> like a Jade with a velvet saddle and gilded trappings:
Will any man esteem the Horse because of them? or will he not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pull these off him, and then try what mettal he is of? In many
men and women their outside is fairest; but if an house were neatly
painted without, and like an Hogsty within, who would not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Whereas such as set their minde so much on brave apparel, look
to be hereupon highly esteemed, regarded and reverenced: God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
crosseth their pride, so as they miss their aym; some laugh
at them, some envy them, some are angry at them, some speak against
them, O there's a notable proud woman; yea, those that crouch to
them, yet in heart mislike them, and the poor say, Since gay clothing
came up, they could get but little relieve: So, whereas hereby
they thought to please all, they please none, neither God nor
man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. It betters not them that wear it, whether they be beautiful in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or deformed, vertuous in minde, or vicious; If beautiful, what
needs such a deal of stir, which doth indeed hinder their natural
beauty? If deformed, hereby their deformity is not hid, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made more known, then else it would; If vertuous, its not
gay cloaths, but their vertues that sets them out, no more then a
candle light, gives light at noon day to the light of the Sun, neither
shall you lightly finde any truly vertuous, and industrous in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
that give their mindes to costly apparel; If vicious, its cost ill
bestowed, and so will all say, and this will not make them the less, but
the more vicious, for it will make them more proud, ambitious, lustful,
covetous, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 8. They that give themselves to constliness in apparel, Sin 1. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, abusing his Creatures to Pride, and in neglecting his
worship publique and private, or coming unprepared thereto, while
they are providing and putting on their knacks, and gew-gawds, dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves by the hour, and praying by the minute. 2. Against
themselves, by neglecting the inward cloathing of the soul, which is
of most worth, and by procuring a great deal of envy and ill speech,
and many censures upon themselves: Many Maids also of small Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65522:220"/>
deck themselves beyond their degree, as that no man of wisdom,
or that's careful to live, dares meddle with them; and so where they
might have been honestly and well bestowed if they had gone decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
their garishness hath made them stay without Husbands, till being
ashamed and wearied hereof, they have at last cast away themselves
upon some swaggeres. 3. Against their Neighbors, in provoking them
to the like by their bad example; for when some begin, others quickly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
follow after, and Pride once begun spreads quickly, especially
where Religion keeps it not down: Hereby also themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so disabled, that their rich Neighbors are not so often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
as before, nor their poor Neighbors in any good sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>9. Its a sin, and the cause and encreaser of much sin; It comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
from pride, and a high conceit of ones self, and it doth encrease pride
greatly &amp; cherish it; It hinders much good, much service to God, much
good to our souls; It breaks the neck of hospitality which hath been
in former times; for though our Forefathers would for festival times
have good apparel, yet they wore it so seldom, as it was still new, and
lasted so long, as they were stil able to do good, but now its both cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and almost every day put on wears out apace; The buying of such
slight Stuffs, and changing their fashion so often, is very chargeable;
besides that, this hinders one great good that ought to be, and that
comes of old apparel, namely, to cloath the poor Saints and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ: Now most wear such thin slight Stuffs, as that they
are quickly in pieces, and not fit to keep a poor body warm; It causeth
also much evil, racking of Rents, enhancing of Fines in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
oppression in Farmers, in Shop-keepers, falshood, deceit, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all to hold up bravery, yea, it causeth also lust in the wearers,
and provokes it in others.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then that excess in apparel is so dangerous and prejudicial,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
let all such as are faulty this way, endeavor to see their folly and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
herein, and accordingly reform themselves; and for those that
are modestly attired, let them so continue: Thus shall they bewray
more vertue in their mindes, have more time to serve God, and have
better ability to do good upon every occasion, with more peace to their
consciences.</p>

that will break out like a whirlwind against the ungodly, who
will be found naked; The more we have of this, we shall appear the
more comely and beautiful before God, his Angels, and all good men;
This is the most costly apparel that can be, of Gods own making,
and which none but his children wear; This is apparel for all Sexes,
ages, degrees and callings whatsoever, and which doth well become
and fit each of them; neither are great ones to despise it, for that
mean ones wear it, for this doth not derogate from its worth, onely
they that are Gods people wearing it; This is never out of season,
(as serving both for Summer and Winter) never out of fashion: It
fits in Youth, in Age, in Life, in Death, and is to be worn as well by
night as by day, in sickness as in health, yea, is then in great account,
when other apparel is laid aside, and not regarded; yea, this apparel
we carry with us out of this world, when we leave our gay Robes
behinde us, and this apparel lasts ever, being the better for the

and found naked, when God shall come to Judgement; such, though
outwardly brave, be inwardly base; their souls are not onely void of
good, but filled with all evil and noysom lusts; they are like a dead

                     <hi>For after this maner, &amp;c.]</hi> From the force of the Reason, holy
women have done so, therefore so must you. Note, that</p>
                  <p>The examples of Gods servants are to be followed in all their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues:<note place="margin">The examples of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are to be followed in all their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note>
The way of Gods Precepts is like an uncouth and bushy way,
the way of examples a beaten way; and herein by setting up his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
as lights to direct us, God hath condescended to our weakness:
Were it not thus,<note place="margin">See Luk. 7. 32</note> we would say of precepts, Its true, we should do
thus,<note place="margin">1 Cor 10. 6.</note> but who ever did so? God shews us every where who they
were:<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4, 5. and 12 1, &amp;c.</note> All examples are written for our good, the examples of the
godly (as <hi>Abels</hi> offering in Faith, <hi>Enochs</hi> walking with God, <hi>Noahs</hi>
obedience, <hi>Moses</hi> his mildeness, <hi>Jobs</hi> patience, &amp;c.) for our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the examples of the ungodly and their punishment for our evita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yea, even in our own times God presenteth divers unto us,
that they which belong unto him may be drawn on by the light of
precepts and examples together, as others left without excuse, who do
not such and such duties, which are to their knowledge by others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>This rebuketh those that follow the evil,<note place="margin">Use.</note> but do not imitate good
examples, neither are any whit moved by them: Those can make
use of the frailties of Gods children mentioned in Scripture, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
themselves in evil; Did nor <hi>David</hi> commit adultery? was
not <hi>Noah</hi> drunk? and did not <hi>Rebekah</hi> cause <hi>Jacob</hi> to lye? &amp;c. will
they say: Such wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction. So
among our selves, if any be bad and licentious, they shall have enough
to follow them; but as for the examples of the godly, they little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
nay, people are so far from following them, that they mock and
disdain them, yea, term them Hypocrites, Precise fools, and the like:
Well, let such make as light of them as they will, God will not lose
his labor, and his light set up: They that make them not now their
patern for imitation, shall finde them one day their Judges to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> as <hi>Noah</hi> did the old world: As the Ninivites against the
Israelites;<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 41.</note> so many a husband shall rise up against his wife on the day
of Judgement, and many wife against her husband, as many a man
against his neighbor; and justly, for its clear that those love darkness
and to wander, which will neither be guided by precept nor example,
whereas God might onely give us precepts, and yet require obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
Its true, all shine not alike; some have their light dimmed for
a time, through some unbeseeming act; howsoever, there's not the
example of any whereby we may not receive some profit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the old time,]</hi> The Antiquity of the examples, are an enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or inducement to follow them; but how, simply because they
be ancient? No: but holy men did thus, and well they did, and
that long ago; He doth urge them to follow examples onely
upon Antiquity, but because they were good also. Note then,
That</p>
                  <p>Antiquity joyned with verity,<note place="margin">Antiquity joyned with verity, is reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and to be followed.</note> is reverend, and to be followed: If
a truth in judgement or practice of life be ancient and gray-headed, its
the more honorable, and to be followed; but if an opinion or practice
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65522:223"/>
be wicked, though never so ancient, its vile, and to be detested, and
is not the better, but much the worse for the antiquity of it: The older,
the more time it were quite banisht out of the Land, Town, House and
Heart.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use.</note> and all such as plead bare
antiquity onely, it hath been thus and thus long, will they say; ours
is the old Religion, and yours is the new: No, ours is ancientest from
the beginning, whereof were the Patriarchs, Prophets, Christ and his
Apostles: Their stories mention when and how theirs began, encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and grew, out of an heap of Ceremonies of the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
mingled together, one Pope devising one thing, another adding
another; Though error and wickedness may be very ancient, yet
truth and goodness hath the start of it, the truth was before sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the world, this therefore is no good rule; this is ancient, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its to be followed, nay, is it also good? Its else nothing: Many
Papists have nothing to say, but thus did our Fathers and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
&amp;c. but they never enquire by the Word, whether they did
well or not,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> whereas our conversation may become wicked through
the tradition of our Elders: So among our selves, if any be reproved
for this or that, they will answer, It hath been done thus these forty
years; It was so ere you came, and will be when you are gone; If
it be a wicked and unlawful custom, why plead you for it? Its more
then time it were banisht, it stinks; because thus they did in darkness,
therefore we should so do in the light, what folly were this? They
will not do so in worldly things, as apparel, dyet, building. They
were wont to go in hose and stockings all of one, and have no chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
in their houses, who will now do thus? yet better retain those,
then bad and unlawful customs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Holy women]</hi> There hath always been a company of holy women
in the world as well as of men,<note place="margin">There have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the world as well as men.</note> and why not? both were made after
Gods image, at first equally good, and in the fall, both are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupt, and the children of wrath, and in the recovery have equal
right to Christ, to the Gospel, to Grace, to Sanctification and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men have no priviledge this way; Grace had been as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on them, (as in the Old Testament, on <hi>Sarah, Rebekah, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,
Deborah, Jael, Hannah, Naomi, Abigail,</hi> &amp;c. and in the New,
on the three <hi>Maries, Elizabeth, Lidia, Dorcas,</hi> with sundry others)
as on men.</p>
                  <p>Women also were as forward to maintain Christ, to follow him, to
bury him, and Christ after his resurrection first appeared to them.
Our own experience also</p>
                  <p>Sheweth,<note place="margin">Why women are as forward as men.</note> that in most Congregations women be as forward as men
in frequenting the Word and Sacrament: And why not? 1. They
are of a timerous nature, and so more easily wrought upon by the
Word, and by Gods Judgements. 2. They keep at home, not seeing
or hearing the abominations that be abroad. 3. They have many
crosses and pains, sicknesses, and Childe-bearings, putting them in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65522:224"/>
minde of death, and drawing them near to God, and so furthering their
Salvation.</p>
                  <p>1. This serveth to stop the mouths of such idle heads as take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to disgrace women.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It serveth to encourage women and to comfort them:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> There
have been ever good women, women therefore must stir up themselves
to encrease the number, especially having more means then those had
in former times.</p>
                  <p>And needful it is that there should be good women as well as good
men;<note place="margin">Its needful there should be good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> 1. For their own sake, who have souls to save or destroy. 2. That
there might be an holy seed to make up the number of the Elect; good
Mothers bringing up their children well, and good Wives being
helpers to their Husbands both in soul and body.</p>
                  <p>As for those women that be wicked, unclean, prophane and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
notwithstanding the fearfulness of their nature, their keeping at
home, and their manifold crosses, What would they have been if they
had been men? They would have been monsters, and of such women-monsters,
Hell is as full as of men-monsters.</p>
                  <p>Note further,<note place="margin">Holiness is that which commends one</note> That he saith not, wealthy women, fair women, but
holy women; Here's the ground of his commendation: A little holiness
is better then a great deal of riches and beauty;<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 30. and 20. 15.</note> That that is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of a man, is his goodness; Beauty fades with sickness, wealth
hath many ways to take it away, but grace holds ever to life eternal,
and commends before God, Angels, and good men: Therefore when
God threatned to take the wealth from the rich men of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 4. 3.</note> and
gay cloaths from the women, yet saith, he will make them amends,
How? <hi>Every one shall be called holy;</hi> They shall so profit by their
affliction, as where it might have been said, Yonder goes a rich man,
yonder goes a fair woman, a woman in costly apparel; now, Yonder
goes a godly man, a vertuous gracious woman: This is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
indeed, and for this we ought to labor, that we may have our part
herein.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">Marriage no hinderance to godliness.</note> He calls them holy, though they were married; Marriage
hinders not holiness, nor is single life more holy then it: Its the holy
Ordinance of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> and the bed undefiled: The gift also of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and single life, is sometimes given to carnal worldlings, and
prophane persons, but denyed to Gods dear Servants, by whom he will
encrease his Church and Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use.</note> Oh, they extol single life,
and disgrace Marriage, as if it were a living in the flesh: O their vile
hypocrisie! they would seem holy, and yet maintain Stews openly;
yea, some of them have written in defence of Sodomy, and for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and Adultery; the infinite skulls of murthered Infants (the
fruit of their Whoredoms) found near the Dens of their abode, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
how unholy they are. The Pope would be <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, yet
was he a married man: Till God call us to marriage, we are to live
in single estate purely;<note place="margin">Luke 4. 39.</note> when we are married, soberly and holily:
If we be single, we are not the more holy, or if married, the less holy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:65522:224"/>
But how could they be holy in those days?<note place="margin">Holiness co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by Faith in Christ.</note> By Faith in Christ,
whereby their hearts were purified, they severed from the world to the
Lords use.</p>
                  <p>There's no Sanctification, no Salvation, but by Christ: Now
Christ is more clearly revealed then he was in those days, more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is therefore now expected; all ignorant, unbelieving, impenitent,
and unholy women are in a fearful case, especially considering the
means. The Lord will one day present these holy women, Look you
here, here be women, that in the dawning of the day saw Christ, and
you have lived in the Sun shine of the Gospel, and have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>He calls them holy,<note place="margin">Holiness may be where there are weaknesses.</note> though they had their weaknesses, as <hi>Sarah</hi>
had; so that we are not to account those as not holy that have imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
for God accepteth of Believers in Christ, and pardoneth
their imperfections.</p>
                  <p>This therefore correcteth the over harsh spirit of those,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which cry
down our Church as unholy, and a Synagogue of Satan, and no
Church, because of some blemishes: Our Savior did not so, but
more charitably calleth <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>

                     <hi>The holy City,</hi> which indeed was
the Church, though stained with many blots of error and bad life.</p>
                  <p>It comforteth also those that be truly sanctified,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and upright in
heart, notwithstanding their imperfections and failings, God accounts

                  <p>
                     <hi>Adorned themselves, &amp;c.]</hi> Of those duties which they did perform,
I have already spoken; observe we onely this, how they came to do
their duties thus; he sheweth they were holy and godly women, and
so performed the same. Note then, that</p>
                  <p>Wives cannot perform their duties aright,<note place="margin">Wives cannot perform their duties aright, unless they be holy.</note> unless they be holy; no
being a good wife, till a good Christian; no building of a godly
life on any foundation, but upon Faith in Christ: Whoso would do
their duties aright, to Gods glory, their own comfort, and anothers
good, they must fetch and draw grace from Christ by Faith; they that
think to do otherwise, build in the Ayr, build that which will fall on
their heads, and which will never hold or continue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even as Sarah]</hi> He speaks of many,<note place="margin">Why more good men be mentioned in Scripture, then good women.</note> and yet names but one, yet
such a one as they could not but acknowledge worthy of imitation:
Though more good men be mentioned in Scripture then women, that
was, because of Genealogies, and their publike places, not that their
number was greater then the others; yet of neither of both are so
many named by multitudes, as were in all those ages: God said, he had
<hi>Seven thousand which had not bowed their knee to Baal;</hi> and its said, That
at our Apostles Sermon Three thousand were converted, yet none are
particularly named.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 32.</note> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. some are named, with their actions
and commendations, but that there were multitudes of others, is there
also implyed.</p>
                  <p>When therefore we read the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Use.</note> we must not think that
there were no more good people then we finde there named: Oh!
there were many thousands more; onely so many are Registred as
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65522:225"/>
might be for our good,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> all could not: As when we come out of a
City or great Town, looking back, we see the tops of a few Steeples
and great houses, but when we were near we saw a great many more;
so when our backs are turned upon an Age, alas, its but a few we can
see then, in comparison of them that lived in that age: Howsoever,
be we of men remembred or not, if we be holy men and women, we
shall not be forgotten of God; our Names are Registred in Heaven,
whether one day our bodies shall come, as well as our souls.</p>

shews; for whithersoever he went and flitted, she went with him; and
when she was bid make ready for the strangers, it was done, and that
speedily, not a word against it; and her calling of him Lord, is here
mentioned as an usual thing done by her, proceeding from a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

                  <p>In all things lawful,<note place="margin">Wives must imitate <hi>Sarahs</hi> obedience and reverence.</note> wives must be like <hi>Sarah,</hi> therein (though haply

but what <hi>Sarah</hi> did, and to do what may make you like her here and

                     <hi>And are not afraid with any amazement.]</hi> It may be Christian wives
were afraid, that if they did not set out themselves in bravery of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
their unbelieving husbands would not care for them, but seek
after others: For this the Apostle prescribes a remedy; let them not

                  <p>Its not enough to do duties, but we must do them in a right maner;

Wives must not be dutiful, because else they should lead a

them,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 8.</note> by giving them a Bill of divorcement; This came of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their hearts, but was not so from the beginning: Of sundry in
our times which live asunder, as have been married yong through
some sinister respects of their Parents, or rashly or inconsiderately,
though come to years of discretion, which afterwards they have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked,
neither party loving the other according to Gods Ordinance;
of those Husbands that idly give themselves after marriage to travel
to see Countreys and Fashions, thus exposing as well themselves
as their Wives to Satans temptations:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 5.</note> Of those that for the most
part haunt Inns, Alehouses, and Taverns, Gusling, Gaming and Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
being but seldom at home; If the Husband is to leave Father
and Mother, much more such places, to cleave to his Wife: Of those
which following their Recreations and Pleasures, put all upon their
Wives, chiding them for whatsoever is done amiss by Servants or
others; those prove cruel taskmasters to their Wives, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s
to the Israelites: were it not better for such (their businesses being over)
to read, confer, and lovingly converse with their Wives? and should
not their company be better to them then all companies in the
world?</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth those that part boards (the Husband being
either so proud,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as he thinks his Wife not good enough to sit with him
at Table, or she so unquiet, that he eats by himself, each Hog in his
own Trough) yea and beds too, and that either continually, or upon
discontent for some time, or upon surliness, and overmuch coyness;
when the Husband will not be troubled with the childes crying, &amp;c.
as if he were not sometimes to bear such marriage troubles, but lay all
upon his Wife.</p>
                  <p>3. This condemeth the marriage of Children,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> who must be kept
asunder many years; This comes from the excessive haste of Parents,
which dare not trust God for a marriage rich enough, till they come
of years, but thus prevent the Lord: Such think they work wisely,
but for the most part, its but foolishly: They think thus to build
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65522:226"/>
their houses, but for the most part it proves their ruine, such seldom
loving one another.<note place="margin">Husbands must be men of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>According to knowledge,]</hi> Husbands must be men of understanding
and knowledge in the Scriptures, and grounds of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that they may do good to their wives and whole family: They
are the head, therefore must be able to guide; the eye, therefore must
see:<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 22.</note> If the eye be dark, all must needs be dark; as the oyntment on
<hi>Aarons</hi> head ran down on his beard,<note place="margin">Psal. 133 2.</note> and thence to the skirt of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 14. 35.</note>
their knowledge must be exercised for the good of their wives,
and the meanest in their family.<note place="margin">In what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars the same will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</note> They must be men of knowledge:
1. To instruct them in the ways of God, to pray with them, and
(especially when through weakness or sickness their wives have
been forced to stay at home) to inform them of such Points as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
were publikely delivered by the Preacher. 2. To comfort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
them in their heaviness of minde, affliction of body, loss of
children, and the like, and that from the Word of God, being
able to asswage the bitterness of their grief. 3. To advise and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
them for the best. 4. How to admonish and reprove them: They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
must not do it without cause, nor when there is cause in an ill maner,
before company, or with carnal bitterness, but rather in the terms of
the Scriptures, and in love. 5. When to yield to their requests or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
perswasions: Herein <hi>Adam, Sampson</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> failed, but <hi>Job</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
his wife, shewed he was a man of knowledge. 6. To bear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
with their weaknesses and infirmities meet to be born with. 7. Not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
prescribing them to do any unlawful or unreasonable thing, whether
on the Lords day, or at other times, as to say, They are not within,
when they are within, &amp;c. 8. Not keeping such a number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
Dogs, as may be both loss and continual vexation to their wives,
or removing up and down till they have wasted all they have: Thus
bad wives may be brought on to goodness, and good wives made
better.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth the common abuse of this Land;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> How few
husbands be men of knowledge, able to instruct, comfort, advise,
govern or admonish their wives? how few able to pray with them,
repeat a sermon to them, or comfort them in any of their heavinesses?
Hence it is, that they burthen their wives with needless things; Hence
many women of some good parts and towardness, matching with
such Worldlings and Ignorants, have been undone; Hence so many
jars and contentions in families: How many wives would perform
their duties, if their husbands would go before them in performing
theirs? O what evils might be avoided if husbands had but discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
but most are void of understanding, cannot give a reason of their
Faith, cannot pray in their families, scarce give thanks for their meat,
check and discourage their wives from goodness, if they have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
thereto: Alas, in these days, if they get a little hair on their
faces, and their portion into their hands, they think themselves fit to
marry, though they have neither wit nor understanding; or if they
stay some years, its to get goods to set up with, not that they may be
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65522:227"/>
furnished with knowledge. Parents enquire after wealth, and how their
daughters shall live, but do not much regard their living with men
of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> which forbid the Layety to read
the Scripture: But where's knowledge to be learned, if not by them?
Its enough with them that their Priests have knowledge, yet must not
they marry.</p>
                  <p>3. For those that are married,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and have failed herein, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem

                  <p>For those that are to marry, let them beg for wisdom, and labor
for knowledge, that being married, they may live Christianly, and
according to knowledge.</p>
                  <p>For parents, let them instruct their sons in knowledge, and before
they provide them wives, let them know indeed that they are men of
knowledge; and for those that have daughters to marry, let them
not so much aym at wealthy husbands, as with those which may live
with their daughters according to knowledge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giving honor unto the wife,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What honor the husband is to give to his wife.</note> The honor which is here prescribed, is
not Divine honor (<hi>Peter</hi> would none of it at <hi>Cornelius</hi> his hand, nor
the Angel at <hi>Johns</hi>) nor that honor which an Inferior is to give to his
Superior (whereof we may read in the fifth Commandment)
but such as a Superior may give to an Inferior (so is the wife in some
things) but as anunequal to his equals,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 26.</note> so is the wife in many things.<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 9.</note>
This comprehends diverse things:</p>
                  <p>1. That the husband is to respect and esteem his wife,<note place="margin">Sundry parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed herein.</note> as of a most
comely, necessary and profitable instrument, appointed of God as a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> meet help for him for the comfortable passing of his life, and such a
one as he could not be without; profitable to the encrease of posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the building up of his house, for the bringing up of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for the ordering of his family, and disposing of things within
doors (wherein he himself hath no skill, and which being left to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
are but sorrily done) profitable also to converse with in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to take comfort from in adversity; yea, by joyning with him in
every good duty to further his souls salvation: She is every way a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
(not evil, as the world faith, but) good, an help meet for man,
both in respect of body and soul; who more careful, painful, faithful,
comfortable to her husband, then she? If God take away the wife,
alas, how lame and maimed is the husband, his one hand is gone:
When husbands do not thus esteem of their wives, they discourage
them, occasion unquietness in them, if they be women of Spirit, or
otherwise make them foolish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. That the husband is to ask his wives counsel and advice in busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:
God hath made her of his privy councel, and two eyes see
more then one,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 4.</note> yea oftentimes (that he may not despise her) she more
then he: <hi>Jacob</hi> sent for his wives into the field, and conferred with
them about his journey: Many husbands have confessed, that if they
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65522:227"/>
had taken their wives counsel, it had gone better with them. <hi>Naaman</hi>
heard his servants advise,<note place="margin">1 King. 5. 14.</note> and followed it, much more should the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
the wives:<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> heard, and yielded to <hi>Sarah</hi> about <hi>Hagar</hi>
and <hi>Ishmael;</hi> such are indeed injurious to their wives, that will never
make them of their counsel.</p>
                  <p>3. That according to his ability he is to allow her competent main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
for her self, children and family, not spending all abroad, as
too many do.</p>
                  <p>4. That he is to give her a fit employment for her place: It were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
a foul wrong for her to sit in a chimney-corner, or set about some
base employment, a servant in the mean time carrying the keys, and
having the whole disposal of the house: And as he is thus to give her
a fit employment, so therein to let her alone, not prying narrowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every thing, and following her from room to room, and taking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of every thing, and every peny made of it, as distrusting his
wives thrift, wisdom or faithfulness.</p>
                  <p>5. That he do not over burthen his wife, or require more of her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
then she is well able to go through: He must not be a task-master to
her, lest she cry unto God, and he hear in his anger, especially not
when she is sickly or childe-bearing, when she is big, or after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery,
for then he is to bear much with her: Such as fail herein,
whereby either their wives or children are cast away, have they not a
guilty conscience, and an hard answer to make?</p>
                  <p>6. That he must not reprove her before company, no not before her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
Children or Servants; for as this provokes her, so it weakens her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that she shall prevail the less with her Family in her husbands
absence.</p>
                  <p>7. That he ought not to take part with Childe or Servant when she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
rebukes or corrects them, though haply she be in a fault; he must tell
her thereof in private.</p>
                  <p>8. That he is to use her lovingly and kindely,<note place="margin">Reasons hereof</note> not proudly, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
or cruelly, abusing his authority; for though God hath given
him preeminence,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25.</note> yet is he not to use it as he list, but as God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes.</p>
                  <p>What may not incite husbands hereunto? God requires it, they are
their own flesh;<note place="margin">Col. 3. 19.</note> Christ loved his Church dearly, as accordingly they
are to love their wives; She hath forsaken all for him, and he hath
chosen her from all others; Her Friends entrust her with him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
kindeness at his hands; He promised the same at the time of his
Marriage, before God and the Congregation: This also will provoke
her to her duty, and so further a comfortable living together. Whoso
then regards the Commandment of God, and will suffer it to bear

their wives.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth 1. Those Monsters which not onely lade their
wives with Curses and Railings,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but abuse them also with blows and
heavy strokes,<note place="margin">Sundry sorts of husbands reproved.</note> oftentimes in their drunken fits shurting them out of

and their own flesh, whom Bedlam or Bridewel would fit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then to be at liberty, unless they could use it better. 2. Those
(though not altogether so bad as the former, yet) can lend their wives
a box on the Ear, or a dowse on the Neck, or a spurn with their foot.
3. Those which though they can rule their hands, yet are so hoggish
and churlish to their wives, as they know not how to please them, ever
unquiet,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 17.</note> and like <hi>Nabal,</hi> so wicked, that one cannot speak to them,
yea, will both rail on them, and revile them. 4. Those that sometimes
be pleasant, and use their wives well, who yet at small things will be
so hot and angry, as they break out into unseemly, harsh and bitter
words, that vex and grieve the spirit of their wives: This argueth
much weakness in the heart;<note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 9.</note>

and matter of humiliation. Neither let any please themselves with

shall we take hold of every little frailty? Its presupposed
that husbands should be stronger then so; and doth not Christ bear
with the infirmities of his Church? Beside, wives have many times
occasions to distemper them, as frowardness of children, untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of servants, sickliness, &amp;c. and they are otherwise good wives,
love us well, be careful for our state, bring up our children well, and
so should be born with; nay, have not we our selves some one or

                     <hi>A.</hi> This lesson was not learned in Christs,<note place="margin">The 2.</note> but in the Devils school;

                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:65522:228"/>

buy peace on such hard conditions, yet in such cases we must rather
perswade then enforce, shew what the Word of God saith, use Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Arguments to this purpose; yea, if need be, denounce Gods
wrath and judgements, which notwithstanding ought to be done in
private and love, without carnal bitterness: We may be earnest, yet
not impatient; and if we perceive any little amendment, take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, and thereupon encourage them, pray for them, instruct
them with meekness, waiting while God give them an heart to repent,
and in good sort to comply with their husbands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As unto the weaker vessel,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wives are the weaker vessels.</note> Here's the first Reason to enforce the
former duty, Wives are the weaker vessels: They are weaker in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
then men, weaker also in minde, timerous, and fearful, soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
soon provoked, quickly take hurt, and are quickly out of
temper.</p>
                  <p>God hath done this a purpose,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> it was so from the beginning, that
the wife might the more willingly submit, and its necessary for peace
and order, that one rule, and the other submit, which that the Wife
may do, and be glad of an head and guide, she is made the weaker ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel;
yet are not Wives so weak, but God hath given them competent
ability of body, and minde to go through with their duties, and as they
be the weaker, so they have the weaker works (except bearing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which they brought on themselves by sin) then men, theirs being
for the most part within doors.</p>
                  <p>1. Hereupon let Wives submit themselves the more willingly,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and
the weaker they finde themselves, let them trust the more on God, that
they may be strong in him.</p>
                  <p>2. For Husbands,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> let them use their Wives kindely, being weak;
they must not grieve them, nor disquiet them to their undoing; they
be good, costly, and very profitable vessels, for excellent use, but easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crackt, therefore had we more need have the more care of them,
as we have of some choyce glass.<note place="margin">Simil.</note> A Gentleman will not put
his Watch or Clock into the hands of Children or Fools, nay,
he thinks that he is scarce wise enough to handle it himself, What
discretion then and wisdom is needful in Husbands about their
Wives?</p>
                  <p>3. This rebukes those that use their Wives ruggedly,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and curstly,
sometimes railing at them, other times beating them, whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good Wives are spoiled.<note place="margin">Simil.</note> A Venice glass well used and lookt too,
may last long, so may a good Wife, but some use them so hoggishly,
as they are not like to last long; some vex and grieve their Wives,
that they pine away with sorrow, What an account have these to
make? justly may God punish such, by taking away their good
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65522:229"/>
Wives, and sending them such as may be scourges to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as being heirs together of the grace of life.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wives be no less heirs of the grace of life then their Husbands.</note> The second Reason,
from the honor whereunto God hath advanced them; They be Kings
daughters, Heirs of eternal life no less then men; They have the
same right to Heaven that men have, and so to the means, Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Faith, Repentance, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
God hath herein made them equal, so as that there be holy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
as well as men; so all believing women be the daughters of God,
and so his Heirs, Heirs of the grace of life: Among men, sons (not
daughters, if there be any sons) be Heirs, and not all neither, but one;
but God, though he hath many sons, yet doth also make all his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Heirs. But of this on verse 5.</p>
                  <p>1. This should make women content with their state,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and thank
God highly; though they be appointed to be subject to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and be also the weaker, yet seeing God hath made them equal
in the greatest matters, they may rest satisfied, especially seeing even
those things also, wherein they might seem abused, are much for their
good.</p>
                  <p>2. It may provoke them to labor for their part in grace,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and means
of glory, God hath not excluded them, they must not exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
A grievous fault it is in a number of women, that they regard
not goodness, as though being poor women especially, little were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of them; But have they not souls to save as well as others?
must they not come to Heaven the same way as others? and as they
be wives and mothers much is required of them.</p>
                  <p>3. For husbands,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> let them use their wives exceeding respectively,
seeing God hath so honored them: To abuse Gods daughters, his
heirs, is grievous. If a man had an Heathen woman to his wife, he
ought to use her well, much more being a Christian: The more grace
any woman hath, the more kindely must she be used; such are Kings
daughters, heirs of the King of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That your prayers be not hindred.]</hi> The third Reason: Using them
ill will breed Contention, and so make them unable to pray at all, or
pray amiss. Here note,</p>
                  <p>1. That the husband should pray with his wife (God takes it here
for granted) and that also constantly;<note place="margin">Husbands should pray with their wives.</note> the course of their prayers must
by no means be broken off.</p>
                  <p>This is their daily homage to God;<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> they have daily need of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
grace, protection, direction in all their affairs, all which must
be prayed for: This hath promise of blessing, and herein all Religion
is contained.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth most husbands,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that never pray with their wives;
they have no skill nor will hereto,<note place="margin">Psal. 14. 2.</note> an argument of a prophane man,
void of all Religion, dead in sin; for where there is the least spark of
grace, there will be crying to God. How do these live? as much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in their Hogs-coats, as in their houses, they live like Swine;
most Families, in stead of being little Churches, be Heards of Swine,
which live as if there were no God: How do these look for a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing?
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65522:229"/>
God hath promised none but to them that ask it; what common
blessings they enjoy, they enjoy not as fruits of their Prayers; If we
desire to be accounted religious, and would have any blessing of God,
let's learn to pray.</p>
                  <p>2. That whatsoever would interrupt our Prayers,<note place="margin">Whatsoever may interrupt our prayers is to be avoided.</note> is carefully to
be avoided: Thus as we are to avoid worldliness, an ill conscience,
and the like; so also contention and wrangling, both with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
and wives: That party is unfit to Pray, whose heart is poysoned
with wrath and malice; the Prayers of such are loathsom, being
thus, our Sacrifices will not be accepted at Gods altar: O what a
grievous thing is it to lose our prayers? What else have we to help
our selves with? What judgements doth not prayer remove? What
blessing doth it not obtain? greatly doth he lose, that loseth the
benefit of his prayers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us beware of contention and strife,<note place="margin">Use.</note> especially with
our wives: Let us always keep our hearts calm and fit to pray; Who
knows what need he may have of prayer, and that more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
As men keep their Horses for service in plight and breath, so
keep we our prayers in good tune;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> keep we them as a Pinnace ready
to send out speedily, and come home laden, else we may miss many
a good purchase.</p>

all consent and agree together, in the matters of Faith, and Religion
of Christ, that they would all embrace the Lord Jesus, the onely
Foundation; and that some onely should not look for Salvation by
him, some by the Law, and some by both, but that all should seek
unto him alone: And as they were thus to agree in matters of Faith,

                  <p>For Unity in Religion,<note place="margin">There must be between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians unity in Religion.</note> though Errors be many, yet there's but

We were all created in the Truth,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6.</note> but since the fall become prone to
error;<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ is the Truth, the Way and the Life,</hi> and this are we to buy;
this is contained in the Scriptures, for which we are to search: Some
foolishly imagine, that every one shall be saved by his own devotion,
but its life eternal to know God,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3.</note> and Christ Jesus whom he hath sent.</p>
                  <p>To be thus in one judgement in Religion,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> is a great mean of peace,
as the contrary a great cause of dissention; even disagreement in small
matters, makes alienations of affections, much more in Religion. This

Such were the Donatists, Novatians, and such like of old, as in our
times, the Lutherans beyond the Seas, and amongst our selves, the
Separatists; Those are led with a Spirit of pride and preposterous
Zeal; They were bred up in the Church, and as soon as they were
able to shift for themselves, they spit in their Mothers face, and call her
Strumpet; These be ungracious children, they were never thus
taught of Christ or his Apostles: As we are to pity and pray for the
former, and that the Lord would deliver his poor people from the
tyranny of the Turk and Antichrist, giving the Gospel a free passage
among them, that with one minde and mouth they may glorifie God
in Christ Jesus; so for these: Seeing there is little to prevail with them,
as having a proud conceit of themselves and their opinions, lets take
heed we be not led away with them; for herein they hazard their souls
greatly, that they forsake the means, the Ministery of the Word, and
so may revolt, or at least stand at a stay: Whiles they be so quarrelling
about matters of Controversie, they neglect matters of Sanctification
and Government of their lives.</p>
                  <p>Besides, even among our selves that tarry in the Church, there is
odds and difference, and thereby carnal worldlings and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
excuse themselves from embracing Religion, but this shall not
serve their turn:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> There is odds indeed, and no marvel, <hi>For we know in
part, and believe in part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But wherein is the difference, not in the grounds of our Religion,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65522:230"/>
but in matters of Ceremony and Circumstance:<note place="margin">Difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst our selves for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> So far as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> agree, let them embrace, believe and
obey, and it shall be sufficient to bring them to Heaven; as for the things
about which they differ, they little concern them: we are to desire God
that these controversies were at an end, and that we may be all of one
minde about these things; till which time we are to desire, that there
might not be such Separation of affections for these things,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but as both
may be saved and be good Christians that be of either of both mindes,
so there might be a consent and agreement, and not one rent asunder in
affection from another; for as it were extream uncharitableness for any
to judge any for these things, whom they see to live godly, and Preach
diligently, so to censure those over sharply that are not altogether of
the same judgement.<note place="margin">The evils which ensue hereupon.</note> This doth much hurt, for as it was said, The
war of Hereticks, is the peace of the Church; so it is now too true,
That the contention of the Church, is the peace and increase of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
among us: Hereby also many fall to Brownism, and sundry no
doubt hereupon shake off all care of Religion, and are little better then
Atheists.</p>
                  <p>Some there are even also amongst private Christians,<note place="margin">Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians about private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note> that having
somewhat better gifts of wit and memory, and some more knowledge

opinions, as, That they can discern Spirits, and in an hours talk with
a man, know certainly whether he be a childe of God or not, &amp;c.
whereby they draw parties to themselves, fall into wrangling and
strife with such as oppose their fancies, becomes strange unto them,
discharge them behinde their backs; whence the godly are grieved,
and prophane ones take occasion to exclaim against the profession of
Religion, yea, their Ministers become ill thought of as teachers of
such Novelties: Such are of a proud Spirit, as who take up Opinions
not grounded in the Word, and maintain them also to the breach of
unity and love: If any scruple arise in our mindes, we are in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
to resort to those,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> whose lips are appointed to preserve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>For unity in civil affairs,<note place="margin">There must be also unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us in our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or outward conversation: We ought to be
of one minde in every good thing in our families, and places where we

one towards another,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 2.</note> according to Christ Jesus; any other
is a conspiracy,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 5.</note> no true agreement. In Towns men ought to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suppress evil persons and places, and set up goodness so
much as in them lies; where two or three thus consent, there is God
in the midst of them: But in most places, men set themselves to cross

God and goodness;<note place="margin">Simil.</note> as if one Horse were set at the one end of the

so is it in many Towns, where dissention beareth sway, nothing is done
to the glory of God or good thereof.<note place="margin">Acts 4. 32.</note> And for particular persons and
neighbors, they must be of one heart, and live lovingly together, not

forgiving, and passing by injuries, not giving place unto wrath,
nor suffering the Sun to go down thereon. We are brethren, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
also of one body,<note place="margin">Isa. 11. 6.</note> we must live like Lambs one with another:
O how good and comely a thing is it thus to live!<note place="margin">Psal. 133. 1.</note> but alas, how do
men wrangle and contend for every trifle:<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> Welfare <hi>Abraham,</hi> he
would rather yield to <hi>Lot</hi> then contend, we are his children if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

by the same Spirit, should yet be at strife and variance? O fie upon it,
How do these stain their Prayers, hinder themselves from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
How canst thou look God in the face, who thus break his

                     <note place="margin">Christians must be of like affection each to other.</note> Another vertue required, is to
be of like affection each to other, in their prosperity rejoycing with
them, and desiring the continuance thereof, as in their heaviness to
be grieved;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 15.</note> yea, we are to rejoyce in their prosperity, though we our
selves were in affliction,<note place="margin">Psal. 122. 6.</note> to rejoyce, I say whether in respect of the
Church in general, or of the particular Members thereof: Such shal not
prosper that have ill will to <hi>Sion,</hi> that envy the prosperity of the
Church, nor such as are envious at the good estate of particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
or Ministers, their welfare, credit, peace, liberty; nor such as
have an ill eye at their Neighbors thriving in wealth, credit, gifts, or
any other blessing: Through the Devil (justly stiled the envious man,
as being the author of envy, they become thus envious: What, shall
we have an ill eye, because God is good? what is this but to finde
fault with God?<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 21.</note> How was envy punished in <hi>Cain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 37. 1.</note> in <hi>Esau,</hi> in the
<hi>Edomites,</hi> &amp;c. Its a work of the flesh, which God cannot away
withal; nay, we are not to envy at the prosperity of the wicked, for
they shall pay full dearly for it: Naturally we are addicted hereunto,
but we ought to hate it, and strive against it: And for them whom
God blesseth above others, they must walk very warily in all humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and care to do good, and kindely use their Inferiors, else they put
them upon a temptation of envy, whereas on the other part people
will say, His wealth and place is well bestowed on him, he is loving,
affable, doth good, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And as we are to rejoyce with them that do rejoyce,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 2.</note> so must we
mourn with them that mourn, we must help to bear their burthen; we
must pity them in our hearts, pray for them, visit them, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
relieve them if need be; we must not be altogether for our selves,
as those who were not born for our selves alone.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> In the natural body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 26.</note>
if one member suffer, the rest suffer with it, much more should it be
so in the spiritual: If the foot get a thorn in it, the back bows down
to it, the eye looks upon it, the hand searcheth it, the heart grieveth,
the tongue complaineth; should not we be thus affected at the hurt of
our fellow-members?<note place="margin">See Acts 9. 4.</note> Our head is a living feeling head, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:65522:231"/>
we should be feeling members: If we shall do thus for others,
shall not they do the like for us? Herein <hi>Nehemiah</hi> may be our patern,
though he were in great prosperity,<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 4. &amp; 2. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> yet hearing of the miseries of
Gods people, he so mourned, that it was seen in his face; he used his
best credit with the King, and by his permission undertook a painful
journey with much hazard to remedy the same.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those which rejoyce at the destruction of the
Church and members thereof,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as the Papists would have done had
their Powder-treason been effected, and as carnal people do when the

                  <p>2. It condemneth those which instead of grieving at the afflictions

hurt no man, but this will not serve their turn, O what comfort can
such look for either from God or men in their extremity! yea, its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a great fault amongst Christians, that they minde so much their
own matters, that they are little affected this way, seldom pray for
such as are in distress, slowly visit them, and slenderly relieve them:
Who knows what temptations they may meet with? Its no easie thing
to go alone through trouble without help; its an Argument such have
shrewd obstruction by Self-love and Covetousness, wherewith they
are much benumb'd, half dead through want of Spiritual moisture:
We must labor to put away those, to be purged and rid of them, and
labor to finde our souls to be in a good state and plight, by our sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
sympathizing at our brothers miseries: Are we guilty herein?
It concerns us to be much humbled for the same, and to labor for
Reformation; then shall we with comfort look up to God in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and may be assured, that if God shall lay his hand upon us,
not a few will help shore us up, and thats no small comfort in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>

the hand.</p>
                  <p>For our selves,<note place="margin">We must pity our selves.</note> we are by nature in a most woful and fearful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we are sinners, and so under the curse of God, and subject to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65522:232"/>
eternal condemnation hereafter, and therewithal the vassals and slaves
of Sin and the Devil. Now we are bound to love our selves first,
therefore to pity our selves in any misery: If we be in any bodily mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
as pains, poverty, or the like, we moan our selves, complain,
and grieving, seek to relieve our selves, so ought we to take knowledge
of the miseries of our souls, and labor to get our selves out of the
same: We must not be quiet till we have got the assurance of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our sins, and that there is no condemnation unto us; we must
give no sleep to our eyes, nor slumber to our eye-lids, till we finde our
selves thus delivered: And considering that of our selves we have no
strength to any thing that is good, we must endeavor to live under the
Ministery of the Word, where we may know the will of God, and
be thereby directed unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the most unmerciful hard-heartedness of the
world,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that have no pity on themselves for their Spiritual miseries, nay
will not take knowledge of them, but hate those that would help them
out of them, or knowing them, yet are content either to abide in the
same without any regard, or bless themselves in their condition, as if
either it were not so bad as it is, or they might come out of it when
they would: Would we not pity our selves if we were blinde, lame,
naked, diseased in our bodies? Such are we in soul, but where's our
pity? Who would live in a place where there were no bread? or in
a Town besieged by Enemies, wherein there were no Watchmen to
give warning?<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but not a few live where there are neither Preaching
nor Preachers. As <hi>Peter</hi> bade Christ favor himself, so may we bid
these pity themselves. O consider of the worth of your souls, and of the
misery wherein they now are, and (if not now prevented) hereafter shall
be: How do we take on if our finger be but a little burnt with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle?
Should we not therefore stand in fear of the everlasting burning
in Hell? Who will pity you, if you pity not your own souls? or
who will commit unto you their souls to be cared for, that have no
pity of your own? If God cast you into eternal torments without
pity, yet you must needs blame your selves, as those who had no pity
of your selves: O pity your selves, though it be with some pains to
your bodies: If your bodies do your souls a good turn, as by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to the Word, being profited thereby, they will requite them
a thousand fold.</p>
                  <p>Pity towards others,<note place="margin">We must pity the souls of others.</note> is either in respect of their souls or their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>In respect of their souls, It must be our care and labor to help
them out of such miseries and bondage as they lie under:<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 23.</note> Thus must
Princes be careful of their subjects souls,<note place="margin">Psal 78. 72.</note> be unto them as nursing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

in their duties:<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3, 4.</note> Thus must Magistrates of the people among whom
they live, encouraging the good, and punishing the bad: Thus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
as Watchmen, tell people of any danger; as Shepherds, feed
them;<note place="margin">See Eze. 34. 4.</note> and as guides, lead them: They must preach to the capacity

of the meanest,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15. and 4. 2.</note> going in and out before them by an holy example:
Thus Patrons must have a care in bestowing their livings in pity of

in the narture and fear of the Lord; Thus Husbands of their wives
souls,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 4.</note> Masters of their Servants, all of us each of others: Help
them that live in ignorance out of it in what you can, bring home the
impenitent, comfort them that are afflicted; yea, we are even to pity
those that are further off, or dwell in other Countries, who are yet
without the knowledge of God and Christ, as also to pity their souls,
who do not yet pity themselves.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> What may not enduce us hereunto?
God is full of compassion and mercy:<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 13.</note> Such an account made he of
our souls,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> as to save them, he gave the blood of his own Son: Christ
Jesus so pitied us, as he was content to abase himself to the state
of man,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> taking upon him the form of a Servant, yea, to undergo the
ignominous death of the Cross: O how he wept over <hi>Jerusalem!</hi>
How moved he was with pity,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 41.</note> when he saw the people scattered as
Sheep wanting a shepherd?<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 36.</note> and as he himself Preached most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
so as the Doctor and Prophet of his Church, he furnisht the
same with able men, as the twelve Apostles, and seventy Disciples.
Adde hereunto,<note place="margin">See Mat. 16. 26.</note> that the soul is of more worth then the whole world,
and that if the soul be lost, it must lie in unspeakable and endless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and thither also will it draw the body.</p>
                  <p>This condemneth the unmercifulness of the world towards souls,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
as of those which establish false Religion, and binde their people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,<note place="margin">1 King. 16. 26.</note>
as <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made the people sin; such poyson and murther
the soul: So of ungodly Magistrates, who hinder the preaching of the
Word in what they can; So of ignorant, Heretical, corrupt Teachers,
ravening Wolves, such starve or poyson souls, They cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the fleece, but care not for the flock; So of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable
Patrons, that for kindred, favor, or money, put in such
as God never called, being no way fit for that weighty calling, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unapt to teach, having neither ability nor willingness thereto, being
such as seek their ease and pleasures; So of wicked Fathers, that buy
livings for their Sons, though never so unsufficient; So of careless
and ungodly Parents, that have no care of the education of their
Children, providing for them food, gay cloaths, and great Portions,
but no good instruction.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If they were taken Captives of the Turk,
they will mourn, but are no whit moved with pity, though they be
indeed Slaves unto Satan; If but their finger ake, they are grieved,
what should they then be, seeing so many ugly sores of deadly sins
running upon them? So of Neighbors that little regard those they
live by, though ignorant, impenitent, &amp;c. they are not troubled at it,
shew little mercy this way; So if any be afflicted in conscience, few
take the same to heart, few do either regard or pity them. Assuredly
such as shew no mercy to the souls of others, especially them that be
under their charge, shall have of God no mercy shewed on their souls,
but as it was said,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth;</hi> so will he make them pay
soul for soul; their blood shall be required of them: <hi>There shall be

                     <hi>to them that shew no mercy,</hi> yea, God will
especially unconscionable and unmerciful Ministers,<note place="margin">See Ier. 20. 6.</note> not only in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their goods so gotten,<note place="margin">Hos. 4. 6.</note> but also in their children. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to those that have pitied souls,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 7.</note> God will shew mercy: Godly
Kings and Magistrates,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> with <hi>Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> God
will bless and remember them in goodness:<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 8.</note> Also godly, painful and
merciful Ministers, shall both save themselves, and them that hear
them; They shall shine as the Stars, and receive an incorruptible
Crown of glory:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8.</note> Being careful in their places, they are (what effect
soever their labors have) a sweet savor to God.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 15.</note> The like may be said
of Parents, who are careful in their childrens education, and of godly
Neighbors, which seek the good of their souls with whom they live,
God will requite it into their bosoms, as having done a great work: O
let us be provoked to have more regard and pity of the miseries of
souls then ever! If we be careful of our own, we will also be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the souls of others; when we have once felt the misery of our
own souls, and found mercy of God to be delivered therefrom, then
will we know the worth of souls, and be pitiful over others. No
marvel though so few be careful of the souls of others, being there
are so few careful of their own; whensoever you see any negligent in
their places, its because the work of grace hath not been as yet wrought
on their souls.</p>
                  <p>In respect of their Bodies;<note place="margin">We must pity the bodies of others.</note> To those that be sick, in pain, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
debt, prison, or any outward distress, we ought to be inwardly
compassionate,<note place="margin">See Isa. 58. 6.</note> and outwardly relieve them as we may; we must have
bowels of mercy,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 13.</note> right bowels towards them; we must have such
tenderness of affection,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 15.</note> as if we were in the same case;<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note> we are not
born onely for our selves, we are but Stewards: God sends poverty
on them, as for the tryal of their faith and patience, so of our love;
we have cause to thank God, who hath thus honored us to be givers,
what have we deserved more then others?<note place="margin">Simil.</note> God as a mighty Prince
and House-keeper, hath called us all to his Table, setting some at the
upper end, others at the middle, as others at the lower end thereof;
It were no maners in them that sit above, to keep all for themselves,
they must distribute to them that sit lowest of that that's set before
them:<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> God is merciful, and so should we be, yea, this is the note of
a good man,<note place="margin">Psal. 112. 9.</note> and such were <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> such <hi>Dorcas;</hi> yea, how
pitiful was our Savior this way, when he fed the hungry, gave sight
to the blinde, healed the lame, &amp;c. God hath also made gracious
promises hereunto, all which may induce us to the performance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.<note place="margin">Signs.</note>
And thus are we affected indeed, when we are ready to hear the
cryes of the poor, and to relieve them chearfully; wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we must not look for too much beholdingness, we must shew
mercy to those that have most need, and of those to the houshold of
Faith; we must give out of goods well gotten, laying aside some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
thereof for such uses; we must abound more and more, being full
of mercy, and not weary of well doing: So when we lend freely,
not looking so much to save our selves, as to pleasure them to whom
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65522:234"/>
we lend, and in buying and selling, do unto others as we would be
dealt withal: Whereunto may be added, our dealing mercifully with
those which fall into our danger, by forfeiting their Bond, not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their Covenants, and the like.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth all unmerciful men,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> whether such as will part
from nothing but even by constraint, hard-hearted, having no bowels,
giving no more then needs must, not lending at all, or for their own
advantage to the undoing of the borrowers; or such as do hurt, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
gripe by Usury, by cruel letting of Leases, selling after unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Rate to the poor, buying of them half for nought, grinding
their faces, and flaying their skins by Forfeitures, &amp;c. so feeding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on them, and working on their necessities; Let all such know,
That they have no grace in them at all,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 17. and 4. 20.</note> no soundness in Religion, no
true love of God,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 27.</note> God also will shut up his mercy from these, neither
shall they partake of blessedness;<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Though they cry unto him, he will not
hear them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth 5. 7.</note> he will be revenged on them in their goods, names, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
souls, here and hereafter: See <hi>Job 20. 10, 15. Prov. 22. 22, 23.
Jer. 17. Mat.</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>2. This may be a comfort to all merciful minded,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and liberal hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men: They are herein like to God, who is merciful, and requires
of us so to be,<note place="margin">Luke 6. 36.</note> because he is so; as good and faithful Stewards, they
shall be made Rulers over much: They shall be blessed every way,
for they cause many thanks to be given to God,<note place="margin">Pro. 11. 24, 25.</note> and they have also
many Prayers;<note place="margin">Eccles. 11. 1.</note> they are blessed in their goods, as which not onely
encrease more and more, but descend from them to their posterity;
they are blessed in their names, they live in credit and reputation, and
being dead,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 2.</note> they are much lamented for; they are blessed in their
children, they are blessed every way, outwardly, inwardly, in body,
in soul,<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 26.</note> here and hereafter:<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 7. and 25. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>The merciful shall obtain mercy, The good and
faithful servant shall enter his Masters joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. For those that be not cruel,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> yet withal not so merciful as they
should be, let them labor for this grace of pity; and to this end both
remove the lets and impediments thereof, namely, Prodigality (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they waste all, become unthrifts, unfit at all to do any good) and
Covetousness (whereby they think all lost that goes besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which is indeed the cut-throat of pity) and use the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
hereunto,<note place="margin">Means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing hereunto.</note> namely, 1. Labor for a feeling of Gods mercy to
themselves. 2. Visit the poors houses, look into their Cup boards,
observe their cold fare, their thin and hard lodging (this cannot but
affect them, as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> upon his view of the man faln among
Thieves,<note place="margin">Luke 10. 33.</note> had compassion on him.) 3. If they themselves cannot see
them, let them take informations thereof from others. 4. When
they are in any affliction, as in pains, or sick, let them consider the
means they have for their recovery, as a warm house, a good bed,
wholesom Dyet, the Physitians advice and direction, &amp;c. all which
the poor want: Whoso doth thankfully acknowledge those, cannot
but be pitiful.<note place="margin">We must be pitiful to our beasts.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There's yet one further branch of pity; We must be pitiful to our
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65522:234"/>
Beasts,<note place="margin">Prov. 12. 10.</note> we must use them mercifully, and keep them sufficiently, yea
be pitiful not onely of our own,<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 4.</note> but our Neighbors, nay our Enemies.
God is pitiful this way,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 21. and 147. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He feeds the yong Ravens that cry unto him;</hi> and,
<hi>The Lyons seek their meat from him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 25. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>He openeth his hand, and filleth all
things living with plenteousness: He will not have the mouth of the Ox to
be musled;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and will have the beasts also rest on the Sabbath day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rebukes those which (though they pamper them not as some
do their Hounds,<note place="margin">Use.</note> giving them that which many of the poor want, and
others their Horses) are cruel persons to their Beasts, as rank Riders,
which are all on the spur (yet in Princes Affairs, or cases of necessity
men may take liberty this way) covetous Misers, that keep their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
bare and poor, Servants that deal unconscionably, through their
idleness and laziness suffering poor dumb creatures to perish; all which
hurry up and down by unnecessary journeys, or by their journeys on
the Lords day, whether for profit or pleasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Be courteous,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What courtesie is, and that Christians are to be courteous</note> Courtesie is an affable, milde, and lowly carriage of
our selves towards our equals and inferiors (for its reverence and duty
we owe and do perform to our superiors and betters) this is in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,<note place="margin">How it shews it self.</note>
gesture, words and deeds; our countenance must be amiable,
not too cloudy and austere; we must kindely and lovingly greet one
another (<hi>Greet one another</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>with an holy kiss;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 16. 16.</note> and in
another place,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>with the kiss of charity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 129. 8.</note> both speeches be to very good
purpose:) This hath been of ancient standing, even to greet one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
at meeting or passing by,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note> and hereof we have examples in the
holy Scriptures:<note place="margin">Luke 14. 8.</note> We must also give the upper hand, and highest seat
in our Meetings, which also our Savior doth require: We must also
be affable in our speeches, whilest we be in company, not too strange
or dark, but free and chearful; this is required in Scripture under the
name of <hi>Meekness</hi> (even the smallest duties that we owe one to another
are here set down) &amp; for this is <hi>Moses</hi> commended;<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 2.</note> so our Savior Christ,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 12.</note>
he was so affable,<note place="margin">Num. 12. 3.</note> as poor ones, yea poor women durst speak to him;
his disciples also asked him questions from time to time, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
not to answer; yea, even unto him that smote him he spake
courteously,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>If I have evil spoken, bear witness of the evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This tends greatly to peace, and to procure love: What force was in
<hi>Absoloms</hi> courteous speeches,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 6.</note> to steal away the hearts of the people?
The contrary breeds heart-burnings, evil surmisings, contentions, what
not? Our Nature can abide nothing worse, then to see our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
or neglected by others; what can we do less, then greet and
use them kindely? If they be our equals, is it not reason we should
use them as courteously as we would be used of them? If our infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
its noble for us to use them kindly, as its a point of a base minde
to insult over, or trample them under. Thus would they murmure
against God, and envy us, whereas our courteous behavior would be
a means to make them contented with their place; yea, though we are
not to be familiar with the wicked, or open our hearts to such, or joyn
our selves in near communion with them, or bear with them in their
evil courses, but speak earnestly against the same; yet are we to carry
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65522:235"/>
our selves courteously towards them, that thereby we may win them
the more.</p>
                  <p>This rebuketh those that fail in either extreme.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the one part, there are some 1. Which are proud, scornful, and
disdainful in their looks and carriage towards others, passing by them
without saluting them, or once speaking to them; such have base
mindes: And what can be more strange, then that any mortal man
which is but a Worm, should thus deal with one that is his own flesh,
the image of God, yea haply one better then himself? 2. Which
strive and justle for the highest rooms, wall, or seats in the Church,
and elswhere, which strive for the way upon the Road, &amp;c. Hereby
they display their pride, and in stead of honor, bring disgrace upon
themselves. 3. Use curst and cruel speaking, like <hi>Nabal,</hi> who was so
wicked, that none could speak to him, or carry themselves so high, as
their inferior cannot speak to them: Hence is the common Proverb,
They had rather speak to the greatest Gentleman or Nobleman in a
Countrey, then to such a mean man, and have a better answer;
<hi>Naaman</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> would hear their Servants speak. 4. Such as for fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
and heart-burning cannot speak when they meet, nor salute
each other, but pass by each other, as if they were dumb and tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed;
a goodly matter, if they could wound and kill one another as
good cheap, would they not do it? and is not this sin before God?
doth not God behold the same?</p>
                  <p>On the other, there is 1. Counterfeit courtesie, in low crouchings
and greetings, &amp;c. wherein (being void of love and kindeness) men
do altogether seek themselves,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 6.</note> as <hi>Absolom</hi> did. 2. Treacherous cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
when men salute kindely, but intend devilishly, under a fair vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
bearing mischief in their hearts; Thus <hi>Joab</hi> in killing <hi>Abner</hi> and
<hi>Amasa,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> in betraying Christ; thus many will speak very
friendly to them against whom behinde their backs they will by and
by rail, and plot mischief. 3. Excessive courtesie, when men be
too full of it: If some in humility and true simplicity, shew a great
deal more courtesie towards their Superiors then they would have, its
not much amiss; but when men exceed in it towards their equals, it
doth often carry much falshood with it, according to the old Proverb,
Much courtesie, much craft; its also seen often, that there are none
more hollow, then they that seem most courteous; God for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
seeth their hypocrisie, and man in time will, and loath both it
and them: Its a fault among Christians, that at their meetings they
stand striving who should take the place, or sit down first, &amp;c. to
the great disturbance of the whole company; modestly to refuse
the place at the first is commendable, as its also in them that offer
it, but for either to stand long complementing about it, ridiculous.</p>

them: They that make a trade hereof, are but carnal, and have naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

hearts: Its also a vile thing, fittter for Turks and Heathens, then
such as know God; as we would be forgiven of God, we must for give
one another. But of this already on <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. of the foregoing Chapter.</p>

Thus we are to revenge our covetousness by more large giving; our
ryot, by more sparing from the body; our earnestness and pains in
evil, by the like or greater in hearing the Word and holy Exercises.
There's also an holy revenge upon others,<note place="margin">On others.</note> which is rather upon sin
then their persons, being zealous against the same in whomsoever we
finde it, whether our children, servants, or others, accordingly aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

should not onely be differing from the world, but in many things they
must be quite contrary, for they are led by contrary principles, the
one by the flesh, the other by the spirit; the one mindes onely earthly
things, the other heavenly: This is a step higher, an harder lesson
then the former, to requite evil with good: The wicked render evil
for evil, so must not we, as light and darkness, Christ and <hi>Belial,</hi> we
must be herein contrary to them: Some weak Christians there are
that come too nigh the fashions, behavior and speech of the wicked;
many too much set upon the world as the wicked are; fie upon it: To
be easily provoked, and hardly entreated to be reconciled, is the
fashion of the world, but such must not ours be.</p>

destruction of bad men delivered in the form of Prayer: But we have
no such warrant, therefore may not we do so; but for private enemies,
or for publike that be curable (as who are not for ought we know?) we
must love their persons, and wish well to them, and do them good,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 5. God every day requites our sins and naughtiness with his loving
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> mercies, as when we sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> he found a way to save us. 6. This
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is the way to stop contentions and strife,<note place="margin">Prov 15. 1.</note> and to melt the heart of our
adversary,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. and 17.</note> if he belong to God, or leave him without excuse; yea,
cause them to speak well of us, as <hi>Saul</hi> did of <hi>David.</hi> 7. This is a good
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> argument of our love to God in truth; for even many other duties
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> which God requires of us, are of men also commanded, but what law
enjoyneth this?<note place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 24.</note> 8. We have for this the examples of <hi>Joseph</hi> toward
his brethren,<note place="margin">See Psal. 35. 13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> praying for the people, <hi>David</hi> mourning

far from it: Most are scarce free from revenge, much less can be
brought to requite good good evil; Oh, its an hard thing! but doth
it not become Christians of such standing as we are to do hard things?
and have we not been told, that the way to Heaven is straight? O but
he hath deserved nothing of me but all ill, will some say: but so have
we of God, who yet doth not thus requite us; and though he have
deserved nothing, yet God hath deserved all love of us, for his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
love to us; Well then, he sets us to pay over some of that love
we owe to him, to our enemies, and is it not reason that we should
pay the same? He may assign over his debt or part of it to whom he
will; If our Creditor bid us pay some part of that we owe him to
another, will we refuse, and say, He is a stranger to me, I owe him
nothing, I'le pay him nothing, &amp;c. much less should we herein; yea,
when we are bid to do good to our enemies, its but as we make our
children do, even to kiss the rod, and this is but to pull down our
stomacks, and we have more blows sometimes with the rod then we
need, would we yield sooner, and kiss the rod: This to a natural man
is impossible, but to him that is truly assured of Gods love, and seeth
his daily goodness, contrary to his ill deserts, and is endued with some
measure of Faith, its easie: And if we are to requite good for evil,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65522:236"/>
how much more ought we to render good to them that do us good?<note place="margin">2 Sam. 9. 7. and 19. 38.</note>
                     <hi>David</hi> was notable in this kinde, he required <hi>Jonathans</hi> kindeness and

for ever.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth those that requite not good to them that have
done them good,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as Children that relieve not their Parents in their
age, much more those that requite evil for good; Thus do many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
Children, Servants, and people, to their Parents, Masters

<hi>Jeremiah,</hi>

days, even of those that have some shew of goodness in them, yet
not a few being faithfully dealt withal by their Ministers, and told of

them.</p>

forementioned duty; Its one thing that God requires of all his, when
he takes them to his favor, even to take up his yoke, whereof this is
one part, then which nothing more yokes our flesh and corrupt nature;
He that will be Christs Disciple must deny himself:<note place="margin">Luke 9. 23.</note> If we perform
this, we have hereby an argument of our effectual calling, and who
would not desire to know indeed that he is in the way to Heaven? An
unregenerate man cannot possibly do this, at least not aright, but he
that hath tasted and felt abundantly of Gods love to him, he will so
love God, that for his sake he will do this, or any thing which he
commands: God chooseth whom he pleaseth, and refuseth others; He
calleth by the voyce of Christ in the Gospel, He calleth from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
sin, this evil world, He calleth to the state of grace, and all the

hold of election before the world, and of glorification after: we
are called to live holily as well as to be saved, never happy hereafter,
except we be holy here: This a Christian may know, and is bound to
labor to make it sure; Its our best riches, it gives us a right unto all
Gods promises, it furthers our Sanctification, it stays our heart in
the evil day, it enables us to suffer persecution, to set light by the
world, and chearfully to do such duties as God requires of us; but
this is no idle thing,<note place="margin">How to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern hereof.</note> it hath hard work belonging thereto. He that is
called, must requite good for evil, being cursed of others, bless; He that
doth not thus is not called: Thou art effectually called, if thou groanest

affliction; If thou receivest the Gospel in the power of it, if thou
art inwardly quickned in thy spiritual senses, if thou forsakest the

weak, or careless and lazy, or for that they are doubtful and full of

                  <p>Christians are a blessed people,<note place="margin">Christians are a blessed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> none like them; Therefore should

because of trouble, but they are of all others blessed. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they are called, being by nature children of wrath; neither
shall any partake of this blessedness, but they that are called, and such
are heirs of blessing: The godly bless them for their graces, pray for
them, and praise them; The loyns of the poor bless them for their
liberality: Their own consciences also comfort them; They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

So we have 1. A Proposition,<note place="margin">The parts herein consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</note> That the patient and loving man shall

                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> Though it be in it self a blessing, as whereby they enjoy many
good comforts in this life,<note place="margin">Long life unto the wicked might prove a blessing, but doth not.</note> and are not so soon in Hell as they deserve,
and besides, have space and time to repent, yet as they handle the
matter, its no blessing, but contrarily proves a means of the encrease
of their sin, and so of their condemnation.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How is life and the continuance thereof to be desired as a blessing,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note>
seeing it hath been the desire of Gods people to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> We must not desire to live,<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it may be lawful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to live.</note> because we would live, but because
we would live to Gods glory, our own and the good of others; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must we desire to dye for it self, for that is against nature, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our crosses and troubles, but that we may cease to sin, and
be with God in his heavenly Kingdom, perfectly both holy and
happy: We must desire to be with God, but yet we must not be so
importunate, as though we would prevent the Lord, and make away
our selves wittingly, or negligently shorten our lives. Again, we
must not so love our life, as that we should be unwilling to yield it up
if God will, or to redeem the continuance thereof with an ill Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and denying God, for he that so loves his life, shall lose it, and
his soul too: Both then may be desired, but because we know not
what is best, we must not be our own carvers, but commend our
selves to God to be disposed of: Its a base thing to desire life, to be
great, enjoy pleasures, be revenged of our enemies, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Whence is it that most men are strongly carried after long life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> 1. Through the corruption of nature:<note place="margin">Whence it is that most men are desirous to live long.</note> To love life is natural,
but to love it so exceedingly, is of corruption. 2. Through ignorance
and unbelief of the things of a better life. 3. Through the love of
worldly profits,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 15.</note> pleasures and prefermentss: That such fail herein,
may thus appear we should not love the world, nor the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:<note place="margin">Iob 14. 5.</note>
The whole world cannot satisfie the soul; our life is but a breath,
a blast, our days are determined, beyond which we cannot pass;
we are here but strangers and pilgrims: So long as we live we are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as well to sin, as crosses by reason thereof: Of the things here
wherein we place happiness, what certainty is there? friends may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
us, fail us, remove from us, dye, wealth also and honor are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:
There's no small labor both in getting and keeping them, as
there cannot but be grief in parting with them; yea, for the most part
they prove hurtful, and drown men in perdition: In a word, the
commodities of a better life are infinitely beyond all those in this
life.</p>
                  <p>1. Seeing long life is a blessing,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> we ought to be heartily thankful
to God, that we have lived thus long, and do yet live.</p>
                  <p>2. When we crave of God the continuance thereof,<note place="margin">2.</note> we must so
use it, as that it may be a blessing to us, wherein we may get the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of our Salvation, grow in grace, and do good: They that do
thus, may account their life a blessing, for those that do otherwise, it
had been good they had dyed long ago.</p>
                  <p>3. We must take heed that we do not shorten our lives,<note place="margin">3.</note> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
out selves of this blessing, through Whoring, Drinking,
Gaming; too too many thus do, as if they should not be ni Hell time
enough.</p>
                  <p>4. We ought to use all good means for the continuance of their
lives that be dear to us,<note place="margin">4.</note> be careful especially not to provoke God to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:65522:239"/>
deprive us of them; so should Subjects of their Prince and godly
Magistrates, People of their faithful Pastors, Husbands and Wives
each of other, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And see good days,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What we are to understand by good days.</note> That is, enjoy here in this world prosperity and
welfare, inward and outward, in body and soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> In Heaven indeed there shall be days, without night, good
without the least mixture of evil, but can good days be enjoyed in this
world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> In comparison we may, but not absolutely good without evil;
for as the best man is not without sin,<note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects days may be said to be good here.</note> so he cannot but have inward
sorrow of heart, and likewise be subject to afflictions, every day bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grief enough with it; yet in comparison of worse days of horror
of conscience, of troubles outward in the Land, of miseries and
vexations that may befal us, we may see good days, that is to say,
Inward peace of Conscience in the assurance of Gods love, and our
care to walk faithfully before God; also we may enjoy Peace in the
Land, Plenty, the Gospel, Health, Wealth, Friends, Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
&amp;c. and when these are, there are good days, days freed from
calamities and sorrows, and wherein we may plentifully enjoy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and blessings. The day also of a Christians conversion is a special
good day, so the days wherein we do enjoy the purity of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the Word and Sacraments, so the days wherein we see Gods
Church flourish, so when the Sabbath is duly sanctified, its a good
day, so when a Christian after sin comes to repentance, so the
days wherein a Christian walks with God, and hath recourse unto
him.</p>
                  <p>And as thus days may be termed good,<note place="margin">In what and to whom evil.</note> so may they in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
evil; evil to the ungodly without exception, to whom even in
their greatest prosperity their days be evil; evil also to the godly, when
they cannot enjoy the means of salvation in the life and power of it,
when God seems to hide his face from them, when they have conflicts
with spiritual wickednesses, when the wicked prevail over them; such,
I say, (and are there not such now?) are evil days: yet withal, there's
great difference between the ill days of the wicked and the godly, for
the godly are even in the worst times blessed, even then blessed when
they are chastened;<note place="margin">Psal 94. 12.</note> God also will deliver them in due time,<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 3.</note> yea, will
make them glad according to the days they have been afflicted. Here
note,</p>
                  <p>1. That mens days be usually evil,<note place="margin">Mens days be usually evil.</note> and that both in regard of sin,
and the effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. That our life is short,<note place="margin">Mans life short</note> set out here, not by years, but by days, which
is elswhere compared to a post, grass, a vapor, a Weavers shuttle,
&amp;c. Thus is it to the godly in mercy, God will not have them to be
long here in this wicked world; Thus is it to the wicked in justice, as
spending the time here allotted them to Gods dishonor.<note place="margin">Good days are a blessing of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That good days are a blessing of God to be delighted in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
of Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Deut 29. 9.</note> God hath promised it, as an encouragement
to obedience,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 165.</note> they have also prayed for it, <hi>Psalm</hi> 118. 25. and 122. 7.
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65522:239"/>

the right hold, and the right use of it, nay, abusing it to contrary

Their table will be a snare to them, and their prosperity their ruine;

                     <note place="margin">Prosperity why denyed for the most part to Gods Children.</note> Though prosperity be in it self a blessing, yet through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of our nature, it often turns to our hurt; for whereas hereby
we should be made more mindeful of God, to love, praise, and serve
him,<note place="margin">See Deut. 32. 15.</note> and walk more obediently and carefully, through our poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
nature we are usually made forgetful of God, proud, secure, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 12. 1. and 26. 16.</note>
contentious, and not onely untoward to goodness, but apt to any
ill:<note place="margin">Isa. 1. and 5.</note> The fattest ground is most slippery, fed Horses fling their riders,
full bodies are subject to the Plurifie:<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 32.</note> Adversity hath slain some, but
prosperity many thousands more: In great Houses, there's swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering,
swearing, drinking, gaming, &amp;c. whereas in mean places, there's
Reading, Praying, &amp;c. nay, in adversity you shal have the same persons
humble, which in prosperity forgot themselves, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah:</hi>
So that adversity is of singular profit, to drive us to a sight of
our sins with <hi>Josephs</hi> Brethren, to keep us from sin, as an hedge of
thorns keeps Cattel out from spoiling the Garden, to abate our pride,
and mortifie our corruptions, to wean us from the world, to shew us
that we are not to look for our portion here, but set our affections on
Heaven,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 17.</note> where our inheritance is indeed reserved for us. Hereupon
the Scripture pronounceth them happy that be afflicted; yet doth not
this prove, that adversity in it self is better then prosperity: To us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it may be better through occasion of our corruption, as
blood-letting, or the taking of loathsom Physick may be to diseased
bodies.</p>
                  <p>1. Be we greatly thankful to God that hath given us to see so many
good days in the enjoyment of peace,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> plenty,<note place="margin">See Deut. 8. 10.</note> the Gospel,<note place="margin">Iob 62. 9.</note> particular
favors, &amp;c. Our sins have deserved all ill days, and assuredly such we
shall see, if we be not thankful for good days.</p>
                  <p>2. Crave we of God to continue his goodness towards us,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as also
grace to use it well, else it will be no blessing, will not abide with us;
we are at all times to walk warily, but more heed is to be taken in time
of prosperity, then adversity, then are we to suspect our selves, lest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
the same, we prove unthankful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q</hi> Whether may we pray for riches,<note place="margin">Whether we may pray for prosperity.</note> and great prosperity, or not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> We have no such Warrant in Gods Word, neither command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
promise,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note> nor example; of moderation we have, as in <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Agur:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 8.</note> And for great wealth without admirable grace, its exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65522:240"/>
dangerous:<note place="margin">Mark 10. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Its hard for a rich man to enter into Heaven,</hi> not many
such are called; to be thus is no mark of a childe of God: If God
send it, we are not to refuse it, but to be thankful, and crave great
grace to govern it, and our hearts therewithal, but we have more
cause to fear it, then desire it; but for competent prosperity we may
pray, yet conditionally, because being an outward thing, we know
not but it may prove hurtful, we are to leave it to God that knoweth
whats best for us; therewith we must also crave the right use thereof,
and to be bettered thereby.</p>
                  <p>3. When God shall be pleased to lay his hand upon us any maner
of way,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> let us bear the same with patience, God sees the same to be
needful for us, as lanching for a sore, blood-letting or purging to a
full body; If God take away our prosperity, be content, its but one
of Gods common blessings, and that which the wicked have as well
as the good, yea, rarely doth any man enjoy very great prosperity in
this world, and happiness in the world to come; yea, be we thankful
to God, that (seeing need doth so require) he will rather chasten us, then
suffer us to perish in our sins; we are thankful to our bodily Physitian,
how much more should we express our thankfulness unto the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
of our souls? Neither must we grudge at the prosperity of the
wicked, though we be in trouble; for its better to be here held in
awe, thereby that we may rest with God for ever, then prosper a
while here to our mindes, and perish hereafter. A thief on the ladder
with the halter about his neck hath elbow room, and sits aloft at his
ease, whereas the people below stand crowded and sweating, but
which of the two is in the best condition, who knoweth not? Thus
is it in this particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> May we then pray for afflictions?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> No:<note place="margin">Whether we may pray for afflictions.</note> we have no commandment nor example for it; we may
and ought to pray when a cross is on us that it may be sanctified, but
to desire that a cross may befal us, we must not, as being in it self evil:
God turns our sins to our good oftentimes, yet may not we pray to sin;
If God send adversity, we may know that its needful, which yet
through care we might have prevented, as through profiting by one,
we may prevent another trouble. Besides, adversity hath no power
in it self to do us good, neither are we very fit to bear the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let him refrain his tongue from evil,</hi> &amp;c.] Now of the duties to be
performed, for the compassing of the forementioned blessings, they
are eschewing evil, and doing the contrary good, both in tongue and
hand: By evil we may understand, blasphemy, mocking, lying, cursing,
swearing, &amp;c. and thus even Gods children out of humane frailty,
and through the remainder of sin in them, are subject at some times to
sin: <hi>Moses</hi> spake unadvisedly, <hi>Job</hi> cursed the day of his birth, <hi>Peter</hi>
swore and cursed, &amp;c. but its not their practice, its not their minde so
to do, they are heartily ashamed thereof; Therefore must not their
example be urged for the justification of the wicked, whose continual
practice is to use their tongue to evil. The point from hence observable
is this, That</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:65522:240"/>
Whosoever would have a good conscience,<note place="margin">Whosoever would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py here and hereafter, must refrain from evil speaking.</note> enjoy Gods blessing,
and partake of good days here, and eternal life hereafter, <hi>he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
his tongue from evil,</hi> we must labor to have a good tongue; The
Law of God bindes the tongue, as well as the hands, neither can a bad
man or ungovern'd tongue enter into Heaven; <hi>If any man seem Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iames 1. 26.</note>
                     <hi>and bridleth not his tongue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>his Religion is vain.</hi> Again, no unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
person can enter into Heaven (the inheritance there is for the
sanctified ones) but whoso is not sanctified in tongue, is not sanctified
in heart.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth the most horrible abuse of the tongue,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> by the
most of the world that make no conscience what they say:<note place="margin">Psal. 12. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Their
tongues are their own, who should control them?</hi> Multitudes abuse their
tongues to Blasphemy, quarrelling with Scripture, jesting out of the
Scriptures, Swearing, Forswearing, Cursing and Banning, idle, vain
and wicked talking on the Lords day; so in railing, reviling, brawling,
miscalling, in ribaldry, filthy talk, singing bawdy songs; so in back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 34.</note>
slandering,<note place="margin">See Prov. 10. 20. and 23. 33.</note> talebearing, guibing, mocking, &amp;c. Such declare
unto all, that they have rotten and unsavory hearts (<hi>for out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart, the mouth speaketh</hi>) their Religion also is vain, they
want a good conscience;<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Their tongue is set on fire of hell:</hi> By their
words they shall be condemned,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 36, 37</note> for even of every idle word that they
speak they must give an account,<note place="margin">See Iude 14, 15</note> and therefore much more of their
blasphemous oathes, &amp;c. yea, even in this world they may look for
some fearful judgement,<note place="margin">See of these examples in the Book of Martyrs.</note> as befel <hi>Denis Benefield</hi> for blaspheming, the
Gentleman of <hi>Cornwal</hi> for swearing, the Sheriffs man for slandering
<hi>James Abbs,</hi> one <hi>Leaver</hi> for railing on Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> &amp;c. They that
have any spark of grace, let them lay to heart all their rotten vile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
which God hath registred, say not, Words are but wind;
true, in some sence they are wind to blow up the fire of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against us; otherwise, think not they vanish, but know they
are all upon record, and repent, that they be not laid to your charge,
else as the tongue is set on fire of Hell, so will the whole body go
thither, as sure as God is in Heaven. If any have been such evil tongued
persons, as, Swearers, Mockers, Blasphemers, &amp;c. but now from
their hearts truly repent thereof, and do wholly abstain from such
speaking, its a good sign that all that is past is forgiven: O repent
of all thy vile words, and for the time to come, use thy tongue as
a Trumpet to sound out Gods praise.</p>
                  <p>2. As we desire to enjoy Gods blessing and good days,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> with a good
conscience,<note place="margin">Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bridle the tongue.</note> let us have great care of our tongues and words: To this
end 1. We must get a good heart, for what the tongue speaks, the
heart indites.<note place="margin">Psal. 141. 3.</note> 2. We must pray unto God with <hi>David, To set a watch
before our mouthes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal 39. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and to keep the door of our lips.</hi> 3. We must take heed
thereunto,<note place="margin">Reasons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereto</note> and watch over the same, for speech is a goodly blessing:
The want of it in any declares it, no creature hath it but man, therefore
ought it not to be abused, to the dishonor of God, the hurt of our
neighbors, or damning of our selves; God made our tongues good
at first, and fit to praise his name, therefore must we labor that they
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65522:241"/>
may be brought to their first plight: By our words also we shall be
justified or condemned; yea, if we look well to our tongues, its a sign
we have good hearts, and that our Religion is not vain, but powerful.
Again, our tongue, though a little member, yet can do a great deal of
good if well lookt to, as, To praise God, Instruct men, Pray, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
Advise, Admonish, &amp;c. therefore it should be well employed, as
the Rudder for the Ship, and the bit for the Horse; contrarily, if not
well lookt to,<note place="margin">Iames 3. 3, 4.</note> it can do a great deal of hurt, as fire or poyson: Oh,
it can dishonor God, hurt, poyson, vex men, damn our own souls, and
was our speech given us to such ends?</p>
                  <p>O let none make a small matter of words, for God doth not so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them, neither let any say, There's no need of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
to look to the tongue, its but a little member, therefore ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
ruled:<note place="margin">Iames 3. 7.</note> No, its an unruly evil; Lyons and Bears have been tamed,
but never man ruled the tongue, God onely can rule it by his Spirit:
It will do prodigious and monstrous things, bless and curse God and
men; it daily affords such contraries: He is a wise and happy man
that can hold it in any compass, look to it narrowly, carry we a straight
reign over it, as over an unruly Horse: If at any time hasty, vain and
unsavory speeches have passed from us, lets make conscience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
hereof; neither rest we herein to keep our tongues from evil, but
let our tongues be ready instruments to praise God upon all occasions,
as also to instruct our families, to give good counsel, to speak plainly,
lovingly, and faithfully, to utter gracious words, tending to Gods
glory, and the edifying of our selves and others: So shall we make it
appear,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 35.</note> that our hearts are good, <hi>For a good man, out of the good treasure
of his heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Psal. 37. 30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>bringeth forth good things;</hi> So shall we not onely escape ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evils from God and men, that an ill tongue would procure, but
we shall see good days, have peace to our selves, glorifie God here, and
be glorified with him for ever in his heavenly Kingdom: This God
enables us to do, that thus doing we may enjoy the blessing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his lips that they speak no guile,]</hi> Here that evil of the tongue is
prohibited, which is more close and covert, when the words agree
not with the heart nor deeds.</p>
                  <p>Its not enough to keep the tongue from notorious and open evils,<note place="margin">We must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from such evils of the tongue as be close and covert.</note>
but even from guileful, from false deceitful speech: Such as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
hereunto, can have no good conscience, but a guilty heart, and
they cannot prosper, for God setteth himself against such, neither can
such (so continuing) come into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Of this guile there be many kindes, all naught, yet some worse
then others:</p>
                  <p>1. In Religion towards God:<note place="margin">Guile to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion toward God.</note> When men pretend great zeal and
forwardness, talk well in good company, and to be well thought of
speak against ill, professing that its the onely thing to be in the favor
of God, and that we ought in all things to be ruled by Gods Word,
whose hearts notwithstanding are false, and who dare do many things
contrary, when they can carry them away close: This is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a false heart, which God hateth, for he loves a true <hi>Nathanael,</hi>
                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:65522:241"/>
and his eyes are upon the truth,<note place="margin">Psal. 51 6. and 32. 2.</note> and he loveth truth in the inward parts;
a certain argument that their sins are not forgiven them: All their
fair words will not serve their turns, they do meerly blinde their eyes,
their saying <hi>Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord,</hi> will not save them; their fair goodly words
will be but a Rod for themselves:<note place="margin">Deut 5 28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>O evil servant, out of thine own mouth
I will condemn thee:</hi> They say well, but O that there were an heart in
them so to do!<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 36, 37</note> 
                     <hi>They do indeed but flatter with their mouth, and lye with
their tongues, for their heart is not right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In their carriage towards men;<note place="margin">In carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</note> as 1. When through fear, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
or advantage they sooth up and flatter their Neighbors and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
making their faults small or none at all, nay haply terming them
Vertues,<note place="margin">Acts 12. 22.</note> and extolling them beyond measure; thus did the people to
<hi>Herod:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>But he that blesseth his friend with a loud voyce, rising early in the
morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</hi> These speaking against their
knowledge, as they wrong themselves, so do they much hurt to the
parties flattered, keeping them from reproof, and puffing them up, by
shewing them a false glass wherein to view themselves; therefore one
being asked which were the worst Beasts, answered, Of wilde Beasts,
the Tyrant, of tame, the Flatterer; and that such were worse then
Crows (which feed not on the living Beast, but dead Carrion) preying
on them which were alive: If such may be gainers, they will set their
tongues to sale, the Devil may use them to what speech he will. To
speak truly and plainly (men are so proud and impatient) often breeds
hatred;<note place="margin">Veritas odium parit.</note> if we dare not thus speak, yet rather then flatter, lets be silent
and say nothing. 2. When men speak others exceeding fair, and make
great promises of kindeness, but its onely for some advantage, or meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in shew; for being put to it, they forget their fair proffers: thus do
many wicked Usurers smooth men. 3. When men speak very fair,
and courteously salute others, and yet mean not well, nay ill in heart;
salute them kindely, and as soon as their back is turn'd, flout at them,
rail on them, slander them, yea do them any mischief, of which the
Psalmist complains,<note place="margin">Psal. 28. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The poyson of Asps in under their lips.</hi> 4. When
men speak fair, but intend mischief, as the Devil when he spake to

partly because (being tedious, howsoever God turneth it to the good

of his) it seemeth so to us: This we are ready enough to eschew,
without bidding (though we be not wise enough to avoid the cause
thereof) yea eschew it by unlawful means,<note place="margin">What sort of evil is here meant.</note> being rather willing that sin
should rest on us, then a cross: But the former is here meant, whereof
not God,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> but the Devil and Man is the Author; for he is that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from whence cometh all good,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 4.</note> and out of one Fountain cannot

                  <p>What is this evil of sin?<note place="margin">What the evil of sin is, and that we must avoid it.</note> Its the transgression of the Law of God,

wicked and evil; so that whatsoever is contrary to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
either by way of Omission or Commission, is evil and sin:
This we must eschew, as the Bullet shot out of a gun, or to be stricken
with a sharp Sword, we must abhor it, as a Toad or Poyson; we must
hate it as the Devil, and Hell fire, we must hate and abhor it with a
deadly, an utter hatred, and accordingly avoid it most carefully.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the cause of all evils: For this the Angels were cast out of Heaven,
<hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice, the old world drowned, and <hi>Sodom</hi> burnt, &amp;c.
yea, it wounds the Conscience, which God hath set in us as a Monitor,

the same, but sin is the destruction of our souls.</p>
                  <p>That sins is worse then all crosses,<note place="margin">The evil of sin worse then the evil of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> appears by the Devils practice,

as is sin.<note place="margin">Psal. 97. 10.</note> To eschew this, is the note of a man that loves God, of a

(for though it be sweet in the mouth, it will be gall afterward, bite like
a Serpent, and sting like a Cockatrice; for a vain short pleasure to
sell our souls to everlasting pain, were folly indeed:) yea, though
we could bring to pass some good thereby, (we must not do
evil that good may come thereof; better that good be left undone,
then that it should be purchased with Gods dishonor, as to steal, or take
usury, that we may do good to the poor, &amp;c.) nay, we must so hate
and eschew evil,<note place="margin">With the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof, and Occasions leading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> as we may eschew the very appearance thereof (as to
go to a place that is of ill report, though having no ill purpose, &amp;c.)

by the Harlots house, anger, multitude of businesses, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

things good and lawful in themselves be an occasion of evil, and cause
us to offend, we must forbear them (as some in using their recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
break out into impatience, and anger, and others cannot leave
the same in any time, better for such to pluck out this their eye, cut
off this their right hand) and to eschew this, we must eschew the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

(as the company of bad persons, and private familiarity with wicked
doers) and that not for any sinister respect, but because its evil (though

haply we may be hated for our labor) eschewing especially those
sins that be most incident to our nature, complexion, and calling, and
whereunto we have been most accustomed.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns them that be so far from hating and eschewing
evil (though it be as poyson,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as the Plague) that they love it with their
hearts, live in the continual practice thereof, drink it down like water,
running thereunto, as the horse rusheth into the Battel: This is the state
of most, they are workers of iniquity, the whole world lieth in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
they love not the means nor persons whereby they may be

but dishonor him, and so requite all his blessings? will nothing serve
those to play with, but swords, and fire-brands, and mortal things?
nothing please them, but to cross God? and nothing like them but their
own poyson? Have they sped so well formerly that have done thus?
Do they provoke the Lord, and not themselves to the confusion of
their faces? If they have vowed, they will have their pleasures and
lusts, whatsoever comes of it, then it must be so, what remedy? These
have no love of God, neither is there any fear of God in them: They
are prophane and godless persons, which may look for wages answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their work, shame and the wrath of God in this world, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
destruction in the world to come; <hi>For life is in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
but death is in the way of sin, and the paths thereof tend to Hell:</hi> O

                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 27.</note>
even that they would break off their sins by repentance! O turn ye!
why will ye dye? acknowledge I beseech you all your rebellions and
treacheries against God, and that you have deserved hereby to be cut

all evil, little and great, shun it at all times, in all places, how gainful
or pleasing so ever, and whosoever commands it, or whomsoever you
see practice it, together with all the appurtenances and occasions of
the same.</p>
                  <p>Means to evil may be these,<note place="margin">Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eschew evil.</note> 1. Labor to understand the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to us, which may work in us love to his Majesty, and so an hatred of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all evil. 3. A sanctified heart, the inseperable companion of true faith.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Attend on Gods ordinances publikely, the Word and Sacraments,

                     <hi>that we enter not,</hi> neither be led, <hi>into temptation.</hi> 6. Make we a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
against evil,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 1.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> 7. Call to minde the fearful
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> wrath of God, and the wages of sin, and the examples thereof on
many, both in Scripture and our own experience, as also the hour of
death (when it will trouble us and lie heavy on our conscience) and
the day of Judgement, when and where we would be loath to meet
with it.</p>

                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:65522:243"/>
2. This also rebukes them that eschew some evil,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> but not all, nor
at all times, or in all places: Being commanded, what will they not
do? What not, for profit, pleasure, preferment? The sins of their
complexion and trade they will in no wise leave; they run upon things,
because lawful, though they cannot use them lawfully; If they can
sin secretly, they make no conscience thereof.</p>
                  <p>3. This may serve for instruction,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> with rebuke to most Christians,
and to us that be most ancient professors, that though we have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
purpose against evil, yet we neither hate it so deeply, nor shun it
so carefully as we ought, nor are so much humbled when we have been
overtaken, and have fallen thereinto, as we ought; we complain of
our crosses,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> but grieve not so much that we have fallen into sin. If
one should threaten to run at us with a naked sword, or shoot at us,
whensoever he could finde an opportunity, we would be wary and
watchful upon our going abroad, having an eye in every corner, &amp;c.
O do we thus against sin, which watcheth but an opportunity to do us
mischief: If we would thus do, we should not be so often overtaken
as we are, we should see better days, scape numbers of crosses, have
more peace to our consciences, more joy in our death, and a freer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to Heaven. But alas, we judge even that which is a great evil, to be
but a little one; it pleaseth us, if we have any colour for the same, as
that we have but once committed it, that others do so and so, &amp;c. Thus
do we prophane the Lords-day, despise his Ministers, and run upon all
sorts of evils.</p>
                  <p>4. This affords consolation to all such as do indeed eschew evil,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note>
and that out of an unfained hatred thereof, rejoycing in nothing more
then when they prevail against it, grieving at nothing more then when
they are overcome thereby; such do indeed love God, such fear him
in truth, and so are beloved of God, and shall be everlastingly blessed;
these shall live happily here, in joy and bliss hereafter: O go on in this
Christian course, though the world hate you, because ye do not as
they do, though they call you precise fools, because ye dare not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such goblets as they do, yea, though hereupon ye pull danger
upon your selves, yet must ye eschew evil, and so let us; Its no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
though we have the worlds frown, as long as we have Gods favor;
and what if we shall miss many a sweet morsel of profit, pleasure,
and promotion, if we be free from the gripes and vexations of
conscience, and the wrath of Almighty God? they that now
have their sweet meat, would one day vomit up their morsels,
if they could, as <hi>Judas</hi> did; who though he rid himself of the
money, yet could not be rid of his wound of Conscience, nor of
the Judgement of God upon him; were they ever the worse, or had
they any cause to grieve, that they had not a share with him in the
thirty pieces?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And do good,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whoso avoids not evil, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do good.</note> This necessarily followeth on the other: No man
can have his heart truly nor aright set to do good, whose heart is not
first purged of the love of all evil, for they cannot stand in one heart
and at once; and that man that lives and bears himself in the practice
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65522:244"/>
one sin, never did good aright in his life, neither ever pleased he
God; Who can serve God in one thing, that serves the Devil in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
                  <p>This may serve to rouse up some,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that fain would do well, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good things they do, but some one old accustomed sin, which they
know is a sin, they cannot leave: Well, there's no hating sin, it will
not do well; the end will not be good, its but to be almost Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:<note place="margin">Acts 26. 28.</note>
Some will say, Such a Preacher hath prevailed much with me,
and done me much good, but as long as one known sin is lived in, all
is nothing worth to Salvation. Its true, a childe of God through
strong temptations, may be overcome of the same evil which he hates,
but he both covenants against it, is careful that he may not fall into it,
having fallen, he is much grieved: He that is not grieved, but doth
again upon the next occasion fall to it, is indeed in a grievous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus from the order.</p>
                  <p>To do good is sometimes taken in a strict sence, for the performance
of the works of mercy,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 38.</note> whether for body or soul,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 16.</note> or both: Here
more largely for that good we are to do to our neighbor,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 17.</note> enemies
that do us hurt,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 10.</note> or yet more largely, for whatsoever God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in his Word, <hi>Whose will is a perfect rule of Righteousness, and
makes that good which he requireth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whosoever would see good days here and hereafter,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> must set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in body and soul to the obedience of Gods will in doing good:<note place="margin">Christians must be doers of good.</note>
No other shall be saved; good is the way leading to this end: To

                     <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. Its good and amiable of it self, as the Lord is. 2. God

are made to well-doing; as in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. may appear.

                  <p>For the extent of this, we must do all good that we can, and our
places require,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 6.</note> having respect unto all Gods Commandments: Thus

                  <p>We must do good at all times:<note place="margin">At all times.</note> Aguish fits of goodness, as before

We must do good in all places;<note place="margin">In all places.</note> not in the Church onely, but
at home in our Houses and Shops, yea, when we are furthest from

                  <p>So in all companies we must do good,<note place="margin">In all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> or take good; if we cannot do

                  <p>We must do good to all persons,<note place="margin">To all persons</note> all duties towards God, publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

Admonitions, Reproofs, Prayers: We must do good also in
our particular callings, as, Magistrates, Ministers, Husbands, Wives,
Parents, Masters, &amp;c. This is so necessary, as that he which doth not
good in his special calling, is no good man: We must do good also,
though it be hard and difficult so to do; naturally we are prone unto
evil, and it comes off hand easily, but to do good is harsh; Gods
Commandments are as a yoke to the flesh, though easie to the Spirit,
a burthen to the flesh, but light and comfortable to the Spirit: To
pray, read, instruct our families, is painful; so to study, preach,
hunt out disorder, set up goodness, see the poor set on work, and the
like; but as we would partake of the reward, which is indeed great here
and hereafter, we must not shrink at this labor: If one way will not
serve the turn, whereby to bring to pass our Religious purposes, we
must set upon another,<note place="margin">Luke 5. 18.</note> as they that carryed the man of the Palsie, <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able for the preass to enter in at the door, uncovered the roof of the house,

to punish sin shall have of evil doers;<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> nay, though the greatest be
against it, as <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed to God, though the King forbade it, and
danger was to follow upon it: Thus the Prophets spake the truth,
though with danger of their lives, <hi>Elijah, Micaiah, John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>
&amp;c. Thus the Martyrs confessed the faith boldly, though with loss of
their lives:<note place="margin">Iosh. 24. 15.</note> We must do good also, though we have few encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

we be as it were alone, as <hi>Noah</hi> in that generation, <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Elias,

We must do good,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 10.</note> while we may,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> while life and means last, yea, and
constantly;<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 7.</note> and to that end (many take up Prayers in their Family,
but quickly leave them off) neither must we onely do good,<note place="margin">And in a good maner.</note> but we
must do it well (for even the best things in the world may be marred
in the doing,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 11. and 58. 2.</note> as Alms and Prayer by hypocrisie and opinion of merit)
and therefore we must be regenerate persons, and by Faith be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God in Christ: We must also do the same in a particular
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:65522:245"/>
Faith,<note place="margin">Iosh. 24. 14.</note> and in uprightness of heart,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 28. 9</note> declaring the same by the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our lives; and this must be in obedience to God, ayming at
his glory,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> and not seeking our selves,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 12.</note> either in our profit, pleasure or
credit, &amp;c. all which must be done willingly.</p>
                  <p>1. This sheweth the wretchedness of our corrupt nature,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that good
being in it self so lovely, and there being so many great Reasons to
perswade us thereto, yet our nature is most averse therefrom.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth those which are so far from this,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that they be
enemies to goodness: The more Spiritual and holy any duty is, the
less they can away therewith; as Prayer, Meditation, Conference
with the godly, &amp;c. nay, they hate goodness in others, whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
Ministers, or private Christians; yea, are so wholly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to good, as they are wholly given over to evil.</p>
                  <p>3. This condemneth those,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> who though they be restrained, and
break not out into evil, yet have no heart nor love to that which is
good: They be no swearers, nor disordered persons in their Families,
yet they do not pray, instruct, and do good in their Families; they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prophane the Sabbath, nor yet keep it holy; they keep not bad
company, yet love not the company of the Saints; they spend not
on wicked purposes, and yet do no good with that they have; they
be no enemies to Religion, but they be not zealous friends; they be
no maintainers of disorders in Towns, yet do not zealously set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against such.</p>
                  <p>This is not sufficient to make a good man, nor to see good days; for,
<hi>Every tree that bears not good fruit,</hi>

                     <hi>shall be hewn down;</hi> and,<note place="margin">Mark 11. 21.</note> the barren
Figtree was cursed;<note place="margin">Luke 19. 22.</note> and, the Servant that did no good with his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
(in the mean time he had done no hurt therewith) was cast out;
It will not go for payment, nor bear out any, that they have done no
hurt, but what good have they done? even we our selves will scarce
keep a Cat or Dog, meerly for this, that they do no hurt, except they
do some good; neither will we think well of those Servants, who
being negligent in our absence, shall say, We have done you no hurt,
have not robbed you of your goods, railed at you, wronged your
children, &amp;c. for that which they should also have been diligent in
their work; It will be demanded of us, whether Magistrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
Housholders, or others, what good we have done.</p>
                  <p>4. This condemneth all those that fail in the doing of good,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> or in the
maner thereof, and so lose their labor, and have no comfort of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as they that will do some good duties, not others; as Read,
not Pray; come to the Word, not to the Sacraments; come to both,
but omit Family duties: They that do not good duties at all times,
but take liberty to shake them off and banish them (so did not <hi>David</hi>)
nor in any places (haply devout at Church,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 20.</note> careless elswhere) nor in
all companies (doing good onely as <hi>Saul</hi> among the Prophets) nor to
all persons (some will seem to give God his due, in the mean time
dealing unjustly with men, as some (with civil persons) are careful in
this, careless in that: Others also will do well to strangers, but not to
their Families; as others to their friends, but cannot away with their
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:65522:245"/>
enemies; and others though submiss to their Superiors, yet are harsh
to their Inferiors;) so they that will then onely do good, when they
finde it easie to be done, who yet in the mean time take great pains to
do wickedly; so they that will not do any good, except when they
may be commended for it, and have good will for their pains; so
they that still say they will, and they will do good, but defer the same
so long, that death takes hold on them; so they that think to do good
in their end, who should do it in their life, the present time is indeed
the time wherein to do good; so they that do good for a while, but
after break off;<note place="margin">See Isa. 1. 11.</note> so they that do good things, but in a corrupt maner,
without Faith, and seeking themselves therein, or meerly in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:
All these (mark me well) that make their practice of doing good
in this fashion, its as good never awhit, as never the better. I deny
not, but a good man may herein at some times fail through weakness, or
by reason of some temptation; but whosoever usually thus doth, doth
bewray himself to be but an hypocrite, and as he thus worketh, so
accordingly shall he have his reward with hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>5. This serves for consolation to all those whose hearts are unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
affected to good,<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> and which are ready to every good God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them in their general or special callings, at all times, in all
places, towards all, even in things most difficult and dangerous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
unfainedly to do them in a right maner;<note place="margin">3 Iohn. ver. 11.</note> they do whats good in
the sight of the Lord, hereupon they shall have comfort for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and hereafter life everlasting: Such are indeed of God.</p>
                  <p>6. This is also for instruction to us all,<note place="margin">Use 6.</note> that we give our selves with
greater diligence to that that is good, and to do much good in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and special callings, taking pains thus to do both publikely and
privately; such as joyn not with us herein, shall want their part in our
comfort: This shall be our Crown, and will accompany us to life
eternal; the more good we do, the more joy shall we have in our
lives, the more comfort in death, and the greater glory in the world
to come.</p>

                     <hi>Let him seek peace and ensue it.]</hi> Another duty to be done of all
those that would live long, and see good days, They must <hi>seek peace
and ensue it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christians must seek after peace.</note> Men that seek not peace, shall not finde it; and without
peace, what comfort can any have of their life? Neither can any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
eternal life, that seek not after peace; for God is that God of peace,
and all that are his must love peace, and therefore hath God given us
his Gospel of peace, as to reconcile us to himself in Jesus Christ, so
also to teach us to live in peace one with another: We must therefore
not onely keep it when we have it,<note place="margin">See Acts 4. 32.</note> and accept it, being offered, but
wanting it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> seek after the same,<note place="margin">2 Cor 13. 11.</note> seek after it, as covetous men do after
Money,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> the hungry after meat, Hunters after their prey; if it run or
fly from us,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> we must run and fly after it:<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 13.</note> This is again and again both
commanded and commended,<note place="margin">Iames 3. 17.</note> is a fruit of the Spirit, and of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that comes from above.</p>
                  <p>Now we must seek after peace,<note place="margin">How we must seek peace.</note> 1. By living innocently and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
with our Neighbors (such as harm them either in word or deed,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:65522:246"/>
are enemies to peace.) 2. By living helpfully, and doing good in our
places, as Magistrates, Ministers, &amp;c. 3. By passing by such small
wrongs as are done unto us, not so much as taking notice thereof, and
for others of more moment, to compound them of our selves, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to indifferent neighbors, which notwithstanding (if they must
needs be determined by Law) must not break off peace, or occasion the
omission of any neighborly duty. 4. By parting with some of our
right to have peace: Herein we must not stand upon terms, though
haply it were fit our adversary should come to us, as being Yonger,
Inferior in place, or who first gave the cause of offence, yet rather
then contention should continue, we must pass by all those, and go to
him;<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> even <hi>Abraham</hi> yielded to <hi>Lot:</hi> And this we must do, nor with
some persons onely, but even with all; not with the rich onely, but
the poor also, as being our fellow servants, members of Christ, as we
are, and such of whom we may stand in need both in prosperity and
adversity; neither with the meaner sort onely, and not with the rich
and wealthy (as if it were of a brave minde to stand out with them,
and not to regard them) but with the one as well as the other; yea,
nor with the good onely (though with them chiefly) but with the bad
also (even <hi>Abraham</hi> maintained peace with <hi>Abimelech</hi>) yet so,<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 32.</note> as that
we may keep our peace with God, not consenting with them in their
evil, nor doing evil, or neglecting our duty for their good will. A just
War is better then an unjust Peace:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 18. 1. and 19. 1.</note> A Nation may have with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
a League of Peace, though not of Amity; so we must have
peace,<note place="margin">See Rom. 12.</note> but not with ill conditions, to yield to unlawful things: Wo be
to that peace that makes partition with God,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> and breaks the peace of
our own Conscience;<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 34.</note> our Savior Christ came not to bring such peace,
but the Sword. It will be better by being faithful, to have favor with
God, and peace in our selves, though we reap the ill will of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
then that God should curse us for our unfaithfulness, and the
wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also in Hell for following their ways. Thus must Husbands
and Wives, Ministers and People, &amp;c. keep peace one with another,
otherwise we must be contented rather to be counted troublesom,<note place="margin">Ier. 15. 10.</note> and
breakers of peace.</p>
                  <p>This we must seek after,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. Because its so pleasing to God, he is
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the God of Peace, and by the Spirit often so called in the Scriptures;
he gave his Son to make our peace with him, and loves that we should
live in peace one with another, and therefore gives us the Gospel of
peace, and Spirit of peace; yea, he so likes it, that he pronounceth
them blessed that helps it forward:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 9.</note> On the contrary, the Devil delights
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in contentions, and he onely gains thereby. 2. This shall be a sign
that we are taught of God, and whereby our Prayers will become the
more acceptable,<note place="margin">1 Tim 2. 8.</note> Our hands must be lifted up without wrath, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is addicted hereunto, can neither pray aright, nor duly partake
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Sacrament, neither rightly perform any other duty. 3. This
is most comely,<note place="margin">Psal. 133. 3.</note> like the oyntment which was poured on <hi>Aarons</hi> head
(which was made of most fragrant sweet things) and to the dew upon
new mowed grass: O how sweet is it to them that do enjoy it! how
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:65522:246"/>
sweet to the lookers on? what a comely thing is it, to see a Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in it self, so a Town, a Family? Its as an instrument, whereof all
the strings be in tune:<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Better is a dry morsel with this, then an house full
of Sacrifices with strife:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">and 15. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, then
a stalled Ox and hatred therewith:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Better to be in the corner of the house top,
then with a contentious woman in a wide house.</hi> 4. Great is the profit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
as the rain makes the mown grass shoot out and grow,<note place="margin">See Ier. Lam.</note> so is peace
exceeding fruitful: O how doth a Land encrease by peace, and how
do Wars,<note place="margin">Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia magna dilabuntur.</note> whether civil or forraign, waste and consume the same! little
things by concord wax great, great things through discord come to
nothing; when there's peace in a Town between the Pastor and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
what good may be done? what evil avoided? where there is
not, neither can evil be suppressed, nor good established. A Town
knit together in peace, is like a faggot fast bound, that cannot be bent,
but divided, like the several sticks of the faggot, which may easily be
broken; the like may be said of Husbands and Wives, Masters and
Servants,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 25.</note> Parents and Children, <hi>A Kingdom, City, or house divided
against it self cannot stand.</hi> 5. If we live in peace we are fit to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
good one to another, else we can do no good, but all evil.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemns all contentious and quarrellous Spirits,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that regard
not peace, but their own wil, are never wel, but when they are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
are so far from seeking peace, as they cannot keep it when they have
it,<note place="margin">Psal. 120. 7.</note> nor accept it when its offered; and so far from following it, as they
flye from it, as those of whom the Psalmist complained: Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it not as they ought, will fall out and break the peace even for
trifles, offer the occasion of strife, and harm their Neighbors both by
words and deeds, in goods and good name; yea, if the least wrong
be done them, they will hear of no reconciliation, but break off all
love,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> quarrel, go to Law, &amp;c. Every place abounds with such:
These bewray themselves not to be led by Gods Spirit,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 15.</note> nor endued
with the wisdom from above; nay that they are carnal, and filled with
devilish and fleshy wisdom; these either never pray, or lose their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
for as good not pray at all, as pray in wrath: These in stead of
good days here, shall have vexation, neither shall they hereafter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
the Kingdom of Heaven,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 8.</note> but shall meet with indignation and
wrath.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh those that live at peace,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> but its after this maner;
they will have peace with some, but not with others; whereas we
ought to be at peace with all, not with the poor onely, but with the
rich also, nor with the good onely, but with the bad also; some there
are that fail every of those ways, as a number that will be at peace
with the bad,<note place="margin">See Prov. 1. 10, &amp;c.</note> not with the good, and have peace with the wicked in
their wickedness (which is indeed fearful) yea, buy peace with hard and
ill conditions, as consenting to evil, or neglecting good: Some that
they may be counted peaceable men, will not stir against any disorder;
woful peace! let men give of their own right for peace, but not of the
Lords.</p>

all their hearts, and can be content to seek it in any honest and lawful
way, and that for conscience, and that they may serve God the better,
and for that God requires the same, in the mean time being careful to
avoid wrangling, and jarring, &amp;c. assuredly such are at peace with
God, and howsoever the world deals with them, enjoy the peace of
a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>4. Let this encourage us all to set more by peace then pearls,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> to seek
it diligently, and to be content rather to lose any reasonable thing, then
this: This is pleasing to God, is also comely; so shall our Prayers
be accepted, so shall we be strong to all good, and against all evil, so
shall we see good days here, and eternal peace with God hereafter.
To this end we must avoid all the enemies of peace,<note place="margin">The enemies of peace to be avoided.</note> and labor for the
contraries, as, 1. Pride, which breaks peace many ways, as
when men have not more honor then is indeed their due,<note place="margin">Pride.</note> as <hi>Haman,</hi>
or when any is honored besides themselves, as <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>David</hi>
was commended in the dance; Pride also makes men think so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of themselves, and meanly of others, as they will be ready to
offer injury, and yet think it small, and if the least wrong be done
them, think it so heinous, as no recompence can be made for it:
They must forsooth by no means be blamed in any thing, else
they swell, break peace, and part company; this we must avoid, and
labor for humility,<note place="margin">Covetousness.</note> which is contrary hereunto. 2. Covetousness, the
covertous man is angry if he have not every good bargain, or if the
least trespass be done him: If but a Goose of their neighbors grase in
their ground, O its such a loss, such a wrong, that they must not put it
up:<note place="margin">Frowardness.</note> They will part with no piece of right for all peace. 3. Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">Prov 16. 28.</note>
                     <hi>For a froward man soweth strife,</hi> we must labor for a meek and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
spirit.<note place="margin">Talebearers;</note> 4. Talebearers; <hi>A whisperer separateth chief friends:</hi> They
be the Devils Pedlers, let them not open their packs, nor unlade their
wares in our ears, thereby to infect our mindes; He that listens to them,
shall never have peace: The world is full of such, yea, such as on
both sides are Tale carriers, which with some few truths intermingle
numbers of lyes, they are the Devils seedsmen to sow strife: If God
pronounce the Peace-makers blessed,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 9.</note> then wo to those Make-bates;
of this number we are not to repute those which inform Parents and
Masters, of some abuses in their children and servants, unknown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, provided it be done in love, and that for the redress of the
same.</p>
                  <p>5. If we must labor to have peace with men,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> then much more with
God, who is at enmity with us because of our sins, and that through
Christ alone, who is our Advocate with him: This will afford more
true joy,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 1.</note> then the world either knoweth, or can: Till we procure this,

long life and good days here and hereafter, and that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
shall befal those that do not thus do, our Apostle here proveth:
Such as thus do, God will have a care of them, and watch over them
for good, and for the others, God will set himself against them; where
an Objection is prevented.</p>
                  <p>Oh,<note place="margin">The preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> might some say, that such as live most harmlesly, and do
most good, and be best disposed, and love peace and quietness, should
of all others be most hated, and lie open to manifest dangers, and
they that will scamble and shift for themselves by right or wrong, not
caring whom they wrong, do yet wax great, and prove rich in the
world: True, saith the Apostle, If peaceable and good men were here
left to themselves, they would be soon thrust to the walls, and be
as sheep among wolves, ready to be spoiled; but God doth not so
leave them, but hath a continual care over them, to defend them
from dangers, as much as shall be fit for them; and if they fall into
any, he is ready to hear their prayers, and to help them: and for the
others, they may prosper a while (which yet some of them do not)
but it shall not always so continue, God will set his face against them,
and his fury root them out.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Eyes</hi> we are to understand the diligent and watchful care that the
Lord hath over his people,<note place="margin">See Deut. 11. 12</note> as the mother whose eye is over the yong
childe that it take no hurt.</p>
                  <p>And by <hi>Ears</hi> is meant, his great readiness to hear their Prayers, and
grant their requests.</p>

sometimes his wrath and displeasure, as here; for a mans favor or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure

                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Because if the Lord should speak unto us weak men of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Why Eyes, Ears, Face, &amp;c. are attributed to God.</note>
and as he is in himself, we were utterly unable to bear it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing that we should understand him, he speaketh according to
our capacity, as the nurse to the childe. Because we know not how
one should see without eyes, or watch over any for good, therefore
God ascribeth eyes to himself; and because our power lieth in our
right hand, therefore doth he ascribe a right hand to himself, the like
may be said about his ears, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. This should greatly provoke us to the reading and exercising
our selves in the Scriptures;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> for that we may so do in them, the
Lord vouchsafed to stoop very low for our understanding: If we do it

from Christ, which though it be imperfect, yet is of the better
part of their Righteousness, and the rather, because they are desirous
to do well, and do it willingly, but sin against their will, as an heap
of corn is so called, though it be not without chaff. 3. Because of
their endeavor to be more and more Righteous, as a yong Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
is called by the name of his Trade,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> because of his endeavor and
purpose, though he can do but a little in it; so that they which
be such, may be of good comfort notwithstanding their imperfections

Almighty and All-sufficient careth for us; He also taketh our cause in

the Creed and ten Commandments as prayers, or theirs which mark
not what they say, whose Prayers are meer bablings; Prayers also in
sincerity, Prayers in faith, knowing that we are reconciled unto God
through Christ, Prayers in repentance, in love, fervent Prayers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Prayers, with fasting, not prescribing the Lord either the time,
means, or maner of our deliverance; See <hi>Psal. 145. 18. Jer. 29. 13.

such as are the contempt of his Word, Sacraments and Servants, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Blasphemies, Sabbath-breaking, and the like; yea, which of us
having prayed aright, have not had experience of the truth hereof,
even that God hath many a time, and in many particulars, given ear
unto our desires,<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 25.</note> and granted our poor Prayers? There is none that

poor Saints and Servants.<note place="margin">How it may appear that God hears their prayers readily.</note> This his readiness to hear their prayers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
diversly, as that 1. He makes a way for them by his sons blood
to come to him, which else they durst not. 2. He gives us his Spirit, to
work faith in us, and to wash us clean, and to embolden us to call him
Father,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> and to pray aright, who knew not how to pray of our selves; Its
a sign that he hath a minde to hear us,<note place="margin">Hos. 14. 3.</note> who puts a Supplication into our
mouthes.<note place="margin">Prov. 50. 15.</note> 3. He commands us,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 7.</note> and sets us on work so to do. 4. He hath

(as our Savior did by the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>) or for that he would have
us set the more short by it,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 23.</note> when we have it, and be the more thankful,

off the fire: The unruly Patient would have the Plaister taken off,
as soon as it begins to smart; such are we, but God will hear and
help in the due, in the best time: Sometimes the Lord grants not at
all what his righteous servants crave, Why? because he cannot, or
is not willing, nay, because its not good for us; as if a childe should
ask a knife of his Father, he would deny it: If for matters of soul,
as deliverance from temptations, the Lord answereth not our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note>
he yet gives strength to resist them (as to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>)
which is far better; for its no mastery to have no temptations, but to
overcome temptations, and to have no hurt thereby: If for outward
things, craving freedom from crosses, sicknesses, loss, &amp;c. the Lord
doth not free them, but gives them some Spiritual grace, profitable
for their souls,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> this is far better then that they asked. If one should

done him? So if one in stead of health and long life here should soon
dye, yet to be translated into Heaven, and there to live for ever; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we ask a greater measure of outward things then the Lord grants,
but yet gives us a contented minde, and assurance of eternal riches in
Heaven; either then he grants the thing we desire, or gives us a better
in its stead, and so not break promise with us.</p>
                  <p>1. This sets out Gods wonderful goodness and mercy,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that will
vouchsafe to stoop, to look so low, as to look to such poor unworthy
Creatures as we are, what are we? dust and ashes, sinful men and
women; and what is he? The infinite immortal God, the Lord
of the whole World, most holy and most pure: This comes
by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                  <p>2. This is a singular comfort to the righteous,<note place="margin">Use 2,</note> that God hath not
left us in this world of trouble, without any means to help our selves;
No: he hath left a mean in our hands, to help us in whatsoever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress;
he sets us on work to pray, and hath promised to hear and help.
Hereunto hath God annexed his promises, neither is there any case,
wherein prayer cannot help us: O this is a wonderful encouragement to
us in all times, &amp; in all necessities! If by prayer we fly unto God, theres
remedy; If we need any grace (as we do continually) God upon our
asking hath promised to give it: The like may be said of patience,

so often wanting unto our selves! how much grace, and how much
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65522:250"/>
good have we lost for want of asking? God hath infinite store, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he loath to part therewith, he hath it to bestow, and its his
glory to bestow it: He hath made the way, offers to teach us to pray,
and promiseth to hear us, and yet what dulness is in us? how seldom
pray we? Many of us can go out in the morning without prayer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have recourse unto God all the day long: He is more forward to
give, then we to ask, and yet who hath the benefit? not he, but our
selves; we shut out our selves, when God hath opened the door; we
know not what we have lost, when we have lost a prayer, when we
have neglected it upon every trifling occasion: We feel not our wants,
we prize not grace, we consider not the worth and excellency of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
We trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other dangerous places for gain, and
that with great hazard; there's no hazard to Heaven, send but out
a well prepared prayer, it never returns empty: If we be in sickness, we
rest too much on the means, and too little in prayer: so for our callings,
as also for deliverances out of dangers, we make friends, but pray
not at all.</p>

we use, let prayer be one, let not that be left out: This can do as much,
much more then any other, onely keep our prayers in good tune, as
horses be kept in breath: If we thus do, we shall assuredly obtain,
onely we must wait Gods good leisure; if we obtain not that we pray
for, we shall have better in the stead of it: If we finde them granted,
we must,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 20.</note> with <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows, return praises; yea, besides our
own prayers, we should have a stock going in sundry godly friends
hands, to get their prayers for us always, but especially when we are
in extremity: If any thing in the world help, its this; But need we

should God hear them? nay, their prayers (if they make any) are
abomination: Whatsoever befals the wicked (as evil enough may

their misery? They may murmure and rage against God, bear out for
a while by head and shoulders, as it were, or lie like blocks and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
or run to <hi>Endor</hi> to the Devil for help, but God they have none

yet are they plagued with a worse judgement; He gives them up
to the blindeness of their mindes and hardness of their hearts, and
will of the Devil, which is the most fearful thing that can be,
and at the day of Judgement he will avenge them all at once,

for their wickedness, and do they think to escape? The mightiest

priviledged? It were their wisdom to send forth messengers of peace,
and to humble themselves in time, least he tear them in pieces, when
there's none to deliver them; they should fear and be wise by other
folks harms: But O the monstrousnes of the times, and hardness
of mens hearts! that seeing their companions plagued before their
eyes, yet run on in the same excess of riot. And for those that are as
Lyons and Foxes, subtile, and shifting by unlawful courses, though
haply they may think to get up and wax mighty, yet assuredly,
God will set his face against them, as he daily doth against Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,

Then shall the Lambs be quiet, when those Lyons are killed;

wrongs from men; This must needs procure quiet to those that
are endewed herewith, Who can harm such a one? As grievous

suit with suit,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 18. and 26. 21.</note> &amp;c. they do but stir the coals, and blow the fire
of dissention, and may look to be harmed of every one; experience
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:65522:251"/>
sheweth that if any shall harm the innocent, there's none almost
but cryes against it (as <hi>Jonathan</hi> blamed his Father,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. 4, 5. and 14. 45.</note> for setting

that in wrongs are impatient and given to revenge, are continually
talked of, ill spoken of, and railed on; yea, meet with adversaries,
that do and will oppose them, so that most of the ordinary wrongs
that come to us from our Neighbors, have their beginning from our
selves, who do not that good in our places which we might, or are
impatient when we are wronged: None is hurt but of himself, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
others do to us, we are not hurt thereby, so we be innocent
and sin not; yet doth not this justifie them that do harm us,
but teacheth us by what means especially we may avoid being
harmed.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh our folly,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that would fain live without harm, and
yet cannot be wise enough to use the means to bring it to pass, but take
the contrary course: either we do not perform our duties to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors

the case of some, or we be impatient in wrongs, apt and given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,

do our duties in our places, and live profitably, endeavoring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
for such humility, meekness, and patience from the Lord, as

                  <p>2. When any have harmed us,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and the same proves grievous
unto us, let us examine our selves, whether we may not justly lay
the blame on our selves: If we have been in fault, then are we to be
patient, to humble our selves, and to acknowledge Gods hand on us,
to teach us more innocency, and more patience, and not to stand out so
bitterly against them that have done us wrong; thus shall we finde
comfort in afflictions, which else (bringing the same upon our selves)
we cannot expect.</p>

they that suffer for a good cause, for righteousness, for Religion, for
conscience sake; such as stick fastest to the truth, provide best and
most wisely for themselves, what can their enemies do to us? If they
take away our goods,<note place="margin">Mark 10. 30.</note> we shall have a thousand fold more in this
world, and in the world to come life everlasting; If they mangle
our bodies, God will raise up the same gloriously; If they separate
our souls from our bodies by death, the Angels will carry them into
<hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom;<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 10.</note> If our cause be good, we have cause to rejoyce in
our sufferings;<note place="margin">Acts 5. 41. and 16.</note> so are we enjoyned, so did the Apostles in their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note>
so also the holy Martyrs. I might to this purpose alledge the
story of <hi>Alice Driver,</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi> wife in <hi>Exeter,</hi> of the Christians in
<hi>Edessa,</hi> &amp;c. but that they may be read at large in the Book of the
Martyrs: O that we should be so discouraged at a mock, at a frown of
our betters! O that we should be as soon ready to give over, as to begin
to do well! though the more religious we are, the more we esteem of
the word, the better both God, his angels, and people like us; yet is it
not so with the world, they liked us better before, but do not now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of our course: howsoever, this is our duty, hereof shal we have the
benefit; yea, to be disliked, to suffer for this, will be our honor, our
advancement:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 6. 22.</note> As <hi>David</hi> being mocked of <hi>Michol,</hi> resolved to be yet
more humble, so should we be so much the more for goodness, as
we see the world oppose it, and set themselves against us because of
the same: We must not be discouraged at the very greatest, much less
at small trials:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 4.</note> We know not what we shall suffer, <hi>For yet we have not
resisted unto blood;</hi> onely let us be careful that we suffer for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and for a good cause; for though we have some good things in
us, yet haply we may be brought to suffer for some fault in us, and
therein we can have small peace: Beware we suffer not as Separatists,
that flie out against and from the Church; that we suffer not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
or usual neglect of our Ministers, if they preach the Word
truly; that we suffer not for rash, heady, hasty and violent carriage of
our selves; that we suffer not for our censuring, for our meddling
with things or persons wherewith we have nothing to do; or for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our bounds in things beyond our reach. Servants must beware
that they suffer not for their carelesness in their places, as those which
having liberty granted them to hear the Word, upon their not profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby, are restrained therefrom; so if they shall suffer for being
negligent, untrusty, sloathful, stout in answering again, &amp;c. they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
deservedly, not for righteousness sake; yea, this their carriage
makes the godly housholders to grieve, and those that be not so well
seasoned, to think ill of the profession, and it makes the name of God
and his Gospel ill spoken of; and hereupon many say, Oh, Ile never

he is still, and shall be the childe of God, the member of Christ,
the heir of Heaven, a Kings son, &amp;c. and how can he be miserable
that hath the Comforter within? For the wicked, nothing can make
them happy; let a wicked man have <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength, <hi>Absoloms</hi> beauty,
<hi>Ahasuerus</hi> his wealth, <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> stately <hi>Babel, Dives</hi> his costly

but a step between him and Hell:<note place="margin">Ionah 1. 6.</note> As <hi>Jonah</hi> was asleep whilest God
was offended with him, the winds raged against him, the Whale was
ready to swallow him, so do the wicked eat, sleep and are jovial, while
God is offended, Heaven is shut up against them, Hell gapes for them,
and the Devil waits on them as his prey: Their security will end in a
fearful wakening, they shall be snatched from their beds of ease, and
cast into everlasting torments.</p>

duty, as a fruit of the former trust in God, exhorting us in token
of our Faith in God, that we be ready with courage to acknowledge
and make confession of our Faith, to those that shall demand a reason
thereof: This we must be ready at all times to do, and so often as we
shall be called thereto, and to all men that have authority to call us,
and to any that shall demand it with a desire to learn, or whensoever
and wheresoever we shall see it meet and requisite so to do (as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God will direct his servants where, when and to whom) yet so
as we do it with courage, meekness, and godly reverence.</p>
                  <p>Our duty then is,<note place="margin">As we must believe Gods Truth with our hearts, so must we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it with our tongues.</note> not onely to believe the truth of God in our hearts,
but we must be ready outwardly to make profession thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the same with our tongues, when God shall call us thereunto:
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> walk'd as Pilgrims here on earth, professing
themselves Gods servants; and <hi>Joshua</hi> professed, <hi>That he and his would
serve the true God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 9.</note> Accordingly must we, both by our speeches and
actions declare whose servants we are, so walking, as that men may
see we are not ashamed of God, or his Word and way, whatsoever
others do, most do, yea rich and wise men do, the great ones of the
world do, yet do we thus walk, daring do no otherwise, and not caring
who know our carriage and behavior; and though they scoff at it as
scruplous, too strict, and precise, and call us fools for our labor,
and ask us, Why we do not thus and thus as we see most men do, yet
need not we be dismaid, as being warranted by the Word of God:
So in all Companies we must make known what we are; If we hear
any rail at goodness, speak ill of good duties, oppose any part of
Gods truth, reproach the professors of Religion, whether unknown
or known unto us, we must take the cause in hand, standing for the
defence of Gods truth and servants: If by our timely answer any good
may come to the Gospel, we must not through our silence betray the
same; but if we be among scorners and dogs, we must shew our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
by departing from them: Thus must we do being in company
with prophane ones, so if we be among Papists or other adversaries
to the Truth, we must have the zeal of God in us; so if it be in the
times of persecution, that we be called forth by Magistrates, or their
authority, we ought not to flinch, nor be ashamed or afraid, but shew
what our Religion is, what our Faith and Hope, giving a Reason
thereof out of Gods Word; or if they demand us about any point
of Religion, we must in the defence of Gods cause speak our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
freely: Thus if the Jews or Turks should call us to know, through
whom we did hope &amp; look to be saved, we must acknowledge Christ
Jesus, and our Faith and Hope of Salvation in him, as of whom the
Prophets foretold, and who did every way for time, place, maner,
&amp;c. fulfil their prophecies of him: This we must believe with our
hearts, and confess with our mouthes, in this Faith we must both live
and dye: The like might be instanced about Justification, if by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:65522:255"/>
we should be called to an account. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> came often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> to justifie his demand; thus <hi>Elias</hi> did acknowledge and
maintain the true God, and his pure worship, against <hi>Ahab</hi> and his
false Prophets; so <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three Children, so the Apostles, so
the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 13.</note> so the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> so the holy Martyrs,
they could not be drawn from the truth, either by promises, threats
or torments; so in this Land in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
shewed good skill in the Word, and made known their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
courage.</p>
                  <p>Reasons hereof may be these:<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. That it may appear God hath some
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that know and love, and will defend his Truth, as the Devil also the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> contrary. 2. That we may declare we be not ashamed nor afraid of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> men, to confess the cause of God. 3. That we may confirm our own
consciences,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> and may also (if possible) win others to the truth, as <hi>Paul</hi>
had almost done <hi>Agrippa:</hi> No doubt many standers by were won by
<hi>Pauls</hi> defences, and the Martyrs, and not a few weak ones confirmed,
the rest being left without excuse.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth that horrible wicked practice of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use 1.</note> in keeping the people in miserable blindeness, and holding
it a deadly fin for them to read any part of Scripture, in a tongue they
understand, or any book touching the true Faith and Religion, nay,
read both Scriptures and Prayers to them in an unknown tongue, and
lock up all knowledge from them, and means thereof, like the Scribes
and Pharisees, that took away the Key of Knowledge: How shall they
then be ready to give an account of their Faith? They must believe
as the Church believes, and that is all they can get, onely they preach
to them in their own language, which yet is but lyes and errors for
truth: This is most gross robbery of the people, Christ bid <hi>Search
the Scriptures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 39.</note> they charge the contrary, and curse them that do: Its
cruel tyranny and murther of their souls; they take away their weapons
that they may make a prey of their souls,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 19.</note> as the <hi>Philistines</hi> did from

the Word of Christ might dwell in them richly in all wisdom, &amp;c.</hi> None
have need to be discouraged from seeking knowledge, for most be too
careless and lazy.</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh the gross ignorance of most part of people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that
notwithstanding this light that we have, and so many helps of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
liberty of reading, and so many Books of all kindes, and of
the grounds of our Religion, yet know not what they hold, nor
what be the points of their Religion; but as Market news, they hear
they must serve God, and come to Church, and must be saved by
Jesus Christ, but to prove that he is the true Christ, or that they must
be saved by him, and by no other, in whole nor in part, or that the
Scripture is the Word of God, they are altogether ignorant, and so
might be carried away to any Religion: This is an horrible sin, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
considering the helps and liberty which we enjoy; What no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
carelesness is this? must we not buy the truth, prize the truth,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:65522:255"/>
know it, hold it fast, not part therewith? Most have such skill in
worldly businesses, that they are altogether unskilful in the Word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not the means of their Salvation:<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>This is condemnation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>that light is

perish for want of knowledge? yet are there some which having know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but not the love of the truth nor Faith in God, will flinch
from it if ever they be tryed, for there is no hold of him that loves
not the truth, though he have never so much knowledge, as we may
read of Dr. <hi>Pendleton</hi> and others in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time: Such, if
they be in company of Papists, of Cavillers or Railers, they can stand
or sit still and say nothing; How would these confess the truth with
peril of their lives,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 30.</note> when they be affriad of a great man, &amp;c? Let
such know,<note place="margin">Mark 8. 38.</note> that Christ esteems them as his enemies, <hi>For he that is not

our Religion, and to know the points of Catechism, and be able to
prove them by some place of Scripture, so as we may be bold to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, and stand to the defence of them: To this end, we must
give ear to Catechizing, read the grounds of Religion, and study the
Scriptures in humility and with Prayer, having a care to know the will
of God, and to be guided by it, and to stand in the defence of it to
Gods glory, against such as oppose it: This is the glory of a man, of
a Christian, to make confession of his Faith in Christ, and stand to
the defence of it; this God may justly expect of us, it hath been
performed by them which had not the hundredth part of the means
which we have: O let us both love and live in the Truth, sticking
close thereto, whatsoever it cost us! And if at any time we shall hear it
spoken against, we must have the zeal of God in us to stand in
the defence thereof:<note place="margin">Luke 12. 8.</note> Thus confessing Christ here among men,
he will confess us before his Father in Heaven and his holy
Angels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the hope that is in you,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with our hearts before we can confess with our mouthes.</note> Faith and hope must be rooted in our hearts
ere we utter the same with our tongues; In vain do we talk of things
whereof we have not the inward feeling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With meekness and fear,]</hi> Here's the maner (for good things must be
done in a right maner) we must temper our courage and zeal,<note place="margin">Our speeches must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with meekness and fear.</note> in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out the truth with meekness and fear; we must avoid pride and
insolency by forgetting our places, or those we have to speak to, or
breaking out into violent speeches, mockings, gibings, or such like,
for so we may do much hurt, and this is unbeseeming the Spirit of
Gods Servants. Besides, the things we speak of, being the matters of
God, our speech and behavior must be sutable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This rebuketh the preposterous zeal of some,<note place="margin">Use.</note> which defending the
truth and a good cause, forget duty and respect to their Superiors, and
break out into violent and unseemly speeches, and be at defiance by
and by, and straight condemn all that are not as they should be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they should by a wise, meek, and moderate defence, and kinde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:65522:256"/>
win credit to the truth which they defend, and so do good;
they on the contrary cause them to speak evil, and to think that its but
a preposterous hate and pride of heart in them so to speak, and so do
hurt: Some sober Christians do much good, and win on many that at
first were opposite, when they hear the wait of their reasons, rather then
the bigness of their words, and seeing they do it in the fear of God,
and for conscience sake: Some are not so milde as others, but of an
hotter nature; this must in any wise be tempered with wisdom, yet
are not we to part from any part of the truth, but to stick as close there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as we may.</p>

as to accuse, excuse, comfort, terrifie, &amp;c. <hi>Placed by God;</hi> for God
being the creator of the soul, he must accordingly be the creator of all
the faculties of it: <hi>In the soul,</hi> called also the heart, and the Spirit of a
man: Herein there be diverse faculties, as the understanding (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we conceive what is true and what is false, what is good and what
is evil) the will (whereby we will or nill, choose or refuse any thing,
whereto are joyned the affections, joy, grief, love, hope, fear, &amp;c.)
and the memory, whereby we hold fast things conceived, or else call
to minde, and remember things past: So also is conscience another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
thereof, whereby the soul reflects upon it self, whereby I know
that I do know such a thing, that I think this or that, that I affect or
desire, love or hate this or that; for its one thing to know a thing, think
a thing, remember a thing, &amp;c. and another to know that I know it,
think it, remember it: Now in which part of the soul it hath its place, as
whether in the understanding or will, or in every part of the soul, I will
not stand; its enough for us to know that there is such a faculty in mans
soul. True it is, it not only gives witness of all the faculties, &amp; tels what
I think, desire, affect, &amp;c. but it useth and worketh upon all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as the understanding; for by it, it directs, and according to it, it
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:65522:256"/>
doth accuse, so as if the judgement be well informed, the conscience
will give right witness, if ignorant or ill informed, then it gives wrong
testimony: So the memory, accusing or excusing for things past; so
it worketh upon the will, by provoking it to choose or refuse this or
that; so it worketh upon the affections, raising up in us comfort and
joy upon well doing, fear and grief upon ill-doing: Now though it
have to do with all, yet it may have its proper place in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and minde, according to the judgement of most Divines: <hi>Of a
man,</hi> for no Creature on earth hath Conscience, but man. True, the
Angels are not without it, the good having a good, comfortable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing,
joyful Conscience; the evil, a woful, ill, accusing, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Conscience, which is so much the worse, for that they know
so much, and be so maliciously bent against it, so that even when they
be not in the place of torment, but have leave to range the world, yet
they carry Hell with them, even a tormenting Conscience, whereof
their trembling (according to Saint <hi>James</hi>) is an evident testimony:<note place="margin">Iames 2. 19.</note>
But no other Creature hath it, for having no Reason, they have no
Conscience; therefore we say in our speech of a bad and unconscion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man, he hath no more Conscience then a Dog, or as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
as an Horse, whereby we mean none at all, for these Creatures
have none: Man then hath a Conscience, yea every man, yet as the
use of Reason may be lost, by folly, phrensie, &amp;c. so the use of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in such: So by notorious wickedness, a man may lose the use
of his Conscience for a time, whereupon we say of such a one, he hath
no Conscience: yes, every man hath a Conscience, though as the use
of Reason is taken from one deeply drunk; so custom of sinning hath
taken away use of Conscience, so that it doth not admonish him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he do ill, nor check and accuse him after, or hath such an erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgement, thinking good evil, and evil good, that he hath also
an erronious Conscience: But this benummed or beguiled Conscience
will be awakened at one time or other, in life or death, or at the day
of Judgement;<note place="margin">Rom 2. 15.</note> for no mans Conscience dyes, but lives, and shall
meet him at the last day: and though his sins be now as words written
with the juyce of Lemmons, nothing to be seen, yet when their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
comes to the fire of Gods Judgements, then every little dash,
idle words, vain thoughts, &amp;c. will be perceived: Though men choak
and smother Conscience, though they strangle it, or so drown it in
their cups, yet it will and doth abide still; what made <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren
troubled in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but Conscience, which told them of the sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them twenty years before? So Conscience told <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that
he and his people were wicked, which determined of his thoughts,
desires, words, and deeds, or more briefly, beareth witness either with
us or against us in the sight of God: It meddles not with other folks
actions, for that is science or knowledge, but with our own, and that
is Conscience: Conscience, that is knowledge with another, that is,
either another knowledge, when I knowing any thing, do know that
I know it, and so know my self and what is in me, or another person
that knows with me what I know, and that as well as I, or rather far
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:65522:257"/>
better, namely, God, who made the Conscience, and will judge it,
and is privy to all that is in it; for so is no other, neither man nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,<note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note>
and accordingly the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> joyn both together:
Great is the force hereof:<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 20.</note> as both being within us, and so more able
either to comfort or terrifie us then any other thing (as the wind that
gets within the earth, shakes it most terribly) and likewise so insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that a man cannot get from it.</p>
                  <p>1. This sheweth plainly that there is a God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> who hath set Conscience
on work thus to admonish, warn, comfort, accuse, terrifie, &amp;c. Having
done evil, why should a mans Conscience accuse or terrifie him, but
that God hath ordained it should so do? and accordingly it doth cite
him before God, and judge him before hand; for not man or Angel
can take the accusation of Conscience, it bears record in the sight of
God: Why have the most unbridled despisers of God, when any
token of Gods wrath hath appeared, run into holes and cellars under
the ground; yea, and such wicked monsters after some foul offence,
though so secretly done as that they needed not to have been afraid of
men, yet been so much vexed and disquieted, but that their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
informed them of God against whom they did sin? and that
his wisdom and knowledge did far surpass that of men or Angels, as
knowing not onely what is done and spoken in the world, but what
is in every mans heart.</p>
                  <p>2. This confuteth those which affirm,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> That we cannot be assured
of our Salvation, and why? because we cannot know whether we
believe or not, &amp;c. But as we may know a Tree by the fruits, so may
we our Faith:<note place="margin">Iames 2.</note> God gives us not grace, that we should not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have it or not:<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2. 3.</note> wherefore serves Conscience but to witness
what is in us?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> Thus what Conscience is.</p>
                  <p>For the second,<note place="margin">The Offices of Conscience.</note> The Offices of Conscience, they are to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to give judgement.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">To bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> I say, To bear witness, and that 1. Of our thoughts, whether
they have been proud, distrustful, unclean, wandering at the hearing
of the Word, or in Prayer, worldly on the Lords day, &amp;c. for the
understanding hath two faculties, one whereby it conceives or thinks
this or that; the other, whereby it doubles upon it self, and knows
that it did think it: The minde thinks a thought, the Conscience goes
beyond the minde, and knows what the minde thinks; so that if a
man would hide his thoughts from God, his Conscience can bear
witness of them:<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 10.</note> Thus it discovers the very bent and sway of our
hearts.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> 2. Of our will and affections, whether the same be set on good,
or that which is evil.<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> 3. Of our speeches, whether they be agreeable
to Gods Word or not. 4. Of our actions, though never so secret:
Thus <hi>Davids</hi> Conscience told him that he had sinned in numbring
the people,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 10. and 24. 15.</note> but that he had not conspired against <hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 7. 4, 5.</note> howsoever he
was by him persecuted;<note place="margin">Iob 42. 3. &amp; 31. 5, 7, &amp;c.</note> so <hi>Jobs</hi> Conscience witnessed against him,
that he had spoken somewhat impatiently, but for him, that he had
not eat his morsels alone, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. This setteth out the great mercy of God to man,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> God hath not
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:65522:257"/>
here left us alone, but besides his Word and Ministers, every man
hath a keeper still going along with him (who is to pry into our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to bear witness of them all, and when we have done amiss,
to tell us secretly thereof, that so we may ask pardon and amend, and
may not complain that we had none to tell us of our faults, &amp;c.) and
that is our conscience: Hereby such as belong unto God are stirred
up to have recourse unto God for mercy, and thereupon are pardoned;
after their conversion, they are also hereby kept from many evils, and
through the checks of Conscience we are driven to repentance: Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are they that have tender Consciences, and turn not the deaf ear
thereto: Doth our conscience tell us of any thing amiss? if we do
thereupon amend, we make good use thereof; but if we do not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it now speaks softly between it and us in our ear, it will roar out one
day, when it will be heard, whether we will or not, namely, Both
at the hour of our death, and on the day of Judgement. Most men
count their conscience a common Barretor, one that troubles them
(as <hi>Ahab</hi> said <hi>Elias</hi> did Israel) therefore is it just with God to give
them benumb'd consciences, that they go snorting to Hell.</p>
                  <p>2. It setteth out the Equity and Justice of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that condemns no
man till he hath given him both a law to guide him, and a conscience
to admonish him,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> yea, to accuse and condemn him: When God judgeth,
every mans conscience shall justifie God for so doing; when God shall
awake the conscience, then it will speak true, give a righteous ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
and condemn the civilest for want of Faith in Christ, and not
performance of the duties of the first Table.</p>
                  <p>3. It teacheth us to beware we sin not,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> whether in thought, word or
deed, either out of hope that none shall know it, or that we shall scape
for lack of witnesses, or that we may alledge that we knew not that
so and so to do were sins: Thus we should but deceive our selves,
for there be witnesses enough, thine own conscience is as a
thousand, and God as ten thousand: Lets do no other thing but that
whereof we would hear again, for conscience will bear witness; do
not we bless our selves for our sins done in secret, as if none saw them,
or could witness any thing against us: The bird in the breast knows,
and God knows; hang down thine head then, and ask mercy of God,
and confess thy self to him; if not, even thine own conscience may
break it out in this world, as <hi>Judas</hi>'s in accusing himself, whereas
he was not taxed by others, and many have confessed Murther, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Theft, &amp;c. some with repentance, others in hellish horror:
Do not any thing in hope of secrecy, unless you can keep God and
your consciences from being present, neither be we careful for eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses
of our well doing in the performance of duties: Its enough
if our conscience tells us we have done well; yea, if we be taxed for
Hypocrites,<note place="margin">See Acts 23. 1.</note> or otherwise be slandered, its sufficient that God and our
own conscience can bear witness of our sincerity and uprightness;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note>
its more then if every one should speak well of us,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 18.</note> excepting our own
conscience: Thus was <hi>Job,</hi> thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> comforted.<note place="margin">Isa. 38. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. To give judgement, and that whether things be good or
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:65522:258"/>
bad,<note place="margin">To give judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our actions.</note> whether they be well done or ill done, and this judgement is
given either before our actions, or after them; before, Conscience
gives judgement thus, it tells us what is good, and what bad, and not
so barely, but with some furtherance, This is good, therefore do it;
This is ill, therefore do it not; so <hi>Pilate</hi> knowing Christ to be innocent,
his conscience moved him to seek to loose him; so <hi>Reuben</hi> when his
brethren would have killed <hi>Joseph,</hi> apprehending that to be ill, and
that from his conscience, he disswaded them therefrom; so <hi>Davids</hi>
conscience told him that he should do ill to kill <hi>Saul,</hi> and thereupon
would not give ear to those that perswaded him hereto: Thus being
tempted to Lye,<note place="margin">See Isa. 30. 21.</note> Deceive, Swear, Prophane the Lords day, &amp;c. the
conscience tells us that its evil so to do;<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 7.</note> Again, being called upon to
any good duty, the conscience tells us its good, and provokes us to
do it.</p>
                  <p>Why,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> then Conscience is a Puritan if it do thus, is not this corrupted as well
as the other faculties?</p>
                  <p>O yes,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> therefore it gives judgement very weakly and imperfectly
in all, but especially in the unregenerate, and especially in the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and most wicked, yet it retains some part of her office and
power, and will be doing as its enlightened, and therefore it will give
this judgement in foul and gross things in the worst of all, as when
they go to commit Murther, Adultery, &amp;c. or tell them on the other
side, they should go to Church, &amp;c. but in the regenerate it doth
much good work, its as a guide to conduct us in our way, and whereby
we shun all by paths; Its a bridle to keep us from sin, and a spur to
goodness, its joyned in Commission with the Spirit of God, they are
obeyed or rejected together.</p>
                  <p>1. Our duty then in token of our thankfulness is,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> That we listen to the
voyce of Conscience, and be ruled by it; we must take advice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ere we do any thing: If we will not be ruled thereby, but do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereto, it will one day exclaim against us, when God shall judge
us for our disobedience; Why, did not I give thee a Conscience to tell
thee of these things, will God say? Yes, Lord, shall Conscience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
I told him it was naught, and yet he would do it; I told him such
and such a thing was his duty, and urged him to it, and yet he would
not give ear, but put off the time from one day to another; he would
not repent, have prayers in his family, &amp;c. such shall then be stricken
speechless: Most are so eagerly carried after their passions and unruly
affections, as that they do not hear the voyce of their conscience, the
noise of those drowns the voyce of this.</p>
                  <p>2. Even natural men have a light of conscience urging them to
good,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and restraining them from evil: None so evil, but they have
in them some light, by which conscience is set on work to advise or
counsel to the doing or avoiding this or that good or evil; its there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no note or sign of grace in any, because their conscience doth
thus and thus: This is in meer natural men, from the light and
knowledge that conscience hath of things good or evil, yea, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so forcible are those stirrings of conscience in them, as that
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:65522:258"/>
it keeps and restrains them from many sins which they are inclined to,
and would otherwise commit, and puts them upon many good things
which it urgeth them to, which of themselves they have neither will
nor power to do; not from the love they have of the good, or hatred of
the evil, but beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se they would please Conscience, which will not
suffer them to be at quiet till it be obeyed; this they may do, and yet
in the mean time may be onely in the state of Nature; for though here
they obey Conscience, yet they do it not for Conscience sake: Their
obedience ariseth not from the purity and holiness of the Law of God,
but from fear of men, from discredit or shame, from hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
desire of ease or the like: If there were no other cause to move
them to enter upon good duties, or to restrain them from doing evil,
but the Law of God, they would not yield that obedience to Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which now they do: And thus conscience gives judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
things be done.</p>
                  <p>For its judgement after our Actions:<note place="margin">After our actions.</note> It then gives sentence, This
was well done, This was ill done, and not so onely, but with an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
or Condemnation: This was well done, therefore you are
innocent in it, and deserve neither guilt nor punishment; This was
ill done, therefore you are guilty, and have deserved Gods wrath
hereby:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Samuels</hi> Conscience spake for him,<note place="margin">Exod. 9. 27.</note>

                     <hi>I have sinned, &amp;c.</hi> Thus is Conscience as a Judge
acquitting or condemning us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12,</note> yea,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 21.</note> a little God as it were in the midst
of man, giving sentence beforehand, as it shall be at the Tribunal seat
of God on the last day: If it acquits us, then it worketh Peace, Joy,
Comfort, Boldness; if it condemn us, especially forcibly, O then
it causeth shame (as in <hi>Adam,</hi> when he fled and hid himself in the
thicket after he had offended) so also fear, yea, in the midst of all jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as in <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and at small things, as the shaking of a leaf; so also
sorrow (which the world judgeth to be melancholy, whereas it is far
otherwise, and yet both may and do often meet together) yea, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as in (<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>) and an universal distraction of body and
minde:<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 20.</note> the accusation of conscience are wounds to the heart;<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37.</note>

the truth and integrity of our hearts, of our hatred of evil, our delight
in Gods word, and endeavor to please him above all things, &amp;c. then
may we rejoyce and be of good comfort, the same being an infallible
mark of our Salvation, and may be bold in believing the same against
Satan and all his discomforts: Theres a great fault in many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
though (as the Apostle saith) <hi>They know nothing by themselves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>but
that their hearts bear witness with them, of their care and faithfulness in
all things, yet are never the more comforted, but are still cast down
through Satans suggestions and lyes, and their own unbelief:</hi> If thine own
conscience well informed according to Gods Word acquit thee, why
shouldst thou not be of good comfort? you may be humbled for your

                  <p>2. Let us always keep our selves in well-doing,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that we may hear
our consciences speak comfortably, so may we keep a continual feast.</p>
                  <p>3. If we have any thing lying on our consciences,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> for which they
boyl within us, and accuse and pronounce judgements against us, let
us not make a slight matter of it; but seek to God for mercy, and to
be discharged of it, that so we may still conscience, which then may
be done, not before: Stop not the mouth of conscience, as many do
by mirth and toys, this is but to delude thy self and delay time; others
let it alone, and think to wear it out in time: O no, conscience will
still cry louder!<note place="margin">Simile.</note> What if one should make the Bayliff drunk, and so
get away, the debt is never the more paid, he will come again; though
the evil Spirit in <hi>Saul</hi> went away by the Minstrels playing, yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to him again; the like may be said of conscience: I wonder at
the horrible madness of some people, though their consciences do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
accuse them and condemn them for many things, yet are so far
from seeking to disburthen them, that they daily adde more and more
thereto: How justly may these fear, lest the terror of conscience come
so fiercely on them, as even to weary them out of their lives? But
howsoever they sleep now, there will be a time when they will awaken
and cry to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>4. Let us take heed that from henceforth we do not burthen our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note>

from the like; so should we do in respect of sin, yea, in our places, as
Magistrates, Ministers, Husbands, Parents, Masters, &amp;c. we must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

&amp; which not gain, pleasures, honor, &amp;c. can procure: Because thy

we, that the Word of God is that which tells us what is to be
done, and what left undone, and that this bindes the conscience to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
when any thing is done agreeable to the Word, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
saith, its well, and excuseth; when any thing is done contrary
to the Word, the conscience saith, its ill, and condemneth: As for
them that have not the Word, their consciences judge by the light
and Law of nature, which was left man after the fall (for there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
some general notions in mans heart both of the first and second
Table, as appears by the Laws which the Heathens have made about

&amp;c.)<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> These I say, are judged by this: Its true, that mens Laws,
an Oath, a Vow, do binde the conscience, but its by vertue from the
Word; now if the minde be enlightened with the true knowledge of
the Word of God, then will the conscience give right judgement, but
if it be ignorant of the Word, then it may make the conscience er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious,
or scruplous and doubtful.</p>
                  <p>An erronious conscience,<note place="margin">An erronious conscience, what it is.</note> is when it accuseth where it should excuse,
or excuse when it should accuse, which comes from an erronious

ignorant persons must needs fill their lives with swarms of offences
and sins, for they not knowing many things to be sins which be, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, and never accuse themselves for them; as we say, the
blinde cats many a flye, and do many things which they have no faith
of the lawfulness of, but do them for custom, example of others,
and the like, and so sin in them; people think if they be free from
murther, whoredom, theft, &amp;c. they be in a good case, but being
ignorant,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 105.</note> their lives abound with sins: <hi>O therefore let the Word be a
light unto our feet, and a lanthorn unto our paths:</hi> Thus of the offices of
conscience.</p>
                  <p>For the third, Three questions here offering themselves, require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether doth a man sin,<note place="margin">Whether a man doth sin that doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his conscience.</note> that doth according to his conscience:
As a Papist thinks he serves God highly well in going to Mass; one in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, thought Fornication a thing indifferent, and so committed it;
A man thinks he may lawfully travel homeward on the Lords-day, being in a
journey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> He doth ill that doth any of these, or the like; for his erring
conscience cannot make that good, which God hath before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
to be evil, by forbidding it in his Word; our conscience is
not our rule, but Gods Word: Thus every one should be saved by
his own devotion, and it were lawful to go to a cunning man, to
sell as dear as we can, to deceive them that deceive us, to use the
Creed and Ten Commandments as a Prayer,<note place="margin">See Acts 26. 9.</note> &amp;c. which who can
justifie?<note place="margin">Whether a man do any thing against his conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing erronious,</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whether it be lawful for a man to do a thing against his conscience,
I mean, though his conscience be erronious and deceived: As if a Papist be
perswaded that its a sin to come to Church with us, and yet for fear comes; an
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:65522:260"/>
Anabaptist holds it unlawful to take an oath before a Magistrate, and yet
through fear he doth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> They do ill, not simply for doing these things, as being good, and
such as God requires, but for doing them with an ill conscience against
their conscience; so that if they do not these things being required,
they sin; if they do them, they sin, what then? They must labor to
be informed, and perswaded of the lawfulness of them, and then do
them: So that though (as in the former question) our perswasion of
the lawfulness of a thing being indeed unlawful, makes it not good; so
the doing of a good thing against ones conscience, makes it unlawful:
If a man think himself bound in conscience to pray three times in a day,
he ought so to do, though God hath left it indifferent: An erronious
conscience must be followed till it be better informed,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> but how vile is
it to commit an evil against the checks and light of conscience,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7.</note> and yet
whats more frequent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether is it lawful to do a thing with a doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.<note place="margin">Whether it be lawful to do a thing with a doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By no means, a particular faith must be had for all our actions; we
must forbear a thing till we be perswaded, and such ought to be born
with that seek resolution: A scruplous Conscience is, when a man
is inclined to think a thing lawful, and yet hath some scruples and
doubts, by reason of many difficulties that he hath heard of, which
he knoweth not how to answer or resolve: Here our rule is to labor to
suppress all difficulties that make us doubt; but if it cannot be done,
then its lawful to follow conscience notwithstanding those doubts
and scruples, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. when the people were setled in a true way
of serving God, if one should come and teach them a contrary way,
confirming the same by a sign, this must needs breed some scruples in
the peoples mindes; nevertheless, conscience enclining to the truth
of the former Doctrine, they are bound to stand to it: Thus of these
three Questions.</p>
                  <p>For the fourth,<note place="margin">The several kindes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> There are good and bad consciences; Mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
was onely good in the Creation, since the fall all mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are corrupted and perverted, whereof some are renewed and
sanctified from Heaven, and so become good, though not perfectly,
because of the remnants of corruption:<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> Whosoever is not sanctified,
hath an ill conscience of one kinde or other.</p>
                  <p>An evil conscience is either a still and quiet evil conscience or stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
either by accusing, or excusing wrongfully; for the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of a good conscience, is to excuse altogether for well-doing:
Now when the conscience is either num and dead, and lies still, or
otherwise accuseth for sin, or excuseth wrongfully, this is an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p>Of a still quiet ill conscience there be three kindes,<note place="margin">The kindes of a still quiet conscience.</note> namely, sleepy,
secure, and seared.</p>
                  <p>The first,<note place="margin">Drowsie.</note> a sleepy drowsie conscience, that lives and lies in many
sins, and yet accuseth not by reason of ignorance in the Word of God,
as the common sort neglect many a duty, and commit many a sin, that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:65522:260"/>
conscience never checks them for, because they be ignorant of
Gods Law, for which another that knows the Law of God is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
with them are <hi>omnia bene;</hi> they hope to be saved by their good
meaning, and crying God mercy at last; they are not troubled at wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
thoughts, worldly talk on the Lords day, to go to bed without
prayer,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and the like: They are like one that comes into a sluttish house
in a dark night, and sees nothing amiss, but when the Sun shines per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the foul corners, yea, the very moats that flye in the Sun-beams:
Some such have come under a lightsom Ministery, and have wondred
and been ashamed of themselves, and have been humbled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;
Thus was it with <hi>Paul</hi> before and after his conversion.</p>
                  <p>The second,<note place="margin">Secure.</note> A secure conscience, that is stirred onely at foul and
staring sins, hates murther and fighting, but in rash and unadvised an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is not moved at all; is somewhat troubled at swearing by wounds
and blood, but makes nothing of By my faith, truth, this bread, fire,
Sun that shines, and the like; such have wide throats, that can
swallow all small things: So there are that make conscience of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
cruelty, in justice, but none of neglecting the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and Prayer, or prophaning the Lords-day, which be
greater then the former, though they do not so think; and partly
the commonness of them makes their conscience not accuse in them,
or that they be never awakened for their sins, till some great cross do
befal them, or after some rowsing Sermon, then their consciences
work; therefore they cannot abide such Preaching, though it were
happy for them, if they might hear such still, till they were wearied out
of themselves.</p>
                  <p>The third,<note place="margin">Seared.</note> A benumbd, brawny and seared conscience; benumbd,
as a member in the dead Palsie; brawny, as a laboring mans hand;
seared, as with an hot iron, which is worst of all: when men go
on and make conscience of nothing, but do what they list, and their
hearts scarce smite them, being (as <hi>Nabal</hi>) like blocks and stones, daring
do any thing, and committing most horrible foul sins, and yet not
being troubled thereat: This comes by the custom of sin, and refusing
the checks of their conscience, and Gods giving them up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
minde, and an hard heart, to work wickedness, and that with
greediness:<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note> great sins also lyen in without repentance, do harden and
benumb the conscience, as a part of the body that is seared is past
feeling: They not onely doing against the light of Gods Word,
but even against the light of nature, and their natural conscience,
God gives them over, and so they go on in sin, without sence of
any thing.</p>
                  <p>The cause of these, especially the two first, is chiefly the want of a
faithful Ministery, for where this is, though they be not converted,
yet they be convinced, and sin not so quietly as others; or if they
live under such a faithful stirring Ministery, and yet have drowsie and
secure consciences, its because they come not to the Word, or regard
not what they hear, or understand it not, or sleep thereat: But there
are some more notorious, which will not lightly abide a zealous or
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:65522:261"/>
powerful Ministery, but will get away from it, else if they tarry, through
long contempt of the Word, and hardening their hearts, they grow
past feeling, having set down with themselves, they will never be
moved with whatsoever is said: This is a great plague, it takes from
a man the onely means under God of his repentance; he is as one
under a grave stone, that cannot rise: These are lusty and merry, they
think their case happy, they say, Peace, peace, they thank God they
were never troubled in conscience, and marvel at them that be, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them out of their wits, or else that they have been some great
offenders, &amp;c. but they are troubled, not because they be out of their
wits, but because they now begin to come into their right minde, as
its said of the Prodigal,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 17.</note> They be troubled not because they be greater
sinners then the others, but because they see that the others see not,
which if they saw (as it were happy for them if they did) they would
see cause enough to be wounded to the purpose: But do they think
their conscience will ever lie thus still? No, let them be assured God
will set all in order before them, and their benumb'd conscience will
prove a raging conscience. A Bankrupt makes a great shew at first, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
breaks, and is arrested and imprisoned; many make fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
unto Delinquents, that they will speak to the Judge for them,
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but do indeed prove their chief adversaries, such are the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of these men: If it be once awakened and stirred, it will roar
as a Lyon, and tear out their throats; a sleepy conscience is like a starcht
Ruff, that stands up brave in fair weather, but falls quite down in a
storm: The peace of such a conscience is naught, it comes not after
humiliation, nor proceeds from apprehension of Gods love, but
from a false imagination, having no true reformation of life accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying
it.</p>
                  <p>Now that the consciences of such may be awakened here,<note place="margin">See Ioh. 3. 20, 21.</note> whilest
there is help (though usually most shun the same) they must 1. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to be acquainted with Gods Law,<note place="margin">Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be awakened.</note> wherein they shall as well see
the smallest as the greatest sins: Therein they shall perceive their own
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> error, as who thought that they did love God above all, and their
neighbors as themselves; that they did ever serve God, and put their
whole trust in him; that it was lawful for them to swear, so it were
true; that it was lawful to go to wizards, that on the Lords day they
might walk about their fields, and do their other businesses, and yet
serve God as well as they that went to Church; that they might do
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with their own what they list, &amp;c. 2. Labor to know and believe that
the least sin is damnation (yet do most bless themselves in their evil
courses,<note place="margin">See Deu. 29. 19</note> and are not a whit moved by all the threatnings of Gods
Word) that thereupon they may be humbled and terrified, and flie
out of themselves to God for mercy, which is the onely way to come
to good: To this end let them make use of the most stirring sermons,
meditate of Gods judgements, go to such as are afflicted, or lie on
their death beds, consider that there be thousands in Hell which have
not committed the tithe of their sins, and that if they themselves should
dye suddenly (this night) their condition were miserable: If any shall
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:65522:261"/>
say, My conscience hath been quiet all this while, I do not mean to
call my estate into question; let such know, that many go snorting to
Hell, and that a troubled conscience is better then a drowsie secure
conscience, for that may come to good, the other is out of all possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of mercy:<note place="margin">See Acts 2. 37 and 16. 29.</note> Indeed, to stay in terror of conscience is fearful, yet
not worse then to have a benumb'd conscience; there's hope of them
that be troubled,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> of the others but a little. Physitians prescribe
their Patients sometimes to go to sea to be sea sick, and that to purge
away some ill humors, for the health of the body; no less needful is
it to be soul sick for the welfare of our souls; yet is it a common speech
of most, at the visitation of the sick, Oh, I pray do not trouble him,
he is in a very good minde, &amp;c. but the Prodigals condition (though
he had ragged cloaths and a rent heart) was better then his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and the Publican justified, not the Pharisee: Thus of the
quiet ill conscience.</p>
                  <p>The stirring ill conscience,<note place="margin">The stirring ill conscience.</note> is either when it stirs by excusing, or
by accusing.</p>
                  <p>Excusing,<note place="margin">Excusing.</note> upon the doing of some evil, whereof <hi>John</hi> 16. 2. or
the omission of some duty, as the hearing of the Word, Prayer, and
the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e: Thus was it with <hi>Saul</hi> when he was questioned by <hi>Samuel,</hi>
for not obeying Gods Commandment; thus hath it been with some
Papists, when they have practiced Treason against their Prince and
Countrey. A good conscience doth excuse indeed, but rightly, not
amiss, in all things, not in some onely, for the maner as well as the
thing it self.</p>
                  <p>Accusing,<note place="margin">Accusing.</note> and that 1. When it should not, as an Idolator is troubled
in conscience for leaving undone some piece of idolatrous service.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
2. For trifles, and not for matters of weight, as the Pharisees made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
great conscience of going to meat with unwashen hands, but not of
murthering Christ; as Papists make great conscience of eating
flesh on a fasting day, who yet make no conscience of Whoredom,
Swearing; so Civil persons would be much troubled if they should
be but accused for wronging their neighbors, who yet are no whit
moved for prophaning the Lords day, not coming to the Sacrament,
neglect of Prayer and the like. 3. When it is forcible and violent,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
causing horror and fear, gastliness, terror in the dark, or at the sight
of any of Gods Judgements, trembling at the ratling of a leaf, yea,
and desperation it self: This, though it be not good of it self, yet turns
to the good of the godly; God brings them this way, onely he leaves
them not here, but by the voyce of the Gospel doth relieve their
mindes, and perswades them to seek mercy, upholding them with
the hope thereof: Some have checks of conscience, but so, as they
can bear them out; some again, so as they cannot endure them.</p>
                  <p>Who so finde their consciences accusing them for their sins,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and
know no pardon, but their consciences still tell them of their sins, and
that their course is bad, let such know, that they have evil consciences,
which being let alone, will accuse them worse: If their consciences
accuse them, God is greater, and knows more: Therefore let them
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:65522:262"/>
seek to pacifie God and their consciences too. To this end, consider,
That God hath provided in his infinite mercy an all-sufficient remedy
in the death and bloodshed of Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 20.</note> then which there is no
other way to satisfie Gods displeasure, nor to stanch the terrors of
conscience; let such bewail and lament their state to Almighty God,
confessing their sins, and judging themselves as the Prodigal for the
same,<note place="margin">See Psal. 32. 5.</note> thereupon craving of him with strong cryes and humble pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 13.</note>
the pardon and forgiveness thereof: To such as thus come in the
truth of their hearts,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 18.</note> God hath made many gracious promises;<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 16.</note> Thus
suing to him,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> he will in his own good time send down a comfortable
answer: This is the onely course to come to good (to still conscience
with forgetting our sins, and mirth, is but to deceive our selves, to
wear it out by head and shoulders; its but as the putting away of the
tooth-ake with cold water, which will still it for a little, but after it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth
more violently) this is the way to get peace: After this will
our consciences begin to be quiet, and thereupon excuse and comfort:
Then will Faith purifie the heart, and work an hatred of all sin, with
a continual care to please God in all things: Then shall we be quite
altered and changed from that we were. I cannot but wonder at a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, whose consciences witness against them, who yet seek
not to pacifie them by assurance of pardon, but adde more daily unto
their sins; whose consciences bear witness, That they have no care
to please God, but their way and works be naught, assuredly their
consciences will one day cry louder; O lay up no new matter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
all the profit and pleasure that comes of it will be dear
bought:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Its as to drink pleasing poyson, it goes down pleasantly, but
afterward wounds the bowels: If a man had never so much wealth, yet
if he have an ill conscience, what shall it profit him? It were as if a man
had a costly banket, rich apparel and attendance, &amp;c. and one with a
sword drawn were standing ready by him to kill him: This is a Bailiff
to arrest, a Jailer to keep safe, a witness to accuse, a Judge to condemn,
an Executioner to torment, &amp;c. Its of all foes the worst, they accuse
to men, this to God; one may go from them sometimes, but not
from this: Its an evil help in adversity, which like <hi>Jobs</hi> friends troubles
us more then all the rest; It will be a woful companion at the hour of
death, and day of Judgement: Its like a woful contentious wife, when
a man hath had trouble enough abroad, coming home, he findes more
there: O their life is no life, that live with a worm gnawing within!
Thus, what joy will there be of health, wealth, or whatsoever else?
yea, as we are to take heed of this, so also are we of a benumbd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
the end of both being bad, the one no less dangerous then the
other; Thus of a bad conscience.</p>
                  <p>A good conscience, is an excusing and comforting conscience, that
speaks on ones side, and that for well doing: Thus have the Angels
in Heaven a perfect excusing conscience; So had <hi>Adam</hi> in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and we shall one day have in heaven: Now our conscience is but
so in part, as all our other faculties; Some corruption remains therein,
even in the best, and therefore doth sometimes accuse, or excuse when
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:65522:262"/>
it should not, but for the most part it excuseth and witnesseth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
on our sides; this is either a good quiet, or a good troubled and
trembling conscience.</p>
                  <p>A good quiet conscience hath these two parts,<note place="margin">A good quiet conscience.</note> an heart witnessing
to us, 1. The pardon of our sins past in the blood of Jesus Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
(for as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s casting into the Sea,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> stilled the same; So believing in
Christ,<note place="margin">Ionah 1. 15.</note> stills the most troubled conscience; if we be justified through
him,<note place="margin">See Act. 16. 30.</note> who shall condemn?) and 2. Our unfained uprightness and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
care to please God in all things, detesting all evil, and bearing true love
to his Word and Saints; of the former read these Scriptures, <hi>Job
19. 25. Romans 8. 16. Psalm</hi> 4. 6. and 32. 1. <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Cant.</hi> 2. 16.
Of the latter these, <hi>Psalm</hi> 26. 2. and <hi>Isaiah 38. 3. Acts 23. 1. 2 Cor.
1. 12. Heb.</hi> 13. 18. They that believe most assuredly the pardon of
their sins, and walk most stedfastly with God, they have the good
quiet conscience, at least so far as is here to be attained: This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Jewel,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> a continual feast;<note place="margin">Ioh. 30. 20, 21.</note> This causeth joy; This causeth bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to come to the Word,<note place="margin">1 Iohn. 3. 21.</note> boldness before God, boldness also to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men (let men say what they will,<note place="margin">Acts 23. 1.</note> we care not, if our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
witness truly on our sides) yea, boldness against the Devil, who
will lay much to our charge, sifting us to the full: O thou art a
damned Creature, will he say: No, Satan; yes, an horrible sinner,
and who hast deserved Hell fire: I grant (Satan) but Christ Jesus hath
paid my debt, and delivered me; If thou shalt scape Hell, yet thou
shalt never get to Heaven (will he say) for none come there but such as
keep the Law: O Christ hath kept it for me! But he hath dyed but
for a few, whereof thou art none; yes, I am: He dyed for none, but
such as truly believed in him, so dost not thou: Yes, I do believe,
and do lay hold on his gracious promises: But Christ dyes for
none, to whom he gives not power to become new Creatures, so art
not thou: Hereunto will a good conscience answer boldly, and so put
Satan to flight.</p>
                  <p>This differs from a bad quiet conscience,<note place="margin">Wherein it differs from a bad quiet conscience.</note> that comes from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their danger (as a blinde man standing before a Canon) this
out of knowledge of Gods Word; This is quiet upon examination,
that because never examined; This is quiet upon good grounds, that
upon nothing but upon bear conceits; This hath joy adjoyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
which that hath not: That leaves one in deadness, this quickens

of Gods love, and the pardon of sin through Christ, but
cannot hold it firm and fast; and this not in the beginning of their
conversion onely, but after they hold it with a wavering hand, so
doubtful and full of fears, because of their unworthiness, and the
greatness of the mercy, so that ever anon they are to seek, and ready
to faint: And for the other, their heart witnesseth the true hatred of
all sin, and care to please God in all things, but herein they think
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:65522:263"/>
they do nothing as they should, and that they can do no good, and
even when they have done duties very carefully, yet are they still
troubled, as if they did all for fear of pain, and Hell, and not for the
love of God, or out of self-love in hope of Heaven, and to save
their souls: And because they finde some corruptions and rebellions,
they think that these spoil all their duties, and that they themselves
are vile wretches, yea, though they hate them deadly, yet this doth
not satisfie them, they hate them not so much as they should. Again,
they are so timerous and fearful, whether they may eat this or that,
or thus much, wear such good apparel, do this or that, go this way or
that, all which notwithstanding are lawful for them, but they are so
afraid to offend God, that they often accuse themselves, &amp;c. This
is a good conscience, though not so setled as were to be desired, and
as the other is: This may appear by these Notes;</p>
                  <p>Such would not part with the comfort they have for the world,<note place="margin">Signs decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof.</note> nor
be utterly out of hope, and are glad when they can believe best:
They resolve to trust in God, and serve him, though he would kill
them; They are humble, and both much and servent in Prayer; They
hang upon the Ministery of the Word, hunger after the Sacrament,
long for the Sabbath, delight in the Saints: There's no Physitian
more welcome to a sick body, then a godly Minister to them in time
of trouble; They walk usually more strictly, then they that have
more comfort, and are more zealous, and more afraid to sin, and
more grieve at sin in others; So that this is a good conscience no less
then the former, Both go to Heaven, the one in sharpness, the other in
sweetness run the way of Gods Commandments;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> They be like to two
Travellers through a Wilderness, or in a dark night, one of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
afraid of nothing, the other of a fearful nature, afraid of every
thing, both which get well through: So do these, the one hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of Gods goodness in not being troubled and tempted, the
other of his power in being upheld, that he is not swallowed up and
overcome of fear and grief: O that there were many such conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!
And yet it cannot be denyed, but that the other is better, as
having more comfort in themselves, and being more fit to do good
unto others, and yet they may scape some checks the others may
meet with, as <hi>Peter;</hi> yea, God seems more to tender these then those;
as a Father having two Children, both beloved of him, the one sick,
the other in health, is most careful of him that is sick, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover:
To have a tender conscience, checking us for the least sin (idle
words, vain thoughts, and the like) as <hi>Davids,</hi> for curting off the lap
of <hi>Sauls</hi> Garment,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24. 5.</note> is a singular blessing, and therefore to obtain it,
we must both see the odiousness of sin, judging aright thereof, and
must bring our hearts to mourn even for the smallest sins.</p>
                  <p>1. Let every man examine himself whether he hath a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
or not,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> whether art thou assured of the pardon of thy sins?
whether doth thine heart bear witness that thou hatest all sin, and art
truly desirous to please God in all things, as well great as small, secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as openly? at least in the deep sence of thy misery, art thou wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:65522:263"/>
under it as an intollerable weight? hearing of the onely remedy,
dost thou long after it above all the world? art thou as willing to turn
from sin, as to have sin forgiven; to take up his yoke, as to be refreshed
by him? If not, thy case is fearful; What have we, if we have not
this?<note place="margin">The great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> Its our duty then to labor for it, and not rest till we obtain it;
What may not incite us hereto? It procures Joy, Peace, Comfort,
Boldness before God and men; such are bold to pray unto God, bold
to crave others to pray for them:<note place="margin">See Pro. 14. 10</note> Its comfortable in prosperity,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 18.</note> a
sweet companion at home and abroad, night and day; its a sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in adversity, like a good wife by her kindeness chearing her
husband when he comes home, who hath been much turmoild abroad,
another <hi>Simon</hi> to bear a piece of our cross, yea in the greatest crosses,
this assureth us, that yet God is our Father: he visits us in love, he
will assist us, and at last deliver us: Its a Castle of comfort, an armor
of proof, a continual feast, an Heaven upon earth: It makes a man em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the flames, kiss the stake, and being in the fire, accounts as if he
were on a bed of Roses: In death its comfortable when all things
else forsake us; then when our eyes are shut up, yet through this we
shall with <hi>Steven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 7. 56.</note> see Christ Jesus ready to receive us, and shall say,
<hi>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace:</hi> In the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it will make us lift up our heads with joy, when we shall see
our Savior Christ come to receive us into his heavenly kingdom: O
they that have a good conscience should make much of it, as of their
jewel, and labor to keep it: It may be easily lost, and is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
as may be seen in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first part of it,<note place="margin">How it is kept</note> namely, The assurance of our Salvation is kept
by daily renewing our Confessions, Supplications and Thanksgivings:
To this end we must labor to know the will of God, and daily to
grow in knowledge, by our diligent perusal of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The 2 part of it, namely, our care to please God is kept &amp; maintained
by a daily and constant resolution not to offend God, and so we must
both strive and watch against our frowardness, worldly-mindedness,
&amp;c. and covenant and vow to do the will of God to the uttermost of
our power: Hereupon we must walk carefully, as in the presence of
God, avoiding all occasions of sinning, &amp; using all good means to keep
us in a good course publiquely and privately, being diligent and careful
in our particular calling, to the glory of God, and good of our brethren.</p>
                  <p>2. This reproveth those that having a good conscience, fail as
much in laboring to keep it,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as the World doth in not laboring to
obtain it: How do Christians go on carelesly, without renewing
their exercises of Faith and Repentance, and so their assurance is
to seek, or else hold it at a venture, and coldly? our worst day in
the week might be better then our Sabbath, had we but the grace to
use our time aright: O how many are careless, watch not, give way
to their lusts? therefore fall into many evils, and so wound their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
very often, which is dangerous. A place often wounded or
hurt, will not at last be healed: We dishonor God much, disquiet our
consciences, give evil example to others by our frowardness, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:65522:264"/>
worldliness, hard dealings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it cometh, that the Word
pincheth us, evil tidings amaze us, we are loath to dye, and the day
of Judgement is fearful to us.</p>
                  <p>3. This may encourage and comfort those that have good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
though they be timerous: What, God shews mercy, even to
men unworthy, and though thy sins be many and great, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hast thou
to deal with him that's able to pardon them: Lose not that thou
hast; when we lose good consciences, all Gods graces diminish and
vanish away, neither can we thrive any whit, as is seen by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
But nothing can do us hurt as long as our consciences hold
good; then are we fit to live, and fit to dye; fit for the Word and
Sacrament, fit for death and judgement: Thus of the kindes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and so of conscience in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having a good conscience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is to accompany the zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our Faith.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> Now of the Words in particular,
whereof I have laid down their coherence with the former, and from
whence may be noted, That a godly conversation in all things, is to
be joyned to a bold and zealous profession of our Faith; to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and profession,<note place="margin">See Iosh. 1. 8.</note> gifts, utterance, and the like, we must adde a
good life;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> these two be two Twins (St. <hi>Paul</hi> often joyns them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
neither must they be parted,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 17.</note> saying and doing,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 22.</note> the tongue and
hand must accompany one another.</p>
                  <p>Reasons hereof may be these:<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. God expecteth of us, that where
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he reveals the knowledge of his will, that we adde obedience, or
else we shall be beaten with more stripes:<note place="margin">Luke 12. 47.</note> Where God findes this,<note place="margin">Isa 41. 8.</note> he
delights in it, as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is called, <hi>The friend of God;</hi> in
<hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 14.</note> whom he calls, <hi>A man according to his own heart;</hi> so in <hi>Joh,</hi>
in <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 1. and 58.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we finde the same commended: The
contrary God loaths,<note place="margin">Ezek. 14. &amp; 33</note> as in his own people, whom he did again and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> again advertise hereof. 2. This will prove our profession sound, and
not hypocritical (for hypocrites go a great way,<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9</note> but its onely Faith
that purifieth the heart) and that our knowledge is not swimming in our
brain,<note place="margin">Iames 2. 18.</note> but sound and saving knowledge, purging both heart and life,
when we dare compact with any other, and say, <hi>Shew me thy Faith by</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <hi>thy works,</hi> as I can. 3. This not onely Gods children look for, when
we have got knowledge, and come forward in profession more then
before, then we should live answerably, that they may boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with us, but the common sort of the world also, they expect
it, for though they will take liberty themselves, yet they look that
we Ministers and Professors of Religion, should lead a strict life in
all things: If we do otherwise, we shall hear of it; and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are beholding to them for this (though they do it of no good
minde) and may make good use thereof to look to our selves, as questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless
<hi>Abraham</hi> did, when in the matter of variance which arose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and <hi>Lot,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>For that the Canaanite and Perizzite were then in the</hi>

                     <hi>Land.</hi> 4. Its an honor to our profession, when with <hi>Job,</hi> we dare bid
our adversary write a book against us;<note place="margin">Iob 31. 35.</note> and the contrary is a disgrace,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 14.</note>
not to our selves onely, but to our profession, yea, our Religion it self
in the account of the wicked, whereat they blaspheme, yet ought
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:65522:264"/>
not they to judge ill of all for the fault of some, but especially of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it self, though the professors thereof were naught: No man
blames the Trade for the fault of the Tradesman, nor all for the fault
of some, yet here they do it, when they see men make a shew of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but denying the power thereof: If professors differ not in their
lives from others, it makes the world think that there's nothing in
profession, and yet they may perceive some few walk without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh some,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that having good knowledge, and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ready to speak, yea, and to censure and blame that that is not good,
and are very forward in profession, yet halt foully in their lives; as the
Brownists, that are very hot, and so holy, as they not onely censure
others, but condemn the Church it self, not onely as impure, but as
no Church, and yet themselves, besides that, they are Proud, Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Obstinate (not to speak of their living out of any Church, and
their spending their Sabbath) they foully sin against the second Table;
they borrow what they can, not caring to pay again, are breakers of
their Word and Promise, think to live of other mens labors, and yet
that herein they should be born with, as being extraordinary persons,
they would say, in being idle and negligent in their callings; yea, there
are some of them which will swear, steal, and break the Sabath: A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Generation.</p>
                  <p>2. It reproveth such among our selves,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> which place all Religion in
hearing Sermons, and talking, as some servants do, which yet perform
not the duties of their calling, are idle, untrusty, lazy, stubborn, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient,
as if all should be born with because of their hearing ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
whereas on that very ground more is to be lookt for at their
hands: And this is grown to such a pass, that many of the common
sort of people say, of all they will not meddle with these Bible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenches
(of which before) Is not this a good report you have brought
upon the Word? yea, many godly Christians are weary of such
(not but that I know there be godly servants of both Sexes, that have
learned to shew the fruit of their hearing by all good carriage in their
particular calling, and are as jewels to them they be with, but these
be rare) Do these things agree? as well as Harp and Harrow: Doth
God take pleasure in this, that you should hear his Word, and yet not
minde to be guided thereby? How can you approve that there's any
more in you then in Hypocrites and Reprobates? can you shew your
Faith by your works? Dare you bid your adversary write a Book
against you? Do you not set men off from Religion, and make them
speak ill? You all that usually resort hither to the Word, I bescech,
to shew the fruits of it when you come home; your neighbors look
for it, your lives be pryed into, it may do you good; we see your faces
onely, and think well, that you will hear, but your neighbors they
see your lives, and God seeth your hearts; and if your faces were
like Angels, and your hearts corrupt, and lives unreformed, you
shall have your portion with Devils. And here I think it requisite to
speak of an abuse amongst us, that they which bring in here (because
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:65522:265"/>
of the concourse of people) their commodities to sell, raise the prizes,
and sell dearer then in any of the Market Towns round about us,
whereby they wrong the poor here, and raise the prizes elsewhere (for
if a price be up, its a president straight) yea, and also raise an evil name
on the Gospel: I do not mean yet that Christians going to Market
are bound to sell at lower rates, then the ordinary, though I take them
so bound at home in dear times to their own poor Neighbors, yet is
it not the part of a Christian to be the raiser of prizes, especially in dear
times; Its indeed a note of a wicked worldling.</p>
                  <p>3. This rebuketh even good Christians that walk not so wisely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them that be without as they ought,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> nor yet so strictly in their
lives, but are too forward, hasty, strict in their dealing, slack in paying
their work-folks, are careless of their words, &amp;c. O let all such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
themselves the Servants of God, shew forth the same by all
good conversation in their particular Callings: Thou must not be a
zealous woman, and yet an unquiet wife; a zealous man, and yet a
cruel husband; a zealous yong man or maid, and yet an unfaithful
Servant; a zealous man, and yet a false dealer in your Shops and Trades.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good]</hi> This is fitly added,<note place="margin">A godly man will stand by the truth.</note> and well required, for one of wicked
life will never stand to the truth, but fall from it, for Heresie is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
usually of foul sins, but a godly man will stand most to the
truth.</p>
                  <p>They that speak evil of you, as of evil doers] <hi>Here note, That</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wicked are very apt and much bent to speak ill of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:<note place="margin">The wicked are apt to speak ill of Gods servants.</note>
Thus <hi>Elias</hi> was said to trouble <hi>Israel, Elisha</hi> termed a mad
fellow, and called bald-head; <hi>Micaiah</hi> said, that he never prophesied
good; and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that he raved; so <hi>Steven</hi> was said to have bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemed,
as <hi>Paul</hi> to be a pestilent fellow; nay, the perfection of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
Christ himself was most foully spoken of, termed a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,
a friend of publicans and sinners, one that had a Devil, &amp;c.
Thus was it in the Primitive Church; thus is it still: If the godly
do any thing amiss, how do they toss and encrease it? If they do but
groan under an infirmity, they will be sure to set that abroach against
them; if they know nothing, they will devise some evil of them,
or if they hear of any from others, though never so unlikely, or on
never so a bad ground, yet shall it go for payment, and currant; yea,
though they can make their own vices go under the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
yet they will call their vertues by the name of vices: If zealous,
then hot and rash; if couragious in a good cause, then stomackful;
if patient, then blockish; if wise in their matters, then subtle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;
if diligent in their place, very officious, busie, medlers, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
if they run not to the same excess with others, then precize
fools, &amp;c. Thus even for their godliness do they speak evil of them,
and so call light darkness, and darkness light.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Gods people must walk wonderful warily.</p>
                  <p>2. They must not think it over-strange,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> nor be discouraged, if
notwithstanding all their care of well-doing, they be ill spoken of.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> We must not readily believe of men that have carried themselves
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:65522:265"/>
well, all that we hear; but try it out, ere we censure, or change our
minde.</p>
                  <p>4. For ill speakers;<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> Its a woful badge of <hi>Ishmaels</hi> generation, that
shall be shut out of Heaven,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 20.</note> and of Satans brood,<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 15.</note> who accuseth the
Brethren: Cursed are they,<note place="margin">Iude, verse 14.</note> God hath appointed a time to judge them
for their cruel speakings.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the world will not only speak ill of Gods Servants, but do ill
to them, slay them, as <hi>Cain</hi> dib <hi>Abel;</hi> imprison them and pinch them, as
<hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Micaiah;</hi> cast them into a dungeon, as the people did <hi>Jeremiah;</hi>
into the Lyons den, with <hi>Daniel;</hi> spoil them of their goods, as those
in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. rack them, torment them, torture them; even such as
the world is not worthy of, and that for their good works; so <hi>Herod</hi>
dealt by <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and thus were the Apostles served, and after,
the Martyrs in the Primitive Church, and since, multitudes under
Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>If therefore we meet with hard dealing, and doing as well as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we must not think it strange: If we can hardly bear a few ill
words, how shall we bear stripes? how Imprisonment, and loss of
all, yea, toturings and death? ye have not yet resisted unto blood, or
undergone the fiery tryal:<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 4.</note> we have infinite cause to be thankful toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for our governors, for if they were so minded as many particular
persons, there would be no peace for any zealous Christian: If I had
authority, will some say, I would hang up all these Puritan knaves, &amp;c.
Neither must we think the worse of those that be troubled, for the
the very best have been thus dealt withal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They may be ashamed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlies mouthes.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> The best way to stop the mouthes of the
world, and to make them think well that they have done otherwise,
is not by goodly great words, but by a good and constant godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
Thus <hi>David</hi> convinced <hi>Saul,</hi> for he spared him, when he could
have once and again killed him: Thus have many who have thought
very hardly of such and such upon reports which they have heard of
them, upon the view of their godly and innocent carriage been much
grieved that they were so far abused:<note place="margin">See Acts 16.</note> Thus were the Martyrs thought
well of by the common people, yea, by great ones, yea, by their
very Jaylors.</p>
                  <p>1. As therefore we would muzzle and stop the mouthes of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
that they may have nothing to say against us, nay, may be
brought to acknowledge and love the truth, and be converted and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God in the day of their visitation, let us live holily and innocently;
else if they finde us halting, we set open their mouthes to speak ill,
continue them in their ill minde and hard conceit, and set them further
off from all goodness: Too too many professors fail this way, either
they fall into foul sins, or live not so christianly, or else at least, with
zeal they are very rash and indiscreet, by every of which, much hurt
hath been done from time to time.</p>
                  <p>2. This sheweth them to be odde persons,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that knowing and seeing
the innocent conversation of Gods Servants, yet cannot be satisfied
nor quieted, but still speak evil of them; a sign of a very bad heart,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:65522:266"/>
who therefore will hate them, because they be good, whereas those
that be but indifferently minded and civil, seeing their good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 12.</note> will think and speak well of them: <hi>Cain</hi> had no other cause
to kill <hi>Abel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> but for his godliness; nor <hi>Ishmael</hi> to mock <hi>Isaac,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the Son of the promise; nor these to speak evil of those,
but because they are godly: Assuredly, a life agreeable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
should stop their mouthes.</p>

reproach,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> whereas its honor to suffer for a good cause: That of the
penitent Thief seems to import so much, we indeed justly, for we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the due reward of our deeds (and so have cause to be humbled)
but this man hath done nothing amiss:<note place="margin">Luke 23. 41.</note> Again, there's no comfort in
suffering for ill-doing, as there's for well-doing. Suffering of it self
is ill and grievous, therefore there had need be somewhat to mitigate
it, but if it be for well-doing, a good conscience will bear it out; its
for Gods sake, its that wherewith all his servants have met, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the conscience takes notice, and that to this there's a reward, none
at all for the other.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those that suffer for their foul offences,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Theft,
Adultery, and the like; howsoever they be punished, yet have they
cause of hanging down the head, not for the punishment, but for the
cause: O how many refusing to be ruled by God and his Word, bring
misery upon themselves and ruine? The Gaols are full, the gallows
catch many: Its a fearful thing when they go to their punishment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently,
and be not ashamed and humbled, its but the forerunner
of fearful judgements: When therefore men have brought themselvs
into trouble justly, their best way is to be humbled, and repent, so
shall they finde favor with God and men: We must avoid evil, as
we would avoid suffering for ill-doing, avoid the sin, if we would
avoid the punishment: We are also to be careful that we suffer not
for Railing, Slandering, Backbiting, Meddling with other folks
matters.</p>

2. This may comfort them that suffer for well-doing;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> its pleasing
to God, they are fellows to the Saints, Prophets and Apostles; the
honor is great, the cause is good, how base or grievous soever the
punishment be: Both <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> and <hi>Barabbas</hi> were imprisoned;
<hi>Achan</hi> and <hi>Steven</hi> stoned; and Witches and Martyrs be burnt; the
cause was not the same, and in the cause the shame lies: If a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
(as <hi>Paul</hi>) be a prisoner, and have chains on him, and being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
why he came there, and is there so used; if he can truly say, Its
neither for Treason nor Fellony, I thank God, but for preaching the
truth of God to the world, then its well; yea, this will quiet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
when he knows its Gods cause, who will take care of him,
strengthen him, and receive him to glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the will of God be so,]</hi> Heres the other Reason: We must be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and comfortable in suffering for well-doing, for its Gods will it
should be so. Here note, that</p>
                  <p>No affliction or persecution comes to us,<note place="margin">No affliction comes to us but by Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will.</note> but by the will of God:
Whatsoever was done to our Savior Christ, was done by Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
counsel; not an hair falls from our heads without our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father:<note place="margin">Acts 2. 23. and 4. 28.</note> Christ foretold <hi>Peter</hi> of his bands before they came,
and so <hi>Agabus</hi> forewarned <hi>Paul</hi> of his,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 17, 18.</note> which sheweth that they came
by the will of God.<note place="margin">Acts 21. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> How can this be by the will of God, seeing its a wicked thing, and
displeasing to God that his servants should be persecuted for well doing, and he
hath both forbid it, and will punish the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> As it comes from the Devil and persecutors,<note place="margin">How far God hath an hand therein.</note> its a sin, and
they do wickedly, and its forbid, but God hath an hand in it so far forth
as it is good, and he that brought light out of darkness, can and doth
bring good out of the evil of the wicked: They intend evil, but God
good, as in <hi>Jobs</hi> losses; so in crucifying Christ, <hi>Judas,</hi> the High
Priests, the Jews, Soldiers and <hi>Pilate</hi> did evil, yet all this was by the
will of God, even so far forth as it was the mean of our Salvation,
and thereupon <hi>Peter</hi> that gave counsel against it,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23.</note> was rebuked sharply;
so in the affliction of Gods children by the ungodly, the devil and they
of spite punish them for their goodness, and to discourage them quite,
but God wills this for many good reasons;<note place="margin">Iames 1. 12.</note> as, to try his, that they
which be approved might be known,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note> and to exercise and try their faith
and patience, and shew, that they serve not in shew, and for wages; to
confirm the truth, not for it self, for their sakes which are weak ones,
and to leave the others inexcusable; to manifest the wickedness of the
wicked, and make way for the manifestation of the glory of Gods
justice in plaguing them, as the glory of God is made manifest by
the constant and patient suffering of the Righteous, which they could
never have done of themselves.</p>
                  <p>1. Heres a comfort to Gods servants,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that we are not left here to the
will of the Devil and wicked men, to do what they list against us:
O no, they are set their bounds, beyond which they cannot pass: The
Devils could not enter into the Swine without permission, nor go one
whit further with <hi>Job</hi> then God gave Commission: A Sparrow falls
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:65522:267"/>
not to the ground without his providence,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 31.</note> and we are of more value
then they: The Lord appoints out our troubles, and measures them;
they shall not be as little as we would, for then should they be too little
(our tender nature loathing troubles, and being unwilling to undergo
the same) nor so great as our adversaries would (for then would they
be too great) but as God will:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The wicked are but the Lords drudges
to scour us and make us bright; They are his Landresses to wash us
white, not so little as we should be never the better, nor so much as
should rend the Lords linen.</p>
                  <p>2. When we be ill dealt with in word or deed by the men of the
world,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> we should sit down quietly and bear it: Its the will of God
it should be so, and he doth all things in infinite wisdom, and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the good of his; accordingly when <hi>Paul</hi> would needs go to
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 21. 15.</note> where he was to be in great danger, his friends said, <hi>The
will of the Lord be done;</hi> thou mayest say, If the Lord hath sent this to
try me, I pray God strengthen me; if to chasten and purge me, then
to awaken me out of security and love of the world: I thank God
for it, if he will any way have glory by me, I am glad, blessed be God,
its his will, I am content to wait upon him; not but that we may with
our Savior and the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> plead our innocency, as also use law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means for our freedom, if God see it good.</p>
                  <p>3. But yet let the wicked think never the better of themselves,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> nor
look ever the more to be freed from punishment, because its Gods
will, for they do it to no such end, and therefore he will cast the rod
into the fire when he hath chastened his children, as he did by <hi>Ashur,</hi>
and the enemies he used to punish his people: Did <hi>Judas,</hi> or the Priests
and Jews, aym at the Salvation of the world in Christs death? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less; Covetousness drave on the one, malice the other: If
God brought good out of it, what thanks to them? He is to be praised
for his goodness, they to be plagued for their sin.</p>
                  <p>4. We must not bring trouble upon our selves,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> for in that we can
have no comfort, but if God bring us into it, we may comfortably

There was no guile found in him, none could accuse him of sin; nay,
he was the light and glory of the world, yet suffered he gross things:
We then, though never so just and innocent, must not think much if
we suffer altogether without cause: Its the better, its but as Christ
did.</p>
                  <p>But alas,<note place="margin">Use.</note> we are very faulty before God, and deserve far greater

that all Hypocrites (not to speak of Turks, Jews, and Papists) which

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:65522:268"/>
and to make up all, it will increase their torment, to think that
they had offer made of Christ, and yet had not the grace to apprehend
it; that they were so near, and yet missed, and that some that sate with
them were converted and are now in Heaven, and they careless or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
are now in irrecoverable damnation: This will make them gnash
their teeth, gnaw their tongues, &amp; curse themselves and the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were born: Let such see, feel, confess, and fly to Christ, there
being no other way of Salvation besides him. I come to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
propounded.</p>
                  <p>The first concerneth the time,<note place="margin">All Christs sufferings make up one perfect suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> how often he suffered, Once: Its true,
Christ suffered throughout his whole life, and that diversly, but all
make up one perfect suffering; and he suffered so, as at once he finished
al, never to suffer again, wherein his suffering is opposed to the sacrifices
of the Law, which were continually renewed, because of their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note>
whereas he suffered once for all, for being God as well as man,
he both endured the infinite wrath of God, and besides, his person was
of such infinite worth, as gave such value to his sufferings, as fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the justice of God.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> who make Christs sufferings imperfect
two ways, namely, by teaching that we our selves must suffer the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our sins (hence are all their masses, penances, pilgrimages, alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds,
and charitable Works, to take away the punishment of their
sins after Baptism) and by their renewing of Christs Sacrifice in the
Mass, which is (as they say) a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the sins of the
quick and dead: Their distinction of bloody and unbloody is but a
shift.</p>
                  <p>2. This is a wonderful comfort to all Gods children,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that our debt
is so fully dischaarged, that there's nothing remaining for us to suffer.
Thus of the first.</p>
                  <p>The second concerneth the quality of the person which suffered:<note place="margin">The quality of the person that suffered.</note>
He was that just one, the Lamb of God, which was undefiled and
without spot,<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26.</note> conceived by the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
had he not been such a one, he could not have been our Savior:
Though he was innocent, yet were our sins imputed to him; and
though we have not suffered, neither of our selves have Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
yet as verily as he had pain and sorrow, we shall have mercy
and Salvation through him: what can be more comfortable? Thus
of the second.</p>
                  <p>The third concerneth the persons for whom he suffered,<note place="margin">For whom Christ suffered</note> 
                     <hi>The unjust,</hi>
not the Devil nor Reprobates, but for the Elect, which yet are by
nature unjust and wretched, servants of sin, and children of wrath,
as well as others: He hath suffered for them that be never so unjust,
provided they feel their misery, and have course unto him for
help.</p>
                  <p>1. Then,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> for them that be in great distress for their sins, and think
they be so many and so great, that they cannot or shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,
let them be comforted, Christ came to dye for the unjust, to
call sinners to repentance, to seek and save that which was lost: If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:65522:269"/>
weary you will come unto him,<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29.</note> as he invite you, you shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed:<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 17.</note>
                     <hi>Though their sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wooll: Paul</hi> was a great sinner, yet
forgiven.</p>
                  <p>2. Let such,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as bad as they be, yet come to Christ, and be truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
He came to save such as thou art, as <hi>Mary Magdalene, Zacheus,</hi> the
Jaylor, and such others: His mercy on them, may put thee in hope,
and provoke thee to seek unto him. Thus of the third.</p>
                  <p>The fourth,<note place="margin">Why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffered.</note> Why he suffered for sins, for our sins, to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
for they onely are our wo; our sins caused all Christs sorrow,
and his sorrow is our happiness. Thus of the fourth.</p>
                  <p>The fifth,<note place="margin">To what end he suffered.</note> To what end he suffered, <hi>that he might bring us to God:</hi>
Ever since <hi>Adams</hi> fall we are gone from God, and born strangers, nay
enemies to God, and therefore further and and further off from God,
and are gone to the Devil indeed: Now Christ by his death recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles
us to God, and him to us, and makes a blessed peace, so as we may
look up to him as to our Father, and come into his presence with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
He also gives us grace by his holy Spirit to be renewed, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and so to do works pleasing unto God, and when we dye,
brings our souls to God, as afterwards possesseth both body and soul
of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>1. Then how infinitely are we bound to God?<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> how welcome
should Christ Jesus be to us all? One would think all should flock un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, for as none are with God, but such as came by him, so neither
shall there be: All that mourn for their sins, come to him, believe in
him, and obey him, he will bring them to God; such as continue in
their enmity against God, shall for ever be separated from him: Many
hope to go to God, that were never reconciled to him through Christ,
nor sought after it, but its as possible for a dog, for the Devil to enter
into Heaven, as for us, without being reconciled to God by faith in
Christ: Is it not lamentable that Christ should have so few that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and search after him, nay, that reject him, being offered again and
again!</p>
                  <p>2. How welcome faithful Ministers should be to the world;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> The
worst hurt we wish you, is but to bring you to God, we are appointed
Christs instruments herein, we must Preach him, and perswade you
to embrace and believe in him, by whom you may be brought unto
God; we have a worthy task and work, and so must not either be idle,
or by false teaching, and wicked living, drive you from Christ, but be
faithful, that your Salvation may be our Crown; yet of all persons
and kindes of people, the world thinks we may be best spared, and
are unto most,<note place="margin">Isa. 2. 2.</note> of all others most unwelcome:<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 40, 45.</note> But not alone Ministers,

                  <p>Our Savior suffered not onely in body and soul things intollerable,<note place="margin">That Christ must have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so did.</note>
but he also dyed, gave up the ghost, as all the Evangelists set down,
and other Scriptures testifie, as they also that speak of Christs blood,
of his offering himself a Sacrifice for our sins, of his bearing our
sins on his Body on the Tree,<note place="margin">Isa. 53. 9.</note> and the like:<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> This was prefigured of
all the Sacrifices of the Old Law; The Prophets also foretold that
he should be slain: Neither could it have been otherwise, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he been a Savior for us, for our sins deserved death, and God had
pronounced that death should be the reward thereof: This his death
was voluntary,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> accursed (as we had deserved it) for our sins, and for
a common good.</p>
                  <p>Which meets with that wicked opinion of the Jews, that neither
think it voluntary, nor that it is a propitiatory Sacrifice for sin, as it is
indeed, and wherein our happiness lyeth, and without which we must
all have perished for ever.</p>
                  <p>The benefits ensuing to us hereby are divers:<note place="margin">The benefits ensuing by Christs death.</note> 1. We are delivered
hereby from all kindes of evil, from the first and second death, and
all forerunners of both,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 7.</note> and from our sins the cause of all; Its the

See <hi>Luke 1. 71, 74. Col. 2. 15. Heb. 2. 14. 1 John</hi> 3. 8. So from
the second death, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. Gal.</hi> 3. 13. as from the first, so far forth
as its a punishment and piece of the curse, and the nature of it is
changed to believers, for whom Christ hath dyed; its become a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
without a sting, yea a blessing, as being hereby freed from sin,
and not before: Hereby the soul is let out of the prison of this body,
into the liberty of Gods Servants, and put into the possession of life:
Hereby also the body is freed from all toils, labors, infirmities, and
pains, waiting in the Grave for an happy and glorious resurrection:
In which respect death is termed a sleep, an advantage to the Saints,
and is better in the day wherein they were born: So from all fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
hereof, which are curses, plagues and punishments, in body,
minde, goods, and name, all which Christ hath born; what crosses
we meet withal, they are to further our Sanctification and Salvation,
but not punishments for sin, or parts of Gods judgement, as they be
to the wicked. 2. We are hereby made partakers of all good, God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
reconciled to us (which is more then to have our sins and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
quite removed) yea, and sheweth us the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
not as <hi>David,</hi> who though he staid his wrath from <hi>Absolom</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the hearts of all that believe in him, to enable them to dye unto sin,
and to mortifie their lusts more and more.</p>
                  <p>This is a singular comfort to all that believe in Christ,<note place="margin">Use.</note> who onely
partake of the benefits of his death; we need not fear Hell, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
nor any enemy of our Salvation, nor any curse or punishment
in this life, all shall be for our good; we need not fear the first death,
but rather have cause to desire it: O the happiness of such! God is
at peace with them, all Creatures in Heaven and Earth are their friends,
they have right to whatsoever they have, little or much, therefore
may they rejoyce: O happy that ever we were born, what pains so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have taken to come to the knowledge of Christ Jesus, by
whom we obtain such unspeakable things! whatsoever the world
esteemeth of believers, they are the onely happy persons in the world,
yea, we shall have power to mortifie our strongest corruptions and
lusts, fear it not, beg it, and use the means, if all these be put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
O how happy is a Christian! who can value his riches? On the
contrary, they that have not their part in Christs death, are most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable;
their sins are not removed, they lye under them, so under
the curse of God in this world, and the world to come; so in danger
of the first death, which will rend the soul and body asunder, that the
soul may be cast out into Hell; so also of the second: O that such
would labor for their part in Christ, Christ came into the world,
Christ is now Preached and offered unto us, men be in a woful case,
and are told of it, and yet how few regard to embrace Christ, how few
customers hath Christ? one would think that all that hear of Christ,
should be heartily glad of him, and embrace and flye unto him; but
alas, most men for profits, pleasures, or love of their vile lusts, are
content to let go Christ, and he lies as a dead commodity, and they
that bring him to the world be unwelcom, and so indeed few have
part in Christ.</p>
                  <p>The consideration hereof, might make us mourn for our sins, the
cause of Christs death, might be a corrasive to eat our sin, and make
it odious to us, might make us serve God zealously and faithfully
all our days, yea, to suffer for his sake, and rather to dye with the
Martyrs, then any way to dishonor him; and besides, to labor to
finde the vertue of Christs death, working mightily in us the death of
sin, and sinful lusts. Thus of his death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But quickned by the Spirit,]</hi> Now of his Resurrection: His body and
soul that had been sundred, were by the power of his Godhead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united,
and he made alive, so continuing with his Disciples until his
ascension into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Touching it, consider, that it was so, the Reasons thereof, the
place, maner and time, with the benefits flowing from thence, and
the duties thereupon to be performed.</p>
                  <p>That Christ rose again,<note place="margin">Christ rose again from the dead.</note> is so plain, that none needs doubt thereof:
The Angels that rolled away the stone, the Soldiers that watched the
Sepulchre, <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and the other <hi>Mary</hi> that came to see the
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:65522:270"/>
Sepulchre, the two Disciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> the eleven Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, &amp;c. all were witnesses hereof: So his appearances were
many, as to <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> then to her and that other <hi>Mary,</hi> then to
two Disciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> then to them all save <hi>Thomas,</hi> then both
to <hi>Thomas</hi> and the others; another time to <hi>Cephas,</hi> another time to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of them at the Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 5.</note> as at another to Five hundred Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
at once; so when he was to ascend, he was taken up in the
sight of all those there present; all which are so many evidences of
his Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Reasons:<note place="margin">Why he rose again.</note> 1. That it might appear he had fully discharged our
debt. 2. Because being the Son of God, and Author, and Lord of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
life, it had been unmeet, nay, it was impossible he should be held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of Death.<note place="margin">Acts 2. 24.</note> 3. By reason of the second part of his Priesthood, which
was yet to fulfil: One part was, to offer himself a Sacrifice Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
to God, for the sins of his people, this he did by his death; now
the other is,<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 28.</note> to make intercession for his Church, and to apply the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his death to those for whom he dyed: This he could not have
done, if he had not risen again.</p>
                  <p>The maner:<note place="margin">The maner of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> When they had rolled a great stone to the door of the
Sepulchre, sealed it, set Soldiers to watch, yet he rose: They could
as well have hindered the rising of the Sun in the Firmament, as his
rising; <hi>An Angel was sent that caused a great earthquake, and rolled away
the stone, &amp;c.</hi> No counsel or strength can hinder the work of the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>Place:<note place="margin">The place from which he rose.</note> The same where he was laid, which was by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to avoid cavils, in a new Sepulchre hewen out of a rock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
never man had been laid.</p>
                  <p>Time:<note place="margin">When he rose.</note> It was the third day, early in the morning, on the first day
of the week, the third day, as was foretold by Christ himself, for he
was buried the evening before the Sabbath, and rose the day after;
so long between, to approve the truth of his death, and no longer,
that he might see no corruption: Early in the morning, to shew that
he was the light of the world, the Son of Righteousness, a light to be
revealed unto the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Psal. 16. 10.</note> one that was to lighten every one that
came into the world, namely, that is lightned, even us that are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
darkness it self; from hence must every man fetch light: On the
first day of the week, for so God disposed of it: This first day was
answerable to the first day of the world; it was the morrow after the
Jews Sabbath: As he began to make the world the first day of it,
when before it was not, so now that it was decayed and corrupted by
sin, he now came to make it up again, which he did by his Death and
Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Reason of the alteration of the Sabbath,<note place="margin">Why the Iewish Sabbath was changed.</note> from the Jews
Sabbath to the day following, which is ours, to keep a memorial, as of
the Creation of the world, so especially of the renewing of the world,
by the work of Redemption; and as the first Sabbath continued from
the Creation to Christs Resurrection, so no question ought this to
abide to the worlds end.</p>

there's no evil remaining: They shall have power given them to
walk in holiness of life, as the <hi>Syon,</hi> graft into a stock, receiveth juice

Resurrection: Contrarily, miserable is the case of the wicked; their
debt is all on the File against them, they shall rise but to their cost and
smart, to a dreadful judgement, when they shall stand trembling, and
wishing that the hills might fall on them, on them the second death
shall have power: Now they lie snorting, neither will be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

his sufferings, and had a good end of them, so shall all that suffer
for his sake: Now, lest this should be doubted of, he sheweth how it
cometh to pass, namely, by the help, assistance and power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God; who as he shewed himself mightily in Christs person, so
hath and will in his members: and for instance, he looks back a great
while ago, when long before Christs coming, the Spirit shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the confusion of the wicked and disobedient, and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and deliverance of Gods servants; as <hi>Noah,</hi> whom as this Spirit
enabled to preach the to wicked world, so they disobeying and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, the same Spirit preserved and saved in the common destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
And therefore if the Spirit of God shewed himself so in the
people of God, for their good so long ago, then we need not fear, but
that he will much more shew himself in and with us, inasmuch as
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:65522:271"/>
now the Spirit is bestowed in a larger and fuller maner, then before
our Saviors coming into the world: Now he reckons this, rather then
any other example, because it was a famous one, both of convicting
the wicked world, and preserving the servants of God in such
a bad time, and because it was so long ago. I come to the meaning
of the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By which</hi> (his Spirit) namely,<note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> his Godhead and Divine Nature,
which raised him from the dead, <hi>He went and preached,</hi> namely, by

that be now and were in <hi>Peters</hi> time Spirits and Souls in Hell, but
when <hi>Noah</hi> preached, were disobedient men and women, when God
seeing the notorious corruption of the times, threatned to destroy the
world with a flood, if they did not repent: To them <hi>Noah</hi> preaching,
both by word, and by deed also, in preparing the Ark, they not being
moved hereat, nor at the long suffering of God, were at the length
drowned, <hi>Noah</hi> onely and his wife, with his three sons, and their three
wives being preserved in the Ark.</p>
                  <p>This Scripture hath suffered (as Mr. <hi>Luther</hi> saith of the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er)
much Martyrdom by false interpretations, and erroneous constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
whereof that of the Papists is most gross.</p>
                  <p>They understand it thus,<note place="margin">How the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them.</note> that Christ being dead, in his soul went
down to the lower parts of the world, where be four several places
together, one above another, <hi>Limbus patrum, Limbus puerorum,</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and Hell, which is the lowest and hottest of all; that Christ
went into <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> to fetch out all the godly Fathers that dyed
from the beginning til his coming, and all such as in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time seeing
the flood come, indeed repented, and went to Purgatory, and had
there suffered all; and so were gone into <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> also, to deliver
the souls then in Purgatory; and into the lowest part, namely Hell, to
Preach to the convicting of the Reprobates there, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But though in truth Christ had done thus (which yet he never did)
this proves no such matter,<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the same</note> will afford no such sence: for 1. By Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
whereunto the word <hi>which</hi> hath relation, is not meant Christs
soul, but his Godhead; not his soul, for then it was, that Christ was
quickned in his soul, or by his soul, but neither can be true; not in
his soul, for his soul never dyed, nor was mortal; not by the soul, for
it was not the soul that raised him again, but the power of God that
joyned them both together, as the Scripture testifieth: and that his
Godhead is hereby meant, will appear by the like places, as <hi>Rom. 1.
3, 4. 2 Cor. 13. 4. 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. where that which our Apostle calls
flesh, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls infirmity; and what he calls the power of God,
our Apostle calls the Spirit, both which are in effect one. 2. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
cannot be meant the Fathers and godly, for he speaks onely of the
disobedient and Reprobate ones. 3. He speaks onely of those that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
lived in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, and no other age of the world. 4. This Prison <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
was an unhappy and miserable place, and not <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom, nor
the place of the Fathers. 5. Even after our Saviors Resurrection, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
our Apostle wrote this, they were then still in Prison, therefore Christ
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:65522:272"/>
had not delivered them, nor fetcht them out, but they that had been
there, were there still: And where they say he went to Preach to the
Reprobates, this will not stand neither; for he speaks here onely of the
Reprobates of <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, and why should Christ in his soul go unto
them, rather then unto any other? Besides, to Preach to them, and do
them no good, nor intend any, is against the nature &amp; end of preaching.</p>
                  <p>But that there are any such places as <hi>Limbus patrum, Limbus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erorum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">That there are no such places as <hi>Limbus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> and <hi>puerorum.</hi>
                     </note>
or Purgatory, the Scripture gives not any inkling. 1. That
the Fathers went to no such place, is certain, but that their souls
loosed by death, went to Heaven; <hi>Jesus Christ, yesterday, to day,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>and the same for ever:</hi> They had the same benefit by Christ (as we)
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> after their death. 2. They also believed in Christ as well as we,
<hi>Abraham saw my day and rejoyced:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 8. 5, 6.</note> They ate the same Spiritual meat, and
drank the same Spiritual drink,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3.</note> and so were partakers of the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of Christ. 3. Their Spirits went to God that gave them; they
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> enter into peace, and so not into the Prison. 4. <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which <hi>Lazarus</hi> was carried by the Angels,<note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 7.</note> was above,<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 2.</note> not beneath,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> an happy, not a miserable place; Christ therefore went not to fetch
them out thence, there being no such place.</p>
                  <p>For Purgatory,<note place="margin">The Popish o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about Purgatory.</note> they say, there's such a place in the brim of Hell,
where the pains be almost as bad as Hell pains, and the fire as hot,
into which are sent the souls of the godly, that dye in faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
but yet have not suffered the punishment of their sins in this
world, therefore must make up their sufferings in Purgatory (for they
teach, that for our sins and punishments both committed before Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,
Christ suffered, but for those after Baptism, though Christ takes
away the sins, yet the punishment must be suffered by our selves, and
that partly in this life by penances, &amp;c. and the rest by suffering in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory;
&amp; that for every sin is due seven years of payment in Purgatory,
and therefore the Pope gives Pardons, sometimes for fifty, sometimes
for an hundred years, &amp;c. and therefore they say Masses for the souls of
them that have been dead many 100 years; and when they have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all their sins, &amp; paid the utmost farthing, then come the souls out;
&amp; after they have been a while refreshed in a fair green field, ful of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
flowers, which is hard by Purgatory, then they go up to Heaven;
notwithstanding, oftentimes through the mercy of the Popes, those pains
are mitigated.<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</note> We say, 1. That as they themselves do not agree about
the place, &amp;c. So neither is it otherwise grounded, but on unwritten
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> verities: The Scriptures mention but two places, whereinto the souls
go immediately after death, Heaven, which is for the godly, and Hell,
which is for the ungodly; for the godly, that they do immediately go
into an happy place,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 29.</note> all the Scriptures sound; with <hi>Simeon,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
in peace, go not to Purgatory, scorching pains; Christ is to them,
as in life,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note> so in death,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8.</note> advantage: Having finished their course, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
there's laid up for them a crown of righteousness:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> They have,
after the dissolution of their earthly Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Iohn 17. 24.</note> a building of God,
an house not made with hand, eternal in the Heavens; Christ hath
prayed for them,<note place="margin">Luke 23. 43.</note> that they may be where he is, even in Heaven:
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:65522:272"/>
The thief on the right hand had as much need to have gone to
Purgatory as any other, yet on that day wherein he dyed, he was
with Christ in Paradice.<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed are they which dye in the Lord,</hi>
saith the Spirit, <hi>for they rest from their labors:</hi> After death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
comes the judgement, that every man shall stick to. Among
all those things which God spake to <hi>Moses,</hi> there's not a word of this;
among all the Sacrifices that God ordained, there were none appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for souls in Purgatory; and amongst all the cleansings and purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of all kinde of impurities of Leprosie and Issues, &amp;c. there's not
a word of this: What, was God so unmindeful of his Church and
people then? Neither is there in all the new Testament any word for
it. 2. What a wretched thing is it to hold, that our sufferings should
satisfie the wrath of God, and punishment of our sins, when the least
sin deserves eternal destruction both of soul and body. And for their
distinction, that Christs death gives power to the pains of Purgatory
to satisfie, is an idle and ridiculous conceit. 3. To say that Christ
should satisfie for our sins, and take them away, but not our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is it not a wicked abuse of Gods justice? where he forgives
the sin, doth he not also forgive the punishment? True, he chastens
his servants, but they are no part of satisfaction of his justice, onely a
means to prevent sin to come, and humble for that which is past; as if
I had a quarrel against a man, I might forgive him, and yet if I see him
in an Appoplexy or Swoon, I may hit him a blow to fetch him again.
The truth is,<note place="margin">Why Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was devised.</note> Purgatory was devised, partly of a blinde and curious
devotion of some Monks, that thought that they that had some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
(as they thought) of goodness, and so dyed, it were no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they should be damned, &amp;c. who were therefore to be purged in
Purgatory, and so come to Heaven; and that seeing most men have
much sin in them, even when they dye, it were unreasonable they
should go straight to Heaven, for no unclean person shall come there,
and therefore they must suffer and be cleansed in Purgatory: Who
doth not see the absurdity of these conceits, when the Scripture saith,
<hi>Whosoever believeth in him shal not be condemned;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 18.</note> &amp; that whosoever dyeth
in the Faith, all their sins and corruptions are done away, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into Heaven: But principally the Pope and his Clergy out of
covetousness, were chief founders hereof; for hereby they did infinitely
enrich themselves, and every where enjoyed the very fat in the Land:
It was devised for the pampering of the living, not the punishing or
purging of the dead: Through their covetousness, meeting with the
peoples ignorance, Purgatory was hatched.</p>
                  <p>But what a cruelty is this of the Pope, who hath power, as he saith,
to deliver as many as he lists out of Purgatory, &amp; yet will suffer so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
so long to lie there frying? But he knows well what he doth; if he
should make it too common, or let out too many, then would the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
care the less, and say, Though I go to Purgatory, yet the Pope of
his clemency will deliver me, and so I mean to give my goods and
lands to my children, and not beggar my posterity by giving them
for Pardons or Masses, &amp;c. Thus indeed their trade would go down.</p>

1. This may stir us up to give thanks to God for his mercy,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
us from those cousenages, and revealing unto us his truth:
We ought to be so much the forwarder in every duty towards the
worship of God, the Ministers maintenance, the poor, &amp;c. you save it
an hundred times over, through the preaching of the Gospel truly: Its
a foul fault in people, that they cannot be content thus to enjoy their
goods &amp; lands, and leave them to their children (which they could not
do) but pull and rake from the Minister, care not how little they allow
him; yea, and are so miserable, as they will scarce allow their part to
keep the house of God upright, or in decent sort, neither give the poor
without grudging, or upon necessity.</p>

                  <p>Neither went he down to Hell to preach to the Reprobates;<note place="margin">That Christ went not down to Hell to preach to the Reprobates</note> for as
its absurd for one soul to preach to another, so preaching is to do some
good, and thereby onely to do hurt is against the end thereof: But,
say they, he onely went and preached experimentally by his presence,
and shewed himself to them to convict them, but they were already
sufficiently convicted, condemned, and put in their place of torment;
if Christ should have gone thither to convict them again, they were
not sufficiently convicted before: But if they say he went to triumph
over the Reprobate there, &amp;c. it may be answered, That he triumphed
on the Cross, and shall triumph over the Reprobates mightily on the
day of Judgement. I proceed unto the Doctrines of the Text.</p>

appear unto all,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that its the Spirit of God which Preacheth in them;
their matter must be sound, and wholly agreeable to the will of God;
and for the maner,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> it must not be with enticing words of man wisdom,
but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power; we must not seek
our selves, but Gods glory in the Salvation of our people: Such as
for their matter Preach contrary to the Word, its not the Spirit of
God which Preacheth in them, but the Spirit of Error; and for the
maner, such as use a dark kinde of Preaching, or curious and quaint
terms, or in such sort as the people cannot understand or profit, do
they woo for Christ, or rather do they not speak for themselves? Such
kinde of Preaching is blasted and cursed of God, and the Preachers
thereof shall have their reward accordingly.</p>
                  <p>2. Let people know,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that when they come to the Word, they come
not to hear such a man (whosoever he be) but to hear what the Spirit
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:65522:273"/>
of God saith to them; a great priviledge: we must therefore prepare
our selves rich accordingly with all reverence and fear (as having to
do with God himself) laying the same to heart, and endeavoring to be
profited thereby, in yielding obedience thereto: O how many come
hand over head, sit sleeping at Church, and are no whit moved with
whatsoever is said? Did we but believe that it were Gods Spirit that
did Preach to us, we would give better heed. If we speak according
to the Word in rebuking you for your sins, you are not to fret, and say,
O some body hath told him hereof, or he doth this of ill will; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 14. 25.</note>
that its Gods Spirit which rebukes you, and that God is
there indeed.</p>

in the Word (as the wicked may be terrified by the threatnings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
They shall come to pass,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> for that the Spirit of truth hath uttered

                  <p>Let the godly have patience,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and wait Gods leisure; and for the

                     <hi>In prison,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The woful condition of the wicked.</note> That is, Hell, the place appointed for the souls of the

                  <p>1. They shall be separate and cast from God, in whose presence stands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

&amp;c. as here, but in torments, howling and wailing, &amp;c. those are
both intollerable and eternal; their souls are presently after death cast
hereinto, as both their bodies and souls, which have been companions
together in sin, shall be on the day of Judgement: And for that though
many be called, few be chosen; and in the parable of the four kindes
of seeds, onely one of them was good; as most of the old world
perished, so shall and have most of every age of the world: <hi>Though

                  <p>O how might this cool the wicked,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> the proudest that live in jollity,
and set all others at nought! Now they are lusty, and swear, and curse,

fools; but the contrary will be seen one day, and that they themselves

that know it not, me thinks they should never be quiet, nor sleep good
sleep, till they know they are delivered from this prison.</p>
                  <p>3. This should make us all,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> not onely careful to save our own souls
out of this place, but to do all our endeavor to save others, especially
them that be committed to us; as, Ministers to preach diligently,

out of the fire; such as do otherwise, are merciless and cruel; so
Magistrates to punish sin zealously, that they might not be condemned

his neighbor: If thou doest them no good, yet shall they wish one

bodily punishment by the flood, as their eternal judgement in Hell,
even for that they were disobedient to the Commandments of God,
and among the rest, to the Ministery of <hi>Noah:</hi> This is aggravated from
the length of Gods patience shewed towards them (though God told
them how long he would wait, yet did not they hereby become the
wiser) and by the real sermon which they had, which was, the
building of the Ark: They had both time and means to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,

                     <hi>A.</hi> It is said, That the earth was filled with cruelty, they are also
termed the world of the ungodly; and its likely that if any had
been openly known to have been good, the Lord would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
them that they should not have perished in the waters with
the rest; yet its possible that even among them that were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there might be some good, and it were hard if we conclude that
all were damned; some were youths, some infants, not capable of sin,
some not born, whereof some might belong to God. Again, it might
be (though not very likely) that some might repent in truth when they
saw the flood come. However, most no doubt were utterly cast away
for ever, yet some might be saved eternally, though they had part in
the bodily punishment; as <hi>Cain</hi> a Reprobate had part in the temporal
deliverance, and yet perished eternally. Hence perceive</p>
                  <p>1. The exceeding and almighty power of God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that was able thus
to take vengeance of the impiety of the world, even of such an infinite
multitude, by such a judgement; theres no power nor counsel against
him: He is the Lord of Hosts, and hath all Creatures in Heaven and

at his command;<note place="margin">See Act 12. 23</note> there's no Creature so mean, which he cannot use to
destroy the very proudest Tyrant: How should this strike terror into
the heart of every wicked man, and make him humble himself at the
footstool of the Lord, and break off his sins by unfained repentance.
The people of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> feared <hi>Herod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. 20.</note> because he could hurt
the Land, who yet himself was worms meat; God can plague and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
a thousand ways: What art thou that rebellest against thy
Maker, the Lord of the whole world, who hath Heaven and Earth,
and Hell at his command, and all Creatures in them? He is able to
plague thee which way soever he will, every hour of the day: He is
able by the greatest, by the meanest also of his Creatures to destroy
thee, as he can also immediately by himself: But if he let all these
alone, he is able to finde enough in thine own bowels to torment thee,
some ill humor in thine own body or bowels to vex and weary thee;
any tooth in thy head may drive thee to extremity of pain,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 5.</note> thine own
thoughts may take away sleep from thee; yea, drive thee into despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
as it befel <hi>Judas.</hi> Most Princes if a great many be in a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
or rebellion, either cannot resist them, or if they could, dare
not put them all to death, for fear of rising, or want of Subjects; its
not so with the Lord, he hath no need of men; if they rebel against
him, he will cut them off, if they be never so many, he fears
not: O let none sin with the multitude, thinking to be hidden
or escape, for God hath judgements enough, and hath prepared
Hell large enough, though there be never so many that rebel against
him.</p>
                  <p>2. The wonderful justice of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and how he hates sin, that
thus revenged it upon the whole world: This is a part of his name;
he will not account the wicked innocent:<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 4, 5.</note> He is a God that hateth and
abhorreth iniquity,<note place="margin">Leut. 26. 14.</note> and hath shewed it in all ages of the world:<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 15.</note> He
hath storehouses of judgements here against the wicked, and hath
prepared for them a prison and place of torment for them hereafter.
This should now make them tremble and fear, hate sin and repent of
it: He hath done justice on the whole world, and dost thou think to
scape? The world makes an Idol of him, all of mercy; such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as this, and that upon the Israelites in the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, shew his justice; and this is such a dreadful example of Gods
justice, as should make all the world to tremble. If we should
see an hundred men executed together, how would it daunt us?
what will it then to consider, that thousands thousands are sent into
Hell?</p>
                  <p>If any shall think that of those which were drowned there might
some be saved eternally,<note place="margin">Two necessary considerations.</note> because oftentimes Gods servants be taken

freedom from outward calamities; howsoever, we must not

voke God hereunto, but yet herein to commend our selves to God,
as which shall not hurt our souls: Though we be wrapt among the

sin of Witchcraft; he who is the Lord of the whole world, and
requireth obedience of all, cannot endure that men should contemn
and disobey the admonitions of his Word, whereby they are called
to repentance: This is mens destruction, see 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 16. Isa. 1. 5.

Most men do what they list, and follow their own lusts,
as if there were no Law, nor any had to do with them; yea, though
God call upon them, and send his Ministers unto them, yet they will
not give their mindes to repentance, but harden their hearts: Oh, those
carry a badge of their destruction, and a mark whither they are going,
a certain forerunner of judgement here, or to be sure of eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

without hope, with the damned spirits in Hell; yea, if God had
taken away his Gospel and Peace from us but within these few years,

the quite contrary;<note place="margin">Isa. 57. 11.</note> O how fearful will their case be, which having
had experience of Gods long suffering these twenty, thirty, forty, fifty
years, yet abide in their old sins? If their judgement was the
greater by the abuse of this patience, then what shall those amongst
us, which have had longer patience, and a thousand times more means?
The time allotted them, an hundred and twenty years, was not above
the third part of the life of a man then, which being compared with
that hath been allotted us, and the usual time wherein men now live,
it will appear, that by way of proportion, we have had far more; and
besides the sermons of the Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles, we
have had faithful sermons from the faithful Ministers of God: Those
of the old world shall rise up in judgement against us, as also <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and shall speed far better then we. O therefore, lets
abuse the patience of God no more,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>but to day, whilest it is called to day,
not to harden our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Oh, do we this the rather, because
God hath set the time how long he will bear with us, which if it
should once be out, it would be then too late for us, he would bear
with us no longer, but would either snatch the Gospel from us,
or us from it by death, or give us over to hardness of heart, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be moved, or to feel our misery, but when it is too late,
as it befel <hi>Esau,</hi> and the foolish Virgins: Therefore it is said
here,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Once the long suffering of God, &amp;c.]</hi> That is, it being out, there was
no longer time to be granted, nor though they had cryed, would
God have heard, and so we may suspect, that there were but a few
(if any at all) which either repented when they saw the flood come,
or whom (though they cryed) the Lord regarded, for that the time set
was then expired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the days of Noah,]</hi> Here <hi>Noahs</hi> name remaining up record, honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
registred: He saith not in the days of any of the Gyants, whose
names are all buried, but in the days of <hi>Noah;</hi> God vouchsafes not so
much as to name them.</p>
                  <p>In the Scriptures the godly are spoken of to their honor,<note place="margin">The names of the godly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to their honor.</note> but the
wicked are either not named at all, or else to their disgrace, and their
brand: <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that made Israel to sin, <hi>Ahab</hi> that sold himself to
work wickedness,<note place="margin">1 King. 15. 34.</note> wicked <hi>Athaliah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Prov. 10.</note> that cursed woman <hi>Jezabel,
Judas</hi> that betrayed him, &amp;c. or with their sins at large to their
eternal reproach: But how sweet is the memorial of the godly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture? as of <hi>Mary Magdalene, Lazarus, &amp;c.</hi> In Stories
also we have the names not onely of famous <hi>Ridley, Latimer, Cranmer,
&amp;c.</hi> but even of meaner men, and not onely of men, but of women
also, yea, and of those, even of poor ones, who are worthily report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of; whereas the names of their persecutors, are either altogether
unknown, or if they be spoken of, as <hi>Bonner, Gardiner,</hi> and others, its
with stopping the nose, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>How may the servants of God be comforted? though haply they are
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:65522:276"/>
mean in the world, yet their names be written in Heaven, and shall
abide, when the names of the wicked shall rot: Labor then to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and godly, that ye may be well reported of alive and dead; else
if ye be wicked, ye shall have an ill report in the Church of God
whilst ye live, and leave a stinking memorial behinde you when ye
are dead, both which are fearful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>While the Ark was a preparing,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The old world then most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, when they should have been by Noahs making of the Ark feared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</note> Another thing whereby their diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is aggravated, that it was even then, while they saw <hi>Noah</hi>
busie in making an Ark, which might have admonished them of the
flood, for he in Faith made it, obeying the Commandment of God:
He believed what God had threatned, but so did not they.</p>
                  <p>1. Note here, That if <hi>Noah</hi> because of the flood threatened, made
an Ark to save himself from it,<note place="margin">Christians must use the means whereby to be freed from Hell and destruction.</note> as God had commanded; its our duty
much more, as I may say, to prepare an Ark, and use the means to
save our selves from drowning in Hell, the pit of perdition. There is
a certain flood of destruction, whereinto all such shall fall, as have
not before got into the Ark, as all that were out of this Ark perished.
The making of this in likelihood, was a matter of great cost, of great
toil, and without doubt he had many a mock for his labor when he
went first about it, and whilest he continued working at it, yet went
he on:<note place="margin">Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance an Ark for the soul.</note> As that was for the body, so are Faith and Repentance for the
soul; whosoever have these shall never perish, but have everlasting life:
For these we must labor, whatsoever pains they cost us; yea, and if
it were to hinder our outward estate hereupon, and expose our selves
to mockings and revilings: Whosoever misseth of these, whatsoever
else they have, shall questionless perish; the word tells it, and we are
to believe it.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes the monstrous folly and madness of the world.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
Gods Ministers, his <hi>Noahs,</hi> preach the flood, and perswade every man
to make ready his Ark; but alas, how few look after any such matter,
nay (as in the old world) they rather mock at those that do, or that take
pains to hear the Word, which is the way to get Faith, or that take
pains to lead a godly life; O these precise fellows, they be so holy,
and these Scripture fellows, they be so holy, as they will be in heaven
ere their bones be cold, &amp;c. whereby it appears, that (as <hi>Lots</hi> sons in
Law about the destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi>) they believe no flood at all,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 14.</note> no
judgement at all to come; or else haply they think it an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to make an Ark at any time, either thinking that some easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and nearer may be found then by Faith and Repentance (as those
that hope to be saved by their good meaning, good prayers, civil life,
&amp;c. which will assuredly deceive them) or that they are easie to be
obtained: Was <hi>Noah</hi> One hundred and twenty years in making an
Ark to save him from drowning in the waters, and can they at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and on the sudden, make an Ark to save them from Hell, and to
get into Heaven; as most hope by <hi>Lord have mercy upon me</hi> to be
saved? But as no doubt, many used sundry shifts to save themselves
when the flood came, and none prevailed but the Ark, so shall it be
with all such: O what if the flood should now come (as it may ere the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:65522:276"/>
morrow) is your Ark ready or not? If it be not, defer the time no
longer: No man knows that he shall live One hundred and twenty
days, or a quarter so long; yet though <hi>Noah</hi> knew he should live so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years, he did not defer the time, delay the making of the Ark: It
will not be done on the sudden, and after this life there's no making
of any;<note place="margin">1 Kings 6. 7.</note> as there was no hewing of timber or stone in the Temple,
but all in Mount <hi>Lebanus:</hi> Look to it therefore betimes, regard nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the costs nor pains you may be put to: Its no matter so you be
saved.</p>
                  <p>2. This may comfort them that have their Ark prepared,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> though
thousands and ten thousands perish, yet they shall not do amiss, but
be preserved and saved as <hi>Noah;</hi> then shall not we weigh what pains
we have taken to make it, to hear the Word, to humble our selves, to
repent, &amp;c. And have not others taken as much pains for transitory
things, that will vanish and never do them good? and though you
have been mockt, yet will the time come, when those mockers will
change their note.</p>
                  <p>Again, in that they saw and heard of this Ark a building, which
ought to have been a real Sermon to them, yet were not moved, their
sin becoming hereby the greater.</p>
                  <p>2. Note,<note place="margin">How useful Examples and occular ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are.</note> That when God addes to his Word Examples, and to
the Ministery real Sermons also, these ought much to prevail, which
when they do not, as well the sin as the judgements of the Delinquents
become the more fearful; for the more means men have, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
not thereby,<note place="margin">See Luk. 17. 32</note> the greater will be their judgement, as our Savior said
of <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.</note> When God threatens to plague wicked
men, it should make them stand in awe, but when they see the same, it
cannot but pierce more: To this end, though God hath left some part
of Scripture in Precepts and Doctrines, yet hath he left most in Story
and Example,<note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> accordingly the Prophets used both: Therefore when
God in his Word exhorts to diligence in laboring after Salvation, and
to lead an holy life, this ought much to move; but when men see
Examples of such people before their eyes,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 10, 11.</note> this ought to move the
more.</p>
                  <p>This condemns the notorious obstinacy of our times,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Word God addes so many examples of his judgements
on wicked men, more by far then we could have lookt for in the days
of the Gospel; as untimely ends upon Drunkards, and notorious
prophane persons, &amp;c. that would take no warning; yea, haply of
a dozen of them which have been in a Town,<note place="margin">Dan. 5. 22.</note> cut off by one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or other, yet who fears? nay, do not others continue in the
same state (as some old Drunkards) without amendment, as other
new ones grow up every day? The like may be said of other sins: <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar</hi>
profited not by the judgements of God on his Father, as most
do not by any judgement on others: What answer have they to make,
and what judgement waiteth them, that have had many examples, and
yet never the better? so of notorious covetous gripers, oppressors,
rakers, how blockishly and fearfully they have dyed, with the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:65522:277"/>
end of their goods? either wofully wasted by drunkards, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
to those that never sweat for them, yea oftentimes to their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
enemies; who seeth not? yet who are moved hereat? let these
look for greater judgements; so when God raiseth up many godly
Christians, that earnestly labor after their salvation, taking great pains
to hear the Word and to live godly, most receive no profit by these real
examples and Sermons, but some mock at them, and think them more
precise then needs; as others are blockish, and are no whit moved
thereby: They might think with themselves when they see some such
take such pains, that there is somewhat in it, some ill to be avoided,
some good to be obtained, some great matter that should move these
people to take such pains; surely (might they say) its not for nothing,
they have business as well as we, which they could tend if a greater
thing were not in the way; its not for nothing that they thus weary
themselves. But most do not understand or consider thus much with
themselves, and yet God hath raised up such as lights to draw on
others; and they that be not won by the Word, nor moved by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the godly, their answer will be fearful: Little do these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
think that those that have travelled by their doors, wet and dry,
and come through their grounds to hear the Word, shall one day be
their Judges; It had been happy for them, if they had dwelt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off.</p>
                  <p>3. In that this ark did betoken the judgement of God to come,<note place="margin">Wicked men fear not Gods judgements.</note> and
yet they feared nothing; Note, that wicked men fear not Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Thus was it with the Sodomites, with <hi>Lots</hi> sons in law, with
the Israelites:<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 16. and 22. 3.</note> This is indeed a token of a wicked man, as being an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of unbelief, Atheism, and hardness of heart, and that they
are mad on their sins;<note place="margin">and 28. 14.</note> These are sure to fall into destruction.</p>
                  <p>This condemns the common unbelief and impenitency of most men,
for though they hear Gods judgements denounced against sinners, and
that they hang over the pit of Hell, and that he will judge Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
and Adulterers, &amp;c. and that no such shall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, and that they are thieves for every bit of bread they
eat, &amp; that if they come to the Sacrament without their wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they shall be bound hand and foot, &amp;c. yet they fear no colours,
but go on like blinde <hi>Bayard.</hi> People were of old afraid of Purgatory,
but these are not, whatsoever can be said of Hell, or the day of Gods
dreadful judgement: But they that now fear them least, shall one day
feel them most; whereas Gods Servants, which tremble and humble
themselves, with <hi>David, Habakkuk,</hi> and <hi>Josiah,</hi> hiding themselves with
God, shall escape, and they that fear them least before they come, and
are boldest in sin,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> on Psal. 14.</note> they are most stricken with horror, and most coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when they come, as <hi>Ahaz, Saul, Belshazzar,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water,]</hi> Here's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
use and end of the Ark, The preservation of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family
from drowning: By souls we are to understand men and women, and
by being saved, their temporal deliverance.</p>
                  <p>1. In that the Ark preserved them, and was not overturned with
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:65522:277"/>
the raging of the waters, and that <hi>Noah</hi> with his were not choaked,
being so long there with beasts. Note, That</p>
                  <p>What God will have a thing to do,<note place="margin">Weak means are sufficient through Gods blessing for our preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> though it seem never so weak,
or unlikely, yet it shall be sufficient to effect it, as <hi>Sampsons</hi> jaw-bone,
the compassing of <hi>Jericho, Daniels</hi> pulse which he eat, the Whales
belly for <hi>Jonah, Jordan</hi> to cleanse <hi>Naaman;</hi> so by the foolishness of
Preaching, by the Ministery of a few mean men (to speak of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison)
to convert the Gentiles, &amp;c. If God shut up <hi>Noah</hi> in the
Ark, he shall be safe enough; yea, and how many poor live and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
with a short and bare allowance, and many of them in sickness,
get up with poor help and means? O the happy condition of Gods
Servants, what means soever they have, if God bless the same, they
shall suffice to do them good! Hereof, how often in time of danger
when means have failed, or weak means onely were to be had, have
we had experience?</p>
                  <p>2. In that <hi>Noah</hi> with six other righteous persons besides himself
were preserved. Note</p>
                  <p>Both the reward of righteousness (though not for merit,<note place="margin">Righteousness shall not want its reward.</note> but Gods
mercy) and what a dignity and priviledge it is to be righteous; one
such is more worth,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> then ten thousand others: As they are the glory,
the wicked are the dross; so do they finde, that godliness hath the
promises both of this life, and that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>O what a provocation and encouragement ought this to be unto us,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
to labor to approve our selves to God, to be righteous in Gods sight,
and to walk with him! Such shall be preserved from all evil of body
and soul; for those that be otherwise, they lie open to all judgements
here, and to eternal destruction hereafter: O that men could believe the
odds between the one and the other!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cham,</hi> being with his Father in the Ark, was preserved from the
Flood, but after was cursed and condemned for his sin, and is in Hell.
Note, both that</p>
                  <p>Its good to be near the godly;<note place="margin">Its good to be near the godly.</note> The place, and they that be with
them, fare the better for their sake, as <hi>Laban</hi> for <hi>Jacobs,</hi> and <hi>Potiphar</hi>
for <hi>Josephs,</hi> wicked <hi>Jehoram</hi> for <hi>Jehoshaphats,</hi> all in the Ship for
<hi>Pauls,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No man can be saved by the goodness of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</note> and here <hi>Cham</hi> for <hi>Noahs,</hi> and none can be saved by any other
bodies goodness: The soul that sinneth shall dye, and every one shall
be saved by his own Faith: <hi>Cham</hi> perished though he had <hi>Noah</hi> to
his Father,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note> who was such a good man. Note further, That</p>
                  <p>Though the wicked both may and do often escape bodily dangers
(as <hi>Cham</hi> did) yea live,<note place="margin">The wicked however they escape bodily dangers, shall meet with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting judgements.</note> wax old, and grow in wealth, &amp;c. yet they
shall not escape the everlasting judgement of God for their sins:
<hi>While they continue their sins,</hi> (whatsoever their prosperity be) <hi>their
judgement sleepeth not, neither doth their damnation slumber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. In that of those which were saved from drowning, being but
few, yet one was not saved eternally. Note, That</p>
                  <p>It ever hath been,<note place="margin">There are but a few which shall be saved</note> is and will be, that a very few have been or shall
be saved; thus you see it was in the old world: So was it under the
Law, when all the Nations lived without God in the world, onely
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:65522:278"/>
God was known in <hi>Jury,</hi> yea, <hi>though Israel was as the sand of the sea,
yet but a remnant of those were saved:</hi> How few in the wilderness, but
were disobedient? how few under the Prophets, but were idolatrous
and stiff-necked? In the days of Christ, where was faith to be found?
and now (not to speak of the Jews, Turks, and Pagans) even among
Christians, doth not the love of most wax cold? Narrow is the way
to Heaven, and there be few that finde it; <hi>Many are called, but few are
chosen.</hi> Gods people are a little Flock; Faith and Repentance (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which none can be saved) be so difficult things, as few attain them.
An Hypocrite and civil man may go far, but come far short: If indeed
to speak two or three good words at ones death, were a sign of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
(as numbers hold) or Heaven were so easily come by, in vain did
Gods Servants humble themselves, and labor to cleanse themselves in
innocency. I would never care for coming into Heaven, if it were so
easily obtained; as the <hi>Arrian</hi> at <hi>Norwich,</hi> about to be Executed, said
to one standing by,<note place="margin">The speech of an Arrian at his death.</note> Do you think Christ would forgive me, if I did
confess and believe in him, and acknowledge him? O saith the party,
without all doubt he would: To whom the <hi>Arrian,</hi> If your Christ
be so easily to be entreated,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 21.</note> I'le never believe in him: <hi>But not every one
that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Faith and
Repentance, with the change of a man, is the greatest work in the
world. Though we cannot judge the precise number of those which
shall be saved, neither yet who they are, yet generally this is true, That
in the visible Church, but a few shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>We must not therefore content our selves to do as most do,<note place="margin">Use.</note> or the
rest of our Neighbors do, but rather as the fewest do, else we can
never enter into Heaven, or be saved; we must crowd, and strive
hard, and labor to be of the number of those few which shall
be saved; we must give all diligence hereunto, seek after this, cry for
this; we must not content our selves with any shadows of grace, but
seek after true grace, which is to salvation; we must not content our
selves to be of the family of the righteous, but must labor and finde
that we our selves are righteous.</p>
                  <p>5. In that he termeth those eight which were saved <hi>Souls</hi> (by which
word also elsewhere men and women be meant) which is not at any
time given unto any other Creature:<note place="margin">Gen. 46. 27.</note> Note,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1.</note> that</p>

have reasonable souls, and so capable of the mysteries of God, of the
image of God, of the graces of his spirit, and immortal souls, and so
capable of living in glory for ever.</p>
                  <p>1. If God hath bestowed infinite more cost on man then on all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> how should we by serving God with our reason, and
having our souls adorned and filled with the gifts of the Spirit of God,
labor to excel them? O the miserable and base madness of most men,
who though being endued with reason, they are apt to serve God best,
and may observe all Creatures serving them in their kinde, yet rebel
against him, and so become indeed void of reason! And how do
most let their souls lie unfurnished of saving knowledge, and other
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:65522:278"/>
graces, like bruit beasts: Happy they had been beasts, God made them
men, but they live like beasts that perish.</p>
                  <p>2. Our care must be more for our souls then our bodies;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Those
be immortal, shall live even when parted from the body: O the folly
of most people, that toil and care for transitory things, as profits
and pleasures, food and raiment, but have no care for any thing that
is eternal; God gave them souls capable of immortal glory, and
they have so neglected the seeking hereof, as that they must dye eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
and be in wo for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> and the old world were a right picture of the good and bad in
our age;<note place="margin">Noah and the old world a right picture of the good &amp; bad in our age</note> while he was carefully workiug, they took their pleasure,
but in the end he was saved and they drowned: So now the servants
of the Lord, they knowing their sin and danger, they spend their time
in mourning and humbling their souls, and in making of an ark of
Faith and true Repentance, wherein to save themselves from the flood
of Gods wrath, which they know they have deserved: They take
pains to hear, read, pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mortifie their affections and lusts, abridge
themselves of many profits and pleasures, having many reproaches
from men, and hard measures, yea, it may be crosses and afflictions
from God to further them in a good course; while in the mean time
the common sort they follow the swinge of their own hearts, and do
what they list, they follow their profits and pleasures like <hi>Esau,</hi> and
often escape afflictions, and have great prosperity, so that one would
think their case happy in comparison of the state of the people of
God: But mark the end, time will come, that the people of God
shall be saved, and escape drowning, when the jolly world shall fall
into the pit of eternal perdition: So the children of God begin in
tears, but they end in joy, whereas the wicked begin here in jollity,
but must end in eternal howling; which of these is the best, chuse
the first or the last, that which perisheth, or that which endureth
to life eternal.</p>

salvation; not that the outward Baptism, that is, the washing of the
body with water, doth save (for that Hypocrites may have) but the
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:65522:279"/>
inward, that is, the pardon of our sins in Christs blood, and purging
our nature by Sanctification; whereof being assured by Faith, we have
a good conscience, and hereby have boldness to make demand, and
challenge of God eternal Salvation, which God cannot deny, having
so covenanted in Baptism to the believer; and hereunto we attain,
not by the work wrought, or our being Baptized, but by the death
and resurrection of Jesus Christ, his death purchasing it, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
witnessing the same; whereof this last, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
and finishing of the other, is onely expressed in this
place.</p>

                     <hi>The like figure whereunto,</hi> &amp;c.] Here note, That</p>

that we be;<note place="margin">The godly throughout all ages are saved by the same means.</note> we by faith in Christ who is come, as they in him to

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>doth also now save us,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the first Sacrament
of the New Testament,<note place="margin">Baptism what it is, &amp;c.</note> and is ordained in the room of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as the Lords-Supper in the room of the Passover; as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
did precede the Passover, so doth Baptism the Lords-Supper;
that being a sign of our ingrafting, this of our growing in the Church;
and as amongst the Jews, even Infants were to be circumcised; so
amongst us Christians, are Children to be Baptized: Hereof the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sign is water, whereby the blood of Christ is fitly resembled,
which is that effectual water which doth wash and cleanse our souls:
It must be pure, not mixt water, in respect of great personages, neither
must any thing be added thereto, as salt, oyl, &amp;c. And the person
Baptized, must neither be marked with an hot iron, as amongst the
Ethiopians, nor Circumcised, as its the practice of others: In ours,
though some things be retained, which some good men have stumbled
at, yet they that be so shie of them as to forsake the Church, as the
Separatists do, or neglect and omit Baptism, or break the peace of the
Church, by seeking to have their Children Baptized elsewhere, they
are too bird-eyed, and I think its ignorance and weakness in them; if
they were retained, as the Papists used them, putting holiness in them
superstitiously; yet if there were no other cause but this, we should
not forsake the Church, nor refuse Baptism; much less seeing our
Church doth altogether protest against superstition in them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
them for order only: The thing signified, is the inward cleansing
of the soul, which being impure through sin, is filthy before God,
till it be washed by the blood of Christ, and Spirit of Sanctification;
yet as there are some which will see no filthiness therein, so are there
others, which are so far from seeking to be purged, that they wallow
still in the mire of their lusts. By this Sacrament also, theres an inward
and Spiritual thing sealed, and grace conveyed, though an unbeliever
seeth it not, contrary to the opinion of the Katabaptists, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to be a badge onely of a Christian profession, and no further;
yet are not the sign and the thing signified always and necessarily tyed
together, and so Baptism doth not save by the work wrought, as
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:65522:279"/>
the Papists would: Even Reprobates may have the outward Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism,
which yet doth them no good, but rather is a witness against
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience towards God doth save us,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The uses of Baptism.</note> To believers indeed, both sign and
thing signified go together, and they may receive much comfort from
their Baptism; as by it make a confident demand of Salvation from
God, for they believing and desiring to obey God, there was sealed up
in their Baptism, the pardon of their sins and sanctification, both
which they may confidently challenge at Gods hand, and therewith
eternal life: This Sacrament also is our badge and livery of God,
and of our holy profession, whereby we differ from Pagans, Turks,
Jews, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is also an instruction to us,<note place="margin">Use.</note> to lead a holy life,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 4.</note> as we did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and promise when we were Baptized: This is an help to keep us
from sin for the time to come, being provoked thereto, we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that we cannot in respect of our Baptism; yea, this also is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to raise us up to repentance after we be fallen; and as no doubt it
did <hi>Noah</hi> good every time he saw the Ark, so seeing Baptism saveth
us, that is, is a sign to us of our Salvation, we should often meditate
thereof,<note place="margin">Who is to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, and who to be Baptized.</note> and be glad to be put in minde of the same.</p>
                  <p>For those which are to Baptize, they must be lawfully called here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and for those which are to be baptized, they are not all men,
but they that be within the pale of the Church, neither are beasts,
or dead things to be Baptized: The Popish Baptizing of Bells, is an
horrible prophanation of this Sacrament: Baptism is a sign of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
neither doth it profit without Faith, therefore none may have
it, but they which be capable of Regeneration and Faith: but of these
particulars, as also of the Baptism of Infants, the time of Baptism,
who are to be present thereat, who to present the childe to Baptism,
the witnesses, the name, the form and maner, whether Baptism be of
absolute necessity to Salvation, whether <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism, and Christs
were all one, or diverse, with divers the like; I have largely spoken by
way of Catechizing.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">See Rom. 4. 25. and 8. 34.</note> Here he sheweth that we are not to
rest in one Baptism, to finde Salvation in it, but to look to the death
and resurrection of Christ, whereby our Salvation is purchased and
procured, though it be sealed up by Baptism: He puts one for both,
his Resurrection, being the accomplishment of our Salvation, and
Testification thereof, containing his death under it.</p>

                  <p>HEre follows another Reason to comfort Christians, in suffering for
Christs sake; namely, that he for whom they suffer, and who is
their head, is advanced into most high dignity, being ascended into
Heaven, and there at the right hand of God, &amp;c. that is, hath all
power in Heaven and Earth committed to him in his Church, all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
Principalities and Powers, both good and bad, <hi>being made subject
to him,</hi> who therefore can make the good to serve our turn, and can
repress the bad, much more can he repress the violence and rage of
men, that persecute his people.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Ascension of Christ,<note place="margin">What our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors ascension was.</note> I have shewed you what it was,
namely, that our Savior having sufficiently manifested the truth of his
resurrection, and confirmed his Disciples by the power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and partly by the supernatural property of a glorified body, he
left the Earth, and was taken up into the highest Heaven, and there is,
and so shall continue till his coming to judgement.</p>
                  <p>1. That he did ascend,<note place="margin">That he did ascend.</note> the Scriptures declare unto us, He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
foretold it,<note place="margin">Luke 24. 51.</note> first, more darkly, afterward more clearly; then most
clearly,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 9.</note> when it was at hand: Neither was it without cause, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as his Manhood had suffered the lowest abasement,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. &amp; 14. 19. &amp; 20. 17.</note> so it might

such things as were to be performed for the good of his Church,
namely, the Application of his death and merits, to those for whom he
suffered, and the sending of the holy Ghost, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. The persons before whom be did ascend,<note place="margin">Before whom he did ascend.</note> were not the Scribes,
Pharisees, and Jews, but his Disciples; those had seen enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but not profiting thereby, they were left to themselves; these
were to Preach his ascension to all, God having ordained, men rather
by hearing then seeing should be saved.</p>
                  <p>3. The time,<note place="margin">The time when he did ascend.</note> not till he had sufficiently proved his resurrection,
Gods goodness appearing herein, that would have all main points so
clear, that they that will not stop their own eyes and ears, might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
Neither did he ascend till he had comforted his Disciples, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the troubles they were to meet with, and instructed them
in the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God;<note place="margin">They that have charge over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers must be careful to leave them in good plight.</note> hereby teaching
that all which have charge of others, must be careful to do all the
good they possibly can to them that be under their charge, while they
be with them, and after to provide to leave them in as good state as
possibly they can: Thus should Magistrates (with <hi>Moses,</hi> who trained
up <hi>Joshua,</hi> to succeed him) Thus should Ministers (with the Apostles
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>) Thus also should Housholders, Parents, Masters do,
that when they themselves shall dye, others may succeed them, which
may do as much, if not more service in the Church of God, then
they did: But who do thus employ their talents for the good of souls?
O what a fearful answer have most to make!</p>

                     <hi>Bethany,</hi> or the Mount of
Olives, both which were close together; that which was often the
place of his mourning, and most sorrow, was now the place of his
greatest comfort: Even there where <hi>Steven</hi> had such mighty adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">Acts 7. 56.</note>
he had a most clear sight of Heaven open, and of Christ stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the right hand of God: Even on the bed of sickness, in Prison,

Church by raising up Christian Kings and Governors, where he hath
any Elect. 2. He governs and keeps the same, defeating all subtile
plots of his Enemies,<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 23.</note> and confounding all their devices; Thus did he
on the behalf of the Church in <hi>Egypt;</hi> Thus also by overthrowing
<hi>Hamans</hi> conspiracy; Thus did he by dissipating the Spanish Armado,
and defeating the Gunpowder Plot. 3. Exerciseth his Church with
crosses, to scour off the rust, which usually long Prosperity brings
thereon. In Particular, for the Members of his Church that shall be
saved, he gathers them, guides them, and exerciseth them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by crosses, and represseth a great part of the rage of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Enemies, strengthening them against the same; and for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of his Church, he brings confusion upon them, as on <hi>Pharaoh,

                  <p>1. How great a one is he,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and how glorious is his Kingdom? He

we must take heed we do no uncomely thing, lest thereby we make

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is 1. An Exhortation,<note place="margin">The parts and meaning of these two Verses.</note> and 2. A motive to perswade
thereto: The Exhortation is, to resolve to mortifie and
subdue the lusts of our corrupt nature, and to cease from
sin; namely, living in any sin, which is both explained
and amplified; explained by setting forth the parts of
Sanctification severally, where's shewed, 1. What must
be laid away, the lusts of men; these we must not follow, nor walk
in. 2. What we must do, even walk according to Gods will; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified
by the circumstance of time, even so much time as remaineth
in this life behinde. The motive to perswade hereto is, For that <hi>Christ
hath suffered for us in the flesh,</hi> namely, in his humane nature, both in
body and soul (for that are we to understand by flesh in the first place;
as thereby in the second, the mortifying of our corrupt nature, or that
sinful disposition which is in us, called flesh, which spreadeth it self
both over our bodies and souls; and in the third, this natural life of
ours, while the soul lives in this body of ours) for us, not for
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:65522:282"/>
himself, but our sins; for us, not angels, who are reserved undereverlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chains of darkness, but for us men; for us, even me, and thee (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou art) that believest; for us, the Apostle himself being one
(for every man must labor to know it to be for him, and the rest of
Gods elect) <hi>Forasmuch then,</hi> I say, <hi>as Christ hath suffered for us in the
flesh, we must arm our selves with the same minde,</hi> even not onely to bear
afflictions patiently, and if it were to suffer persecution for his cause,
but also to dye unto sin, not living any more to the lusts of men, but
to the will of God. As Christ hath dyed for sin, so should we dye
to sin, and not live in that for which Christ paid so dearly, and God
so hated, and from which we are freed; but rather in token of our
thankfulness for our deliverance, we must labor by all possible means
to mortifie these our wicked lusts, and to lead an holy life, to the
glory of our Redeemer. Our Note may be this, That</p>
                  <p>The passion of our Savior Christ ought to be a mean to mortifie our
lusts,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> and to kill sin in us;<note place="margin">The passion of Christ is an especial means to stir us up unto mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> for who can love the knife that killed his
dearest friend, or that would have been his own certain destruction?
neither can any man have any perswasion (upon good grounds) of his
part in Christ death, except he dye to sin; for as one end of Christs
death was to free us from condemnation,<note place="margin">Tit. 3. 7.</note> so another was, to kill sin in
us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15.</note> for he purgeth those whom he redeemeth: He is a perfect Savior
and Redeemer, not setting us free from some, but out of the tyranny
of all our enemies, therefore of sin as well as wrath; again, would
Christ dye for a company, and have no use of them, but leave them
still to live in sin?</p>
                  <p>As therefore we would not live in sin,<note place="margin">Use.</note> let us often meditate on
Christs passion:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> O its a fruitful mother of many children! To know
that sin is enmity against God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> fights against the soul, brings death
with it, is not so available to kill sin, as to know and meditate on
this, That</p>

                     <note place="margin">Christians are to labor for mortification.</note>] The duty whereunto we are exhorted,
is to suffer in the flesh, to mortifie our flesh, that is, our corrupt and
sinful nature, and the lusts and sins thereof both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
But</p>
                  <p>1. Most are so far from mortifying their lusts,<note place="margin">Who do not.</note> that they follow them
with greediness, and cannot endure any to speak against them: These <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
be fools indeed, to destroy their own souls, by living in enmity and
opposition against God.</p>
                  <p>2. Some it may be refrain some lusts, but others they live in and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
yield to, and yet these will claim part in the death of Christ, hope to
be saved by Christ; but so long as its thus with them, its impossible
that they should have any part in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Do we therefore labor for mortification,<note place="margin">Use.</note> applying the edge of the
Word of God to the throat of our lusts: That we may not give
way hereto, lets often call to minde the threatnings of the Word, the
Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, what God offers us
there, and what we convenanted with him for, the crosses which our
lusts have drawn on us, Gods manifold mercies unto us, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
meditate on Christs death and passion, which is indeed a strong
corrasive to eat out sin; for our corruptions remain too rank, and
through want of care and too much yielding thereto, be not subdued
as they ought: Let us know, that he is the best Christian, not that
hears most, or knows most, or can utter most, but he that hath
most power over his affections and heart. Note further from hence,</p>
                  <p>That as our lusts fight against us,<note place="margin">Christians must furnish themselves as Soldiers, that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</note> so we must furnish our selves like
Soldiers, that we may prevail against them: Its no easie thing to get
out of sin, or to get the Mastery thereof; its to mortifie our members,
to pluck out our right eyes, and cut off our right hands: Its easier to
take any pains in offering sacrifice,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 16. and 58. 5.</note> nay, fast extraordinarily, and to
part with our goods,<note place="margin">Micah. 6. 7.</note> with thousands of Rams, and ten thousand ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of oyl, yea, with our first born, then to part with one beloved
sin:<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 1.</note> They that would overcome their lust, must not stand still, or be
without weapons;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> we have that within us which rebelleth against the
Law of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> and would lead us captive to the Law of sin which is
in our members: Hereunto the Devil addes his power, the world
also joyns herewith, by ill examples, bad counsels, mockings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,
&amp;c. and therefore we must be resolute and play the Soldiers,
if we would get out of our bad course: Through want hereof, some
even under a powerful ministery, be never converted; some get a
little way, but hang behinde in sin; some are a great while ere they
can get out, whom the Word having called and awakened, the world,
the Devil and their own lusts do again freshly assault; nay, some being
truly converted, yet fall back again into foul security, and have yet
strong corruptions, and many odde qualities, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes most of the world,<note place="margin">Use.</note> who do indeed joyn with
these enemies; few fight against them, but fewer resolutely, and
therefore are led captive of them to their destruction.</p>

                     <pb n="522" facs="tcp:65522:283"/>
2. This may provoke us to put on the whole armor of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> to arm
our selves on all occasions, and in all temptations, with good thoughts,
and meditations of the ugliness of sin,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 13.</note> danger of it, its hatefulness to
God, with the passion of our Savior Christ: O how few arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or when they do, its but to halves? O this must be put on and
kept on continually, night and day, we shall sleep never the worse;
there can be no truce between us and our enemies: This must be kept
even in the times of greatest prosperity.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Ships usually are cast away in
storms, but Christians may miscarry when its calm. Thus was it with
<hi>David,</hi> he abode constant in all <hi>Sauls</hi> storms, but in the time of peace,
was carried away with <hi>Bathsheba</hi>'s beauty: It must be kept on even in
our old age, and till death, for then will the Devil set himself most
against us; and both <hi>Noah, Moses,</hi> and others, did then catch worse
foils then ever before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suffered in the flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To mortifie our corrupt nature, why called suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the flesh</note>] To mortifie our corrupt nature is called suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the flesh; and the truth is, its hard to say, whether is harder to
suffer bodily torments and pains, or to mortifie a mans lust: O its a
death to part with them; yea, when in a man after long strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the grace of God and his corrupt nature, in the work of his
conversion grace prevails,<note place="margin">Mark 9. 20.</note> its even as the pangs of death; as when the
Devil went out of the childe, he threw him down, and he lay foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as if he had been dead: O its not so easie a matter as the blinde and
prophane world imagine.</p>
                  <p>Hath ceased from sin,] <hi>That is, living in any sin,</hi> For he that is born
of God sinneth not;<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and,</hi> He that committeth sin is of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That he no longer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The whole time of our life after our conversion must be spent holily.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> The whole time of our life that remains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we are called to repentance, ought to be spent in the service of God,
and practice of Repentance, and a new life: We owe all our life to
him, all the days of our life, the whole time, we owe all to him
who hath made and preserved us,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 75.</note> nothing to any other: What time
therefore we have spent in sin,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> we have robb'd God of it, and so
ought willingly to give him the remainder, redeeming that is past with
all diligence: The time past we know, but what is behinde we know
not how little it may be, and therefore must make use of the time
present, in turning to God and providing for our own souls.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those that have spent a great part of their life in sin,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
and yet being called to repentance, cannot afford this remainder to
God; as yong men that think it as yet too soon, &amp;c. much more
horrible and wicked are they, that have spent half their life, their
yong time in pleasures and vanities, and now are as mad of the
world as ever, with whom even yet its too soon to turn to God.</p>
                  <p>2. Let this be a provocation unto all sorts to turn unto God:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> Let
yong men repent,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 9.</note> they be called, and invited hereunto: O now it
would be acceptable to God when their wit is fresh,<note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 1.</note> their memory
good, their body and minde able; it would be like <hi>Abels</hi> sacrifice:
As for old, torn, lame Sacrifices, God hath no regard to them:
If we begin betimes, we shall prevent a number of sins, and so a
great deal of smart and sorrow. Besides, we shall learn goodness with
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:65522:283"/>
much more ease, if God should from our youth turn our hearts after it:
If we delay, we shall thereupon see not onely how wretchedly we
have spent our time, and misused our wit, memory and strength, but
how dull we be when we are old, and unfit to learn, it will much vex
us; an old Convert lightly never gets knowledge, and sees but dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the way,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 24.</note> as he that saw men like trees. If one should defer to learn
a trade till age, he might easily perceive that his wit were dull, his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and joynts stiff: Let the middle aged repent, nay, let not even
the oldest despair, but hasten to repent, that if possible they may
crowd in.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> And for those that have long walked in the ways of God,
let them hold out to the end, do so still; many of Gods servants have
been tript in old age, yea, and then the Devil labors most to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Should live in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.]</hi> We
must neither live in gross actual sins, wherein most men live, that
lust after them, as a woman longeth after a thing when she is with
childe, nor give way to the inward corruptions of our hearts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from that old man, Lusts, Original sin, concupiscence that
is in us; we must not live after the lusts of carnal, natural and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
men, called in the next Verse, <hi>The lusts of the Gentiles,</hi> of
which as being enemies to God, and to our own souls, and bringing
death along with them, I have already spoken: Its an argument, that
they which live after them,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> be not Christs: To those now living after
their pleasures, and following their lusts, it will be said hereafter as to
<hi>Dives,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hast had thy pleasure, as Lazarus pain, now is he comforted,
thou tormented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we must live after the will of God;<note place="margin">Gods will must be the rule for all our actions.</note> To whose will should
the servant be obedient, but to his masters, the subject but to his
Princes? God is our master and soveraign: His will also is a most
holy, pure and perfect will, and a rule of righteousness; he requires
no uncomely, no hurtful thing of us, but that which is holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
every way: The Angels in Heaven, they do the will of God,
our Savior came into the world to do his will:<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 10. &amp; 17. 4.</note> In his passion he had
respect hereto, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> saith he; all the Saints
do it,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> and the godly on earth are and ever have been careful hereof,
as being a note of such as shall be saved: All creatures in their kinde
obey the will of God, and do that they were appointed for; we are
taught to pray, that this may be done: To do this in all things wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 10.</note>
brings comfort and peace along with it.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those that will not be brought in subjection to
Gods will, but of all things thats most irksom to them: Who made
thee? who gave thee this comely body and reasonable soul? who
hath preserved thee? whose will shouldest thou be subject to? art
thou a masterless person? such should be sent to the house of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
Whose will dost thou follow? what fault findest thou with
Gods will? is it a better will which thou followest? O no, its a most
corrupt and sinful will.<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It rebuketh those which will be ruled by the will of God in some
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:65522:284"/>
things onely, and at their pleasure; this is not to do Gods will, but our
own: Such was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> obedience, <hi>Sauls,</hi> the Devils: About this
there's no small stir in the world; God would have his will, and
men would have theirs; Ministers call for Gods will, and people
will have their own, though they dye for it, say who will against it:
And indeed oftentimes, what is it, but their will that they do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times?
Its against their profit, their credit, prejudicial both to soul and
body: Why do men follow drunkenness and riot, but because they
will? This is the cause why Preaching is so little regarded of most, so
much opposed by many, even because it would set up Gods will, and
pull down mans: If any Preacher shall speak against prophaning the
Lords-day, Oh, he is a troubler of <hi>Israel,</hi> hinders people from their
wills and old wonts: They enquire not what Gods will is in things,
but what their profit and pleasure leads them to; not what is the way
that God would have us increase by, namely, by diligence in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
by equal and righteous dealing, &amp;c. is Gods way askt after and
followed? No, but shorter cuts are sought after, as by deceit, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the like; its a sign that such shall never come into Gods
Kingdom, every Creature is better then they, and have a better end
except they repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they will have their wills, they must have that
belongs to it, they must pay dearly for them, as many do: <hi>Israel</hi>
would have flesh in the Wilderness, would have a King as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had; they had their wills, but it had been better for them they
had been without; <hi>Ahab</hi> would have his will in going to <hi>Ramoth Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead,</hi>
he had it, and there perished: God will have his will of such in
their condemnation, as who will resist his Soveraignty, and he will
not cease to be a King, though they refuse to be Subjects? O (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the filthiness of our own will, and the the dangers thereof,
and the holiness of Gods will, and the benefit that comes thereby)
that we would renounce our own, and follow Gods will.</p>
                  <p>3. It rebuketh the Servants of God, that be not so careful of the
will of God as they ought: O how often do we suffer our own wills
to bear sway, in omitting many a good duty, or doing it coldly; so in
doing that is evil, in wrath, impatience, worldliness, &amp;c! Its his will
that we should forget wrongs, but we do often nourish and retain
them in our thoughts; Its his will that we should be patient, but we
burst out upon small occasions; Its his will that we should keep holy
the Sabbath day, but we do for the most part prophane the same:
Herein we do but foolishly, for if we mark it (as we do, if we be of
God, and I speak to such) we have ever checkings of conscience, and
smart for it, as peace in cleaving close to his will: O how often do we
lose our comfort, and pull crosses on our selves?</p>
                  <p>Note we further from these words,<note place="margin">Gods will and mens lusts be opposite each to other.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That to live after the lusts of men and to the will of God, be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
each to other; our inward lusts, with the desires and fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
are enmity against God, and as contrary to the holy will of God,
as light and darkness, God and the Devil; for the Devil and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
hearts be much alike: no marvel then if we think so well of our
selves, and make so much of our lusts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="525" facs="tcp:65522:284"/>
2. That we cannot at one and the same time,<note place="margin">No man can at one and the same time live unto both.</note> both walk after our
lusts, and live to Gods will; or live to Gods will, and walk but after
our lust: God and Satan can never dwell in one heart together, as
neither the love of sin and goodness: This well considered, would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
some to be in a worse case then they think; they think, seeing
they have renounced many lusts and most sins, and are in many things
obedient, one sin is not so much, but though they love that, they do
love God and goodness too. Deceive not your selves, its impossible
it should be so: one lust loved, is sufficient to prove a man uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
sufficient also to condemn him, and all his other obedience is
vain:<note place="margin">Iames 2. 10.</note> If thou wouldest indeed please God and be saved, renounce the
love of every lust, and walk in obedience to all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>3. That in the course of Sanctification,<note place="margin">Till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our lusts we cannot be holy.</note> we must begin at renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
our own will, and the lusts of men: None sow or plant, till weeds
be pulled up; None put on new apparel, till they have put off their
rags:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> So must we abandon all the love of evil, ere we can entertain
any good.</p>
                  <p>This rebukes the common course of the world,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that set upon good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ere they have bid adew to their lusts; All their service is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
before God.</p>
                  <p>4. That its not sufficient that we do renounce our lusts and evil,<note place="margin">Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced our lusts, we must yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods will.</note> except
we yield obedience to the will of God: Thus the Scriptures run, Cease
to do evil, and learn to do well; abhor that which is evil, and cleave
unto that which is good; deny godliness and worldly lusts, and live
holily and soberly, &amp;c. dye to sin, and live to righteousness; put off
the old man, and put on the new; cast off the works of darkness, and
put on the armor of light: Its nothing, or at least but half, if a man
hath renounced ill company, if he hath not taken up the love of good;
Its not for il-doing that men shal be condemned, but for the not doing
good:<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down, and
cast into the fire.</hi> Its not enough we have no disorder in our families,
or be no ryotors, or ill example givers therein, except we take up good
orders in stead thereof; Its not enough we do no hurt, if we do no
good:<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 30. and 44. 45.</note> He that gathereth not, scattereth; and he that doth no good
in a Town, doth hurt: An house empty and swept, if it be not gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with goodness, its fit to be possest of Satan again; yet how
many think highly of themselves, because they have done no hurt,
have not wronged, oppressed, defrauded any, who yet have done no
good.</p>
                  <p>5. That its not one action or two,<note place="margin">A mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of walking, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers what he is.</note> whereby a man is discovered
what he is, but his constant course of walking or living: The best
man may be and is overtaken, as <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter,</hi> doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own lusts and will, not Gods, but such is not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
course; yea, when he doth otherwise then is fit, he is grieved,
and humbled, unfainedly repenteth, and earnestly desireth to be more
watchful over his own ways: We must not because of some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
conclude against our selves that we are not the Lords, if in
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:65522:285"/>
the mean time our hearts bear us witness, that what we do is contrary
to our intent and purpose, our course and drift of life; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
its not one good action or two that makes a good Christian, if
a mans course be contrary thereto; for even a Thief will be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Kings highway when its for his advantage,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> whereas usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he keeps in back lanes, and blinde ways: Thus many a bad man will
come to hear the word (this is one of Gods ways) but all the day after
he will be in his own course, even lying, swearing, drinking, deceiving,
without any reformation either in heart or life.</p>

defer? Should we not make haste? 2. Time is very precious,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
above gold and silver, and hereof we have squandered away a great
part. 3. There is no time to be spent in sin, but we are to serve God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
in holiness and righteousness,<note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 1.</note> all the days of our life: <hi>We must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
our creator, even in the days of our youth:</hi> Therefore having rob'd
him of some of his due, is it not well he will take this that remains,
and put up that wrong at our hands that is past, though we adde no
more? 4. Whatsoever time is spent till we return to God, is all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
out of the way; and if a man hath gone out of his way but till
eight or nine a clock, assuredly that's more then enough. 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
time is spent that way, is but doing that that must be undone
again, and repented of, and we must with grief and shame wish we
had not done it: Is not a little of this too much? who will willingly so
do his work, that it must be ript or ravelled out again? we use to chide
our Children if they do their work so, nay, who perceiving that he
hath thus wrought, will not grieve? who will not hereupon say, It was
a good turn I spyed it so soon, &amp;c? So should we grieve at all our
former mis-spent time, withal, blessing God that we did so soon perceive
it. 6. All that is done this way is for the Devil, our sworn Enemy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
for whom even the least is too much: Its for the flesh, to which we
owe nothing, and for the world, which is our deadly (though subtile)
Enemy. 7. Its all done against God, to whom we owe all, and is it not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
then sufficient we have wronged him so far? and is it not a great mercy
if he will pardon all that is past, though he adde no more to the heap?
8. And all is against our own souls, and is it not sufficient we have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
wronged, yea, wounded our own souls hitherto, the welfare and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
whereof we should now (at least) seek? 9. Its all done in such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
filthy work, as God never set them about, nor gave them soul and
body for the doing thereof.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those youths, that being called on to repentance,
yet think its too soon, and that that's not sufficient which they have
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:65522:286"/>
done already, What? Have they not yet spent time enough that way,
do they know there is so much more behinde? you would repent ere
you dyed, would you not? you would: Must you not then do it to
day, for you know not but that you may dye to morrow? Have you
squandered away already so much precious time, as that some would
even give the whole world for one day thereof, and will ye yet go on
in that course? O do it not, lest God snatch you away suddenly;
lest God give you up unto your hearts lusts, and so ye fulfil the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of your iniquity!</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh also those unreasonable people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as middle aged
folks, of forty or fifty years, which are now as deep in the world and
their profits, as before they were in their pleasures, and yet its not
sufficient for them; they can finde no time of thinking truly and
throughly to turn to God.</p>
                  <p>3. It rebuketh also those that do still defer till towards their end,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note>
and then they will turn to God; Is not God much beholding to them?
O let these sluggards know, that poverty will come upon them sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
and strongly: If they will needs stay till almost Sun-set ere
they set out, shall they not with the Levite and his Concubine be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,<note place="margin">Iudges 19. 15.</note>
and shut out of doors? Their condition shall be the same
with the five foolish Virgins.<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 10.</note> If a man had a long journey,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and had
gone out of the way all day, till three of the clock in the afternoon,
would he being informed thereof, go on still, and say, When its almost
Sun set, Ile turn into the right way? yet thus doth the world: Men
defer till they think they shall dye; then have they to come back all
the way of their life, and then must they lead the contrary good life,
and ere they can do this, the night of death overtakes them, and they
be shut out with Dogs and Inchanters, &amp;c. O let such be wise in time,
ere it be too late, and let them think it more then high time, to turn
head, and to ride hard too, to redeem the time! Its past Noon with
many of us, nay, past three of the clock in the afternoon, it draws
towards night with some: O then is it not time for us to draw near
to God! Note further from hence, That</p>

63, 115. In the Law its forbidden to touch a thing unclean, as a
dead corps:<note place="margin">Luke 7. 21.</note> This did morally signifie meddling with sin and sinners:
Using bad company we can neither keep a good course, nor a good

None can walk in the Sun but shall be tanned,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> nor touch pitch but he

uncleanness, and the provocations thereto, as fidling, dancing, mixt
sports of men and women, filthy talking, ribald jesting, unclean songs,
lewd ballads, whorish apparel, idleness, &amp;c. These are so common,
that its even a death to people to be held from them; we can scarce
see a yong man or woman in whom some one or other flag of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hangeth not out; Are not these works of darkness? shall such
inherit the Kingdom of Heaven? O that the disorder of such were

                     <hi>Excess of wine,</hi>] Another lust of the Gentiles which we are to avoid,
the immoderate use or rather abuse of wine and strong drink: Wine
is the good creature of God, made for good use, and God hath given
us liberty to use the same, and that both ordinarily (according to our
ability,<note place="margin">See Psal. 104. 15.</note> so as it may be for the health of our bodies, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the same the better to serve God in his worship,<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 6.</note> and our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 23.</note>
and in time of weakness of body or minde) and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
as in times of great and solemn rejoycing; so of thanksgiving to
God for deliverances and mercies, and at marriages, or such meetings
of friends, wherein not onely whats for necessity is allowed, but also
whats for delight, and so a more liberal use thereof then at other
times; yet even then, moderation and christian sobriety must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 10.</note>
we must no further make use of wine, but as thereby we may
be fit to praise God,<note place="margin">Drunkenness an abominable sin.</note> or otherwise to do good: But the excessive use
of it to drunkenness is abominable, and often prohibited. Besides,
its not onely odious to God,<note place="margin">Isaiah 5. 22.</note> and so all good men, but its even vile in
the eyes of the Heathen,<note place="margin">Luke 21. 34.</note> insomuch that they have made many severe
Laws against the same,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 18.</note> and uttered many excellent sayings against it:
It puts God as it were ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he serves more then God, cares for it, seeks to please it more then
God, nay, to satisfie it, he cares not to dishonor God; Its also a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
abuse of Gods benefits, and a means to dishonor him, which ought
to allure us to love and serve him, it makes a man also unfit for Gods
service; we be unfit at the best, but when the head and heart are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with drink, we are then as blocks and beasts, unfit for any
good work in Church or Common-wealth, unfit to govern or be
governed,<note place="margin">Lev. 10. 9.</note> unfit to follow our Callings, yea, unable to cover our own
nakedness,<note place="margin">Prov. 31. 5.</note> as it was with <hi>Noah.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 69. 12.</note> Hence it is, that Magistrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
whose callings are of greatest use and necessity, do flatly forbid
it; it makes a man also fit for all evil, as to swagger, swear, curse, rail,
mock; to talk filthily, to scoff at Religion, and the Servants of God;
to commit whoredom, (as <hi>Lot</hi>) to quarrel, fight, stab, kill, (daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
shewing most frays proceeding from the pot) to thrust their
wives out of doors, beat their Children, play the mad men, fill all
places with filthy vomiting, &amp;c. Its reported, that one being tempted
to whoredom, murther, and drunkenness, and thinking that he must
needs yield to one of them, for that adultery was dishonorable and
dangerous, and murther most odious and fearful, he gave way to the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:65522:287"/>
third, which was drunkenness, but then when he was drunk, fell into
both the other; for having committed folly with another mans wife,
the husband coming in, he killed him. This puts out the eye of the
soul, and takes away the use of Reason for a time, even that whereby
a man differs from a beast, and indeed, makes a man, so that being
drunk,<note place="margin">See Pro. 23. 35.</note> he knows neither what he doth, nor what is done to him, as it
fared both with <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot:</hi> For a man to cut or hurt his own flesh,
were bad, but to hurt the principal part, the soul, how dangerous is it?
That were but as if one should kill a Subject; this, as if he did take
the Prince, and binde him hand and foot, and turn him out of his place
of Government: Who would put out his bodily eyes? but too too
many do thus put out the eyes of their soul. This disguiseth the body,
which is Gods workmanship, and comely, and ought to be preserved
in holiness and honor,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 13.</note> and kept as a Temple for the holy Ghost, and
makes it the stye of the Devil: From hence are red eyes, an inflamed
face, a swoln body, the hands quiver, the feet reel and stagger; yea,
it not onely disguiseth, but endangereth it; it dulls the wit, spoils the
memory, breeds diseases, Dropsies, Imposthumes, Palsies; oppressing
and drowning the natural heat before the time (as a Lamp with too
much oyl,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> or a candle thrown into the water, ere it be half burnt)
and so bringing untimely death: They that are addicted hereunto, are
self-murtherers, and though they had need to prolong their lives
while they can,<note place="margin">Hosea 4. 18.</note> unless they were fitter for death, yet do they long as
it were, and hasten to be in Hell: This is a stinking sin both to God
and all good men; Its a wicked abuse of Gods Creatures, appointed
to be received with prayer and thanksgiving to the glory of the giver
thereof;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 4.</note> Its a wasting of the portion which God hath given us,
whereby we might live comfortably, and do much good to others in
Church and Common-wealth: O how many do hereby squander all
away, rob Church, Common-wealth, Poor, yea, their own Families,
their Wives portions, and Childrens Patrimony, all going down their
throat!<note place="margin">1 Tim 5. 8.</note> What cruel murtherers be these? If he that provides not for
them is worse then an Heathen, then what is he that having already
wherewith to maintain them, thus pulls it as it were from them? This
also is a wicked mispending of our precious time; This brings infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and reproach with God and men; This brings beggery along
with it: many having spent all on strong drink in their youth, are fain
to drink water in their age; This hath wo, sorrow, and wounds at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereon:<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 29.</note> Many in their drunkenness have been stabb'd, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have come to the gallows for that they have done in their drink;
yea, custom and continuance herein, breeds not a delight onely, but
from thence another nature, and a kinde of necessity upon the body,
that they cannot leave it; they swallow not the wine so much, as the
wine swallows them up, and they are buried in wine, &amp; as unfit for any
good,<note place="margin">See Deut. 21. 20.</note> as one that is buried, to do the work of a living man. Hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
may be added,<note place="margin">Isaiah. 5. 22.</note> that as there are fearful judgements threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 10.</note> both in respect of this, and the life to come (for the cup
of the fierceness of Gods wrath is prepared for such to drink to the
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:65522:288"/>
bottom, and the full Vials of his judgements will be poured out
upon them eternally) so amongst others, this is the main, that they
seldom or never repent: I have known some toucht at the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this, weep for it, promise, yea, vow against it, who have
yet again fallen into company, and could never get out.</p>
                  <p>1. If this be so horrible a sin,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> what shall we say to the Land
wherein it is grown to such an horrible height, and to abound in such
a fearful sort? It was wont to be the sin of other Countreys, now
we have got it, and may we not boast of our gettings, think ye? It
was wont to be rare, but is now common in all places; wont to be
done in a corner, and the parties ashamed thereof, now it staggers
abroad in the open streets, none being ashamed of the same; wont
to be the sin of base ones, according to the Proverb, He is as drunk
as a beggar, but now its the sin of Gentlemen, and herein our Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
sons exceed,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 15.</note> to the wasting of their Revenues: St. <hi>Peters</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
were now a very slender one, for men rise early to drink strong
drink; yea, men are now grown into such an horrible height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
as that they labor and strive to excel therein; they get Beer of
extraordinary strength, and call it by names, <hi>Snapdragon,</hi> and
(which is most horrible Blasphemy) <hi>Hosanna in the highest,</hi> &amp;c. drink
by the yard, by the dozen, in pails, in crooked horns that cannot
be set down, make matches who shall drink each other drunk under
the Table: O fearful! Is this the fruit of the Gospel, and of this
peace and light? Its indeed a work of darkness, though it abounds
in the light of the Gospel, a lust of the Gentiles, and so not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
Christians: Do we marvel at unseasonable Weather, at Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and Scarcity, &amp;c? we may rather wonder at Gods patience:
And were it not that our Governors and the chief of the Land have
taken it to heart, and Enacted good Laws to suppress it, both by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
a penalty upon it, and preventing it by diminishing of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,
the sinks of all disorder and mischief, and by forbiding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
strong Beer, and enjoyning a moderate size thereof, &amp;c. We
might have looked for some notable judgement of God; but when
men of authority take sin to heart, and seek to punish the same, then
God takes it well, and is pacified: Contrarily, when Magistrates
have not grace and courage to put life into his Laws, by the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Justice, the Lord is enforced to take his rod into his own
hand.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth those which are addicted unto this sin of
drunkenness;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> What? Think they that God gave them their souls
and bodies, their goods, health, wealth, his good creatures, and their
precious time to use thus? hath he bestowed on them the days of the

what answer and account think they to make to Almighty God for
these things? They may justly fear some notable judgement from
God to be inflicted on them, as of late there hath been on divers, and
do not these things affright you? dare you go on in the like? were
they not sent for your admonition, and to be warnings unto you?
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:65522:288"/>
Awake therefore you Drunkards, and howl, humble your selves on
the knees of your soul, confess your horrible wickedness to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, cry for mercy and pardon, and if it be possible, turn from
this base vice, renounce, hate, detest, vow, covenant, swear against
it, pray also to be kept therefrom, avoid all company of lewd ones,
which will either by flattery allure you, or if you yield not to them,
reproach and mock you: But what do I speak to them that have lost
their wits, Is there any hope of repentance for such? Well, yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impossible to God, The harder it is, labor the more, and weep
and lament for that is past, redeem the time to come, give your souls
and bodies to please God in all good life and sober conversation; you
have spent your goods and time hereon, do so no more: If thou
wiltst not be perswaded, but go on still and hate to be reformed, thou
mayest look for some one or other dreadful judgement to be here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on thee, and at thy death to be cast into utter darkness, who
hast wallowed in the works of darkness,<note place="margin">See Psal. 75. 8.</note> and for thy drunkenness to

                  <p>Neither are common drunkards onely to be rebuked, but such also
as will now and then drink with their friends, and sit so long talking

                  <p>Nor are those only to be condemned that be so drunk as they be
like beasts, but even such as take delight to quaff and to carouse, and
spend their time in swilling, having yet strong brains to bear it, and
herein they glory that they can drink others under-board, and because
they be never so drunk, but they can carry it away, therefore they think
themselves no such persons, but they are as bad drunkards, and as
guilty as the other; they waste as much time, as much wine or strong
drink as the others; they waste also their substance, and delight in this
course, nay, haply they drink much more then the others, for some are

To make others drunk, enticing them hereto, and to this end, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colour of kindeness to drink to them often, as is usual in Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
Butteries, and Cellars, in Inns, and Taverns, &amp;c. where men
will be at great cost to dishonor God, this also is fearful; these be
zealous Servants of the Devil: But if one should allure another to
go in such a way, where he were sure to fall into a pit, or be drowned,
or be robbed, &amp;c. would not every one cry out of such a treacher?
no less treacherous are those which make others drunk: We are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
indeed to provoke each other to love and good works, to call one
another to the house of God, to exhort and edifie one another, but in
no sort to destroy one another, as those allurers and enticers do.</p>
                  <p>To compel others to drink till they be drunk, or to drink more
then they can bear, is usual; to refuse, is accounted of sundry ruffians
in our days, a matter of great disgrace, which they will not put up, and
therefore stab, or challenge to the field, those that will not drink as
many and as big carouses as they that have begun them: What inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
is this? what folly? hath nature made all alike? can one of
low stature reach as high as he that is far taller? can a weak
man bear as heavy a burthen as a strong man? Besides, what greater
wrong, then to force a man to do that which will hinder his health,
shorten his life, wound his conscience, and destroy his soul? But
especially what an outragious wickedness is this against God? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
we our selves be content to do wickedly, but as ringleaders we
must enforce others? whosoever scape, such traytors shall not: What
woful wretches are those? have they not sins enough of their own to
answer for, but they must needs desperately pull other mens sins on
their heads, whereof they themselves are the principal cause? For
those,<note place="margin">See Heb. 2. 15, 16.</note> they shall answer on that dreadful day: Against such shall <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus</hi>

endeavor for the time to come to avoid the same, with all the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

well-doing, we must not use them to sin, like the Mastiffs, that flies
in his face that gives him meat: Wiltst thou so foully dishonor God?
shall thy body and soul appointed for Gods service, be for the service
of the Devil in this base sin? Wiltst thou thus make thy self unfit for
any good, in danger to run into any evil? Wiltst thou so disguise
thy self, as to make thy self a scorn? so abuse Gods creatures, to
hazard thy health, bring diseases and untimely death on thy self?
Wiltst thou so wound thy conscience, and provoke the Lords judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

for necessity, but also for delight, as well in the plenty as variety of
them: Those he hath appointed us to receive in due time, measure,

in their fare, and are never satisfied herewith, and give themselves
to devise new found dishes, cates, and sawces, so fulfilling the lusts
of their flesh; a common fault in great Towns and Cities: Most are
a great deal more careful herein, then to please God; and more angry
if it be not to their tooth, then for any sin against God; Its good to
have things cleanly and wholsome, but not curious: There are some
also that this way exceed their ability, being too much given to belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheer,

times forget themselves, and by variety of meats are beguiled; this
is the fault of feast-makers, occasioners of gluttony, who provide
too excessively and curiously, costly and dainty dishes, when men are
filled with wholesome and sufficient food before; Its good there should
be plenty according to every mans ability, that so the poor may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
and some variety too to shew Gods bounty, and because
all love not alike, but overmuch costliness is not meet; That which in
the end of feasts is oftentimes wastfully spent, would go a great way
with the poor, and much comfort them, if the charges were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

would grudge at as many pence to give to the poor; Its a good feast

blame worthy, that make the Sabbath day a Feasting-day, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all good order and reason; that's a Feasting day for the soul,
but if the body be overmuch pampered, the soul shall fare the worse:
we are therefore sparingly to eat that day, especially till night, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to go about spiritual duties, whereunto we are so unfit, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
whereof, through excess of food, we become sleepy, and
drowsie, which is most unseemly and wicked in Gods service; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as when we serve God extraordinarily, we fast altogether; so
when ordinarliy, we must be very temperate and sparing.</p>
                  <p>For the time; It must not be at unseasonable hours, as either too
soon, before men have done God some service, or been about some
good business,<note place="margin">See Eccles. 10. 16, 17.</note> nor so late, as when men should be at rest, such ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettings,
junkettings, and late Suppers, be not for strength, but for
lust; sundry servants be wanton in this kinde, watching their unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abominable idolatries,</hi>] This is a sin aginst the first Table, forbid in
the first and second Commandments, though most in the second:
Its either inward or outward, and its either the worshiping of false
gods, or the true God in a false maner, both which are most detestable
and abominable before God, and therefore to be hated of us in a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maner, as that which is the flat breach of the marriage Covenant
between God and his people; Its a turning our heart from God, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting,
yea a forsaking of God, a setting up another in his stead, who
will have no partners: Hereunto we are naturally prone, as may be
seen throughout all ages; even those that know the true God in some
sort, set up something before him to worship him in and by: Hereof
the Israelites were wonderfully guilty; though they had many strict
charges against it, yet they were wofully carried away with the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
of the Heathen; sometimes they did worship the very gods
of the Heathens, as <hi>Baalim</hi> and <hi>Ashtaroth,</hi> &amp;c. and at the best, they
used to worship God in Images, as in the golden Calf that <hi>Aaron</hi>
made, and in the two Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> for those the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
did vehemently reprove them, and threaten Gods judgements
against them, which accordingly were inflicted on them, as appears
this day: and if when they lived in their own Land they were so taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with idolatry, what were they now, having so long conversed with
those prophane Heathens? This therefore the Apostle warns them
now to leave and abandon, as having already continued too long
therein, and having repented thereof, he would not have them go back
thereto any more.</p>
                  <p>I shall speak a little here of the Idolatry of the Heathens, of the
Idolatry of the Papists, and of the Idolatry of our own people, all
which are either in worshiping a false god, or the true God in a false
maner.</p>
                  <p>For the worshiping of false gods;<note place="margin">Idolatry in worshiping false gods.</note> so did the Heathens, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped
the Sun, Moon, and the hoast of Heaven, yea, any thing what
soever, and according to their countries were their gods, nay, they had
their city and countrey gods, and houshold gods: There was no end
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:65522:291"/>
of their abominations,<note place="margin">Psal. 115. 2.</note> having this in their heart, that there was a God,
and not knowing him,<note place="margin">Isa. 44. 9.</note> they worshipped any thing, which the Lord
doth deride,<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 19.</note> and whereat he is angry, for he will not give his glory
to another, nor his praise to graven Images. O what cause have we
to bless the name of God that have the light of the Word, whereas
most throughout all ages have been ignorant thereof, and so worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
they know not what, and worshipped not onely in vain, without
any profit, but to the dishonor of the true God, and their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
Neither is this the sin of Heathens alone to worship false
gods, but even of the Papists, who have the Word for their Rule,
whose sin therefore is greater then the Heathens; they worship the
breaden god, they bow down to it, and call it their Maker, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is then between them?<note place="margin">See Isa. 44. 17.</note> as those fell a Tree, and with some
part make a fire, with some bake, and of some make a god and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
it; so these sow Corn, reap it and grinde it, and of some part
thereof make bread for themselves and theirs, and of another they
make a god which they worship; they also worship the Cross, and
Reliques of Saints; they also worship the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> calling on
her oftner then on God; so they worship Saints and Angels, their
Pictures also be common, whereunto they give Divine worship, they
dedicate Altars, Offerings, Temples, Priests and Days to them,
which are proper to God onely; yea, they make the Pope (that Man
of Sin) a god, not onely calling him so, but ascribing that to him which
is proper to God, as, To make Laws to binde the Conscience, to
open and shut Heaven, Hell and Purgatory, as they say, to forgive
sins, to adde and take from the Scriptures, &amp;c. O horrible! What
King will endure his Royalty to be given to another? If Angels and
Saints were to appear to us, as they were wont formerly, we ought
not otherwise to worship them but with civil worship (the excellency
of the Creature doth not change the kinde of worship, but onely the
measure) but now seeing they appear not to us, we owe them no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
at all, but onely to reverence them, and thank God for them, and
imitate them in what we can.<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 9.</note> The Angel would not suffer <hi>John</hi> to

they do it in a good meaning; but our intention is not the rule of Gods
Worship, but his own will: As for their shift, that they worship not
the Image, but God in the Image, its indeed a meer shift, that will
not serve their turn; so said some of the Heathens, so said the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;
assuredly God is displeased with both.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore detest Popery,<note place="margin">Use.</note> as being abominable before God,

to have common friends and enemies, as to help them against their
enemies, or crave their help against ours.</p>
                  <p>There be some that speak minsingly of the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> as
that there be indeed sundry differences between them and us, but that
they are petty and mean ones, and of no great moment, but such,
as if we would yield a little, and they a little, there might be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
made: Wo be to such dawbers, that would go about to
reconcile God and the Devil, Light and Darkness, &amp;c. There are
sundry differences which are main ones, and against the foundation,
and such as except they will renounce, we neither can, nor must ever
joyn with them. So of the Papists themselves, some will speak very
favorably, O they be good honest men, and many good things they
do, if it were not a little for their Opinions, &amp;c. Do such speak
wisely? they be abominable persons, for they be Idolaters (and
those God calls abominable) worshipping other Gods, and
the true in a false maner, namely, in Images: If they were
Murtherers, and would take away our lives; Adulterers, and
would abuse our wives; Thieves, and would take away our goods,
O we would cry out upon them, and say, They be abominable;
but we have no feeling of any thing which hurts our souls, nor
of that which is foully against God and his glory; its an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of self love and little grace: It should go more to our hearts,
that its against GOD and his glory, then any thing that were
against our selves any way: We ought to pray to God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

For the Idolatry among our selves:<note place="margin">The several sorts of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters amongst our selves.</note> Some conceive of God, as
of a God onely merciful, and not just; which emboldens them to go
on in their sins without fear or care, supposing that when they have
abused him at their pleasure all their days, if in the end they utter
but a few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> good words to him, he will be as well pleased, as if they
had served him all their time: This is to conceive an Idol, and not
God; for he is as just as merciful, the one no more then the other.
Sundry also among us make a god of their Belly, Profits, Pleasures,
Honor, Children, Ease, &amp;c. seeking onely these, setting their heart
and delight in these, trusting in these, yea, to compass these, not
caring though they offend God; for whatsoever a man loves more
then God, or trusts in besides God, he makes it his god: Thus the
glutton makes his Belly, as the covetous man his Wealth, his god;
O vileness, and extreme baseness! We that live under the Word
preached, should learn to know God to be All-sufficient, and to labor
to make him our portion and inheritance, our joy and our castle: He
that hath God, hath all; he that wants him, in the midst of all hath

and worship God indeed, but in a false maner; they pray, but
depart not from iniquity; hear the Word, but hate to be reformed;
are baptized, but keep no Covenant; receive the Lords Supper, but
without Knowledge, Faith and Repentance; but God he is a Spirit,
and therefore will be worshipped in Spirit and Truth: They that
worship him as most do, they worship an Idol, namely, Such a God
as is content with the outside, with Ceremonies, but so is not the true
God; the service of such is abominable, against such judgements have
been both denounced and inflicted; See 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 23. Psal. 50. 16.

speak ill of our Religion, and hold off, even because (though indeed
we worship God, and profess well, yet our peoples lives be so far
wide) we that enjoy the Gospel, and the true means of the right

serving of God: and so much the rather, because we had the means
to bring us to the true knowledge of him, which is denyed to the

we use it to no better purpose, and our souls too among the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>

take the course that you prescribe, we should be wondred at as an
Owl among Birds: They would think strangely of us, as of fools
and mad folks, and hate us, and speak evil of us, that we should not
be able to abide it: Others also might say, We which have followed
your counsel, have made our selves a gazing stock, and pulled all men
upon our tops; even those that liked us well before, speak ill of us,
and what we shall do, we know not: The Apostle Answereth, I
know it is so with some of you, and will be so with the rest, but be

finde much opposition, undergo the hatred and ill will of most. <hi>Lot</hi>

for making the Ark, and <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Courtiers at <hi>Moses</hi> his choyce, <hi>Michol</hi>

<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> wondred that the three children refused to bow to his
Image which others did, <hi>Festus</hi> thought <hi>Paul</hi> mad; In time of Popery
they wondred at the Martyrs, that they would not at some times yield
a little, as to speak a few words, &amp;c. Thus it is now (for the world
lives still, and is like it self) If any dare not play or riot, or talk of
the world on the Lords Day, they are thought to be mopish fools,
who had rather be poring on a book, then doing as others: If any
care not to get by Lying, Deceiving, and the common ways of the
world, they are wondered at as fools; so if any now and then omit
some of their businesses, and go to hear the Word, they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
idle (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to the Israelites) and such as have little to do:
If any be humbled for their sins, they think them melancholy, and
that they will be out of their wits, and they would not be in their
case for no good, and would have them be merry, and play it away. If
any at the hearing of the Word, perceiving it to be high time to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
his old wont, and take a better course, now dare not do as he
hath formerly, they wonder at him: What! art thou turned Puritan,
will they say? Wiltst thou forsake thy sports and merriments (which
they think a little heaven) cast off thine old companions and sworn
brethren? &amp;c. What, wondrest thou at them for thus doing?
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:65522:293"/>
What, for coming out of the fire? for taking pains to save their
souls? for not daring to wound, poyson or destroy themselves by
provoking God? for taking pains to do that which must keep them
by Gods appointment, with all needful graces? for being troubled
about their sins, and the danger thereof? for longing to be in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of God, &amp;c? Assuredly thou hast small reason so to do; but its
for that they savor not the things of the Spirit of God, for that
they perceive not the things that are of God, are blinde, and cannot
see afar off.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If we should see one of a strange Country come through
our Town, we would wonder at their strange attire, nothing like
ours: The children of God be not of this world, but chosen out of
the world, and may not fashion themselves like the world, but be of
the fashion of Heaven, the world therefore wonders at them.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore let none think,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that if they turn to God, and take a
good course, that they shall be generally beloved and well thought
of; of God, Angels and good men they shall, but of the world they
shall be wondered at and hated; ere you begin, make account hereof,
even to have the ill will of those which have loved you, yea, it may
be, the displeasure and frown of Father, Mother, &amp;c. yet let not
this hold you off, nor keep you still in your old course; as long as
God and good men love you,<note place="margin">Luke 6. 26.</note> what need you care? <hi>Wo be to you, when

                  <p>2. For those that are entred into a good course already,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and finde
it thus, let them not be discouraged; its no new thing, the worthy
servants of God have been counted fools and madmen for well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
We must have an Heroical courage not to be daunted herewith;
we must not think the worse of our selves, because the world thinks
basely of us, who know us not, nor our course, which of them that
be very fools indeed, is counted foolishness; we may wonder as much
(and much more) at them, that be so desperate to go on in their sins,
and take no thought for death,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> or day of Judgement, that hang over
a pit, and yet can be merry; that run on in the score, and never think
of reckoning; that dare buy a few short profits and pleasures at so
dear a rate, at the loss of their souls, that deprive themselves of the
inward and true comfort and peace they might have in God and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things, as the Word and Sacraments, for the short and vain
pleasures of honor and deceiveable riches; that prefer Hogs meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Angels food: We have cause, I say, to wonder at their folly
and madness, and to pity them, thanking God that hath not left us
in their woful blindeness, and miserable estate: If thus by wondering
at them we can do them any good, so it is, but let not their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hurt us.</p>

so to be carnal: They that mislike the fashion of Gods children, its

our proneness and eagerness to that that is naught is exceeding great:
We can run to Play-sports, Vanities and Follies please us, but we
come to the Word, Prayers and good Duties with a leaden heel; at
this we are drowsie, but at the other watchful enough. Many run so
fast in the ways of sin, and make such haste, that they run themselves
quite out of state and credit with God and man, and out of their
health too, and have brought untimely destruction upon themselves;
they have made such haste, that it seemeth they thought long till they
were in hell: Too too many also are now a running (but its in the broad
way) wherein the faster they run, the sooner they come to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
if it were well considered, they can see small cause to make such
haste: O that they could be perswaded to turn head, and enter into
the way of good men,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> and then let them run as fast as they will, <hi>run

before we rejected all counsel that might do us good, so now let us
shake off all impediments, whether within or without us, that would
hinder us in our Christian course, or from running the way of Gods
Commandments: The faster we have heretofore run in vanity, run
we now the faster in the right way; we could then take great pains,
think the time short, spend our money in vanity, now after the same
maner lets do the contrary; its our great fault, that we did run apace
after the world,<note place="margin">See Rom. 6. 19</note> with the profits and pleasure thereof, but now our
fault is, that we go a foot pace, nay, a Snails pace in goodness.</p>

hearts are set on evil, there is no hoe, but they will run over head and

runs so violently; so small beginnings in sin, grow to excess quickly,
and by degrees till they are past hope.</p>

a good servant of God, having made a breach in his conscience, and
sinned once in denying his Master, was thereby stirred up to adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
breach, and another thereto, what shall become of the wicked?
Do not therefore say, Is this such a matter, &amp;c? for one sin draws on
another.</p>

Gods servants, they not onely think ill, but they speak ill too, it shall

for every railing reproachful word against the Saints of God; its to
speak ill of the way of God, to speak ill of them that walk in it for
so doing; as he that calls one an Heretick, calls his Opinion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
Heresie; and he that calls men fools, calls their course foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Its to hinder men from coming to God, or to drive them away
being come: Now this must needs be fearful, for if they that win
souls to God, shall be rewarded in Heaven, what shall become of them
that do the contrary? And if he that gathereth not, scatters, and he
that brings not to God by words, counsel, encouragement and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
is counted as an enemy, and such shall be punished at the
day of judgement, how much more they that have professedly
hindred men from heaven? what are those but Factors for the Devils
Kingdom? deep enemies they are to God, that will not onely not
serve him themselves, but mislike, and would hinder them that do,
like the Devil, who fell himself, and then would perswade man so to
do, that God might have no Creature to serve him: He were an odde
servant (and whom his Master would assuredly call to an account) who
neither would work,<note place="margin">Luke 15. 9.</note> nor suffer his fellows. The conversion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <p>2. It confutes them that hold, That every man is saved by his own

must needs lay the building under foot: Do not we see, that
when they were even most zealous in Ceremonies, that yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
cryed out, that God was not content, but called both for Faith
and Love. Besides, what a folly is it to think that every man shall be
saved by his own Religion? Is any thing pleasing to God, but that
which himself hath appointed in his Word? not our conceit, but his
wil is the rule of his Worship: The Word sends us to Christ, in whom
alone God is well pleased, without him there's no Salvation for any.</p>
                  <p>3. It confutes those among our selves,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> which hope to be saved
by their good meaning, good prayers, civil righteousness, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,

from the end of the Gospel, that</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Gospel calls for sanctification,<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 27.</note> and all the parts thereof, for as
the Law hath Commandments,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11.</note> so hath the Gospel; it cals for faith and
repentance,<note place="margin">Differences between the Law and the Gospel.</note> and in this latter, obedience to all the Commandments of
the Law: The differences are, 1. The Law requires obedience, but gives
no power, the Gospel doth both. 2. The Law requires strict obedience
to the utmost, the Gospel requires an upright endeavor onely, and to
believe in him who hath performed it perfectly. The Sacraments and
Sacrifices of the old Testament called for this, even for truth of heart,
for faith &amp; repentance.<note place="margin">See Exo. 12. 15.</note> God bade them circumcise the foreskin of their
hearts,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 30. 21.</note> and under that Law of purging all leaven out of their houses, the
people were called to repentance. So Baptism and the Supper of the
Lord, the appurtenances of the Gospel, call for Sanctification: And
doth any thing more cal for mortifying of our lusts, &amp; living to God,
then the death of Christ for sin, wherein we see how hainous a thing sin
is in <hi>Gods</hi> account, as also the unspeakable love of <hi>God</hi> to us, in giving
Christ thus to dye for us? The death of Christ should be a great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive
to eat our sin:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 15.</note> This was the end of Christs suffering for us; Will
Christ dye for a man,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 74.</note> and yet have no use of him after, but that he may
live as he list? assuredly God would never cause his Gospel to be
preached, but to bring men to Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>1. This confutes as well the Papists for affirming,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that we preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justification by Faith onely,<note place="margin">See Rom. 3.</note> preach a doctrine of liberty to sin;
but on the contrary, this doctrine doth notably establish good works,
as those among our selves, that cry out upon going to sermons; O, say
they, we see none worse then they, they will deceive, they will cut
their neighbors throat; but of most this is a lye: but if some be so, let

They hope to be saved by Christ, and yet remain in their lusts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mortifying the same, or giving up themselves to God in an holy
life: Thus is it with ignorant persons, prophane persons, civil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
worldlings and hypocrites; What impudent wretches are
these? They hope to be saved by Christ, and yet live in their sins,
thus making Christs death to be a license to all evil. Sundry deceive
themselves in these days, some content themselves with an outward
profession, some are haply at some times humbled, and thereupon
conceive themselves to be converted, &amp;c. but let every man try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by his Sanctification: If this was required of them that lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christs coming, who had dimmer light, and more sparing means
and promises then we, then think whats required of us that have
heaven set open to us, and all the Fathers minde revealed, yea, Christ
dead, risen, ascended, and all fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>3. For Gods children,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which do indeed hope for Salvation by
Christ, and have yielded obedience to the Gospel in some measure;
there is nothing that can become us better, then to labor to profit in
mortifying our lusts, and to shew the fruits of the Sprit more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and powerfully in our lives: Every Sermon and Sacrament
should put new life in us; For what is the profiting by the Gospel, but
to dye to sin, and live to righteousness daily, by an effectual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ Jesus: O its our great fault that we grow so slowly,
that we get not a full mastery of our lusts, that sometimes we shrink at
the yoke of Christ, as thinking some part of it too strait, and desiring
more liberty, who yet thought we could never do enough for the
Lord: O that our actions should favor so much of the flesh, and so
little of the Spirit; O that we might encrease in our zealous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to God, for his love in Christ, and for the Gospel, and that our
behavior may be daily more answerable thereto, as our Salvation doth
more nearly approach.</p>

to scare the people?</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> He spake as he was perswaded, and that truly, 1. Either in
respect of the times before Christ, it was nearer then to those under
the Law;<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 4.</note> or 2. In respect of God, to whom 1000 years are but as
one day; or 3. In respect of eternity; a thousand years are nothing
to the time to come, which is for ever, its as little as a drop of water
to the whole ocean Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But did the Apostle think that it was thus far off, and should last
thus many years as it hath since he spake this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Its likely he thought it nearer, for Christ Jesus being come, and
all the Prophesies of him fulfilled, the Gentiles called, and the mystery
of iniquity begun already to work, why might he not think this?
and though some things were yet to be accomplished touching the
calling of the Jews, yet might he think that that might quickly be
dispatched:<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> Howsoever, that that time was the last time they knew,
and that God would never speak after any new maner to his Church,
as he had done before from time to time;<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 1.</note> and the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> though
he would often signifie the end to be approaching, yet he knew it was
not to be by and by, but that some things must first fall out, though
haply he conceived that the same might have been dispatched in lesser
time then it hath been: But we have the advantage of them, because
we have the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> left to the Church, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of <hi>John,</hi> the last living Apostle, containing things to come,
from that time till the worlds end, whereof many things be already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
which makes the Book more lightsom, &amp; other things are
yet to come touching the ruine of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> calling of the <hi>Iews,</hi> destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Turks; but in what time the Lord will finish these things,
we know not: What if the day be yet some scores of years off, yea,
some few hundreds, as we may well think that is the utmost, is it not
then near by? It was near in the Apostles time, much nearer now; then
began the last time, now is the end thereof: But that is not so much
the force of the Reason, as this, That we live in the last times, nearer
the worlds end then our Forefathers before Christ, therefore ought
to minde earthly things less, and seek more after heavenly, and lead an
holy and godly life: But say the day of Judgement were not so near
as it is, yet every of our particular ends is at hand, we know not how
soon, when, where, how, to day or to morrow, and that is to us as if
the world were at an end for any use thereof; and for our state, it shall
be with us at the last day as when we dye.</p>

1. This may provoke us to Sanctification,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and a godly life, seeing
we live in the clearest times, when the last day draweth near: They
that lived long ago were to live godly, much more we, having so short
a time; we must so live, that when our Master cometh, he may finde

                  <p>
                     <hi>Be ye therefore sober,]</hi> Now of particular duties, one helps another.
The former reason strongly enforceth these duties. From the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
note,</p>
                  <p>1. That as before he exhorted to Sanctification in general, so he doth
now in particular, for we are subject to deceive our selves: Many
be good in the gross, not so in particulars; they think they love God
above all, and their neighbors too, and that they live holily, but come
to particulars, its nothing so.</p>
                  <p>2. That as he forbade the forementioned lusts and vices, so he
now exhorts to the contrary duties; the one must not be without the
other, see <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18.</p>
                  <p>In particular, we are to be sober both in the use of riches, and in
the use of pleasures, but of this last with the appurtenances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
Meat, Drink, Apparel, Recreations, we shall speak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>For sobriety in Riches:<note place="margin">Riches good in themselves.</note> Riches as Gods creatures be good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,<note place="margin">See Psal. 112. 3.</note>
and promised by God to his servants as blessings, nay, given
to some of them as blessings,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 16.</note> as to <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job, &amp;c.</hi>
They are encouragements to duty and well-doing, and may be great
helps and furtherances to us, in and unto many good duties, and that
both towards our selves (for we may spend the more time, and have
more freedom about matters of our soul) and to others, in shewing
liberality and mercy; and to the children of God that use them well,
they are as pledges of better and everlasting good things, as <hi>Canaan</hi>
was to the godly Jews a type of heaven: But it may seem needless to
speak of the goodness of riches, seeing most men count them the
onely good; but the truth must be taught, we speak of the things
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:65522:297"/>
themselves; yea, some have utterly hated them as evil, as <hi>Crates;</hi>
and among the Papists there be some that profess voluntary
poverty, but our Savior bids us not cast them away, but make friends
of them,<note place="margin">See Eph. 4. 29.</note> even employ them well to the glory of God, the giver there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and our own and others good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But our Savior calls them thorns, which choak the good seed, snares
to entangle and drown us in Perdition, and riches of iniquity, and sheweth
that its an hard thing for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> He speaks not of riches as they be in their own nature, nor
as they be well used by godly men, but as they be wickedly abused by
wicked men, either in the ill getting of them, or wicked using of
them to pride, and such bad purposes; and our Savior explaineth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 23.</note>
That its hard for a man that trusts in riches, or sets his minde up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them (as indeed most do) to be saved: Its certain that few rich
men be saved, but its not the fault of their riches, but the abusing of
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> We must do as Christs Disciples, who forsook all and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We are not bound to do as they did, for they were called to
a special and extraordinary calling to follow Christ, and go into all
the world preaching him, which could not stand with worldly busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
2. They left not these things in respect of their right to them,
but onely in the use of them; They took off their mindes from them,
and were content to part with them for Christ and the Gospels sake,
and so ought we,<note place="margin">Matth. 9. 10.</note> but they retained the right of them: <hi>Matthew</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he followed Christ, feasted Christ, and with him many Publicans in
his own house:<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 14.</note> So <hi>Peter</hi> had a Boat and Nets, and went a fishing a
little after our Savior Christ was taken from him: So that a Minister
is not bound to spend that which his friends hath left him, much less
are private persons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But the yong man was willed to sell all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It was but a particular tryal of that rich yong man that thought
himself so righteous,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 21.</note> whereby our Savior would let him see how far
off he was of that he thought was in him, in that he had not profited
so far as to prefer God and his Kingdom before his wealth, but
would rather forsake God then his riches, if he must needs part with
one, that so he might be humbled.</p>
                  <p>Though riches in themselves are good,<note place="margin">How riches are good.</note> yet 1. They are not so in
an high degree, but in a very mean and low degree, in respect of God,
Spiritual Graces, and the Kingdom of Heaven; In comparison of
these they are but dross and dung: The leavings of the love we bear
to those, is too much for the world; fervent love to these, lukewarm
to the world is good enough. 2. They are not good absolutely, but
as they are used; to the godly they be good, when they use them well,
else not, but they are at no time good to the ungodly, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
use them well: Therefore concerning riches its required, 1. That
the party who would use them must be in the favor of God, a Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
person, restored unto Christ by a right thereto, which we lost by
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:65522:297"/>
our sin in <hi>Adam:</hi> Else we shall taint Gods blessings by our sins, we
shall be ready to use them to bad purposes, if we be bad our selves,
and the things which be good in themselves, shall be turned into sin
to us; for unto the unclean, all things are unclean: Extreamly foolish
is their practice that labor to have all good things about them, House,
Land, Corn, Cattle, Houshold-stuff, Money, &amp;c. they themselves
remaining bad, for these be never good to them, till they themselves
be sanctified; and hence it is that as most men go to work, they use
riches to the hurt of their souls, yea, to their own destruction, which
could they have sobriety in them, they might easily avoid. 2. That
he use them a right, even with sobriety.</p>
                  <p>For sobriety in riches;<note place="margin">Wherein so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in riches consists.</note> Its either in the desire and seeking them, or
using and employing them, we must seek them soberly, we must also
use them soberly when we have them.</p>
                  <p>Sobriety in seeking or getting them is in many things: 1. We must
seek them according to their worth, first, Heavenly and Spiritual
things, then these; we must not in our judgement value them equal,
much less above Grace, the favor of God, and Heaven; we must
not in our affection so love them, nor in our practice seek after them so
earnestly as for grace; every thing is comely in his place and time:
A Servant whiles he keeps his place is a comely necessary help, but if
he begin to control his Master, to usurp his Masters Chair, to woo his
Mistris,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> &amp;c. its intollerable: So while riches be content with the
place of Servants, to be at their masters appointment to good uses,
its well; but when they shall perk up above Spiritual graces, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things, and get away the heart from God, and our heavenly
Husband Christ Jesus, then they are to be turn'd out of doors, and
stampt under foot, for in comparison of these, they are as the basest
pibble stone to the most precious Stone or Diamond. 2. We must
not set down with our selves that we will be rich (for then if lawful
means should fail, we would use any other, transgress even for a piece
of bread;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9.</note> they that will be rich, fall into divers temptations and
snares) but herein shew a moderate minde.<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 20.</note> 3. We must not make haste
to be rich, but must be content to stay our time, and wait the Lords
leisure, till he bless our labors with fruitful encrease: A man must not
run out assoon as he seeth a booty,<note place="margin">See Prov. 20, 21. and 28. 20, 22.</note> lest there be Enemies by in ambush,
which may make us a booty, but must consider well ere we go about
it; haply it was onely held out as a tryal from God, or a trap by the
Devil to catch us: They be thorns, if we rush upon them hastily, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we be well fenced and prepared we shall hereby harm our selves.
4. We must seek them with a quiet and contented minde, and not with
an unsatiable appetite, such as can never be satisfied, but thirsteth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
after more. 5. We must seek them onely by lawful means,
and not otherwise; not with the neglect of good duties to God, our
Souls, or Families, &amp;c. or hudling them up, much less by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
evils, as by Lying, Swearing, Sabbath breaking, Deceit, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,<note place="margin">See Mat. 16. 26.</note>
&amp;c. nor by Gaming, &amp;c. This were to seek them with the
dishonor of God, and loss of our souls for trash. 6. We must not
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:65522:298"/>
affect, seek, or desire after abundance and superfluity, but for things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
not for necessity of nature, but for necessity of a mans estate,
condition and calling: Thus a Prince, Nobleman or Magistrate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a greater Portion to maintain their Estate, and those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on them; So a Minister, to maintain himself and his, and that he
may follow his Study, and buy Books; and herein we may desire so
much as may be competently sufficient, as well for our selves, as for
all that belong to us, &amp; that not onely to maintain them while we live,
but to leave them somewhat according to our state when we dye; yea,
and that whilest we live we may be enabled to do some good in our
places towards the relief of the poor,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 35.</note> it being a more blessed thing
to give then to receive: To ask or desire more to spend superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
we have no warrant, yea, so to ask or desire, were a sign of
distrust: Not but that the things themselves are good, how great a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever we have of them, if we could use them to good uses; but
our corrupt nature is subject, both to dote upon them, trust in them, be
lifted up by them, and the Devil to fasten many dangerous temptations
on us, by the means of them, and therefore we should not desire such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of them:<note place="margin">See Prov. 30. 8.</note> If God should cast such abundance on us, by honest
labor in following our calling, or otherwise, we ought humbly to beg
a great deal of grace and fear, our stewardship and account being now
far greater:<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> asked food and raiment; and we are willed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be content, they be not good absolutely, and to every man; and
many have taken hurt by them, few at any time made better; where
poverty hath slain a thousand, riches hath slain ten thousand: They be
never almost mentioned in Scripture, but with one check or other (as
thorns, snares, uncertain, deceitful, meat that perisheth, unrighteous
Mammon, &amp;c.) that we may not be in love with them.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth the common practice of most men in the world,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
that be stark drunk with these things, and seek them without all
bounds, which is also the fault even of some of Gods Servants: O
how many seek them before grace and heavenly things, do altogether
labor for the meat that perisheth! O how many will work all the six
days long, but in the mean time do nothing for their soul, yea, on the
Sabbath do no more then an outward performance of duty to satisfie
Law, and for fashions sake, their tongues and hearts running after the
world! God and grace are not in their thoughts: A little of this is
enough, yea and then onely, when they can follow the world no
longer; and thus with most the greedy desires after the world eats up
all thought of any goodness: Hence it is that they are wise for the
world, but stark fools in matters of Religion; of that they can talk
all the day long, but cannot speak three words savorly of any good
thing; They abound in wealth, but have not so much as a dram of
grace, nor look after none; rich in the world, but to Godward, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
poor, blinde, naked souls.</p>
                  <p>2. How do numbers set down with themselves to be rich,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> &amp; thus much
to give to such a childe, &amp;c? how also many are even mad in making
haste to be rich, up early, down late, by right, wrong, &amp;c. yea, make
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:65522:298"/>
such haste, as they break their shins, nay, make waste of their souls?
What, will they flie before they be fledged? must they needs get up
all at once? cannot they tarry, and rise as God will have them, but
by getting other mens goods into their hands, or running into the
Usurers books, undo both themselves and others? what purchasing
is there before men be fit, when haply they have not half the money
to lay down, but for the rest must be beholding to the Usurer, and
so fall into the Kites paws? Thus some have lost their own livings
which have been competent, by reaching at more before they were
fit; others, though they have not thus undone themselves, yet much
straiten themselves, shame and disgrace themselves, are still in debt,
live barely and miserably, who might else live at elbow room and
comfortably: How many are so unsatiable and greedy, that like
Hell and the Grave, they still cry, <hi>Give, give;</hi> they have the dropsie,
and their thirst can never be quenched: They are like a great Hound
standing at the tables end, give him one piece of meat, he swallows
it down without chewing, looking on your face presently for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
There's no end of Lying, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
and false Weights and Wares, Oppression, Wrongful deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. and all to be rich in the world; nay, when men have
both competency and sufficiency, yet do they still eagerly follow it,
with as hot a pursuit as if they had nothing: O how odious this is
in Gods sight! this Covetousness is Idolatry; yet, as if one should
have told <hi>Nabal,</hi> after he had so blockishly sent away <hi>Davids</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that he was Covetous, he would have said, Nay, but a good
husband; so who can perswade these hereof? This is a kinde of
drunkenness, as the moderate seeking of riches, soberness; neither
can two things be more like, then are drunkards and covetous persons.</p>
                  <p>1. Both be insensible,<note place="margin">A comparison between drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness and immoderate seeking of riches.</note> ye cannot beat any good thing in either of their
heads: Though the one reel as he goes, and cannot so much as speak
a wise word, yet you cannot perswade him that he is drunk; and
though the other doth both pinch himself and others, yet he will not
believe that he is covetous.</p>
                  <p>2. Both be insatiable; The drunkard must have pot after pot, is
never satisfied, but still dry; So the covetous man must joyn Farm
unto Farm, House unto House, Land unto Land; The one calls in

                  <p>3. Both be inserviceable; who will put a drunkard in any office? what
employment is he fit for? So a covetous man, he will so look to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
gain,<note place="margin">Exod. 18. 21.</note> as he will neglect the publique; he will have something clear
to himself,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 3.</note> of that's committed to him, or will take bribes, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
fees; Therefore it is, that both Magistrates and Ministers are
willed to avoid this.</p>
                  <p>4. Both be incorrigible; Theres no hope of an old drunkard, few of
them repent; so of a covetous man, its a rare thing to see a <hi>Zacheus:</hi>
That story begins with a word of Note, <hi>Behold:</hi> The vilest drunkard is
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:65522:299"/>
not more odious to God,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 3.</note> then is a wicked covetous man: God would
not have covetousness to be once named amongst us;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11. and 6. 10.</note> yea, he forbids to
keep company with one that is covetous, &amp; pronounceth that such shal
not inherit his kingdom. Covetousness is the root of all evil, the breach
of all the ten Commandments; it takes away our Love, Fear, and Trust
in God, and gives it to Wealth, yea, it hinders from the very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God: Through it many have society with Idolaters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of it, how many thousand oathes are sworn daily? how many
daily forsworn? what regard bear such to the Word? either because
of their Farms and Oxen they will not come thereto,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 14.</note> of if they do,
they are so toiled by the world,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31.</note> that they sleep thereat; or if they do
hearken, they do but mock, at least go not away much the better,
their mindes being all the while ranging, and they hearing onely as
one in a dream. Hereby also they neglect prayer, and are either kept
from the Sacrament, or come prophanely; hereby also do they infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
break the Sabbath, as in buying, selling, riding, talking of
worldly matters, &amp;c. Thus also many Parents through niggardliness,
spoil their children for want of education, Migistrates take bribes to
prevent Justice, Ministers ingross livings, people pull away their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
maintenance, servants deceive their Masters, Princes pole
their Subjects,<note place="margin">See Prov. 1. 19.</note> and Subjects withdraw their taxes and dues from
them: Through this many lose their lives, as <hi>Naboth:</hi> There's much
contention both within doors and without for trifles; so many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
prostitute themselves, and their husbands wink thereat because
of advantage; and many to avoid charge, which as they think would
come by marriage, live in uncleanness: From hence also what cousen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
and deceivings do arise in buying, selling, letting, hiring, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing,
lending, partnership, &amp;c.? what simony, sacriledge, bribery,
usury, &amp;c? how also are lyes multiplyed hereby? and how many
Tale-carriers are there meerly for this respect? yea, there's no vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
in this world so odious to God and man, which through cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
men will not commit, and therefore it was no wonder that
<hi>David</hi> prayed that his heart might not be enclined hereto.<note place="margin">Psal. 119 36.</note> O what a
folly and madness is it, for men to seek so greedily after these things,
which yet oftentimes are the further from them; but admit thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest
them, are they able to purchase for thee a pardon of thy sins?
Can they pacifie Gods wrath? Can they prolong thy days one hour?
Doth thy Salvation stand in these? mayest thou not soon be deprived
thereof? Shalt thou tarry long with them? Is there not vexation in
them? If thou shouldest long enjoy them, yet having no grace in thy
heart, no assurance of <hi>Gods</hi> favor, no hope of a better life, wo unto thee,
and yet this is the state of thousands: They only minde earthly things,
having no regard of Heavenly or Spiritual Grace, and so living here
basely for a while, without enjoying the benefit of that they have, they
are at the length snatched away, and then the world strives for their
goods, and the Devil for their souls. As an Ass that caries Plate all
day, at night is turn'd into a foul stable, or bare Pasture to nob on
Thistles, and that with a galled back; so are they turn'd out with a
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:65522:299"/>
galled and guilty conscience,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and a soul laden with innumerable sins,
and so sink down to Hell, there to be for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Art thou guilty hereof? Repent, endeavor to see thy folly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
cry to God, make restitution of that which thou hast taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
seek for pardon, for grace, for sanctification: O that it might
be said to thee,<note place="margin">Luke 19. 9.</note> as to <hi>Zacheus, This day is salvation come to thy house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Art thou free of this poyson, beware thou beest not tainted herewith,
of all evils its the most dangerous and damnable, and most hardly
rooted out: Esteem of these things as they ought, but chiefly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
for your part in those true riches, which shall never be taken
away.</p>
                  <p>Its the fault of Christians, that they seek the world too eagerly, and
neglect many good duties for it, run into unwarrantable courses, are
unquiet, contentious, &amp;c. whereby they make themselves and their
Profession to be ill spoken of: O how ill doth this beseem Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
which have God to be their Father, and Heaven for their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and portion! Fye upon it; Is this to behave our selves Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?
we should carry our selves so moderately in these things, that
we may make the world see and say,<note place="margin">Iohn 4. 32.</note> we have riches that they know
not of, as our Savior said, <hi>He had meat his Disciples knew not of;</hi> we
must labor to grow in grace, and covet the best things.</p>
                  <p>For the second part of sobriety, which is in the use of riches when
we have them, it hath relation either to our minde, when we esteem
of them; or our practice, when we employ them as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                  <p>1. We must esteem of them but as they are,<note place="margin">We must not set our mindes too much on riches.</note> and not set our mindes
overdeeply on them, as if the having of them were our happiness,
the want of them our utter misery: Neither must we think the more
highly of our selves,<note place="margin">Psal. 62. 10.</note> because of them; for goodness is that onely
which makes us of account with God and good men: when we go
down to the grave we be all fellows, nor ought we to trust in them,
as though they could be a Castle and Tower against whatsoever may
come upon us, Plague, War, Famine, &amp;c. This is the common sin
of the world, yea, even Gods Servants may partly perceive that their
hearts rise as their wealth encreaseth: O its hard for a man to keep down
his heart that it swell not! Nor must we be excessively loath to part
with them when God sees it good, nor cast down when we have any
loss, as if we had lost happiness: O how many are thus grieved, which
were never grieved for their sins, nor wept for fear of Gods wrath
and condemnation! we should grieve indeed for our sins, or if we do
not feel Gods favor, or observe any decay in our love to God and
goodness, but not as worldly losses, especially enjoying Gods favor,
and having through Christ an assured hope of a better life.</p>
                  <p>2. We must employ them as God requires,<note place="margin">We must em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them as God requires.</note> and that both on our

of his own house:<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 30.</note> But what base misers are they that cannot afford
themselves or theirs necessaries in food and raiment? They are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
with an evil sickness; They are Thieves to their backs, bellies,
families: neither are those prodigal rioters in a better case, which
waste and consume all in sports, company keeping, and belly-cheer;
they rob their wives, their children, their friends, the poor, and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
dye in the Goal, leaving their children to misery.</p>
                  <p>Others,<note place="margin">Prov. 3. 9.</note> as upon the worship and service of God, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
of the Gospel and Ministers thereof, for the good of our own
souls.</p>
                  <p>So upon the King and Commonwealth, under whom we enjoy
Peace and the Gospel, as also upon the Poor, especially the
Saints, See <hi>Deut. 15. 10. Psal. 37. 25, 26. Psal. 112. Prov. 11. 23.
Matth. 5. Luke 14. Heb.</hi> 13. And this we must do,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 34, 37.</note> not onely of our
superfluity, but in some cases even of our necessity, of our very Lands;
we are not Lords of our goods, but Stewards for which we must be
countable to our master.</p>
                  <p>This rebuketh those that are all for themselves, as for any other,
either they will not bestow any thing at all, or no more then needs
must, and most Christians are too nigardly: For the worship of God,
some think that any thing bestowed this way is too much, that this is
the worst and idlest money bestowed this may be; they could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with a blinde Sir, that would live of crusts; and if they can pull
away the Tithes, and make a bargain with a Minister half for nought,
they think it well gotten; and many that might procure the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word to them, onely the want is, their hearts are so glued
to the world, they had rather have their Hogs, then Christs compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
among them: The blinde devotion in times of Popery to build
Churches and Religious Houses, will condemn the wretchedness of
our times; If a Church be but decayed in our days, there must be a
Collection all over the Countrey, if not many Shires, for the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
hereof: And how do men hide and conceal their Estates, that
they may be freed from the paying of Subsidies and Taxes, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the King of his due? And what wincing is there for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the poor, the true poor? If it were not out of the fear of
Law and Justice, they would pay nothing, or as good as nothing:
Hath not God made many promises? what unbelievers are these that
will not take Gods word? Their goods thus spared prosper not long,
for God will be true; hence come so many changes of owners, even
because men get and keep their goods unlawfully.</p>
                  <p>Thus many instead of wealth, leave their children an heap of chaff
that blows away: God will rifle in such goods; and besides at the
last day, what account and bills will these be able to bring in? that
they spent all on themselves, or wasted all in riot, or spared all from
those good uses they should: Their bills will not be taken, they shall
hear this sentence, <hi>O evil and unfaithful servant, thou hast been untrusty
in a little, who shall trust thee with more, take him hence, binde him hand
and foot, &amp;c.</hi> but to those that have employed them well, it shall be
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:65522:300"/>
said, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, &amp;. Well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
servant, thou hast been faithful in a little, enter into thy Masters
joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O then let us learn this sobriety: We have an enemy to resist, who
if we be drunk with the love of the world, will assuredly have his
will of us; and is not the end of all things at hand? If we be drunk
when our Lord and Master cometh, what shall be our portion? we
must dye; we dye daily in our neighbors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And watch unto prayer,]</hi> This is not to be understood of the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
waking of the eye from sleep, though the Papists so transfer it,
and therefore keep certain Vigils and Watches for Saints, certain
nights of the year (though upon occasion,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 148.</note> we ought with <hi>David</hi> to
keep our eyes waking in the night, that we may praise God, and pray
unto him) but its meant of a spiritual watchfulness, whereby we have
an eye to our hearts and ways, that we do nothing against the will of
God, but may ever be doing that which is good and acceptable in
his fight, which is a notable help to further a man in a godly life to
the kingdom of heaven; and this is performed by those onely, who
having obtained mercy of God, and assurance of pardon, see cause
why they should turn to him, serve him, and give themselves wholly
to him.</p>
                  <p>This watchfulness is well put after sobriety,<note place="margin">Watchfulness why set after sobriety.</note> as sobriety is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it to make way for the same; for as a man drunk with wine, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep awake, but sleeps like a Hog, so he that is drunk with the
cares of this life, cannot watch spiritually.</p>
                  <p>This watching is a looking to our hearts and all our ways,<note place="margin">What watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness is.</note> that we
may be always kept from evil, and ever in a good course. Therefore
as Watchmen use to examine all Passengers, and accordingly deal
with them, so ought we to watch against all enemies, which are, evil
thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds, which do either directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from our own ill heart, or by the temptation of Satan and the
world. To prevent evil thoughts, we must keep the heart with all
diligence:<note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> This is the fountain that sends forth such streams; the
furnace from whence comes such sparks. If our thoughts be wicked,
impatient, unclean, proud, &amp;c. we must suppress them, and beat
them down; but if good, holy and pure, let them pass for true men;
so we must <hi>take heed to our ways,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 39. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>that we sin not with our tongues.</hi> Our
tongue is a slippery member,<note place="margin">Iames 3. 2.</note> an unruly evil, able (as little as it is) to
do much hurt, and he is a perfect man, and able to rule all his body,
that can rule his tongue; we must therefore set a watch before the
door of our lips, and examine all our words. And for evil actions,
we must also beware of them, we must take heed to our ways, watch
all parts and members of our bodies, that no ill action break forth,
and accordingly as <hi>Job</hi> Covenanted with his eyes,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 1.</note> we must with every
member. We must examine every action at our going about it; if
any evil one pass from us, and break, as it were through the watch, we
must be grieved and repent, and thereafter be more watchful: As the
eye-sight and eye-lid are necessary in the body, so is watchfulness in
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:65522:301"/>
the soul; we are continually in danger of falling, the Devil, the
world and our own lusts be our enemies; if we suffer them to break
in upon us, we dishonor God, and spoil our selves of our peace and
comfort: And as we must watch against all evil, so must we especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
against those we be most subject to, as wise and careful Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
will have most care of the weakest parts of their City: And as
we must watch to keep out evil, so must we to do good, and that
both privately and publikely, towards God, our selves, and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
And not this onely, but watch that we do good as we ought
to do, in a right maner; we must look to our hearts in our callings,
and in our best duties, for even then they will beguile us, and the
right maner of performance is all in all: Thus in prayer we must
watch against private pride, hypocrisie, wandering thoughts, &amp;c.
so in the Word, against Infidelity, prejudicate Opinions, &amp;c.
this must be all the day through, and in our particular actions; for
its not enough to have a general purpose of well-doing,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> or of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
life,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 17. and 28. 14.</note> but we must look to every particular action through the day;
we must not be good by wholesale,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 10.</note> but by retale; not in the sum and
gross, but even in particulars; there must not at any time be an evil
heart in us, we must be in the fear of the Lord continually. As in
journeying (suppose to <hi>York</hi>) we ask not onely whether it be East,
West, North or South, but through what Shires we must go, nay,
by what great Towns, nay, by what Villages, nay, we ask what
turnings there are from such a place, to such a place, nay, what marks
we shall meet withal, as Windmils, Crosses, &amp;c. And as a great
mans servant, sets not down onely received 100 or 500 l. and laid
out so much in the gross, but particularly, what he received of such
a one, and what of another, and what he laid out for this, what for
that,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 75.</note> &amp;c. so should we observe every particular, and that throughout
the whole course of our lives:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17. and 4. 2.</note> There's no time for security or sin, we
must not at any time give way either unto evil,<note place="margin">Why we ought to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> or that evil one.</p>
                  <p>That we ought to be thus watchful, may appear; 1. For that we have
within us corrupt and wretched hearts, which continually lust after
evil, and are untoward to any good, being also subtile and deceitful
above all things. 2. The Devil a most malicious and watchful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,<note place="margin">Zech. 3. 1.</note>
is at our elbows always, yea, in our best actions, as he was
at <hi>Joshua</hi>'s right hand to resist him: The world also affords many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.
3. The love of God towards us in Christ, pardoning our
sins, and calling us to the hope of eternal happiness, being so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and unspeakable; must we not therefore so watch in all things,
as that we may do nothing to grieve so good and merciful a Father,
but be careful in all things to be acceptable in his sight. 4. Our Lords
coming is uncertain, we must therefore be like the diligent servant,
with our loyns girded, and lights burning; we must be like the five
wise virgins, with oyl in our lamps, attending the coming of our Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom:
This is no more then Gods requires of us, no more then <hi>Noah,
Henoch</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> performed; they walked with <hi>God,</hi> set themselves
continually as in Gods presence, in an heedful care to all their ways:
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:65522:301"/>
This is no more then needs, if either we consider the price of sin, the
inclination of our own hearts, and what enemies the Devil and world
are to us. Neither doth this watchfulness hinder us from any thing
but sin; from no liberty, but that that is nought and hurtful, and that
we may as well spare, as water out of our shoes; it hinders not from
our calling, onely requires us to pray first, now a whet is no let, we
shall speed the better all the day after; it onely teacheth us how to be
in our calling, not as drudges to the world, but the servants of God;
it hinders us not from buying and selling, but from Craft, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Corruption in the same; not from company, but from vanity
and unprofitableness in company; not from mirth, but from vain
wicked mirth; so that its so far from being a bondage, that its blessed
liberty: Some think that thus we shall pinion and binde our hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
us, and that this is too strait: Its true, to our nature that hath
been used to so much liberty,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it will seem strait at first, till we be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to it, and then it will be found easie and pleasant; even as
a new sute of apparrel, though never so fit, yet will seem strait at the
first putting on, which afterwards it will not: Such pretences are but
as a Lyon in the way of a Sluggard.</p>
                  <p>The benefits ensuing hereby are divers:<note place="margin">Benefits of watchfulness.</note> 1. It keeps from many
sins, whereunto else we must needs fall ere we be aware, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
from many sorrows, both outward and inward; from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
crosses and troubles,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 17.</note> from many heart-smarts and wounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
Whatsoever is a mean to keep a man from sin, is a blessed
friend of his. 2. It keeps us from lying still in any sin, and is a mean <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
to raise us up by true repentance; for if it cannot prevent it, yet it
will no suffer us to sleep in it, nor be quiet, nor go to bed till we
have vomited it up, and so is a mean to keep our hearts from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Lying in sin hardens the heart, and provokes God against us,
so that when we would, we cannot rise, nor tell how to go about it,
and when we do, yet we do not so easily obtain pardon and peace:
Often reckonings make long friends. 3. It keeps us from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
foul sins, for lightly men fall not far at once, but by little and
little; neither is this a small benefit, for though every sin be hurtful
to the soul, yet great sins do it more hurt. A little jerk with a wand
makes us skip, and puts life into us, as it were, but a blow with a
Cudgel or Leaver dazles us; so little sins make us stir up our selves,
and put more care in us through Gods mercy, whereas great sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb
and dazle the conscience. 4. It makes us see the corruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
and naughtiness of our own hearts, and so to be the humbler; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to see Gods mercy in keeping us from so many evils, whereof we
are in continual danger, that so we may be the more exceedingly
thankful. 5. It upholds our communion with the blessed Majesty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
of God, and the peace of our conscience, which is a continual feast.
6. Its a special argument that we are the children of God: All the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
while we do thus, we go on in the strait way, we do as few do, as
none but Gods servants, none but zealous Christians do. 7. It makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
our lives the more fruitful to our selves and our brethren by many
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:65522:302"/>
degrees. 8. It makes us fit both to live and dye, to live and perform
the good duties that God requireth, for a heart well ordered is fitter
to pray, to hear, to come to the Sacraments, &amp;c. our accounts be
the sooner made, and so it being done daily, its done more easily,
then if it be put off to a great deal together. To dye, as being always
fit and ready for our Lords coming.</p>
                  <p>1. This being a thing so necessary and profitable,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> we have cause to
lament that we have known it no better, nor had acquaintance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal:
for alas, not to speak of the common sort, which look after
no such matter, but will do as they list, though they smart for it
eternally, even among the people of God, how little is it known
that God requireth such a particular care and watch? that its a thing
possible, but rather impossible, or at least most irksom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
content themselves with a general purpose to do well; and if
they be careful on the Sabbath day to look to their heart, tongue and
ways, and keep within compass, yet that they ought and must thus
do on other days, few think. Hence it is that we fall into so many
evils to Gods dishonor, our own discomfort, the ill example of
others, and reproach of our profession: What though we have no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the morning to do ill (as some wicked have not) yet may we not
through want of watchfulness fal ere we be aware, as <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Seeing this is a part of Gods Counsel,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and he that bids we
should not steal, should keep the Sabbath, &amp;c. bids us watch; let
us know, its not safe for us to neglect it, when God hath made
known the same to us: Is it not pity that such a blessed mean to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
us so sweetly to heaven through this world, should be so little
known, and so few have help by it? O if we would once enter upon
it, it would save us from many dangers, it would make our life fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
it would bring us so much unwonted peace, as we would be so
far from being weary of it, that we would be grieved that we have
been strangers from it so long, and came to the acquaintance and use
of it no sooner. O let us grieve and crave pardon for neglecting such

but when it comes to be cut, is stretched out into many mens uses;
so our love must be stretched out to many persons, to many duties;
as in giving and doing good to body, soul, goods, good-name, and
that not sparingly, but liberally, so in forgiving both much and often;
neither must this be onely when we can well do it, or when we have
nothing else to do, but when its against our profit, pleasure, ease, &amp;c.
so as we neglect not our selves too much, and thereby more pleasure
may be done our neighbors, then hinderance come to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons</hi> hereof may be these,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. Gods love towards us is fervent,
and reacheth out into innumerable favors, for our bodies, souls, goods,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
good-name, &amp;c. and that continually, forgiving also our daily offences,
and bestowing his own Son on us. 2. A little love will be easily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
quenched and hindred by the Devil and his instruments, whereunto
our brittle nature most readily yieldeth.</p>
                  <p>This is not such a love as that whereby the fornicator loves his
harlot,<note place="margin">Use.</note> one enemy to goodness loves another: This is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:65522:303"/>
upon any transitory thing, or common gifts, but is for grace: We
love thus, not for any by-respects, but because God requireth of us
so to love; this is agreeable to the Word of God, and therein we
must principally aym at the good of our neighbors souls: to perswade
ones friend to that for preferment, which he cannot do with a good
conscience; or being sick, to perswade him to send for a Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
or woman, or to disswade him from suffering for a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
&amp;c. is rather hatred then love: Had our Savior followed <hi>Peters</hi>
advice, and not gone up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for to suffer, we had all perished
eternally. But of this before.</p>
                  <p>For charity shall cover the multitude of sins.] <hi>The Reason,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There will be through our corruption and frailty of nature, many
offences one against another, therefore must we labor for love to
cover them.</p>
                  <p>The Papists interpret the words thus, That our love to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
will merit at Gods hand forgiveness of our sins; but we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before God by Faith in Christ Jesus, before we can do any good
work; neither can we love God or our neighbor for his sake, till we
be assured of his love to us in pardoning our sins. True, the more we
love our brethren, the more we may be assured of Gods mercy to us,
and that we be pardoned, and that he will still shew us mercy, but
not by desert: That opposition <hi>Prov. 10. 12. Hatred stirreth up strifes,
but love covereth all sins,</hi> sheweth plainly, that this is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Faults that love covers,<note place="margin">What sins love covers.</note> be of two sorts, namely, sins against God,
and wrongs against our selves.</p>
                  <p>Against God,<note place="margin">Sins against God.</note> whether they be natural infirmities or others, so they
be not notorious acts, or continued wicked courses of bad men; as
love will not be suspitious, but hope the best, till it know an evil
committed, and interpret things charitably; so those that be faults,
yet love will not blaze them abroad, but keeps them in, and admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the party; it utters them not where they be not known, to his
disgrace, and so uncovers his shame and rejoyceth therein, as <hi>Cham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against our selves;<note place="margin">Sins against our selves.</note> for those that be small ones, it passeth them by,
takes no notice of them, but treads them under foot; for those that be
somewhat greater, it will be content with any reason; for those that
do touch us to the quick, in our names, and goods, it will forgive the
wrong and the revenge, but yet it may seek his own right and due,
and that by the benefit of the Magistrate; where note, that he must see,
1. That it be not for trifles.<note place="margin">On what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects we may seek redress by the Magistrate</note> 2. Not till all other ways more peaceable
have been offered and refused. 3. That its then without revenge to
the party, or hatred, and without denying any Christian duty to him;
love will cover a multitude of these, committed by sundry men, or
ift be by the same party: As God covers our infirmities, and accepts
of our true desires; and Parents put up much at their Childrens hands,
and do not revenge themselves by beating them by and by; so must
we by love cover the infirmities one of another.</p>
                  <p>By both these its evident and plain,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that there is but a little love in
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:65522:303"/>
the world, and that our selves are very short in this duty, whether we
try it by covering of faults against our selves, or of mens faults against
God: O how the world rejoyceth to talk of the faults of Professors!
how will yong Professors be censuring whom they like not? and
what censuring, and backbiting, and slandering is there of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
what telling tales and talking one of another?</p>
                  <p>That we may cover mens faults committed against God,<note place="margin">How we may cover faults committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</note> we must
1. Minde our own matters. 2. Think of better things. 3. Rebuke
the tellers of such things, and stop our ears from hearing the same.</p>
                  <p>That we may cover their faults committed against us;<note place="margin">Against our selves.</note> call to
minde, 1. That we be subject to offend them, and need their forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
2. That God requires it, who forgives us a multitude of sins.
3. That there can be no better argument that our sins be forgiven, then
our forgiving of others; as there can be no better motive to God to
shew us mercy, then for us to be merciful. 4. That Christ forgave
those that wronged him.</p>
                  <p>If we can bear nothing,<note place="margin">Use.</note> its a sign of little love: O that we could
think it a glory to forgive and pass by offences, whereas we now count
it a disgrace, and that we are no body, if we revenge not: This hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
not, but that we may admonish each other, but that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
may punish faults committed, but that the Minister may preach
against sin: Neither doth this warrant that we should slatter or daub
one another, yet must not we point out a particular person, unless it
be upon an extraordinary occasion.</p>

                     <hi>Gaius, Onesephirus,</hi> &amp;c. were notable examples; so we read of
some that gathered for others, and sent unto them in their necessity:
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:65522:304"/>
This Land hath done commendably this way, in relieving the French
and Dutch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. God who requires this duty of us, is merciful, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> should we be so. 2. These with widows and fatherless are
most shiftless, most heavy hearted, least regarded in the world, easiest
trodden down, unable to requite good, or resist evil; therefore God
hath taken the charge of them, both to defend them from wrongs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and to requite the good which is done them. 3. We must not adde
affliction to affliction,<note place="margin">Obad. 10.</note> that's not to be endured; but we must help bear
their burthen, comfort their hearts, refresh their bowels; Its enough
for them that they are fain to forsake Land, House, Friends, and all for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Christ sake. 4. This will keep them from impatience, murmuring, and
many other temptations; as also from falling into their Enemies
hands bodily, or from forfeiting a good conscience by recanting,
whereunto in likelyhood they would be driven through our unkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. This helps strengthen their faith in Gods promise, that he will
provide for them, which forsake any thing for his cause; when we use
hospitallity towards such, then is this promise fulfilled, and we help
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> them to believe. 6. Hereby also we provoke them to break out into
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> many praises to God, and to pour forth many prayers for us. 7. We
know not how soon their case may be ours; now if it were, would we
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> not be kindely used? 8. Thus we shall express our thankfulness to
God, in that we our selves are not driven from our own homes.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 9. Hereby also we shall declare a good Testimony of our love, and
so of our faith; for seeing they can never requite us, therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> its laid up with God. 10. It shall not be forgotten with the Lord,
but rewarded here and hereafter; never did any lose by kindeness to
strangers:<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 42.</note> He that receiveth a Prophet, &amp;c. shall receive a Prophets
reward; that is, such a reward as a Prophet may be like by his office
to help them to from the Lord; so such a reward as a righteous man
may help them to; look upon all the forementioned examples, and
they clear the same:<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 34.</note> But were there none here, that Scripture, <hi>Come ye
blessed of my Father,</hi> would suffice to draw us on to the performance of
this duty.</p>
                  <p>O let us be ready in performing this duty,<note place="margin">Use.</note> let us put to our helping
hand, let us shore them up, that they s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ink not: Neither must we thus
do onely to strangers of other Countreys, but even to those in our
own Land, in the time of persecution; So also if we hear of their
great losses by fire, or otherwise (especially being authorized) let us
extend our charitable benevolence on them for their relief, and though
we our selves do not harbor them, yet if we help to build up or repair
their Houses, &amp;c. we perform this duty: Sundry among us do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tollerably that way, but for the mercies of others, they are cruel;
Its a sign that those never tasted of Gods mercy, which are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without the bowels of mercy.</p>

those whom we harbor, and the House is the stronger that night, as
<hi>Lots</hi> was; yea, we entertain more then Angels: <hi>For he that receiveth
one of these little ones, receiveth me,</hi> saith Christ: Who would not be

                  <p>If I could obtain a Son,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> having none, or being dead, to have him raised

even such things as may be for the good, both of our own souls
and theirs.</p>
                  <p>And if even those which in likelyhood have done thus onely in
civil courtesie have not been unrewarded, how much less shall they,
which do it for Conscience sake?</p>
                  <p>2. For our own poor:<note place="margin">The regard we are to have of our own poor.</note> Its best to maintain them at their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
with that which their own labor will not attain, and not suffer
them to go from door to door, except when they bring home their
work, or come out upon occasion of some sickness, to make known
their necessities: But many are forced out, as being neglected at home.
Besides their maintenance at home, its meet also for them of ability
now and then to bid them home to their houses, to warm them at their
fires; and that not onely at the Festival time of the Nativity of our
Lord Christ, but upon other occasions, as the day of our deliverance
from the Powder-Treason, &amp;c. So its meet, that every Lords day
we should take home with us a poor body or two, who are best mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
most diligent in their Callings, bring up their Children well, &amp;c.
to encourage them in goodness,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 13.</note> and that they may bear their burthen
the more chearfully:<note place="margin">Isa. 58. 7.</note> This is even in special enjoyned to us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us;<note place="margin">Iob 31. 17.</note> and thus doubtless did both <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how are the poor by most in most places neglected?<note place="margin">Whence it is that the poor are so much neglected.</note> Hereof
there are two chief causes: 1. Wicked Covetousness, which hath
so prevailed with some, that they are mad for the world, and insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
thinking all lost that goes besides themselves: Some rich keep
no house; some have many Farms, and for any good they do, it were
better they had none; some live basely and miserably, &amp;c. 2. Pride
in building, apparel, sumptuous dyet, whereby they are drawn so
dry, that nothing is to be had of them: For the former, they covet
an ill covetousness to their own house, it being the way to pull it
down; and for the latter, their bravery will be turned into rags: God
blesseth not the Children of either the one or other; The Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill Tenants, and not paying their Rent, God will turn out the
Children. O how many, by sparing more then is right, come to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?<note place="margin">Iames 2. 13.</note>
Being merciless, they shall have judgement without mercy; stop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping
their ears at the cry of the poor,<note place="margin">Prov. 21. 13.</note> they themselves shall cry, and
not be heard: They send away the poor, as <hi>Nabal</hi> did <hi>Davids</hi> messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and bid them <hi>Go, &amp;c.</hi> and it shall be said to them at the last day,
<hi>Go ye cursed, &amp;c.</hi> If thou wouldst be merciful to the poor, thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
be blessed in all thou puttest thine hands unto; if thou wouldst
sow liberally, thou mightst reap liberally; thy Children might be
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:65522:305"/>
blest,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 29.</note> thou mightst have a good name, and be mourned for, as <hi>Dorcas;</hi>
thou shouldst not partake in the evil to come, thou shouldst hear a
joyful Sentence on the last day.</p>
                  <p>3. For inviting one another:<note place="margin">Inviting of one another, how useful.</note> Its a means for watering love, much
good comes by it, and the contrary strangeness doth hurt: In many
places its neglected, and that out of pride; for they cannot or will
not meet, but with so great cost and variety, that men be the worse for
it a quarter after; if Christians would meet like Christians, for society,
and not for meat, and be content with one dish or two, it were much
better, and then it might be oftner.</p>
                  <p>This duty is required of Ministers (and that elsewhere particularly)
as well as others:<note place="margin">Ministers must use ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality.</note> for, they be fittest to counsel and comfort stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
are easily found out, and must go before their people in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of that they teach, and shall thus both provoke others the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and make a way for their Ministery in the hearts of the poor.</p>
                  <p>If it be thus,<note place="margin">Use.</note> then it was doubtless Gods minde, That a Minister
should have wherewithal, even a competent maintenance for himself
and his, and to do good to others.</p>
                  <p>Its the conceit of some, That a Minister should live but meanly,
and as it were from hand to mouth; and accordingly they do so pole
from him, that he can do no good this way. But though they should
not be pompous nor sumptuous, nor rake after farms and wealth, yet
they must and ought to live in good sort, as well as themselves: Such
as have skill in the Scriptures, or have profited by the word, or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the Calling of the Ministery, will not otherwise judge: For
us, if we cannot do as we would, we must do as we can; nor having
ability, must we bid set on the great pot, in the mean while starving
our peoples souls.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>OUr Apostle yet proceedeth in the argument of love, and because
it were too long to exhort particularly to every duty of love, he
puts here all together in one, requiring that every one do communicate
what gifts soever he hath, and in what kinde or measure soever; He
must not keep it to himself, but distribute it to the good of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Church and Commonwealth; and seeing God hath given
us those gifts for this end, and made us not owners, but stewards and
dispensers of them, and such as must give account of the same, which
well followeth upon the former Exhortation, That nothing be done
with grudging, we have no cause to grudge at what we do.</p>
                  <p>This Exhortation is general to all sorts of men whatsoever; though
in the next place he instanceth in some particular duties of Church-Officers,
as Ministers and Overseers of the Poor.</p>
                  <p>Here we have, 1. An Exhortation, to minister, to be doing service.
2. The maner, according to our gift whatsoever it be, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the author of it, or means how we have it, we have received
it. 3. The generallity of persons which are thus to minister, every man.
4. A Reason, because we are but Stewards.</p>
                  <p>As every man hath received the gift,] <hi>Here note,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That every one hath some gift or other to do good with,<note place="margin">Every man hath some gift or other wherewith to do good.</note> and
whereby he may be profitable, as authority, wisdom, wealth, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and the like; as there is no member in the body, but hath his
gift fit to do good in the body,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> not a finger, or toe, nay, the least
joynt of the least toe serves for the more steady walking, without
which the body were lame,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> we could not go so firmly. As every one
of the Servants had some of the talents, and he that had least had
one; So, though one may have a more excellent gift, or greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thereof then another, yet every man hath some or other.</p>

a carnal person, yet there were use of thee; but of every one that
feareth God, there is special use, and thou doest and mayst do good
many ways; Thou doest good in following thy Calling whatsoever
it is: Also thou hast some Children, or a little family, if thou bring
them up in the fear of God, that they may prove profitable instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

adversity, diligence in thy calling, contentedness in thine Estate, and
the like; so by counselling, admonishing, exhorting, comforting, and
visiting thy poor and sick Neighbors: Be not discouraged then, but
lay out the gift thou hast, and thou shalt please God as highly as they
that have more. There are, indeed, some prophane minded men, that
say, For these poor folks, what use are they of? they do no good; if
there were a thousand of them out of the way, it were a good turn;
they do nothing but spend that other folks get: Thus will some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
minded men say. But if they were carnal, yet are they of use,
have skill one way or other; neither shouldst thou grudge at their
life, but rather wish that they may live and mend: If they be godly,
they do more good then thou dost, notwithstanding of all thy riches;
therefore let none despise any, as the eye despiseth not the hand
or foot.</p>
                  <p>2. That every one hath a several and diverse gift,<note place="margin">Every one hath (as it were) a several or diverse gift.</note> as it were; some
for Magistracy, as Courage, Wisdom, Policy; some for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
as Knowledge, Interpretation of Scripture, the gift of utterance,
Exhortation, Love, Zeal, &amp;c. Some to be housholders, some skill in
Physick, Husbandry, Law, Merchandizing, &amp;c. Every one hath not
the same,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> neither hath one man all: As a General of a Field disposeth
of his men, all be Soldiers, but not all of one kinde; some be
Horsemen, some be Footmen, and of these some Pikemen, some
Musketiers; so hath God disposed of men severally: And this God
hath done, for the knitting us together in love, that none might be
lifted up above all others, nor despise any, each being of use in his
place: None can live of himself, none without the help of others;
The Prince not without the Subject, nor the Subject without the
Prince; Ministers have their maintenance from the people, people
through their preaching attain Faith to the salvation of their souls;
The rich wants skill, neither are able to do their own work, therefore
employ the poor about it, and relieve them; The Lawyer cannot be
without the Clyent, nor the Physician live without Patients; The
Merchant cannot be without the Clothier, nor the Husbandman
without the Tradesman, each must partake of the others gift.</p>
                  <p>As therefore we should praise God for such variety of his gifts,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and
for his wisdom in distributing the same; so we should not be lifted
up, or wax insolent, to the despising one of another: If thou hast
some gift that others have not, they have also some that thou hast not;
If they need thee, thou also standest in need of them; say not of thy
Minister, He liveth of us; if thou beest as thou oughtest, thou livest by
him: so, as the poor cannot be without thee, thou canst not well be
without them.</p>
                  <p>3. That whatsoever we have fit to do good with,<note place="margin">God bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth gifts on us freely.</note> its a free gift
of God; we came naked into the world, without any goodness,
even the least good is of God, any thing that may be called good:
They were all freely given <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Iam. 1. 17.</note> much more now, since our rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

That he had his from God;<note place="margin">Iob 1. 21.</note> yea, to have a heart to distribute it well,

brass, wood, stone (as were <hi>Bazaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi>) is the gift of God.</p>
                  <p>Let us not then stand in Gods light,<note place="margin">Use.</note> by arrogating any thing to our

none ought to require of me to give out of it, but as I list my
self: Alas, what if it be so as thou sayest, yet its Gods free gift; for
thou hast made many forfeitures, whereby thou hast deserved to have
it taken away: for any thing thou hast, any Land, Living, Place,

brag of a borrowed suit of apparel, as if it were his own, and he were
able to maintain the like: He that gave it thee, found thee without it,
unworthy of it, and could have given it to any other, and can yet take
it from thee, and give it another; nay, rather be humble, because of
of the account: As the Master of the Talents called his Servants to
an account, so will the Lord call thee; <hi>To whom much is given, of him
is much required:</hi> The more gifts and the greater, the more is thine
account; thou art the farther in debt, and therefore should be the less

                     <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same</hi> &amp;c.]
Here's the main duty required; every man must be faithful in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating

hath received it.</p>

light under a bushel, nor hide his Talent in a Napkin: The Magistrate
must administer justice duly and truly, relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, defend the widow, break the jaws of the wicked, &amp;c. as he
who beareth not the sword in vain: The Minister must do service with
his gift, Preaching in season, out of season, &amp;c. The Housholder
must instruct and train up his Family, employing all the wit and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he hath to this end,<note place="margin">See Deut. 6. 6.</note> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> he must pray with them, and
go before them in an holy example: The Husband must minister his
gift, by living with his wife as a man of knowledge, &amp;c. The wife
must live in subjection and build up her house, and as a mother lay
out her breasts for her yong ones, if God hath given her milk and
strength: The Servant must put out his gift in his business, and not
be idle, untrusty, an eye-servant, &amp;c. He that hath knowledge must
teach the ignorant, admonish the disordered, exhort them that begin
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:65522:307"/>
to slack, comfort the heavy, &amp;c. If any hath wealth, he must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
thereof as need requires; If any have skill in Physick, or in
any thing that is useful to man, yea, or to beast, they must minister
it; nay, there's not the meanest work done in faith and for conscience,
which pleaseth not God, as a Preacher in the Pulpit, or Magistrate
on the Bench.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle descendeth from general, to particular Exhortations,
and instanceth in some main and principal gifts, which be of
greatest use; namely, Gifts and Offices in the Church, towards the
souls and bodies of the people of God: and that not onely for their
good, but that God might be glorified in all his gifts, through Jesus
Christ; of whom, and his gifts bestowed upon us, when he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he cannot but break out into a hearty thanksgiving, desiring, and
that fervently, that all praise and dominion may be given to him for
ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Here we have an Exhortation, a Confirmation, a Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>The Exhortation is unto Ministers by name, to preach the Word
of God, and as the Word of God; and to other Church-Officers,
under a general term, that they are to dispense their gifts, according
to the gift bestowed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Now in that the Apostle contents not himself with the general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
in which Ministers were included, but names them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
we may note, that</p>

for the good of his brethren (for then would all things come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion)
but the neglect of the Ministery were yet worse, as being the
means whereby those may learn their duties: The souls of people
depend on the Ministery; and where Prophesie faileth, the people
perish. Hence it is, that when the Lord promised great favors to his
people,<note place="margin">Ier. 3. 15.</note> he promised them faithful Ministers;<note place="margin">Mat. 9. 36.</note> and our Savior, in love
to his people the Jews,<note place="margin">See Ezek. 3. 36 and 7. 26.</note> sent his Apostles among them, pitying them
as sheep which were scattered, and wanting a Shepherd: where on
the contrary,<note place="margin">Amos 5. 13. and 8. 11.</note> no greater judgement could befal them, then the want
of such faithful Shepherds,<note place="margin">Zech. 11. 16.</note> or the having of unfaithful: Can La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers,

and such others, be spared in a Commonwealth? Who knows not
the use of them? Such are Gods Ministers in respect of our souls.</p>

such high matters, and to have the charge of Souls; Here is no dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying,

employed about a worthy work, and accordingly must labor in the
Word and Doctrine, for the gaining of Souls: Hereupon followeth an

our answer must needs be fearful,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> which made <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>Who is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for these things?</hi> And godly men have been in this Calling with
much fear and trembling; without doubt wicked Ministers as they are
the Factors for the Devils Kingdom, they have more to answer for,
then either unfaithful Magistrates, Housholders, Lawyers, Physitians,
&amp;c. nay, then those that rob and murther by the High-way; for these
kill a few, and but mens bodies, but those murther many, and their
souls, their peoples blood will be required at their hands; were this
considered, men would neither so rashly and unadvisedly run into the
Ministery, nor so loosly and idly live therein.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth people to esteem the Ministery as the most necessary
gift of all others,<note place="margin">Use. 2.</note> as that whereon the winning and losing of their
souls depends, and which is appointed for Salvation; and accordingly
they must regard it, make use of it, and endeavor to profit by it, for
their Humiliation, Conversion, Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>3. It rebukes numbers of blinde people in the world,<note place="margin">Use. 3.</note> that think of
all gifts, the Ministery might be best spared, especially those preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ministers, that have (as they say) a deal of Tythes and maintenance,
and that they could like as well a Reader, that would be content with
a small stipend, &amp;c. O these unsavory Earth-worms know not
the worth of their souls, and therefore savor not the things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to the salvation thereof: Thus indeed our Commodities in most
places are deadest, and of least price and regard; some few wise Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
thank God for our Ministery, and highly value it: Well, know
that thy foul, the best jewel thou hast, depends on the Ministery of
the Word; if ever it shall be saved, it must be by means hereof,
whereby thou mayest as well renounce thy felf, as lay hold on Christ
for Salvation.</p>

preaching, even to be able to open the Scriptures soundly, and apply
the same wisely to the peoples edifying:<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note>

not to be counted void or nullities) run before they are sent, are blinde

having mouthes, but speak not, &amp;c.</p>

if their Minister be but a Reader: We have a very honest man,
will such say; true, he cannot preach, but he doth his good will, and
we can desire no more of a man, and a very fellow-like man he is, &amp;c.
But if it happen they have a godly Preacher, what is their note then?
we have a Minister, I would we had never known him; some say he
is learned, and he preacheth indeed, but he is so troublesome, he
hath spoiled our Town quite, we were all as quiet as could be till he
came, but now there is such finding of faults, and bringing up new
Orders, as we cannot tell what to say; a good many of the best
of the Parish will do what they can to remove him, &amp;c. Thus
the world loves reading Ministers; They say of Schollars, they be
the most conscionable; They care not how little they have for their
money, but its true also of a number of silly miserable people; They
can have no more of a man then his good will, they say: But they
would not say so of a Carpenter, or any Workman or Servant they
hire; if they do not the business they are set about, they would have
others.</p>

destroy souls; they give in stead of an egge, a scorpion, and

Such as teach mens traditions, or their own devices and opinions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

the hearts of the godly, and strengthen the hands of the wicked,
making their Text speak what God never meant; Such as Preach
Gods Word, but so mingled with mans inventions, as they Preach
not Gods Word but their own fancies: Thus many stuff their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

2. This may instruct people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that they hear nothing, at least receive
nothing but the Word of God;<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 17.</note>

                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 1.</note> Therefore they must
be able to try what they hear; we must not be like children, <hi>carryed
about with every wind of doctrine: Solomon</hi> counts it the property of a

things we hear be so and so; they were neither curious nor captious,
yet they would receive nothing but the truth. A man may tell money
after his own Father, not because he thinks he would deceive him, but
because he may be deceived: we take not upon us to have dominion
over your Faith, that you should believe whatsoever we say, because
we say it; but if it be not according to Gods Word, take it but upon
exchange: All that we hear, and Ministers deliver, must be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Scriptures, which is the rule and touchstone; and when
people have knowledge, and can try what we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from being angry, and saying, It was never merry world since every
Taylor and Shoemaker could talk so much of the Scriptures, and finde
faults with mens preaching; would we have the peoples eyes out?
True, the Papists cannot abide it in the people, but tell them, They
must believe as their Ministers believe, &amp;c. This is as bad a sign in
them as may be: But alas, we have cause to complain of peoples ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance;
it were even just with God to let them fall into the hands of
deceivers, as having got no knowledge all this while.</p>
                  <p>Ministers must preach as it becomes the Word of God,<note place="margin">Ministers must so preach as it becomes the Word of God.</note> even with
all reverence and authority, with all courage and boldness; yea so,
as that they declare by their lives, that they believe it to be Gods
Word, even by being first in the practice thereof, and obedience
thereto.</p>
                  <p>1. This serves to reprove divers;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> as namely, those that mingle
tricks and conceits to tickle the ear, and are all in their Inkhorn terms,
riming, and running on the letter, &amp;c. together with those that have
itching ears, and delight in such things. Its a sign of a sickly ill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
stomack, to whom the wholesom food of the Word is not sweet,
except it have some such strumpetly sawces. Those that through sear
keep back Gods counsel, not revealing his whole will; those that live
daily in the same sins which they rebuke in others, not fearing those
judgements which they denounce on others, nor doing those duties
they call for of others; these, as the Scribes and Pharisees, are
blinde guides; these make the people think, Preaching is but for a
fashion, and they must speak somewhat when they be in place, but its
not to be regarded; for if it were, they would not do thus and thus
themselves: Thus, as <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, they make the Lords people loath
the Sacrifice of the Lord; yet must not people thus stumble: Do as
they say,<note place="margin">See Psal. 50. 16</note> take the good, and leave the ill: men will take up money
out of the dirt.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 21.</note> Miserable is the condition of such Ministers as give
this foul offence, weak are those people that take it.</p>
                  <p>2. This may instruct people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> 1. To be duly prepared by prayer,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:65522:310"/>
ere they come to the hearing of the Word; being come, they must
with all reverence attend thereto. Its Gods Word they hear, the Lord
himself with whom they have to do: O how few come thus! nay,
most men behave not themselves so well as they should, to a man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
them of good will:<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> There are now few such as <hi>Cornelius;</hi> want
of preparation is one main cause why so few profit by hearing: How
many hear unreverently, or as if they were weary and sleepy? Is this
to hear it as the Word of God? Hence it is that men, not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of their miserable and damnable state, or that the way to Heaven
is so strait, content themselves with their present state; Would not
men be thrust out of doors, if they did so before their Prince, should
he speak unto them? 2. People must not be afraid to frequent and
attend on the Word preached, they must not be ashamed hereof.
3. They must shew their account hereof, by their obedience hereto:
O look to it, you have not to do with us, that cannot tell when you be
gone hence, whether or not you practise the same; but you have to do
with God, whose Word you hear, who will go hence with you, and
knows your sitting down,<note place="margin">Psal. 139. 3.</note> and your rising up, yea, and all your ways,
and both can and will deal with you accordingly. In the fear of God
let us look better to this, and resolutely set down with our selves,
That whensoever we come to hear the Word,<note place="margin">See Exod. 20.</note> we come to hear God
himself speaking to us: If it were not so, we durst not speak it for our
lives; the matter concerns us no less then you.</p>

                     <hi>If any men minister,]</hi> He proceedeth to other Offices in the Church,
and ayms, no doubt, at them whose Office it was to distribute and
look to the poor: The word <hi>minister,</hi> signifieth to do service, and so
may be taken more generally; even every man in his Office and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
must be a minister to his brethren: The Magistrate is so called,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and so the Exhortation also may concern them: However,
the point may be this, that</p>
                  <p>All that have Office one way or other in the Church,<note place="margin">All that bear Office in the Church must do the same faithfully.</note> must do the
same faithfully; we have them that answer in some sort to the Officers
in the Primitive Church, Churchwadens must look to mens Maners,
and spy what is amiss, who prophane the Lords day, neglect the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, be idle and riotous, &amp;c. These they must admonish,
and if thereupon they amend not, complain of them; Constables
must suppress filthy houses, break the knots of lewd persons, prevent
and root out disorder to the utmost of their power; The Overseers
of the poor ought to be wise and faithful, and not think it enough to
take money with one hand,<note place="margin">See Acts 6. 3.</note> and pay it out with the other; but they
must distribute it with wisdom to every one,<note place="margin">Acts 11. 29.</note> according to their need,
to the best,<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 26, 28</note> most, and with best encouragement, to the other, with
gentle rebuke and admonition; even those of best quality, report and
credit have been entrusted with this business: There are prophaners
of the Lords day, such as then lie in bed, and regard not the House of
God; There are Swearers, Railers, Riotous persons, such as bring
not up their Children in any Calling; There are idle persons, &amp;c.
these would be well lookt to, and often admonished, and no more
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:65522:310"/>
given them, then needs must; There's a company of idle Wenches
which keep at home with their friends where there is no need of them,
or crowd into one house or other, and live at their own hand, and that
either because of idleness they refuse to go to service, or having been
in service, because they may not do as they list, they will no longer be
Servants, but live by themselves; This is a foul and dangerous abuse,
not to be suffered in Towns: Headboroughs and chief men in Towns
ought to provoke Officers to their duty, and encourage them doing
well, yea, countenance and stand by them, as whom God hath lifted
up for this end.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh the exceeding coldness and carelesness of Officers
that take no pains to prevent or redress disorder;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Thus Overseers
think it enough if they gather and pay out the money, and bring in a
true account, whats this? It were hard if men should rob the Poor,
a curse would follow it, but for looking into their state and maners,
and with relieving their bodies to do good to their souls, Who
doth this? This is rare indeed; But if we have an office, we must
wait on our office, we are not altogether born for our selves:
Every office is an honor,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 7.</note> and carries a burthen along with it; we
must bestow some time thereon, its not lost, God will requite it;
and cursed is he that doth his work negligently,<note place="margin">Ier. 48. 10.</note> though others
have been careless, and though haply you may be counted more busie
and curious then needs, yet whether your office be great or small, set
your selves with care and diligence about it: Hereby much good
will come to the Town and Poor in particular, God shall be glorified,
and you shall reap much comfort, with a good report in Gods
Church.</p>
                  <p>2. This bewrayeth a great fault in Towns,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> for making choice of

                  <p>1. What entire love should be between Ministers and people,<note place="margin">There must be entire love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> they
should love one another as fathers and children, mothers and children,
Nurses, and such as have suckt their breasts, Brethren, &amp;c. See 1 <hi>Cor.
4. 15. Gal. 4. 19. 1 Thess. 2. 7. 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons</hi> hereof may be these, 1. God hath committed them each <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to other,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 19, 20.</note> and so they be nearly knit. 2. Such as be won by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
are they that must comfort their Ministers here, and be their
Crown hereafter (the more they be, the greater is their Crown) whom
therefore their Ministers are to love, them also are their people to love
no less dearly, as on whom they should depend for all comfort, and
the means of their Salvation, whose lips must preserve knowledge,
who are also to pray for them, and teach them. 3. Ministers by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
their people, shall be provoked to live with them, to take all
courses to do them good publikely and privately, as also to bear with
the dulness of some, the unkindeness and weakness of others: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
their people will reverence them, regard their Teaching, and
chearfully allow them maintenance; which did they not truly love
their persons, they would not.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth both Ministers and People to be most tenderly
careful to preserve mutual love,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and avoid all occasions of unkinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or dislike, removing them speedily when at any time they do
arise (for oftentimes of a small spark neglected, ariseth a great flame)
of all unkindenesses and contentions, those between Ministers and
People be most unprofitable and hurtful; whoso hath a hand herein,
and goeth about to alienate the mindes of each from the other, that
the one cares not for the other, work journey work to the Devil in a
high degree.</p>
                  <p>2. This condemneth that common and most woful abuse in this
Land,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> even the miserable want of love on both parts; not a few Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:65522:312"/>
care not how seldom they come among their people, and when
they do, how little pains they take, how often do they sue them for
meer trifles? on the other part, what light and base esteem have people
of their Ministers? How unkindely do they use them? How pole
they them of their maintenance? Where its thus, God is not, for
God is love,<note place="margin">John 4. 16.</note> and there's no good done to be sure. Here the Devil
may sleep till he snort, he shall not be hindred; but where Ministers
and people live in godly love, there let him look to himself.</p>
                  <p>2. That we should love men never the worse for their troubles,<note place="margin">Christians are not to be the less, but more loved for their troubles.</note> but
rather the more, as who are worthy to be honored for their Faith, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Constancy, and being paterns and means to confirm us in
our sufferings for Christ: The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> used this as an argument
to move <hi>Philemon</hi> to grant his request, for that he was aged, and a
prisoner for Christ. Hereof this our Apostle informs them, even that
notwithstanding all their troubles (whereof haply some might have
conceived him careless) they were dear unto him.</p>
                  <p>This rebuketh those that make account of men,<note place="margin">Use.</note> while they be in
prosperity, and the world smiles on them; but when the times frown,
and they be discountenanced, and in disgrace and trouble, then cast
them off, or shrink from them, shewing them no countenance nor
kindeness; a sign either of mung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>els, or at last of dastardly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Think it not strange concerning the fiery tryal,]</hi> Here's the matter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to: By <hi>fiery tryal</hi> is meant, All kinde of persecution, in what
degree soever, compared to the fire; for that as the fire tryes the gold,
so persecution tryes men. <hi>Think it not strange,</hi> wonder not at it, as at
some strange think come out of a far Countrey, whereof the like was
never either seen or heard of; it behoved you to have prepared for it
before, and now make a reckoning of it, that so you flinch not from
it when it comes. Here note, that</p>
                  <p>The want of fore-thinking of trouble,<note place="margin">The want of preparation for troubles before they come, make them harder to be born when they are come.</note> makes it the harder to be
born, and the stranger when it comes: When a man hath time to
put on his armor, or draw his Sword ere the Thief come, he is more
safe, then if a Thief should rush upon him on the sudden.</p>
                  <p>As those which are not used to sickness, bear it worst; so, such are
most cast down in the time of trouble, which in the time of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
do not so much as think thereof.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth us,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> even in the time of prosperity, to think of
troubles; in the midst of health we must think of sickness, and how
we shall bear it, and accordingly provide for it; so in the time of
wealth, of poverty; so having Children, if God should take them
from us; of our Friends, if they should hate us, how would we behave
our selves? How could we do as such and such a Christian, &amp;c? So
in life, we must think of death; and when any one dyes, think that
we may be the next, and thereupon finde out how we are prepared for
it: These thoughts are profitable, they will make us use our prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the more soberly and thankfully while we have it, and walk more
humbly, and be better prepared for troubles, if God shall lay them
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:65522:312"/>
upon us: Neither will they come the sooner for thinking of them;
howsoever, we shall be the better enabled to bear them, when ever
they come: What's written of the Basilisk, that if it see us before
we see it, we dye for it, but if we see it first, we live, is true of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
If we see them ere they come, we be much better, but if
they come on us unlooked for, they prove the more dangerous. Now
every man sits under his own vine, and under his own figtree; Now
we go to the house of God in peace; Now we profess Religion with
good liking: But what if the case alter ere I dye? shouldst thou say;
What if I be haled to prison, lose my goods, be convented, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
tortured, banished, &amp;c. what shall I then do?</p>
                  <p>2. This rebuketh most,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that seldom or never have any such thoughts;
May not we have changes? why do we not then think of them?</p>
                  <p>Oh such sad thoughts do not well,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> lets be merry while we may, sadness will
come time enough.</p>
                  <p>Thou wrongest thy self,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> thy case will be the worse, thy condition
the more fearful, if either sickness, poverty, pain, or any other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
should take thee unprovided: For persecution, who is there that
now thinketh of any such matter? most think that they shall never
be moved,<note place="margin">Psal. 30. 6.</note> and that they shall dye in their nest, whereas, alas, it may
fall out far otherwise:<note place="margin">Iob 29. 18.</note> Have we not many enemies? and what doth
not our sins deserve? God hath indeed wrought for us many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,
as from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Invasion, and Gunpowder Treason, &amp;c.
but are we sure he will do so still? Hath not our grievous unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
deserved the contrary? Do we think that our enemies do not
now plot mischief against us? No doubt they make use of peace, to
prepare for war, and they will plot now towards their latter end, to
uphold their tottering <hi>Babel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Simile.</note> and do as fishes, feeling the water almost
gone from them, flush and make a stir; and when death draws near
men, they have strong pains: So what now at the last the Lord may
suffer them to do against us, we know not. Its the more likely there wil
be some judgement, because all men cry Peace and Safety, and are so
sensless; if there should be any such, alas, how unprovided are we?
nay, what were all our provision, strength, multitude of men, &amp;c. if
God should set himself against us?<note place="margin">See Ier. 37. 10.</note> On the contrary, if we have God
on our side, as he was with <hi>Gideon</hi> and his three hundred, with <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
and his Armor bearer, we need not fear them, though never so
many so strong. Now if any such judgement should come on the
Land (which the Lord turn away for his mercies sake) wherein multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
should be slain with the Sword, others made Slaves, and carried
away, our Wives and Daughters abused before our faces, our houses
and chests rifled, the godly imprisoned, and brought forth to torment,
except they would forsake their Religion: O Lord! how far are we
unfit for any such matter; and the rather, for that we never think of
it? Never would any Land think trouble and misery more strange,
then we which have been used so delicately. O then let us think and
provide for this before, that if it should come, it may not be strange
unto us. If we look to our selves, have not we cause enough to be
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:65522:313"/>
humbled, and purged from our dross: and for the world, shall we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if they hate and persecute us? Haply we think because we be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
persons, the Sons of God, they should not so deal with us: Its
true, but alas, they know not our Father, much less know they us his
Children:<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 2.</note> Haply we think because we be now godly, and make
conscience of all our ways, and love God, and live with our brethren
Christianly, and desire nothing so much as to please God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all should make much of us. True, God, Angels, and good
Men, will do so, and that must content us; but the world is the world,
and will hate us the more for our goodness, which hath been thus ever
since <hi>Cain</hi> hated <hi>Abel;</hi> we need not think it strange, for may not the
Lord justly after long schooling us, now call us out to try what we
have profited. Again, hereby he would have the wickedness of the
wicked break out, that he might get glory in confounding them:
Also he will hereby confirm the hearts of the weak to believe the
truth,<note place="margin">See Phil. 1. 12, 13, 14.</note> and be bolder to defend it. Again, if we look to the state of
the Church, and faithful Servants of God in former ages, we need
not think it strange, for its the way that they have all gone, <hi>Abel, Isaac,
Jacob,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Heb. 11.</note> the Prophets, Christ, his Apostles, the Primitive Church, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
under the Roman Emperors, not a few even in this our Land in
the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed the Devil is ready to make us
believe that our case is worse then any bodies, and that there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any as we, which is, that he may make us murmure, and drive us
to desparation or to flinch, whereas its a very lye, for we are in no such
case, but the Saints of God have been in as bad, in the same, in worse;
This duly considered, will be a means that afflictions shall be better
born.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which is to try you,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Afflictions are tryals.</note> Here's the Reason of the Exhortation; The
end of persecution is not to destroy the good, but to make them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as the gold is tryed by the fire, afflictions (persecution chiefly) are
sent to try what we be, and in what state; not but that God knows it
already, but he would have us also and others to know to our comfort
or humbling. They are of great use, As</p>
                  <p>1. To try whether we have any truth of grace in us,<note place="margin">Above the truth of grace in us.</note> whether we
be any thing or nothing, sound or hollow, true friends, or hypocrites,
such as are built on the rock,<note place="margin">Read the story of <hi>Pendleton</hi> and <hi>Saunders</hi> in the Book of the Martyrs.</note> or sand: Many that now think well of
themselves, will never be able to stand, and many mean in their own
and others eyes, would hold out: A man is never tryed till adversity
comes, as a Soldier is in the Battel, a Marriner in a Storm, a Friend
in time of need; Who would have thought the seed in the stony
ground would have flincht? few so good as they in most Parishes: If
these would not abide, what shall we think of most amongst us? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
as the fan, of one heap makes two, and as the fire, separateth
the gold from the dross.</p>
                  <p>Labor then for a true faith of the right stamp, who knows but that
God will send a tryal, let's labor to be so provided, as we may be
good wheat, to abide by it, and not chaff, that will flie away; that we
may be gold fit to be Vessels for the Lords use, not dross to be burnt
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:65522:313"/>
up with unquenchable fire: Onely true believers will hold out, all
others will flinch; lets now look to our selves, lest we making a fair
house, not onely in the sand, it fall, and our fall be great, and we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
begun a piece of work, leave it in the mid way, to our perpetual
shame: But they that are proved to be sound, and to have true Faith,
its a great Comfort and Crown to them. Who would not have his
Sword or Gun tryed ere he went to the field? A little tryed Faith is
better then much tryed Gold, then much Faith in mens tongues and
conceits.</p>
                  <p>2. To try what measure of grace we have,<note place="margin">About the measure of our grace.</note> whether as much or
more, or less then we thought; for some over-prize themselves, and
some do on the contrary. Who would have thought <hi>Peter</hi> had been
so weak, after such bold protestation? Who would have thought
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith so great as it was, or <hi>Jobs</hi> both Faith and Patience?
<hi>Though the Lord would kill him, yet would he wait on him:</hi> What do thine
afflictions bewray?<note place="margin">Use.</note> If more grace then thou thoughtst, be thankful;
if less, be humbled, and apply thy self to the means more carefully.</p>
                  <p>3. To purge,<note place="margin">They serve to refine that measure we have.</note> purifie, and refine that measure of true grace thats in
us: In the days of Peace and Prosperity, the best men are subject to
gather soil, as standing waters putrifie, bodies without exercise prove
full of gross humors: In prosperity we gather pride, security, teachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
self-love, too much love of the world; these God purgeth away,
that our Faith and Grace may shew themselves in their bright colours;
as the Vine, having the superfluous branches cut off, proves the more
fruitful: Never do Christians shine so bright, as in affliction, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But rejoyce,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> Here's the second Exhortation: We must be so far
from thinking it strange when we are persecuted, as that we are then
to rejoyce.<note place="margin">See Iam. 1. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how can this be?<note place="margin">Q.</note> will some say: To rejoyce in mockings, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11.</note>
cold irons, tortures, &amp;c. seems impossible, and the rather, for that
no affliction for the present is joyous, but tedious.</p>
                  <p>To the flesh these things be tedious,<note place="margin">A.</note> yet there is cause to make us
rejoyce in them: Though a natural man cannot do this, as being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to flesh and blood, yet grace, and a good measure of faith,
and an heart mortified to the world, and taken up with the desire of a
better life, will do the same. A man may both grieve, and yet rejoyce
in the same thing, in diverse respects; as them that saw the Temple
re-edified,<note place="margin">Ezra 3. 12.</note> some wept, namely, the ancient men, some again rejoyced,
namely, the yong men; the one, because it was no better, the other,
because it was as it was, both which might have been in either of
them: As a man may be glad that he hath a childe departed in a godly
maner, and yet grieve at the loss of his childe; so if at the fall of a
Scaffold, where many lost their lives, we have had a childe that broke
his Arm, we are sorry at that, but glad that he scaped with his life:
Thus the Apostles rejoyced,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 41. and 16. 25.</note> thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> thus the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
thus the Christian <hi>Hebrews,</hi> thus the Martyrs throughout all ages:
Such a thing is Faith;<note place="margin">1 Thess. 1. 6.</note> its not a Conceit,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note> but that that makes things
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:65522:314"/>
absent, so present, as that we can be content to endure present pain
for joy to come, and to lose things present, for happiness hereafter:
Thus have many of Gods Servants done, so that God requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of us, but that he hath enabled many to do, yea ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
like our selves, nay, not a few even of the weaker Sex.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh the woful unbelief and hypocrisie of most of
the world,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which though they profess the Word in prosperity, yet in
adversity they shift for themselvs, make friendship with the world, and
will suffer nothing for Christs sake or his Religion; they are ashamed
of Christ here, of them will he be ashamed hereafter; now saving
their lives with an ill Conscience, they shall lose life eternal.</p>
                  <p>2. It rebuketh even the Servants of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> who are so loath to suffer
or abide any hardness: We can hardly abide a frown of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
or an hard word, or a railing speech, but we are cast down, and
disquieted about it; yea, many pull in their heads, and step back, and
think its not good to be forward, and so come to Jesus by night: How
will we suffer imprisonment, and loss of all we have? how endure
the fire, and especially with joy? This is too much tenderness, its
through too much earthly-mindedness.</p>
                  <p>3. Lets labor for such grace,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> as whereby if God call us forth to
suffer, we may not onely not flee back, but endure any thing, and that
with joy. To this end, we must 1. Endeavor for a sound Faith and
assurance of Gods love to us in Christ, that so we may so love him
again, as we may suffer for his Name, and being assured of our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from everlasting pain, and that he hath freed us from shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sufferings, which for our sins he might have brought us to, may
endure these glorious sufferings for his Name joyfully. Being thus
assured of his love, and thereupon of eternal happiness in heaven, we
will be content to suffer any thing to obtain it. 2. Withdraw our
mindes from earthly things, and set them on heaven and heavenly
things, as our onely treasure. 3. Mortifie and subdue our lusts and
affections, bringing our hearts in subjection to God in all things, and
bearing our present afflictions quietly and comfortably. This joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in sufferings doth well become Christians, daunts their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and puts a difference between them and all others, whether hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
civil persons, or Time-servers, who will never thus do:
Christians must be like <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies, even excel others, do more
then ordinary men. If we do onely love our friends, what singular
thing do,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 46.</note> do not even Publicans the same? If we profess Religion in
prosperity, what great matter do we, do not even Hypocrites the same?
We must learn to take out higher lessons, and be perfect, as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in heaven is perfect. Its an easie thing to rejoyce in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
but so to do in adversity is a good hard lesson, and so the more
worthy a Christians labor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christs sufferings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christians are called Christs sufferings.</note>] The first Reason
of the Exhortation, We are partners with Christ, therefore we may
think our selves advanced, and so rejoyce. The sufferings of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
are called Christs sufferings, 1. Because they are suffered for his
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:65522:314"/>
sake;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note> which may be no small comfort to them that suffer for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 17.</note>
for its for Christs sake, and so he counts it: therefore he will put
our tears in his bottle,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 24.</note> take our part, defend, and reward us; as <hi>David</hi>
took care of <hi>Abiathar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 22. 12.</note> having lost his Father for his sake. 2. Because
he bears a part of them with his Saints; there's so near a conjunction
between him the Head, and the Saints his Members, as whats done
to the one, whether good or ill, is counted as done to the other; as the
godly hearing Christ railed on, are so grieved, that they had rather
themselves had been so used: much more doth Christ Jesus account
their troubles his,<note place="margin">Acts 9. 4.</note> which as it may terrifie their adversaries, so it may
much comfort them. But here they be called Christs sufferings in
another sense, namely, as his own sufferings, which he bare in his own
person, whereof we partake, when we also suffer the like things; we
are set up to be like our Master Christ Jesus,<note place="margin">Christians suffer with Christ.</note> and is it not cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
that he vouchsafeth to make us like himself, to bring us into
his order, to pledge him of the same Cup he began to us?</p>
                  <p>He suffered, his whole life was nothing else: They misconstrued
his words, and mistook his deeds, and said, <hi>He cast out Devils through
Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils:</hi> How often was he railed on? how
hardly used, especially towards his latter end?</p>
                  <p>If we be so dealt with at any time,<note place="margin">Use.</note> we need not think hardly, but
rejoyce, not think hardly: He was the glorious Son of God, we poor
mortal Creatures, dust and ashes; He most holy and righteous, and
perfectly pure, we miserable sinners, which though not at mens hands
which wrong us, yet at Gods have deserved all evil, both here and in
Hell. If God turn our opprobrious sufferings here, and perpetual
torments of Hell, into a sew short and glorious sufferings, we have
no cause to think hardly; yea, he having suffered all for us, we may
well suffer for him, we can never lose hereby, nor can ever suffer so
much for him, as he hath done for us; nay, not onely we must not
think hardly at our sufferings, but we have cause to rejoyce, that we are
advanced to be like our Master, made conformable to our head Christ
Jesus: He is a bold Servant, that is not content to fare as his Master
fares; Those Worthies that have gone before us, have accounted it
their honor, and a special favor that they have drunk of this Cup.</p>
                  <p>When therefore we do at any time suffer for Religions sake, let's
thus encourage our selves, I am herein made like all the Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 18, 19.</note>
and chief of Gods Friends and Saints, yea, as his onely Son,
and thus our Savior comforted his Disciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy.]</hi> The second Reason, our sorrow shall be turn'd into joy, as
in part when we dye, namely, in our souls; so perfectly when he
shall be made glorious in all his Saints, whilest he was here in the
world, he was put to an ignominious death, but he rose again from the
dead, and ascended into Heaven, and shall come one day to judge every
man according to his deeds, even to bring into happiness all those for
whom he dyed, and to confound all his Enemies; He came the first
time in meekness, because he came to suffer, but the second time he

a blessed thing, and who would not rejoyce in that that will make
him happy? and though he instanceth in one kinde, and that which
may seem no great persecution, yet he is to be understood of all others
whatsoever; That such shall be blessed, he proveth, because thus to
suffer is an argument that the Spirit of God, even the glorious Spirit
resteth on them; who, howsoever on the adversaries part he is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemed
and ill spoken of, yet is glorified by them that suffer patiently
and joyfully for Christs sake: Here then, besides that suffering for
Christ we are happy, we may be induced thus to suffer for him, for
that his Spirit resteth on us so doing, and hereby also he is glorified:
In the words we have a proposition, and the confirmation thereof.</p>

                     <hi>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye,]</hi> There's the
proposition; This may seem to be but a slender thing to be reckoned
among persecutions, and that which may be easily born; No, its
that which many have found harder to bear, then loss of goods,
blows, yea death it self: Some which have suffered torments coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously,
and indured the loss of all with joyfulness, yet have almost
sunk under slanders and ill tongues: <hi>David</hi> much complains of his
adversaries, that they made Songs of him, that they spake words like
the prickings of a Sword, and like sharp Arrows: <hi>Sampson</hi> could not

go on constantly, and not be discouraged, and there's good hope
they shall bear greater persecutions if they come, which else in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
they cannot.</p>
                  <p>3. That it hath been an usual custom in the world to reproach,<note place="margin">To slander Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their godliness is usual.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,
and slander Gods Servants for their godliness: Sore eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide the light, and there's an enmity between the seed of the
Woman and the Serpent; and when other weapons have failed them,
they have used this of their tongue, whereby indeed they prevail much
to the disgrace of Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. Being so now we must not think it strange,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> for the Devil is now
as malicious as ever, and hath instruments as fit for his turn as ever;
If now endeavoring carefully to serve God, we be counted proud fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:65522:316"/>
factious, Enemies to the State, &amp;c. we must not be too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted,
were not the Prophets, the Apostles, Christ himself thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted?
we are not too good to go hand in hand with them; its a piece
of our livery to be thus dealt with.</p>
                  <p>2. When we hear any reports against Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> know them
well ere we believe them, we should else condemn the innocent; even
Christ was slandered for a Conjurer and Traytor, and the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> for a pestilent fellow, yet who were more freer? who more
wronged?</p>
                  <p>4. That such as are reproached for the name of Christ,<note place="margin">Such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the name of Christ are happy.</note> are happy;
I say, for the name of Christ, or for being true Christians, believing
in Christ, and serving him; for not the punishment, but the Cause
makes a Martyr: How can this be will some say, and what blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can there be in being railed upon and slandered? why, thus saith
our Apostle,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 11.</note> and he knew what he said, having learned the same of his
Lord and Master, whom he heard so speak.</p>
                  <p>Its a blessed thing to be a Christian washt in the blood of Christ,
reconciled to God, whom the Angels protect, who is the heir of Gods
promises and blessings here, and of eternal salvation hereafter: Even an
Emperor without this, is but as a man in great jolity to night, that must
to execution to morrow: But to be railed on for being a Christian, is a
greater blessedness,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> a special honor: Its honor to be a Princes Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
but to be about him, and to have the guard of his own person,
and to stand in his defence against an Enemy, or to be called forth to
justifie his lawful Title, is far greater.</p>
                  <p>Again, Its a blessed thing to be willing and able to suffer for Christ,
flesh and blood cannot; we might have been of the persecuters, or
of them that regard no Religion at all, or to suffer any thing for it, or
making profession of Religion, should yet shrink from it, rather then
suffer for its Cause;<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 28.</note> Therefore to suffer for it is a blessed thing, which
is to us a token of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore we must not onely not be dismaid,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but bear these
things patiently, yea joyfully, for should we not rejoyce in that that
makes us blessed? If therefore we shrink at the least of these things,
and pull in our heads, where's our faith? labor, that if we should be
mockt and railed on, it may not be for nothing, but for true grace, faith
wrought in us by the Word, &amp;c. If we have these things, no matter
though we have some mocks withal.</p>
                  <p>2. See that wicked persecuters make Gods Servants happy,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> yea,
more happy then they should be, so that in seeking their hurt, they do
them good many ways; They purge and try them, make them the
more dear to God, and set the greater Crown upon their heads: what
a priviledge have the Servants of God, that all things, even their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters
should work together for their good; Its not so with others,
yet are not we to thank the wicked for this, who intend no such
thing: The <hi>Caldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> were an occasion that <hi>Job</hi> had twice
as much goods given him as he had before, but no thank to them, for
they took from him what they could; Its God who blesseth the more
those whom the wicked curse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="589" facs="tcp:65522:316"/>
5. That the judgement of the world is contrary to Gods;<note place="margin">The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods.</note> They
think not any blessedness to be in being railed on for Christs sake, but
that blessedness stands in Health, Wealth, Honor, favor of Princes,
&amp;c. Alas, poor vanishing vanities to be lost every day, but blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is in being a Christian, and suffering for the same, Gods thoughts
are not as mans; The blinde world cannot judge of colours, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
men savor not of things Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore look that we never esteem,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> nor be carried with the
judgement of the world, no not of the wise men of the world, which
is a crooked rule to go by; They say, its not good to be too forward
is matters of Religion, but go so far, as they may come back
when they will, and save themselves from danger, and have two
strings to their bow; but let us know this to be cursed policy, this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the world, to be enmity with God.</p>
                  <p>2. If we think troubles for a good conscience,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> base, vile, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed,
and so shun them, though with an ill conscience, we are then
of the world, and either wholly carnal, or in great part; Shall we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that cursed, which the Lord calls blessed? True, we must not
bring troubles on our selves, nor desire persecution; yet if God call
us to them, we must not count them base, but glorious; not cursed,
but blessed: So if we think basely of them that suffer, or are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
and shun them, then are we carnal and of the world; nay,
we ought to esteem highly of them, and think them glorious persons,
because they be honored of God, and greatly graced of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you,]</hi> He proves what
he affirmed; If ye suffer for Christs sake, its an argument ye have
the Spirit of God in you, which is a glorious Spirit, and makes you
glorious, notwithstanding the ignominy and reproach the world casts
upon you, as though you were of all others the vilest; whereupon you
must needs be blessed, which Spirit is on their part ill spoken of, but
on yours that suffer is glorified; So that as the Spirit makes you glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
you glorifie it by your constant and joyful suffering. Hence
Note,</p>
                  <p>1. That to suffer for Christs sake,<note place="margin">To suffer for Christs sake an evidence of Gods Spirit in us.</note> is a sign that we have the Spirit
of God in us; for 1. The world would not hate us except they saw
some work of Gods Spirit in us, for if we lived after the maner of
the world, they would let us alone. 2. Such have the Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,<note place="margin">Iohn 15. 19.</note>
assuring them of Gods love, of pardon and Salvation, which
makes them willing to suffer. 3. Its the Spirit that comforts, and
heartens to such weighty things; flesh and blood will endure nothing
for Religion, neither can it, but through the Spirit we are enabled:
<hi>Steven</hi> a comfortable Martyr,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 3. 7.</note> Why? Its said, <hi>He was full of the
Holy Ghost:</hi> It was by the Spirit of God onely that the Martyrs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
so constantly, not a few of them being weak, sick, tender, feeble
of nature, and fearful; It was of the Spirit that Mr. <hi>Glover</hi> spake when
he came to the Stake to be burnt, <hi>He is come</hi> Austin, <hi>he is come;</hi> having
been very heavy and comfortless the night before: In ill I confess
some may be as stiff, as the best can be in the truth, but they cannot
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:65522:317"/>
suffer so joyfully as the Servants of God;<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 20.</note> for its through the Spirit
of God that they suffer.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore if we have had,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> or finde any power to endure perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
we may know that we have Gods Spirit, and thereupon ought
to be both thankful and joyful.</p>
                  <p>2. As we would suffer with comfort and joy,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> let us labor for the
Spirit, and for a greater measure thereof daily.</p>
                  <p>3. As for those that neither can nor will endure any thing,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> its a sign
they are carnal, and without the Spirit: And indeed, none can suffer
much or joyfully, but such as have the Spirit, and therefore so few
having the Spirit, there would be but a few to stand for the truth, if
there should come a time of tryal.</p>
                  <p>2. That such as are endued with Gods Spirit,<note place="margin">Such as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Gods Spirit are blessed.</note> be blessed; for such as
have and are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God; and
they, yea they onely which be sanctified here, shall be glorified here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note>
The Spirit is given to the Elect, not to the world, its the earnest
of our salvation, and seals us up to the day of Redemption. Again,
such are freed from the bondage of sin to serve God, such also have
God abiding in them, yea, and hereby the Word, the Sacraments,
Prayer, Afflictions, all things are profitable to us; Hereby we are
enabled to every duty, and armed against temptations.</p>
                  <p>1. This may comfort those that can prove they have the Spirit of
God in them;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> they are comforted, sanctified, and guided thereby: This
is the earnest and pledge of eternal life; they are blessed, though but
mean; they may come into Gods presence boldly; they shall want
nothing that is good.</p>
                  <p>2. It may be a terror to those that live after the flesh;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> They have
no mark whereby to free them from being reprobates; for if any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, the same is none of his, Christ never
dyed for such, they are yet under the bondage of sin.</p>
                  <p>3. This should teach us,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> having the Spirit, to beware of doing any
thing whereby to grieve or weary such a guest (sin is a filthy thing, and
that wherewithal the Spirit cannot away) yea, to use all means to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
it daily, suffering our selves to be guided thereby, as that which
will not be there where it may not rule.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Spirit is glorious in it self,<note place="margin">Such as are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Gods spirit are glorious.</note> and makes them glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God and man that be endued therewith; it makes them shine more
gloriously then the Sun: And this the Apostle opposeth to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minies
and reproaches wherewith the world doth besmear them; Its
as if he should say, Though the world reproach you as vile, yet
know, that you are glorious in Gods account, because of his Spirit that
dwells in you.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore be not dismaid,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> though the world stain us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
us vile, yet are we glorious to God.</p>
                  <p>2. We must esteem of the Servants of God,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> in whom we see the
Spirit of God, as of glorious persons, yea, though the world disgrace
them, and count them as off-scourings, and not worthy to live, we
must count them as Gods worthies, and Warriers, as his principal
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:65522:317"/>
Servants; we must count them such, as the world is not worthy of:
They that esteem basely of them,<note place="margin">See Ioh. 15. 21.</note> do not consider that Gods Spirit is
in them,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 24.</note> and resteth on them.<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4. and 119. 199.</note> Contrarily, they that have not the
Spirit of God in them, are base and vile, let the world make what
reckoning of them it will.</p>
                  <p>4. That there's no small difference between the common gifts
of the Spirit that the Reprobates have,<note place="margin">The gifts of the Spirit which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have, cannot be lost.</note> and the Spirit of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which is bestowed on Gods Elect; those may be lost, this
cannot, it resteth on them, yea, abideth and continueth with
them.</p>

they speak ill of the Spirit of God; they think they have but to
do with the men, and them they will be bold with, to speak their
pleasure of; but they deceive themselves, in speaking ill of Gods
Servants, they speak ill of the Spirit of God; as the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when
they murmured against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 18.</note> murmured against God:
<hi>He that despiseth you</hi> (saith our Savior) <hi>despiseth me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10. 16.</note> Therefore when
<hi>TURKS</hi> and <hi>JEWS</hi> mock and reproach us for believing in
CHRIST, they reproach both the Word, that so teacheth us, and
the Spirit that thus guideth us, and assureth our hearts herein; as he
that reproacheth a Servant for doing that his Master commands, or a
Schollar for speaking as he is taught, reproacheth the Master and
Teacher: So when the Papists call the Doctrine which we preach
and profess, Heresie, and us Heretiques, do they not reproach the
Word that so teacheth, and the Spirit that so assureth us? So they
among our selves, that rail on men for their zeal and forwardness in
hearing the Word, keeping the Sabbath, shunning some sins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
that the world swallow up, &amp;c. What do these, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
Gods Spirit? We do not these things of our selves, but by
the warrant of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Take heed therefore that that be evil which thou speakest against,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
else whilest thou reproachest goodness in thy Servant, Childe, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,

Commandments, nor that any should be more precise then they list
to be,<note place="margin">1 King. 22. 13.</note> despise the Word and Spirit; they be like <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Micaiah:</hi>
Wouldst thou have God to make new Scriptures, more loose to serve
thy turn, or to be like thy self? No, know, these Scriptures shall
stand firm, as to the comfort and salvation of all that are willing to
be guided thereby, so to the confusion of all that kick against the
same, or hate to be reformed. If therefore you list not to be ruled
by the Word and Spirit, yet speak not against the same, for so you
shall encrease your sin, and make your judgement greater, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will be great enough. If you will not walk in obedience to
Gods Laws, yet suffer others that would.</p>

word, who hath promised eternal life to them that hold out; so when
we obey him, and do that willingly he calls us to; so many praise
God for our constancy, whereby they be strengthened, and God is
honored,<note place="margin">See Ioh. 21. 19.</note> that they cannot prevail against us, but though they take

in life or death, we may effect this.</p>

                  <p>LEst any should think that he commended suffering in respect of it
self, so that all suffering should be blessed, and were to be rejoyced
in, he tells us, That there's another kinde of suffering, then that he
hath been speaking of, which is not to be rejoyced in; namely, when
men suffer reproach and punishment, or whatsoever else for evil doing,
for their just deserts: Those sufferings are base and shameful, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Christians must beware; but for the sufferings which are for
Christ, for Righteousness sake, for a good Conscience, there's no
shame belonging to them, but rather glory and rejoycing.</p>
                  <p>Here then are two kindes of sufferings laid down,<note place="margin">Two kindes of sufferings.</note> the one forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
whereto shame belongs, namely, to suffer for ill-doing, which is

flie from it; for that herein he resists the Magistrates Sentence on his

                  <p>Sufferings for ill-doing are not glorious,<note place="margin">Suffering for ill-doing are shameful.</note> but shameful: Sufferings
are good onely in respect of the cause; if that be good, then they be
good; if that be evil, then they be shameful: The same sufferings for
kinde and measure may be to one person glorious, to another infamous;
the one may have cause of joy, the other to hang down their heads:
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:65522:318"/>
Both <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> were killed, but he for his goodness, she for her
badness; both <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Officers were imprisoned, but he
unjustly, they justly: Such as are reviled, are blessed, provided it be
for the Name of Christ, and for Righteousness sakes.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh all that suffer for ill-doing,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> especially such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
therein; as 1. The Papists, who keep a Kalender of Martyrs, I
warrant you, that have suffered in our late Queens days, and since;
but they be the Devils Martyrs, if they be any: If they had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
faces, they would be ashamed of them; for why have they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered?
for their Religion? no such matter: Have they been asked, what
say you to the Mass, to Worshipping of Images, to Justification by
Works, &amp;c. if you will not recant these, you shall dye? no such thing;
but they have been convicted by Witnesses, or their own Confession,
of Treason and Mischief against the Prince, State and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and for these have they, according to the Laws of all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
and Kingdoms, as pestilent instruments, been cut off: Yet if they
had been put to death for their Religion, they had been no Martyrs,
for it had not been for the Truth or Gospels sake, but for maintaining
Lyes and Errors. None can dye the death of a Martyr, who hath
not first lived the life of a Christian, which they did never; they are
even as good Martyrs as those of our own, that be executed for their
theft and murther: They have a multitude of Saints in their Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that be Fire-brands in Hell. 2. Such as for their crimes and
faults bring sufferings upon themselves, as thieves, murtherers, &amp;c.
woful wretches, they have cause to hang down their heads, both in
respect of their sin, and the punishment that doth befal them; they
are herein companions with the Devil and Reprobates, that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for their sins: Others bring punishments upon themselves for their
Drunkenness, Whoredom, Cousenage, Oppression, Quarrelling,
Idleness, &amp;c. Others bring an ill report upon themselves, being noted
and ill-spoken of for Lyars, Backbiters, Slanderers, Tale-tellers, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Pinehers, Hard Dealers, Gamesters, Company-keepers, &amp;c.
3. Such as are professors of Christianity, and it may be have some
good things in them, which yet are justly blamed for some faults; for
one may be a Christian and be blamed, and yet not for his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
but for something he did before he was a Christian, or for some
fault that is yet in him: As some be justly blamed for being such
deep censurers of others, so for separating from the Church, living in
no Church at all, but setting up any ignorant persons to take upon
them the office of Preaching: So some among our selves are justly
blamed, for being too proud, given to censuring, and medling with
matters that concern them not: So some poor men that have nothing
but their Labor, and a Family depending upon them, that yet be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in their Callings, and look to live of others, and it may be go
to three or four Sermons in a week, and tarry abroad a day or two
here, three or four there, or, as some, go from house to house, and
live of others, who though they can talk well, yet must not be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in their Calling, or of their Families: So a number of Servants
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:65522:319"/>
that profess Religion, are very desirous to hear every Sermon, who
yet are idle, lazy, careless and untrusty, thinking that a little profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of goodness should bear out all; when-as thereupon there's
more required at their hands: These cause the Name of God to be
ill spoken of, fie upon it; it is your Masters duty to let you come to
the Word, and is it not as well your duty to give them an account
when you are come home (which some of you do not at all) and to
shew the fruit of your hearing, by your faithfulness in your particular
places?</p>
                  <p>2. Let all beware of these kindes of sufferings,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and those that have
besmeared themselves thus, seek to wash themselves clean again by
repentance to God, and better conversation to men; let us walk so
warily, that we may not in any case grieve the Servants of God, and
that the wicked may finde nothing justly to speak ill of us (as thus, He
is a Professor,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 5.</note> but covetous, idle, proud, &amp;c.) as the Princes, though
they watched <hi>Daniel</hi> narrowly, could finde nothing against him, but in
the cause of his God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed,]</hi> Now of
the other kinde of sufferings, whereof no man ought to be ashamed;
If a man suffer for Christs sake, his Christianity, godliness, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cause, and in that onely respect, for his goodness, for holding the
truth of the Gospel, for yielding obedience to the Word; Hereof
none need be ashamed, but rather thank God for the same. Here
note, That</p>
                  <p>Sufferings for godliness be glorious,<note place="margin">Sufferings for godliness are glorious.</note> they be the marks of Christ;
Christs sufferings, no shame belongs to them, for no shame belongs
to Christianity; The Cause is good and glorious, accordingly must
the sufferings so be: No shame belongs to goodness, no shame among
Turks to be counted and known a Christian, among Papists to be a
Protestant, among common Protestants to be a zealous server of God,
that desires to bring into practice that which we outwardly profess;
we need not care who know we be such, shame came in with sin, and
belongs to sin; to suffer for goodness, whether it be by word or deed,
as to be Apprehended, Imprisoned, put in Irons, Whipped, &amp;c. is not
shameful, but glorious; the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> might have boasted more of
his iron Chain, then others could have of their golden Chains; No
suffering is base, if it be for a good Cause: If one should be put in a vile
Dungeon, dragg'd at an Horse tale, &amp;c. yet being for the Cause of
Christ, he needed not be ashamed.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh all such that are ashamed of goodness,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and to be
ill spoken of for it; not onely the common sort who are ashamed of
no evil (as of Covetuosness, Swearing, Sabbath breaking, &amp;c. but
do even strive who should exceed others therein) are ashamed of the
least goodness, and would not be seen with a Bible in their hand, or
in good company, or to speak a good word, lest their companions and
betters should upbraid them: No, beware; well, they are not worthy of
the honor, they shall not need to fear it; But others that have some
goodness in them, as one would hope that are yet so ashamed of being
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:65522:319"/>
seen to be too forward, would hear oftner, but for fear they should be
counted Puritans, have their Landlords frown, &amp;c. and accordingly
grieve if they have a rebuke for their forwardness: Alas poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that see not what is their glory, are ashamed of that they should
glory in, namely their goodnes, which is the thing that commends eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man; even Kings in the Scripture are not otherwise commended but
for their goodness: Others as great as they, are either branded with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
or passed by in silence that had no goodness.</p>
                  <p>2. Take heed therefore you be not ashamed of God here,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> lest he
be ashamed of you another day: Do as <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
they built here and there Altars, and were not ashamed to call on the
Lord, neither was he ashamed of them to be called their God: Art
thou called Puritan? Answer, I am not so pure as I should be, I
pray God make me pure; you must be pure, else you shall never see
God: we must also take heed that we esteem not basely, nor be ashamed
of them that suffer for Christs sake, shunning and avoiding their
company lest forsooth it should be known weare friends to Puritans;
to those the world so calls and counts, and that for their goodness;
wo be to us if we be not friends and favorers of them, this being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a main mark of our Regeneration.<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 14.</note>

                     <note place="margin">To suffer for well-doing affords matter of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> As sufferings for God are a
benefit for which we are to praise God, so they be a great honor which
the Lord vouchsafeth his: Hereby we are tryed, made Partners with
Christ, the Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, that be now in Heaven,
are like our head in suffering,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 41.</note> and so shall be in glory, and shall rejoyce
at his coming,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> and for ever: This is an argument we are none of the
world, but chosen out of it, yea, that we are blessed, and have the
Spirit of God in us; hereby also we glorifie God: And might not
God have left us to our selves, and brought shameful sufferings upon
us for foul sins, as upon many others; yea, might have cast us to Hell,
to have most just and woful torments for ever and ever: Now seeing
he vouchsafeth to change our shameful sufferings here and hereafter
for our sins, into a few glorious sufferings for his names sake, it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge:
Therefore though there be some tartness in the afflictions
themselves, yet consider how they might have been, and now the
cause why they be, what Partners we have, what good they will do
us here, and what an happy end we shall have hereafter, we have
great and unspeakable cause to praise and glorifie God, which I pray
in Gods name let's labor (by faith) to bring our hearts unto.</p>

                     <q>For the time is come, that judgement must begin at the house

                  </head>
                  <p>HEre are more Reasons to the same purpose; 1. From the time;
God will now since Christs coming, exercise his Church with
greater tryals and trobules, then the ages before his coming in the
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:65522:320"/>
flesh. 2. The necessity of it, Judgement must come. 3. By making
comparison between the state of Gods children persecuted, and their
persecuters; yea, and all the wicked, for though these be chastened a
while, yet the end of the ungodly will be most fearful, which he sets
not down affirmatively, but with much more vehemency and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by interrogation, <hi>What shall the end be,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the time is come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Churches troubles are more now then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> &amp;c.] The Church is appointed to more crosses
and tryals since Christ under the Gospel, then before. True, it hath
been persecuted even from the beginning, and every true believer hath
had crosses and tryals, and the people of God have been persecuted
both of the prophane among themselves, and of others, yet never so
sorely nor commonly as since Christ, witness the ten bloody Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
with those which the Church hath since suffered by Heathen,
Turks, Papists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Because this time hath clearer promises, and a more
fuller revelation of Gods will, and Heaven as it were set open, and
Christ and all his benefits so set before our eyes, as we have much
more means of comfort and believing, and so of love to God, and
courage, and therefore may well undertake greater tasks; the time of
the Law, was the time of the infancy of the Church; the time of the
Gospel, the time of the maturity thereof: Therefore well may God
require and look for more obedience, and not in doing onely, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering;<note place="margin">Acts 2. 17.</note>
for God will not have the graces of his Spirit in his Servants
to rust. 2. The Lord hath promised great things of the people in time
of the Gospel:<note place="margin">Isaiah 4. 2. 27. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>He will pour out his Spirit upon them, knowledge shall abound,
yong men shall see visions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Now seeing its foretold, we should be
holy in these times, the Lord therefore must use the best means to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the same, whereof afflictions are one.</p>
                  <p>1. This confuteth that opinion of the Papists,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that teach, That
the Church in the New Testament should always so prosper and
flourish in wealth, and be conspicuous and glorious, and have victory
over the enemies thereof, which is rather the mark of the synagogue
of Satan, which is ever greater in number, and more pompous, for
though God give his Church breathings to be gathered, and to edifie
themselves, yet is it scarce at any time free from troubles.</p>
                  <p>2. It rebuketh those among our selves,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that the Gospel should bring
all peace and ease, and therefore when they see any troubles come for
it,<note place="margin">Amos 9. 9, 10, &amp;c.</note> they are offended: Its true, God gives peace and plenty, as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids
to wait upon the Gospel, yet either for chastisement for the
contempt of the Gospel, or tryal of his Servants profiting; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
hath troubles, and men must be content, and take the Gospel with
whatsoever troubles, and thank God too, and think they be gainers:
But many would have the rose, not the prickle, follow Christ for
loaves, and in hope for preferment, but hearing that he hath no where
to rest his head, they will be gone; These be but Hypocrites, and such
as never tasted indeed of the Gospel, for if they had, they would part
with all for it.</p>
                  <p>3. It should teach us all in these days,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> not to conceit of ease, credit, &amp;c.
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:65522:320"/>
for the Gospel brings a Sword, and therefore we must prepare for
hardship, yea, the Gospel brings enough with it, to make us willing
to suffer for it; The not thinking hereof, causeth unpreparedness, and
both either a flying from God, or else to bear them impatiently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That judgement must begin]</hi> By judgement is not meant plagues or
punishments for sin, as pieces of Gods wrath, and forerunners of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
(for such are those laid on the wicked) but merciful cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 32.</note>
and loving corrections, whereby we are moved to judge
our selves that we be not judged of the Lord, and condemned with
the world.</p>
                  <p>1. These afflictions must begin with Gods-Servants;<note place="margin">Afflictions must begin with Gods Servants.</note> 
                     <hi>Jacobs</hi> house
first, afterwards the <hi>Egyptians</hi> felt the Famine; first the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
oppressed, but afterwards the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themselves plagued; the <hi>Jews</hi>
were first carried into captivity, but afterwards the <hi>Assyrians</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi> 1. In respect of their sins, they are
full of terror and anguish of Spirit ere they can get any comfort, and
when they have obtained it, its often eclipsed, and they go mourning.
2. They are subject to many sicknesses, grievous pains, diseases, losses,
crosses, disgrace, persecution at the hand of the wicked, &amp;c. And thus
will God have his Church afflicted, either by his own hand, or by the
wicked. 1. To humble them for sin past, as <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren. 2. To
fetch them into the way from wandring, and teach them obedience,
as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonah.</hi> 3. To humble them. 4. To mortifie their lusts,
wean them from the world, and quicken them to duty. 5. Hereby
also God sheweth that he will not bear with sin in his dearest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
as he did not in <hi>David, Moses, Miriam.</hi> 6. To confute the
Devil, and shew that Gods people serve him not for wages. 7. To
shew them their happiness is to come, and that if God thus school his
Servants, that then he will deal severely with the wicked, so that this
may be a looking-glass to them.</p>
                  <p>1. Seeing God will have it thus,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and that his course is to begin
with his Children, we must not refuse the chastening of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
neither conclude against our selves, that we be none of the Lords,
because of this, as <hi>Gideon,</hi> but if we can prove it by other reasons,
let not this dismay; This is rather an argument we are the Lords,
though not of it self (because the wicked are also thus met with) yet to
be taught hereby to labor to see the Lords minde, and to make use, and
be patient, is a good sign, and know, seeing we be chastened here,
we have happiness remaining for us.</p>
                  <p>2. That none bless himself to be in Gods favor because of his great
prosperity,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> or for that his eyes stand out with fatness:<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>For</hi> Ishmael

                     <hi>and</hi> Esau <hi>the dew of Heaven, and</hi> Judas <hi>carryed
the bag:</hi> They might rather conclude, seeing they live wickedly, and
be not punished but prosper here, that therefore there remains a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
answer for them, and so there doth, as in the next clause appeareth.</p>
                  <p>3. Neither ought Gods children envy or be discouraged at the
prosperity of the wicked;<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> for they may from thence conclude, that
judgement is coming on them; but for themselves, that there's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:65522:321"/>
laid up for them; for if God can afford his enemies the blessings
of this life (which oftentimes even his own have in a scant measure)
how great happiness will he bestow upon them in the life to come?</p>
                  <p>2. Its of necessity that Gods Servants must here suffer troubles;<note place="margin">Why Gods children must here suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note>
and that 1. In respect of Gods will, he hath appointed us thereunto.
2. In respect of our necessity: Sin is so rivited into us, and in our
very nature, as it must be no small nor easie thing to pluck it out from
us: O our infidelity, pride, hypocrisie, self-love, frowardness, &amp;c.
how near do these cleave to us,<note place="margin">Psal. 32. 3, 4.</note> and how fast do they hang on? nay,
what a while is it ere an affliction works any thing to the purpose,
which therefore must either be long continued, or have another joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therewith: Who hath not need to have his heart more mollified?
to be weaned from the world, to be quickned to his duty &amp;c. how
soon do we forget an affliction, and therefore who hath not need to
be remembred?</p>
                  <p>Therefore let us not be against the Lords chastning:<note place="margin">Use.</note> Its better to
have a strong purgation, then to fall into spiritual diseases and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
whereunto we shall else be subject; there's no rule in the world
among children without rods: Neither use we untimely means, or
make over much haste to get out of them, but crave rather to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
renewed and increased in Faith, Patience, Humility, &amp;c. our care
is comfortable.</p>

and <hi>Cornelius</hi> had godly Families, God will have none that shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves unseemly, or not be subject to the Orders of his
House; we must not be away at meals, when the Family meet; If
God finde our place empty, when it should be full, as at Word and
Sacrament, he will be much provoked; if the second time, beware,
&amp;c. 2. We must follow our work hard, that our Master sets us about,
for he hath no idle persons in his Family; we must therefore know
what is our work in our general calling, as that we must walk holily,
righteously and soberly; what in our particular, as a Magistrate, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
Housholder, Servant, Husband, Wife, &amp;c. He will pay
well, and therefore looks to have his work done well and faithfully;
neither must we refuse any work he sets us about, as some skemish Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
do in our time, but do whatsoever he requires, knowing that he
appoints no work but whats fit and meet; and we must be at his hand
always, not as retainers, (God hath no such) but houshold Servants,
up-rising and down-lying. 3. We must bear patiently the rebukes of
our Master, and his corrections when we have done amiss; yea,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:65522:321"/>
learn to amend there by, not murmuring nor answering again. 4. We
must take our Masters part when we see him misused, or his goods
imbezeled, he will else pull our coats over our ears as unfaithful ones.</p>
                  <p>Towards each other. 1. There must be no contentions between us,
an honest Housholder will not endure it in his Family, much less can
the Lord away that there should be in his; How shall then the work
go forward? 2. We must love and joyn together against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and defend one another in goodness; not hinder, but further
one anothers works, and not envy that any of our fellow-servants
do more work then we; let us do what we can, and when we cannot,
yet be glad that our Masters work go forward.</p>
                  <p>2. It serves for comfort to all that be of the Lords Houshold;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> They
shall want no good thing, no direction, comfort, strength against
temptation; If we use the means, and make known our wants to God,
he that requires us to work, will not suffer us to want wherewithal;
yea, for outward things, we shall not want what is meet: He that
bids us provide for our Families, and saith, he is worse then an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
that doth not, will not fail us in our lawful endeavors: Haply he
will not always give all we desire, but what is meet; and hereafter we
shall be taken up to his other house in Heaven, when we have been
sufficiently purged here.</p>
                  <p>3. It may be for terror to all that misuse Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and buffet them, when they be at their work; God will
not put it up, but defend even the meanest Servant in his Family.</p>
                  <p>4. It may be for direction;<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> let us prove our selves his true Servants,
Covenant-Servants, and no hang-by's; for as about Princes and great
Mens Houses, be many that be not in Covenant for wages, nor are
setled Servants, of whom any charge is taken: So in the Church,
the Lords House, there are a number that work not the Lords work,
but the Devils, and are of his Family; for he hath two Families, one
of reprobate souls in Hell, the other of unbelievers and wicked here
on Earth: These work earnestly for the Devil, yet they will come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Gods House, and the Devil is content they should, so long as they
keep their heart and life to him; yea, they will put over their leg, and
sit down at the table to eat of the bread prepared for the Lords Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but he will come in and view them, and finding them without a
wedding Garment, and such as be not in Covenant with him, he will
cause them to be bound hand and foot, and cast into utter darkness;
These shall have their wages where they have done their work: Hast
thou been such a one? humble thy self before God, bid adieu to thy
old master, and come in good earnest, and enter Covenant, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be a true and dutiful Servant to God, and he will have mercy
on thee, and take thee into his Service, and then mayest thou have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and challenge the priviledge of the Family.</p>
                  <p>If it first begin at us, <hi>&amp;c.] Here note,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That the Apostle puts himself in the number of such as were

Labor we therefore to attain hereunto,<note place="margin">Use.</note> else what joy can we have
of our lives?<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> we are bid make our calling and election sure, and
why do we it not? wouldst thou know to what family thou dost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
thou mayest by the works thou doest: If we work the works
of God,<note place="margin">Iohn 8. 44.</note> of Holiness and Righteousness in our general callings, and
be faithful in our special callings, then are we of Gods Family; if the
works of sin, then are we of our Father the Devil: You may come
into Gods House, as many an hypocrite and Beast doth, but of his
house you be not; try whose work thou doest: Thou doest some
work of Gods, and some of the Devils; no, if we do any work wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
for the Devil, we do none for God aright, nor that he accepts.
Again, if thou dost not believe nor repent, thou art none of Gods
Family; if thou art an unrighteous person, thou art none of his, yea,
if we be of Gods house, we cannot abide to hear our Master ill spoken
of, nor any of our fellow-servants for their goodness, but our hearts
will rise against it; contrarily, if we be such as dishonor God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the sincerity of the Gospel, and power of Religion, with
them that desire so to walk, yea, or can hear them ill spoken of, and
are not grieved thereat, its a sign we be none of Gods Family, but
the Devils.</p>
                  <p>2. That there's no small difference between the state of Gods
children and the wicked;<note place="margin">The state of the godly and ungodly much different.</note> even the state of the godly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the many troubles wherewith their life is filled, is to be
preferred before the state of the wicked, notwithstanding their
present jollity: The state of the godly is infinitely better then
the wicked's, both in this life, in death, and at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Those are freed from the curse and wrath of God, and all evil,
are reconciled and made the children of God, and are covered with
Christs righteousness: These are in danger of all condemnation, remain
children of the Devil, Enemies to God, altogether in their own
filthiness; all Creatures both in Heaven and Earth are at Peace with
those, but all at odds with these; Angels guard the one, the other are
a prey to the Devil; the one working the works of holiness, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, and shall have eternal life, the other the filthy
scullery of the Devil,<note place="margin">Psal. 11. 6.</note> shall have Hell; the one are beloved of God,
the other hated; the person and prayers of the one are acceptable to
God, the others abominable in his sight; of the one all things, their
afflictions,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> yea, their sins turn to their good, to the other, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God,<note place="margin">Isaiah 4. 5.</note> yea, his holiest Ordinances turn to their hurt: Those
are called the glory,<note place="margin">Psal. 1. 3, 4.</note> these dross; those are as a tree planted by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of waters, &amp;c. these as the chaff which the wind driveth away;
those are as wheat for the garner, these cockle and tares to be bundled
up for the fire: the wicked seem more excellent outwardly, but they are
like painted Sepulchres, like rotten wood shining in a dark night; the
godly are like a plain leather Casket, with a precious Pearl therein of
unspeakable worth: Turn them which way you will, if both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
infinite odds, one being the childe of God, the other of the
Devil; the godly hath more joy and peace in well-doing, then the
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:65522:322"/>
wicked of all their jollity; the ones prosperity is a pledge of better
things in Heaven, the others is sent in wrath to fat them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
If both in adversity alike, yet infinite odds; the one
chastened of God, as a Father doth his children, for their great good,
the other pursued in vengeance, by a just Judge, as fore-goers of
greater plagues; for the one Gods arrows are dipt in poyson, for the
other, the poyson is taken away in Christs Sufferings; On the one
God hath promised to lay no more then they are able to bear, the
other have no such promise; the one have Gods promise to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and uphold them in them, as also assurance, as of good by it, so
of a good and happy end, and after this life their joys to begin, that
never shall end, but the other have no such promises; nay, when
this life ends, then shall begin their Torments, which shall never end;
nay, put the godly in the greatest misery that can be, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
in the greatest jollity, like <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or if ye will
chain the one in a Dungeon about his feet, middle and neck, and let
the other ride in all pomp, and with all the attendance and honor
that the world can afford, yet the one is infinitely more happy then
the other. In death the Righteous have hope, the wicked none, but are
either full of horror or blockish: After death these go to Hell, those
to Heaven; the children are taken up into the Chambers of Christ,
the Dogs and ungodly are cast out of doors: At the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the one shall stand with comfort on the right hand, the
other with terror on the left, both being raised up: The wicked shall
have the wound that death gave them healed up (as Traytors be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their hurts, that they may come to execution) and thereupon
both in body and soul shall be cast into Hell fire; though the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with joy, yet they end with wo; and though the other begin hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
here, yet they end with joy in Heaven, and this life is nothing
to that's to come: Could we discern this, we would reverence the
one highly, and no less pity the others; yea, should the ones troubles
here, infinitely exceed the others jollities, or the troubles of the godly
be here greater then they are, as also the jollity of the wicked, we
would not change with them.</p>
                  <p>1. This confuteth the blinde world,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that esteemeth basely of Gods
servants, and of their state; but let us never think the worse of our
estate for them, as a plain rich man doth not, when a vain bragging fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in brave apparel goes swaggering scornfully by him.</p>
                  <p>2. This may and ought wonderfully to comfort Gods servants,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
that hath advanced them to this high dignity, passing by so many
others: O that we would walk worthy hereof in an holy and pure
conversation.</p>
                  <p>3. This may be a choak to the wicked,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> notwithstanding all their
jollity, and make them weary of their condition, laboring to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
godly, and of Gods house, that so they may be truly happy.</p>
                  <p>What shall the end of them be that obey not the Gospel of God?] <hi>Here's
implyed,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That though the afflictions of Gods people be many and great,
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:65522:323"/>
yet they are nothing in respect of the miseries which shall befal the
ungodly:<note place="margin">The afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the miseries of the ungodly.</note> The Lord is Judge of all the world, and he will deal justly
and equally, even give every one according to their works: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he afflict his children with rods, he will plague his enemies with
scourges;<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 5.</note> if he will not bear with sin in his own servants that are
careful to please him,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 6.</note> and stand in awe, and yet be overtaken, then
he will be dreadfully revenged of those that make a trade of sin; if
his children in their conversion, and often afterward upon any sin
committed, have gripes of Conscience, and suffer the terrors of
God,<note place="margin">See Psal. 78. 55. 65.</note> then shall the wicked have a gnawing Worm that shall never
dye;<note place="margin">Isa. 27. 27.</note> if those be brought, as it were, along by Hell, these shall be
left and swallowed up of Hell:<note place="margin">Ier. 25. 29. and 49. 12.</note> The Lord began with the Israelites
in Captivity, but ended with the Egyptians, in drowning them in
the Red-sea; the three Children were put into the fiery Fornace, not
burnt, but fire seized on them that put them in; <hi>Daniel</hi> was put into
the Lyons Den, but his Enemies and Accusers were devoured; Israel
was carried Captive, but <hi>Ashur</hi> destroyed; the children are beaten
with the rod, thereafter its burnt; God chastens his for a few days
here to their amendment, but the wicked shall be cast into eternal fire.
In reading, hearing and seeing what grievous things the Lord hath
laid on his own children, the wicked may see, as in a glass, the woful
state that abides them.</p>
                  <p>2. That the torments prepared for the ungodly in death and at the
day of Judgement,<note place="margin">The ungodly's misery cannot be expressed.</note> are such as cannot be expressed: The Apostle
knew that they should have a fearful end; but utter the further end of
it, and lay it out to the full, he could not, therefore is forced to say,
<hi>What shall be the end?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 2.</note> Its a wonderful love of God, that he hath
made us his Children, but yet its not manifest what we shall be, that
is,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> it cannot be exprest what happiness is prepared for us: <hi>Eye hath not
seen, nor ear hath not heard, what God hath prepared for his children:</hi> So
cannot any decypher the fearfulness of the wo prepared for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:
Such shall be separated from God and from his Saints, and
have their portion with the Devil and damned: O the universality of
their torments, both in respect of their bodies and souls! O the
greatness of their pangs, tormented with fire and brimstone! O the
eternity of them! They shall be world without end: If a man in pain
should shed a tear or drop of water from his eye once in a thousand
years, and no more, yet sooner should he make a whole Sea, before
this time will end.</p>
                  <p>1. O what an iron scourge should this be to drive the wicked to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
not resting till they know they be freed from this woful
lake! O let them never glory in their prosperity, as long as they are
in danger hereof! If any will not break off their sins and fear,
they will prove costly profits and pleasures; and they that will not
believe and fear here, shall feel them to eternal destruction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>2. How should this glad the hearts of all Gods people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that know
themselves freed from this fearful lake, and make them walk chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:65522:323"/>
and obediently all their days, to the honor of him that by his
sufferings hath freed them therefrom; yea, should we not bear our few
afflictions patiently, being freed from these endles and easeles ones, and
not to envy at the prosperity of the wicked, seeing it shall have such
an end? let their beginning be what it will be, if this be their end, God
keep us from having any part therein.</p>

                     <hi>If the righteous]</hi> Hereby we are to understand, not such as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
righteous in themselves, and without sin; for if there be any
such (as there is none) they should not scarcely, and with difficulty
be saved, but according to that, do this and live, easily and without
stop: Even the most perfect have not been without their own failings;
there was impatience in <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat 9. 13.</note> infidelity in <hi>Zachary, &amp;c.</hi> not meant

imputed unto them by Faith: They that have their sins pardoned in
his death, and his righteousness imputed to them, are truly righteous,
yea, and perfectly too, as ever they shall be in heaven. 2. By inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

by the Spirit of Sanctification, whereby they be sanctified
throughout, though not perfectly, yet those God vouchsafeth to call
righteous, though they be but so in part, and have remnants of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
abiding in them, yet they are so called from the better part,
as an heap of corn that lies on the floor, though there be chaff in it, and
that much. 3. For that they endeavor, and daily labor after more
righteousness; as one is called a Schollar, or by the name of the trade
he is entred into, though happily he can do but a little, onely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
for skill and knowledge therein: Of which elswhere.</p>

1. This setteth out the exceeding goodness and mercy of God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
that vouchsafeth thus to come and call such poor and sinful creatures
as we be, pestred with such a deal of blindeness, and so manifest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;
yet seeing he seeth an heart in us to hate them, and suppress
them, he will not reckon of us after them; and though we have but
a little grace, yet because it is true, and of his own working that we
have, and that we would fain have more, he accounts of us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that we would be, and not that we are.</p>
                  <p>2. This is an exceeding comfort to Gods true Servants;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Christs righteousness imputed to us, and feel we an universal and
true change in us, then may we rejoyce; God calls us by glorious
names, Saints, Holy ones, Righteous, let us not then be dismaid at
our imperfections or corruptions, which we labor to mortifie; lets
not say with some, because of them we are none of the Lords, we
have such sinful hearts, &amp;c. Neither let us suffer the Devil to pluck
our Crown from us, or rob us of our comfort, making us believe that
we be none of the Lords; as some few be thus in danger, especially
at first, though many Christians make too light of their sins; as long
as God speaks so graciously, let us not believe what Satan our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
saith, onely let us care to grow more and more in grace.</p>
                  <p>3. This rebuketh those wretched mockers that reproach the Servants
of God,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that labor to please God, and dare not do as they: O you be
of the righteous, you be so righteous, &amp;c. Is not this right like <hi>Ishmaels</hi>
mocking of <hi>Isaac?</hi> O you be the Son of the promise, you are
the dainty one, &amp;c. Such shall be shut out with <hi>Ishmael,</hi> unless
by repentance they prevent it: Why say you thus? because you
think it to good a name for them? Is thine eye evil, because Gods
is good? what hast thou to do, seeing God calls them so? or is it
because thou wouldst not have them so?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9.</note> Yes; but if thou beest not

Among earthly Judges, when a cause hath gone current on a
mans side a great while, yet at last, either by corruption of Jury or
Judge, or by some evidence come to light, not seen before, all may be
dasht and turn'd the other way: It shall not be so at Gods judgement
seat;<note place="margin">Its an hard thing for a man to get to Heaven.</note> there will be question made of the damnation of some, but no
question made of the salvation of any of the godly: But the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is in this life; its an hard thing for a man to get to heaven (called
therefore a Straight gate,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 14.</note> and Narrow way) a hard thing to come to
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:65522:325"/>
be a Christian, a converted person, and an hard thing to continue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and grow forward. God hath much ado to bring us to grace,
and then much ado to hold us therein; as he had a great deal ado to
get his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and into <hi>Canaan,</hi> sometimes themselves
by murmuring, lingering, &amp;c. and sometimes others, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the
Red-sea, &amp;c. proving hinderances thereto; so hath he to get one of
us out of the bondage of the Devil; out of the <hi>Egypt</hi> of sin: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
holds, the world hinders, yea, our own wretched nature is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to come out: What a stir hath he? how many Sermons, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
Promises, secret gripes of Conscience, Warnings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
purposes to come out, and yet keep in still, ere we will yield?
yea, how is God fain almost to pull us out by some crosses or sharp
afflictions, as the Angels pulled <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> how hardly are
we throughly humbled for our sins? when cast down, how hardly
comforted? when we have got it, how hardly do we keep it? what
a stir with our hearts to leave our old courses and take new? and when
we have begun, yet what ado to hold out? what revolting and
backsliding hearts have we? ready to wax cold, and to linger after
our old lusts, so hard it is to do any good duty well. The Devil, like
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> pursueth us, and labors by all means possible to hinder us from
all good altogether, or from the right performance of it, so also to
draw us to all evil: Then the world like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Soldiers, labors
to hinder us by their ill example, by ill counsel, by vails of profits
and pleasures, and if these not, by reproaches and troubles that it will
raise up. Our own Nature is worst of all, as having a lingering after
our old sins, as the Israelites after the fleshy pots of <hi>Egypt;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we think like them, we shall never hold out, there be such lets
in the way, high walls, and <hi>Anakims,</hi> &amp;c. so that we get forward
hardly; as a man that were to go up a steep hill, and had three great
weights hung at his back; so that we have such continual need of the
Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Meditation, Conference, Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that unless hereby, we wax cold, and grow out of order; nay,
notwithstanding all these, yet what ado to keep our hearts and lives
in order, and our selves within compass, but we slip and stumble, and
grieve, and up again, and down again; yea, if the Lord to all these
means should not adde some one or other affliction, it would be yet
more hard: The Lord is fain to pull us with that strong cord also, and
this is chiefly meant here, <hi>they are scarcely saved,</hi> even because they are
forced to be brought through many troubles; so that as a man that is
to climb such a steep hill, as he cannot fasten his feet, but is fain to
get Daggers in his hands, and sticking them into the ground, &amp;c. may
be said hardly to get up;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and as when two Armies fight for a Town,
one while one part prevails, another while the other, at last the better
side prevails, but notwithout much pains, many wounds, shrewd blows,
and continual labor, we may say, They got the Town hardly; the
like may be said in this particular: Who knoweth not the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in his own experience? how hardly canst thou be humbled? how
hardly drawn to renounce thy lusts? how art thou fain to wrestle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:65522:325"/>
thou canst do any good? what continual need hast thou of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
good company, &amp;c. yea, who knowing any thing, seeth not he
hath need of his crosses, and that it was good for him that he was
afflicted?</p>
                  <p>1. This crosseth the most gross,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and yet most common conceit of
the world, that its an easie matter to be saved, that there's no need of
such preciseness, but that if men mean well, God will be content,
and though one have lived badly, yet at what time soever they repent
(for which a quarter of an hour is enough) it shall be well with them;
and hence it is, that the Word and our Preaching is of such small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and that so few take any pains to be saved, but take pains for
the belly and back, and to grow rich, &amp;c. Ignorant persons look not
out, but content themselves with a blinde good meaning, without any
part of a good life; so prophane persons, so worldlings, so civil
ones: Though the Scripture requires us to labor, strive, give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
study, seek, yet will not they take any pains; nay, not onely
so, but they laugh and gibe at them that labor herein, as fools or idle
persons: What art thou woful wretch, that darest cross the Lord so
directly? He saith, <hi>Its a strait way, and few finde it;</hi> and to this end,
bids Strive; Thou sayest its no such matter: If it were as thou dotest,
Christ might not onely have spared those speeches, but indeed the
whole Scriptures; for what use of any, but to bid people live as they
list, and at last cry God mercy, and all is well: No, God must
make new Scriptures, and chalk a new way to Heaven, ere ever thou
shalt finde that thou lookest for: But what art thou, that neither wiltst
take pains to save thine own soul, nor canst be content that others
should? Dost thou think that they be idle persons that take pains to
hear the word? O, they could follow the world, and that too hard,
but that they know one thing is needful: Could they not sit at home
in their chairs, or keep their beds, as well as rise and toil, &amp;c. but that
they know that they cannot so get Heaven, but that they have need
to use all means, and that little enough, though thou seest no such
thing: Indeed, to lead a careless life, to do good if it come in the way,
and if ill come in the way, to be as fit for that, &amp;c. a few Sermons, and
little hearing may serve for such a life, but this is not the way to get
Heaven: If ever thou wouldst be saved, thou must change thy
minde, and practice and believe the Scriptures, that its a strait way,
and accordingly bend thy self to begin to take pains, to see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
thy sins, to labor for faith, to turn to God, to strive against the
Flesh, the World and Devil; thus as hard as it is, thou mayest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
O strive whilst thou mayest, for many shall strive that shall
not enter in, and thank God a thousand times, that thus striving thou
mayest obtain.</p>
                  <p>2. Let every man prove whether he be in the strait way or not:<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
Many say, They thank God they have ever been of a good belief, and
never doubted of Gods good will in their lives, and that they thank
God they have a good minde ever, and can serve God with all their
hearts, and that they are not troubled with any such temptations as
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:65522:326"/>
they hear some complain of, and that they thank God they be not so
wicked, that they should need so many Sermons as some do; and
that they have ever prospered, and have had as few crosses as any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
&amp;c. These will think ill of me to unsettle them, but their state is
too smooth, and too easie to be the way to Heaven, its rather the
broad green way to Hell: They that never doubted, never believed,
that have been ever good, were never good; so they that have had no
dumps nor fears at any time: For Christ calls none but sinners, but
the heavy laden; they that can serve God with all their heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any trouble, the Devil hath them sure some other way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
troubles them not in their duties, because he knows they be but
lost labor, done in hypocrifie, or else he draws away their mindes,
and they feel it not: Those that can do well without resistance, be
better then St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> who could not do the good he would; its a sign
they be all flesh, for were there any Spirit in them, there would be
opposition; let such know, their state is naught: This way will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bring them to Heaven; what would you have or lose all this
time? better begin twice, then be damned once.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, some say, They have gone a troublesom way, and
full of labor and difficulty, have much ado to be humbled, much to get
comfort, then much to hold it, so that they have had much strife with
themselves for some lusts, and to take up some duties; much ado with
their old companions, and that they can do no good but with such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and pain, as Pray, Read, Hear, &amp;c. and what a stir they have
to bridle their nature (and have had no more but needs) many crosses,
&amp;c.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> let these be of good comfort; this is a sign of the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
and as a man that is going to some Inheritance, being before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the rugged miry and troublesome way he must go through,
finding it so, though it somewhat trouble him, yet it more joys him,
that hereby he knows he is in his way; so cannot it but rejoyce those
that thus labor, as knowing that they are in their way: let us be of
good comfort, and strive still, and we shall at last get to Heaven, and
be saved, though it be thus scarcely and with difficulty; for faithful
is he that hath promised, who shall separate us from his love? He that
that hath begun the good work in us, will perfect it; The gates of
Hell shall not be able to prevail against us, we shall get to Heaven in
spite of the Devil, the World, and our own Lusts: Our Father is
stronger then they; That's a racking uncomfortable opinion of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that men may strive all their days, and at last lose all: No, wo were
then to us; If our Salvation were in our own keeping, it might and
would be lost.</p>
                  <p>3. This teacheth all Gods Servants to take pains,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and strive hard
to get to Heaven; even Gods Servants are herein faulty, that they
think it not so hard to be saved, and therefore are the more secure and
lazy, take too little pains, watch not, put not on their armor, labor
for no more grace then they had seven years ago: O lets strive more
against our lusts, labor for more strength and grace, pray, hear, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
watch continually, &amp;c. Its not praying once a day will serve
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:65522:326"/>
us, but as often as we have need, else if we spare our pains herein, and
be negligent in these duties, we shall smart another way, fall the
more into sin, have the more discomfort, bring more labor and charge
upon our selves, as he that lets his house go out of reparation to avoid
trouble and charge; nay, how often meet we with crosses upon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of these duties? O whil'st others are encreasing their iniquities,
and making more rods for themselves, let us these holy days and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
time take pains to further our selves to Heaven; And as Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
chear up one another, lend one another their hand to help them
up, if they be down, or an high or slippery place; so let us help one
another to Heaven all that we can: Neither let us be unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
afflictions, nor impatient under them, but rather bear them quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and thankfully, seeing they help us up this hill of Sanctification to
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where shal the ungodly and sinner appear?]</hi> If they that take great pains,
yet get hardly to Heaven, then what shall become of them that lay
down the rein, doing what they list, and taking no pains at all;
Here's the comparison, shewing the woful state remaining for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
at the last day: By ungodly, we are to understand such as live
wickedly, and indeed as if there were no God. Heaven or Hell; and
by sinners, such as go on impenitently in their sins, whether ignorants,
prophane persons,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 8.</note> civil persons, or Hypocrites: All are sinners, and
if we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves; yet there be of them,
which have sin in them, whom God will call righteous; but of the
workers of iniquity, of those that make as it were a trade of sin,
and return a great deal, being great dealers therein, our Apostle is
here to be understood.</p>
                  <p>These two,<note place="margin">He that is not righteous is ungodly and a sinner.</note> ungodly and sinner, be opposed to righteous, so that
whoso is not righteous, is an ungodly one and a sinner: If such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reproved shall say, Are not all of you sinners? are you without
sin? and shall think thus to hide themselves; let them know, that the
righteous (though not without sin) do both hate sin, and purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it before, strive against it at the present, and are sorry after they
have committed the same, none of which are found in these ungodly
and sinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where shall they appear?]</hi> He asks not because he knew not, for he
knew they should and must appear before the Judgement seat of
Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 10.</note> and knew also that they should be set on the left hand, to hear
that dreadful sentence pronounced against them, <hi>Go ye cursed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
&amp;c. but speaks thus to shew the fearfulness of their state; for
its more then if he had said, They shall appear to condemnation,
Where shall they appear?<note place="margin">The fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlies condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be expressed.</note> as if he could not express what a fearful
appearance they should have: To flee therefrom they cannot, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should they, all being on fire? To resist they cannot, they have
nothing wherewith, they are naked of their pomp and retinue: Hide
themselves they cannot from his all-seeing eye; to abide the presence
of this Judge, is impossible: O they will then call to the hills to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them! we think that the Jews, <hi>Judas, Pilate,</hi> and the Soldiers,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:65522:327"/>
shall have a fearful appearance, but many among our selves shall have
a worse then some of them: Do not we prefer our lusts before Christ,
as the Jews did <hi>Barrabas?</hi> Do not many among us pierce him with
their sins? Crucifie him again, persecute him in his Members? This
will not be the state onely of poor snekes, or of the common multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
but of the greatest and mightiest potentates, <hi>Nimrods,</hi> Gyants:
O these shall wail before him, beating their knees one against another!</p>
                  <p>They that have sit as Judges of Gods Servants in their Velvet coats
and Gold Chains, shall now stand naked before this Judge: Here they
dare appear any where, yea, where Gods Servants oftentimes care not
for appearing, but we shall one day appear with joy, where they shall
not shew their faces.</p>
                  <p>O that this might strike terror into wicked mens hearts,<note place="margin">Use.</note> to think of
this day, and might be a choak to all their ungodly profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:
O this day will pay for all! O that they could be perswaded
now to kiss the Son, now to humble themselves before him, now to
stoop to him, and imbrace him as their Savior; yet how many wicked
wretches be there, that will hope to be saved as well as the best, even
notorious ones? O fearful impudency! you saved, then who shall
be damned? The Turks and Heathens that know not God. True,
but not with such a destruction as shall befal you, your stripes shall
be worse and more then theirs, your day is coming, you have had the
start of Gods Children, you have been first in prosperity, as they in
trouble, but ere long their mourning shall be turned into mirth, your
joy into everlasting misery.</p>

an Exhortation to commend our selves to God in our troubles; those

us, and not fail us: He is Almighty, and can do it; He is also most
loving,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10.</note> and hath made many promises in his Word so to do: <hi>Be we

to get through it, but cast thy self on God, who never failed any that
put thier trust in him: Do not we rely on our selves? for this were the
way to fail, like <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> who fell shamefully; but trust in
God, Pray, use all good means, and set thy faith on work to depend
on God, to be well carried through thy trouble to the end, and from
death to Heaven: Thus did our Savior, and after him St. <hi>Steven,</hi>
                     <pb n="612" facs="tcp:65522:328"/>
commend their Spirits into the hands of God: O our unbelieving
hearts, that fail as soon as any great tryal comes, as the Israelites up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s pursuing them; yea, are ready to sink, to be dismaid, to
put our hand to some unlawful means: If we had faith enough, what
Victories might we get, what Conquerors might we be? we shrink
and are dismaid as if we had none to trust in, or as if God were not
Almighty, or had made no promises, or at least were not faithful: O
let us rebuke our unbelief, and gather up our selves and Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and examples of his goodness to his, and rest upon them, as on
an unmoveable foundation.</p>

our hands to unlawful means, then God takes no charge of us, then
have we cut off our selves from all hope and comfortable commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>1. Therefore be we perswaded,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that our greatest comfort in our
trouble must be to stick close to God, and so long God hath tyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

Therefore in what danger soever we be, let us never put out our hands
to unlawful means, as to run to wizards, in poverty to steal, in any
danger to forfeit a good conscience: Our comfort is then gone, and
Gods promise belongs no further to us, at least till we humble our
selves, and be reconciled upon our repentance for it.</p>
                  <p>2. No ungodly man in any strait can have any warrant or comfort

him whom they have served: they that have given their souls to God
in believing and obeying here, may with comfort yield up their souls,
and say, Lord, The soul thou gavest me, and hast redeemed, sanctified,
preserved, and with which I have unfainedly served thee, or which
now in suffering, I have sacrificed for thee, I do now commend it to
thy keeping: This soul God will most readily take, its more his then
thine, he loves it well: But for a wicked man, either he cannot have
the face to commend his soul to God, as wherewith he hath at no time
served him, but the Devil his Enemy, or if he be so impudent, God
will take no knowledge thereof.</p>

and very hurtful to the Ministery and Ministers of the
Word of God,<note place="margin">The duties of Ministers, with reasons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the same.</note> namely, Idleness, Covetousness, and
Pride, seeketh to prevent these in all Ministers, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them to the diligent and faithful performance
of their duties belonging to them; namely, 1. To
feed the flock of God, that is, to Preach the wholsome Word of
God diligently to them. 2. To take the oversight thereof, that is, to
have a special care of them, and regard of all their lives and behavior,
applying themselves to them accordingly. 3. To be examples to them
of pure, humble, and godly conversation; nor doth he onely exhort
to the doing of these, but to the right maner of performing the same:
They must be done, 1. Not by constraint, that is, out of fear of
Gods wrath, or force of mens Laws, but willingly. 2. Not for filthy
lucre, but of a ready and free minde, seeking Gods glory and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Salvation. 3. Not being lordly or haughty in their carriage, but
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:65522:329"/>
examples of humility and godliness: The Reasons whereby he urgeth
the same are diverse; The 1. taken from his own person, verse 1. where
are three motives to perswade them to obey his counsel, even for that
he was <hi>a Minister</hi> as they were, <hi>a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and
a partaker of the glory to come in Heaven.</hi> The 2. For that the people
were Gods flock and his heritage. The 3. For that they did depend
on them for instruction and means of Salvation. The 4. For that
hereupon they should receive a Crown of glory that fadeth not
away.</p>
                  <p>Speak we first of those duties in general, then in particular.</p>
                  <p>In general, Ministers being here instructed in their duty as people
elsewhere: Note,</p>
                  <p>1. That the Scripture is not partial,<note place="margin">The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures inform every one of their duty.</note> binding some to duty, and
leaving others at liberty, but indifferently teacheth all; yea, the greater
place that any is in, the more duty it requireth (every honor carrying
a burthen of duty) and the more need have such to do their duties for
the example of others: Above all others, Ministers have most need
both to be instructed in their's, and also to perform the same; for on
theirs depends the well-doing of the people, both in their general
and special callings: for how shall the people have these things, if
they receive them not from the Ministers of God put apart for that
end? how shall they else be either good Christians, or good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
Husbands, Housholders, &amp;c. If the great wheel of the clock
that should turn all the rest do stand still, so also must all the rest.</p>
                  <p>1. When people are informed of their duties,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and amongst others,
of their duties towards their Ministers, as of love, honor, reverence,
obedience, maintenance, &amp;c. they must yield thereto, not think much
hereof, for God hath laid as great a burthen on their Ministers, which
they are charged with, yea, they must be thankful to God, that hath
had such a special care of their souls, as so weightily to charge Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
therewith; as its no small comfort to the poor, that God hath
taken such order for them by so many commandments, so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
also, and threats to the rich: People also ought in any wise to
be careful of their own souls, and joyn with the Lord in care, who is
so careful of them: Heavy is the state, and will be the answer of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
people, who though they see this care in God to command his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to preach diligently, to care for them, to give them good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
which according to their charge they do, yet they minde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor are ever the better, by feeding, care or example.</p>
                  <p>2. For Ministers,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> they must take heed, that having gotten into this
calling, and a living on their backs, they do not think themselves at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to do what they will, something or nothing, or but a little, and
that when they list, and look for much reverence, obedience, and
maintenance, and care not to do their part, and to procure this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it from the people; but to know that they are as much tyed to
their duty, and shall be countable to God: Its an easie matter to look
for much,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 35.</note> but its more worthy of a Minister to perform much: <hi>Its a
more blessed thing to give then to receive:</hi> Let us therefore know we stand
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:65522:329"/>
charged deeply by our office, and by how much our calling is more
excellent, and the trust more that hath been laid upon us, so much
the stricter account we must make.</p>
                  <p>2. That the calling of the Ministry is a very painful calling;<note place="margin">The calling of the Ministery a painful cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> The
duties here exhorted unto imply the same. Hence it is, that its called
a work, a worthy work, a laboring in the Word and Doctrine, yea,
its a most high and honorable calling: Hence it is, that Ministers are
called Stars, the light of the World, the salt of the Earth, Angels,
Ambassadors, such as are employed about the highest things, the
Word, Sacraments, Prayer, &amp;c. for the gaining of mens souls,
whereas Phisitians take care of their bodies, and Lawyers of their
Estates; They are appointed of God, as instruments to open the eyes
of the blinde, and to translate them out of the power of darkness to
the power of God, and of children of wrath, to make them the
children of God; Here's honor indeed, but not without labor: Their
titles of Builders, Husbandmen, Soldiers, Watchmen, Shepherds,
&amp;c. do also imply the same: This burthen of the Ministery, was after
a sort prefigured by the burthen of the Ark which was imposed upon
the Priests,<note place="margin">See <hi>Downham</hi> of the duty and dignity of the Ministery, page 17.</note> wherein was the golden Pot with Manna, <hi>Aarons</hi> bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Rod, the two Tables of the Covenant, and upon the Ark, the
propitiatory overshadowed with the glorious Cherubims: By the
Manna, we may understand the Sacraments; By the Rod, Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Discipline; By the budding and fruitfulness of it, their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
conversation; By the Tables, the Preaching of the Law; The
Propitiatory signified Christ, understood the ministery of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
committed to the Ministers of God, both in respect of Prayer,
and also of Preaching. Again, to Preach painfully, what prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is required hereto? what Reading, Meditation, Prayer, Labor
of the minde, &amp;c? and for the delivery thereof, it spends not onely
the outward, but the vital parts, and wastes the Spirit, which being
hurt, is hardliest holpen. Again, to teach the ignorant, convince the
gainsayer, comfort the heavy, admonish the disobedient, exhort them
that be in a good way, pray for all, publikely and privately, watch
to withstand all the Devils assaults, rebuke the stubborn, have an eye
to hereticks and deceivers, that creep in to beguil and lead away,
especially new converts that be in their first heart of love, perswading
them (as some Brownists have out of a proud discontented Spirit)
that we are no Church, and that Christ doth not reign among us
as King, &amp;c. who will not accouut this a laborious, hard, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
task?</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh the common and base opinion of the world,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that
the Ministers calling is an idle calling, and that they do nothing for
their living, and that of all others they might best be spared. <hi>A.</hi> This
is true indeed of those which fleer, but feed not the flock, being meer
drones and ciphers, who should not eat, because they labor not, whose
account shall be fearful in respect of their idleness, and the taking of
wages for which they work not at all: But because some are such, are
all so? Is the calling it self an idle calling? have not men souls as well
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:65522:330"/>
as bodies, and as much need of help for the good of the one as of the
other? Is there need of Physitians and Lawyers, and not of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?
Hath God ordained any other means whereby men may come
to Knowledge, Faith and Repentance? And is there not a labor of
the minde as well as of the body? Do the Prince, Councellors, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
&amp;c. nothing, because they work not with their hands?
Their work is great, in foreseeing and preventing dangers, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things well:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Its in vain to pump the Ship, or for the Mariners to
run up and down the hatches, unless there be one that sits at the helm
to guide it aright: And if it be thus painful, then according to our
Saviors testimony,<note place="margin">Luke 10. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>The laborer is worthy of his hire;</hi> who goeth on
warfare at his own charge?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7.</note> Maintenance indeed is the thing the world
grudgeth at; they could be as well content with the Sexton, or some
base person to read a little for five or ten pounds a year, as a godly
Preacher, who (say they) must have such a deal.</p>
                  <p>2. It rebuketh them that live idlely in this calling,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> evil beasts, slow
bellies, meer idols, having eyes, they see not, &amp;c. blinde guides: Wo
be to them that live at ease in this painful work, it will be turned to
endles wo; when the laborers shall rest in Heaven, as having been good
and faithful Servants, <hi>the evil and unfaithful shall be bound hand and foot,
and thrown into utter darkness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It teacheth Parents what children to dedicate to God,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> for the
service of the Ministery, even the best and fittest, not the weak and
lame:<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 4.</note> Herein God is little beholding to them; <hi>Abel</hi> offered of the
best in sacrifice: In this calling there will be use of all the parts and
strength of body and minde; whoso taketh notice of this great work,
finding his own inability to Study, Preach, &amp;c. through weakness,
sickliness, &amp;c. if he have a good conscience, it cannot but be a great
grief and trouble to him: And if they intend their sons for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
let it be with this minde onely, even that they may prove pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and profitable laborers herein; there are too many which have
carnal ayms, that therein they may grow rich, live at their ease as
Gentlemen, &amp;c. O woful Parents, to bring up one to be a drone, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
a robber, a murtherer of souls, a ravening wolf, &amp;c. Better
thou hadst brought him up to the basest lawful trade in the world; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thou hadst followed him to the grave being yong, for then,
though he had gone to Hell, he should not have been the means of
many others ruine, to the increase of his damnation.</p>
                  <p>4. For those that would enter into the Ministery,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> let them beware
what they do, and consider well, and tarry till they have a calling,
and let them not intend to live at ease, to follow their pleasures, to
gather riches, &amp;c. but let them make their reckoning to prove Labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">The first Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing duties taken from his own person, being one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way fit to exhort them.</note>
Soldiers, Watchmen, &amp;c. else no coming here. Thus in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The elders which are among you, I exhort,</hi> &amp;c.] This verse containeth
the first Reason of the following Exhortation, which is taken from
his own person, being one every way fit to exhort them; namely, 1. An
Elder and Minister as well as they (for the name Elder, is of dignity
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:65522:330"/>
and office here, and not of age) who therefore knew what belong'd to
his place, and did what he required of them to do. 2. A witness of
Christs sufferings, and so well acquainted with his minde. 3. A par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the glory that shall be revealed, who therefore would not
exhort you unto any thing, whereby either I my self may be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
hereof, or you hindred from attaining hereunto.</p>
                  <p>1. In that he an Elder, exhorts them Elders, note, That</p>
                  <p>Ministers are fittest to teach Ministers,<note place="margin">Ministers are fittest to teach one another, and judge of one anothers actions.</note> and to judge of their actions.
True, people may and ought try our Doctrine, modestly and humbly;
they may also dislike, and speak against foul things in our life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
but of things not so apparent, people must not be ready to
censure,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 32.</note> much less think to teach their Ministers: <hi>For the spirits of the
prophets are subject to the prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rebuketh the too much rashness and pride of some this way,<note place="margin">Use.</note>
ready to control every course of a Minister that is not pleasing to
them,<note place="margin">See Hosea 4.</note> yea, their maner of teaching, prophanely calling it railing,
and that they should have spoke thus and thus; when such dislike any
thing in a Minister, it were their wisdom to ask the judgement
of some godly Minister, before they censure or give judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
                  <p>2. In that he requireth nothing at their hands, but what he himself
did, note, That</p>
                  <p>The most forcible and profitable way of teaching,<note place="margin">To practice the duties we teach procures obedience thereto.</note> whether pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or publique, is, first, to do that in our own persons which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of others: Jesus did and taught: Parents may not rebuke
swearing in their children, and swear themselves: Housholders bid
their Servants go to Church,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> and stay at home themselves, having no
necessary occasion to keep them from thence: <hi>Abraham</hi> was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
with his Houshold, <hi>Joshua</hi> and his Houshold served God, the
Jayler and his Houshold were baptized: He is not the best Husband
that puts over his work to be done by others, saying, Go: but who
puts his hand thereto, saying, Go we, &amp;c. He is an ill Captain that
bids his Soldiers go fight, himself in the mean time tarrying behinde;
Its woful teaching by Ministers that do quite contrary: Shall we not
condemn our selves, while we call for that in another, which we our
selves do not observe? Neither is there likelyhood that in such a case
any will give ear unto us.</p>
                  <p>3. In that he besseecheth, Note, as his modesty and humility;
So that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> was no Pope,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peter</hi> was no Pope, neither challenged any Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> had no Supremacy; was not Christs Vicar,
as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> affirmeth of him, and challengeth of him by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession:
Had it been so, there had been no fitter time wherein to have
shewed it, then this: Howsoever, what had it been to the Pope, who
hath wofully degenerated? He calls himself a Pastor, yet challengeth
authority over all the Church, not Kings themselves excepted: He is
an hideous Beast and Monster: If he send any commands, its not, I that
am a fellow-Minister, and that take pains in the same calling, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, but he proudly thundereth and threatneth, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>A witness of the sufferings of Christ]</hi> So be we,<note place="margin">How <hi>Peter</hi> was a witness of Christs sufferings.</note> its an Article of our
Faith, and we look thereby to be saved; but we are witnesses onely
of that we have heard, he of that he saw; he was with him when he
was apprehended, when he was brought before the High Priest, &amp;c.
he was a witness by seeing them, preaching them, imitating them. Now
in that he urgeth this as a reason to back his Exhortation, we may note,</p>
                  <p>1. That if we have any Credit,<note place="margin">All that we have must be improved for the Churches good.</note> Honor, Favor, Dignity, we ought
to improve the same to the benefit of the Church, and furthering of
Gods cause.</p>
                  <p>2. That Ministers must use all Spiritual wisdom and skill to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
unto obedience;<note place="margin">Spiritual wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be used to procure obedience.</note> as cunning Chapmen, they must use many

is an opening of the Scriptures (wherein as many things be dark

hath been powerful to this end, and by this was the world subdued,
and this God is pleased yet to use.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use 1.</note> which maketh a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Ministers, but not to preach: If they can say Mass, and
therein offer Christ (as they say) as a Sacrifice Propitiatory for the
quick and the dead, that's enough.</p>
                  <p>2. It condemneth all among our selves (whereof there yet remain
too many in this Land) that are in the room of Ministers,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> but feed
not, either cannot or will not preach the Word; such are no feeders,
but starvers,<note place="margin">See Hos. 4. 6.</note> blinde leaders of the blinde, Soul-slayers, blood-suckers,
yea, worse then Cannibals, as living of the blood of Souls, whereas
these live on mans Flesh; <hi>Davids</hi> abstaining from drinking of the
water of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> for which he longed so much, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

escape the forementioned wo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9? shall they not have the reward
of the idle and unprofitable Servant, <hi>to be bound hand and foot, &amp;c?</hi>
Howsoever they are to be reputed as Ministers, and their actions be
not nullities, but may be sanctified to the people of God; yet not
being sent of God, that is, gifted, and apt to teach, they are no true
Ministers of God; neither can they be said to be good men, unless
they be good in their special calling: They are indeed in the room of
Watchmen, but are blinde, and cannot discern the enemy, therefore
suffer the people to be surprised; Husbandmen, but have no skill to
plow up a fallow ground-heart, to sow, weed, &amp;c. Builders, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell which way to hew a stick or stone for the Lords building; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
but take no pains; Soldiers, but rather betray their people
to the Enemy, then fight for them: Some of them be good fellows,
and set on the great pot, and keep a good house (which yet all do not)
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:65522:332"/>
and so think all well; but what though they fill mens bellies, if in
the mean time they starve their souls? nay, though they live quietly,
keep hospitality, make peace among their Neighbors, yet they do
not their duty if they Preach not: O that they would give themselves
to be feeders, or else take to themselves any other calling, rather then
for a little advantage, lose their own and peoples souls! what a
foolish bargain make they for a little piece of the world,<note place="margin">See Matth. 16. 26.</note> a mite in
comparison, to damn both their own and the souls of others?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But they read the word,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> and is not that sufficient?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Reading both private and Ministerial,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> is of great use, but
there's no small difference between the same and Preaching; when
the Word is onely read, people neither understand it, nor have they
power or will to apply it to themselves.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 31.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reading is as a rich and costly garment folded up,<note place="margin">Differences between Reading and Preaching.</note> Preaching when
its open and held out by the four Corners: In reading we see it full
of Majesty, but when its unfolded by Preaching, we wonder at so
much matter in so few words:<note place="margin">Of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment read <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersol</hi> on <hi>Phil.</hi> pag. 208.</note> Reading is as the whole loaf, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

divided;<note place="margin">The Preachers Plea, p. 114. to 180. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> on Heb. 13. 17.</note> Its as the cracking of the nut, and finding out the kernel:
This difference will appear plainly by comparing the knowledge and
practice of those which live under those which are onely Readers,
with theirs which live under faithful and diligent Preachers.</p>

they must count themselves grievously wronged, &amp; complain to God,
as being ready to starve, and pray earnestly, and complain to them
that be in place to right such things,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gibson</hi> on 1 Cor. 9.</note> yea, and that much more then if

world!<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> most people care not for this, are well enough content, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
not hereof;<note place="margin">The 1. branch.</note> If their Ministers do but use them well in their
Tythes, they can swallow down any thing else, nay, in numbers of
places the people like such best; we may know by the Market folks,
how the Market goes: Ask of those you meet with as you travel,
what Ministers they have; what's their usual Answer? If he be a
Reader, We have an honest peaceable man; true, he doth not Preach,
but he doth what he can, and we can desire no more of him, &amp;c. but
if he be a Preacher, then, We have a troublesome man; some say he is
learned, but howsoever he hath troubled us all, we were as quiet as
could be till he came, but now there is such finding of faults, and such
new orders, as we are even weary of both; and thus they had rather
have one that will let them go on snorting in their sins, not reproving
them, then a faithful Minister that seeks to pull them out of the fire;
pitiful Creatures! If the King should make weekly allowance to a
Town, and the under Officers should defraud them of it, would they
not complain? God hath appointed the preaching of his Word for
the food of souls; This is not distributed by divers, who would seem
entrusted herewith, and yet who openeth his mouth in this case? God
would have us to be Seers, but the world would have us either to be
stark blinde, that we should see nothing amiss to reprove in them, or
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:65522:332"/>
purblinde at least, to see nothing but foul sins that stare men in the
face;<note place="margin">Isaiah 58. 1.</note> for their pride, covetousness, or neglect of duties, they must
not meddle therewith: God would have us cry aloud, and set the
Trumpet to our mouth, and rebuke the world of sin, but the world
would have us either dumb dogs that should not bark at all, either in
hope of a crust, or fear of a blow, or else at least to bark at none, but
strange and monstrous sins.<note place="margin">The 2. branch.</note> 2. If they be fed, they must look to profit
thereby; If their Ministers prepare for them good and wholsome
food, they also must prepare themselves, and bring a good stomack,
and take it in well, by diligent hearing, digesting it by meditation and
conference, that they may grow thereby: O woful people in many
places, that have excellent Preachers, and as good feeding as may be,
and yet have lean ill-favored and mishapen souls (being inwardly as
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s seven kine appeared outwardly) as if they had never had a
good meals meat; whence is this? some will not come to Church,
where the food is; some come, but presently fall asleep; some have
their stomacks so cloyed, that they have no appetite; others put it out
like wanton children: These are authors of their own wo, their blood
shall be on their own heads, what answer will they make to God, when
they shall be called to an account for this? what a grief is this to Gods
Ministers? when they have made their provision, they are gladest if
their guests come, and have good stomacks, that nothing be lost.
3. While their Minister is feeding them carefully,<note place="margin">The 3. branch.</note> they must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to feed him with necessary and convenient maintenance, that he
may not be troubled or distracted:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a sitting Hen should go much
from her nest to seek for food for her self, the eggs could not but chill:
If Ministers should not be maintained, how could they go on in this
great work? contrarily, how many purloin from their Ministers?
how many endeavor to get their Tythes at an under-rate, &amp;c? Doth
their Minister feed them carefully, and should not they allow him to
the utmost? should not they be as careful of him, as he is or ought
to be of them? how else shall he maintain himself and his family?
how else keep hospitality, and be helpful to the poor? how else
succor poor Christians, Schollars, and Strangers that resort to him

many good uses.</p>
                  <p>2. That Ministers must preach the Word soundly,<note place="margin">Ministers must preach the Word soundly.</note> they must not give
stones instead of bread, for an egge, a Scorpion, for a fish, a Serpent,
for food, Poyson: Not onely they must not teach erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
but also not brackish and unsavory points, that jar with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
though not in the highest degree: They must not Preach mens
inventions and Traditions (what is the chaff to the wheat?) not idle
things, frothy stuff, &amp;c. to the discouraging of the good, and hearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

follow or embrace any such Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>3. That Ministers must Preach diligently,<note place="margin">Ministers must preach diligently.</note> in season and out of

1. This rebukes them,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that having flocks, feed them but seldom,
haply once a year, quarterly or monethly Sermons, they think more
then enough.</p>
                  <p>2. It rebukes the woful backwardness of many people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
wisdom cryeth and lifteth up her voyce in the streets,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 18.</note> yet for
their Oxen and Farms will not intend this Market, count her wares but
as dead commodities; How many worthy Ministers have been
forced to give over their preaching for want of company, as others to
preach to a few? O what lets have without us, besides our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardness
to call home the uncalled at one time or other, to build up
by little and little the good: Alas, even they that have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
forward, are subject to decay, and to become worse again. A
Ministers work is not like a Carpenters or Masons,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as they leave it,
they finde it, but he may leave some in a good minde, who yet within
a while after are cooled or turned away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The flock of God]</hi> These words are a reason,<note place="margin">The second Reason Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are Gods flock.</note> whereby he enforceth
his Exhortation. The people are the Lords, not ours; all are his by
creation, but he hath a company in the world, who are his by another
right,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> namely, of Redemption, as being bought by the precious blood
of Christ: O unspeakable price! They must therefore be dear to
him, for such things as costs us much, we much set by: If God gave
his Sons blood for them, his Spirit to them, and prepareth Heaven for
them, then they be dear to him; therefore he will call to a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for Souls, not one shall perish, but he will have account how,
and by whose default. The King will have account of every of his
Subjects (even the meanest) how he comes to his end, so will the
Lord of Souls.</p>
                  <p>1. This teacheth all men to take heed of Souls,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> they meddle with
Jewels, with costly Ware, when they meddle with them: Woful
is the state of all unconscionable Patrons, that to incroach a great part
of the Livings in their gift, put in of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> Priests, when the Souls
of Congregations were at their mercy to save or destroy them; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
also is the state of such, whom they thus put in.</p>
                  <p>2. Let Ministers do their duties,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as they that must be called to an
account,<note place="margin">Iohn 21. 16.</note> for their flock be the Lords, his Sheep, his Lambs, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ost
use them not as if they were the Lords.<note place="margin">See Ezek. 34. 10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This teacheth people to submit themselves to the guidance,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
teaching and government of their Shepherds, whom God
hath set over them: They must be content to be kept within the fold,
to be kept from rank places that would rot them, to be kept in bare
pasture,<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 27.</note> to be often dressed, &amp;c. As sheep follow their Shepherds
voyce,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> so must Gods people the whistle of Gods Word by his
Ministers.</p>
                  <p>3. This rebukes numbers which will not be kept in,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> but stray
where they list: These straglers will fall into the Devils mouth, they
will run into the rank rotten places of unlawful profits and pleasures;
do what Ministers can, they will not be dressed, &amp;c. Thus thousands
dye of the rot, and of other deadly diseases, notwithstanding all the
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:65522:333"/>
care of the most diligent Shepherds; these be none of Christs
sheep, his follow the mouth of his under-Shepherds, and lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it, as who shall have eternal life; but these be Goats, and its
easie to know their place, where it will be, even on the left hand, to
hear their doleful doom.</p>
                  <p>Again, By <hi>Flock,</hi> the whole company that is under a Ministers
charge being to be understood, thus much may be noted, that</p>
                  <p>A Minister must have regard to all his people,<note place="margin">Ministers are to regard all their people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> even to the meanest,
from the one end of the Church to the other: No Shepherd will
willingly lose the least sheep of his fold; and good Husbands and
Housewives do not onely look to their Silver Vessels, but to those
of Brass, Pewter, Stone, Wood; so must we take care of all, look
to all.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those Ministers which preach so loftily,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
tongues, and after such a fashion, as is quite beyond the reach of
most, and onely apply themselves to a few of the chief, rather in
ostentation seeking themselves, then Gods glory, or the peoples souls:
It were unreasonable for a Minister to preach, if his voyce could not
be heard of the one half, so is it to be heard, if not understood; five
words are better being understood,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 19.</note> then many in an unknown tongue.
A Ministers glory is to stoop to the capacity of the meanest; what's
the end of preaching, but that people may understand and be affected?
have not the poor souls as well as the chief? yea, it may be they are
most dear to God, for the poor receive the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. This teacheth all to give ear and yield obedience to the Word;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
This must the poor do, this also the rich: But O the woful careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the one, contempt of the other! for the poor, they sit at the
lower end, and regard nothing, come but seldom, and think their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
excuseth them, which should indeed provoke them more unto
obedience; They live as if they had no souls, all for the belly and
back, but regard no good thing universally; for the rich, they think
their greatness may excuse them, and that this subjection doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their place and rank, whereas the more riches, the more great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
&amp;c. they should be the more obedient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which is among you,]</hi> Or dependeth upon you. Here note,</p>
                  <p>1. That its Gods minde,<note place="margin">Every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is to have a several Pastor.</note> that every particular Congregation should
have a several Pastor over them, and so did the Apostles take order in
their times.</p>
                  <p>2. That a Minster must attend to that charge over which the Holy
Ghost hath made him overseer;<note place="margin">Every Pastor is to look to his own charge</note> He is not bound to other flocks, but
to his own; not but that one Minister may help another in case of
special need, not neglecting his own, but his main care must be for
his own.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those that lying in Universities,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Cities, or great
mens Houses, regard not the people that depend on them; Their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
depend on them for instruction, comfort, direction, &amp;c. and their
lips should preserve knowledge, now if they be dry Nurses, Wells
without water, they do but deceive their people, their people trust to a

2. People must respect those Ministers which are set over them;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> If
their gifts be competent, and they teach them the truth, they must not
dishonor them, but pray for them, hearten them, frequent their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
&amp;c. As Ministers must attend their own people, so people
must attend their own Ministers; even a Minister that is sincere and
careful, though of meaner gifts, may yet be fitter to do good in his
own place then a stranger, because he knows their state and condition
best, and we may also look for Gods blessing on the labors of such:
As poor folks Children with their plain and slender dyet,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> are yet as
lusty, well liking, strong and comely, as they that are rich, having
all abundance and variety: Men must not say, I can edifie better by
another, or I cannot edifie by him, they must labor to edifie, and
God will give a blessing; If at other times other helps are offered,
people are to embrace them, and be thankful for them, but without
contempt of their own Minister.</p>

                     <hi>Taking the oversight thereof,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ministers must oversee and look into their flocks.</note> Another duty of the Ministers of God:
Its not enough to preach, yea soundly and diligently, but they must
besides take a particular view and oversight of their flock, marking
and looking into (by themselves and others) the conversation and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
of their people,<note place="margin">See Prov. 27. 23.</note> and applying themselves to them accordingly in
admonition,<note place="margin">Iohn 10. 3.</note> exhortation,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> comfort: As Watchmen, they must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
look to prevent,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> descry, and disapoint the Enemy: As Nurses,
they must not onely feed their Children, but have also a careful eye
over them; should they leave them, they might peradventure go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the ears, scratch one another, fall into the fire, wander out,
fall into the water, &amp;c. No, they must have continual work with
them; as to take them up, being fallen; wash them, being soul;
chide and part them, when they wrangle and fight: As Shepherds,
they must not onely drive or lead out their Sheep to Pasture, but view
and mark them at going out and coming into the Fold, having also all
day long their eyes on them, fetching home those that wander, binding
up those that are hurt, &amp;c. If a Minister know any of his people riotous
or prophane, he must rebuke them; If any out of the way, admonish
them; he must hearten them that be in a good course to go on still, and
must comfort them that languish under their sins, temptations and
fears; in a word, deal with every one as the cause requireth: As they
say of a Begger, he is never out of his way; so its true of a Minister
in his own Parish, he is never out of his way, but wheresoever he goeth,
there is some work, and whomsoever he meeteth with, he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to say to him: If he be a riotous son, a disobedient servant, an
idle person, one that comes not to Church, or that behaves himself
rudely therein, there's occasion offered to rebuke and admonish: But
if it be some zealous Christian, or some beginning to wax faint, or
some in affliction, there's occasion offered to exhort and comfort:
The like may be said when he goes to see or sit with any of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whether poor or rich, and amongst those he may finde some stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
in judgement, ready to be seduced by Brownists, Papists,
Anabaptists, &amp;c. whom he must have an eye to: Thus he may help
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:65522:334"/>
his publique Ministery: Thus prevent and remedy many things amiss;
Thus their peoples consciences cannot but be convinced, whereas
what is spoken in the publique Ministery, many take not to themselves:
Thus Ministers shall know the better how to Preach aptly, according
to their peoples necessities, who else shall but preach generally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly:
his Ministery is also the more like to prevail, when he comes
home close to the peoples hearts, and toucheth their very faults; thus
also shall he know the better whom to admit to the Sacrament: All
the discommodity is, that having rebuked or admonished men of any
faults in private, and coming to reprove such things in publique, they
think he points at them, and galls them, and so they stomack him, and
cannot away with him; but its onely thus with some few proud per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or rich men, who therefore must have the less said to them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and that they shall get by their frowardness.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those Ministers that be absent from their people
usually or continually:<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> How can these take care of them, that come
not at them above once in a Quarter, except they could indent with
the Devil, never to trouble their people, or tempt them in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or tell them when he would be busie with them, &amp;c. If they
say they care for them by another, so they shall go to Heaven by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but be in danger to go to Hell in their own persons. Besides, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is fit to care for them (and then why hath he not the wages that
doth the work?) or he is not fit, and then how will they answer that
to God?</p>
                  <p>2. It rebukes those also that living among their people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> yet care not
thus, but think themselves discharged that they meet them at Church
on the Sabbath, and then preach them a Sermon, whereas all the
week after they consider not of them, nay, scarce visit the sick, but
either are so entangled with cares and businesses of the world,<note place="margin">See 2 Tim. 2. 4.</note> that they
cannot, or so addicted to their pleasures, that they will not minde
this; Thus they are less fit for Preaching, do the less good,
and receive all at a venture to the Sacrament, which is a fearful
thing.</p>
                  <p>3. As people must be careful for their Ministers (who had need of
no worldly care hanging on them) that they may attend on their care
of them;<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> so they must be willing that their Ministers have a care of
them, and deal privately with them and theirs.</p>
                  <p>This many cannot away with, but would that the Minister should
content himself with seeing them at Church, but not to look into their
behavior in their Families, or to pry into their lives, or deal privately
or particularly; who yet if they have a shepherd, look that he should
diligently tend their sheep all day, and look to them particularly, as
well as feed them; they should be glad when the Minister will come
to their Houses, and sit with them, conferring with them and theirs
of heavenly things, &amp;c. But if they should know when he would
come, they would be sure to be out of the way; this is a sign of an ill
conscience, that they cannot abide the tryal, and (which is worse) of
a bad heart that is not willing to mend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="626" facs="tcp:65522:335"/>
But there's another extremity, when people will expect too much at
the Ministers hands, as to visit them at their houses more often then
the largeness of the place, and his strength and time will permit, which
though it be a good fault and a rare, &amp; therefore to be much born with
(for there is nothing more comely in the world, then to see Ministers
delight in their peoples company, and people in theirs, and thereupon
to be much together) yet it must be done as it may stand with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;
There must be convenient time to Preach, that we may not
come unpreparedly; and if a Minister Preach also on the week days,
he cannot have much time for private, especially in a great and wide
Parish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not by constraint but willingly,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ministers are not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, but willingly to perform their duties towards their people.</note> Now for the maner; A Minister is
not to perform the forementioned duties by constraint (as for fear of
Gods wrath, mens Laws or shame, &amp;c.) but willingly: To do by
constraint is base and servile, what any doth thus, they do but homely,
no better then needs must; and besides, what hope of Gods blessing
can they expect upon such work?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 17.</note> God loves a willing heart, and a
chearful doer:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> There's a constraint that is good, whereof the Apostle
writeth to the <hi>Corinthians, The love of Christ hath constrained me,</hi> &amp;c.
namely, because Christ hath pardoned my sins, dyed for me, hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to this high and holy calling, to be his Ambassador to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
hath entrusted me with the souls of his People, &amp;c. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in all and every these respects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do my duty in the most faithful
and careful maner that I can, neither can I do otherwise; other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
is base: A man cannot endure his Servant should thus do his
work, much less the Lord, who hath no need of any man; and if one
do it not, he can set up another at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those that never Preach,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> but so often as they are
bound by Law, once a moneth, or once a quarter, as also those who
for avoiding the shame of dumb idols, step up and do a little, but like
hirelings, who have no love to their work, are at it in body, their
mindes being far therefrom.</p>
                  <p>2. It may perswade all Ministers to readiness and willingnes in our
duty private and publique,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> when we finde any loathness to our study,
and drousiness therein; lets think what an honorable Calling ours is,
and that whereas others are employed on earthly things: ours is in the
Scriptures, searching in the rich Treasures of the Word, and dealing
altogether in Spiritual and Holy things; and again, what a trust is laid
up with us, and what weight lyeth upon us, and what a reward remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for us; we serve a good Master, in an excellent work, in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of most rich wages.</p>
                  <p>3. People must learn also to do their duty,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> not by constraint but
willingly; Thus must they reverence their Ministers, hear them, obey
their Ministery, allow them maintenance; but how grudgingly do
most pay their Tythes, which is for want of finding good by the
Word; They should so take part of the Ministers Spiritual things, as
they may put themselves into his debt, and see cause to allow him
means: O suffer not any of the tenth part to cleave to your fingers,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:65522:335"/>
neither seek to enrich your selves hereby, but by the remaining nine
parts: whoso think to enrich themselves by working on the Lords day,
or keeping back their Tythes, deceive themselves, they shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper:
Be the Minister good or bad, give him willingly all the Law
gives him; If he do not his duty, he shall answer for it: Be not you
Trespassers also, stoppage is no payment; but if he be a sufficient and
painful Minister, your custom will not priviledge you from paying
him his due by Gods appointment, you must give him his due to the
utmost, and he is worthy of it: But O the woful covetousness and
corruption of men in this behalf! They think any thing enough for a
Minister, though it be but from hand to mouth, whereas they look to
encrease themselves, and think their Trade bad, and themselves ill
Husbands, if they leave not store to their Posterity.</p>

that calling! No, I speak against these scabs and scurfs that disgrace
it, for some of those were never in the Ministery, but boldly have
taken this course without calling or warrant; some it may be have

                  <p>O that we would set Gods glory and our peoples good before our
eyes, as the mark whereat we are to aym; covetousness is a base
sin in any, but chiefly in a Minister: How shall he teach others to

covetousness in others, who is himself covetous?</p>
                  <p>6. For People,<note place="margin">Use 6.</note> they must not reverence and make much of their

they must not rigorously, cruelly, or over imperiously rule
them: speak we first of that which is prohibited, then of that which is

                  <p>That which is forbid Ministers, is pride and lordly carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
whereunto a reason is annexed, even because the people be

                  </p>
                  <p>1. That Ministers must not exercise civil authority and temporal
power over their people, but use a spiritual rule over them, by teaching
them, and denouncing the judgements of God against them that do
evil,<note place="margin">Iohn 18. 36.</note> and ruling them by the Word of God, and by spiritual censures
to correct the stubborn and disobedient:<note place="margin">Luke 12. 14.</note> Our Savior Christs (our
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:65522:337"/>
Masters) kingdom was not of this world, and so not ours: He would
not be a Judge or Divider between two at variance about their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;
Magistrates must rule by the Sword, and we by the Word;
they by the Temporal Sword, we by the Spiritual; we must teach
the people, exhort, perswade, and commend men to God, and pray for
them; and if any be obstinate, to admonish them more seriously;
and if they reform not, to debar them from the Sacraments; yea, if
they have committed any notorious sin, and live without repentance,
to cast them out of the Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 5.</note> and deliver them up to Satan: These
be more weighty and fearful censures,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note> being rightly performed,<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 25.</note> then
any bodily punishment;<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 15.</note> we must leave other things to the Magistrate,
whose power is of God to rule with the material Sword: Thus did
our Savior Christ, onely once, as he was the King of his Church,
and not as a Minister of the Gospel, he whipt out the buyers and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
out of the temple: So the Apostles exercised no other but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
authority, except <hi>Peter</hi> by special and extraordinary direction, on
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> on <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer; In those times
God shewed extraordinary works and miracles for the confirmation
of the Gospel, which we need not now: And this was not usual, for
then they could not have served <hi>Demetrius, Tertullus,</hi> with all their
Enemies thus.</p>
                  <p>A Reason hereof may be this,<note place="margin">The Reasons.</note> one calling is sufficient for one man;
As the Magistrate must not encroach upon the Ministers office (as <hi>Uzza</hi>
did) either a private man to expound the Scripture and administer the
Sacraments;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note> so must not Ministers on theirs: The action of <hi>Phineas</hi>
was extraordinary,<note place="margin">Numb. 25.</note> and so no fit president.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes the notorious usurpation of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use 1.</note> who
not onely challengeth to be the Head of the whole Church, and to
have Supremacy over the same, but also Temporal Jurisdiction over
Princes and Potentates, to set up and cast down whom he pleaseth, to
set them together by the ears, to impose Taxes on them, to exempt
their Subjects from their Allegiance, &amp;c. But upon what ground
doth he challenge this Supremacy? from <hi>Peter,</hi> whose Successor he
alledgeth himself to be: But he is quite fallen from the Faith and
Doctrine of <hi>Peter,</hi> and if he did succeed him aright, yet could he have
no such authority, for <hi>Peter</hi> himself had no such thing, neither do
any places of Scripture (used to this purpose) prove any such thing,
much less had <hi>Peter</hi> and Civil Jurisdiction over Princes and People,
which the Pope also challengeth from him: But of this heretofore,
onely let us know that our Christian King, and all other Kings in their
several Dominions are Supreme Governors, and that the Pope hath
no authority to meddle with them; all that hold otherwise (as all right
Papists do) are Traytors in heart at least, and can be no good Subjects;
let's pray that all other Kings may shake off his yoke, both in Spiritual
and Temporal things, and stoop to Christs yoke: And let us know
that God hath given no Civil authority to Ministers to rule the people
by, what Princes in their savor may bestow upon them, and what
they may lawfully receive from them, and enjoy and exercise: I mean
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:65522:338"/>
not now to discuss, neither indeed can it be well decided; this we are
sure, that there is no more weighty part of any Ministers duty, nor
none like unto it, then to Preach the Word of God, about which
the Pope with his Popelings have no minde to take pains; Those
that have been godly Bishops have exercised themselves diligently
in the same.</p>
                  <p>2. It condemns the lawless freedom of the whole Popish rabble
from the Civil Magistrate,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> which is wicked; for though our Ministery
be above Magistrates, and all, even Princes are to be subject there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and our duty is to discharge our duty in rebuking sin in all,
yet as we be Citizens, so we are under the Magistrate, and he hath
power to punish faults in Ministers, as well as of any other.</p>
                  <p>2. That Ministers must not carry themselves proudly,<note place="margin">Ministers must not carry themselves proudly and disdainfully.</note> highly, and
disdainfully, accounting of others as a company of Clowns and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fellows, but account them the people of God, and such as they
must care for, serve and attend in all painfulness, for the Salvation of
their souls, carrying themselves so lovingly and amiably, as that the
meanest may be bold in good sort to speak unto them. Nor</p>
                  <p>3. Must a Minister rule them rigorously and with violence,<note place="margin">Ministers must not use rigor toward their people.</note> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
them with suits or strong hand, God cannot away with such
Shepherds: Neither will any rule more Tyrannously over people, then
those that take least pains to seed them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34. 18.</note> but they must win men by the
Word: If any be obstinate, they must deal more roundly with them,
yet still after a Spiritual maner, and no carnal kinde of violence, which
is not so fit for a Minister, nor so like to do good; if they be unbridled
and unruly, let the Magistrate deal with them: A Minister must be
kinde to those that have any good; they that be not as he would have
them, yet must not be cast off, but wait with patience, shewing all
good desire of winning them; for though a Minister is over the people,
yet not so as that he may do with them what he list, but as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 1.</note>
So is the Father over the Children,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 19.</note> yet must not he provoke
them to anger; and Husbands are over their Wives, yet must not they
be bitter to them:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The Minister is over the people, as a Shepherd
over his sheep, he must feed them, catch them with his hook, see
what they ayl, dress them, binde their legs being unruly, if they range
out, fetch them in, if they come not at his whistle, set his dog at
them to scare them, but he must not pend them up all the day and
starve them, break their legs or their backs, worry them with his
dog,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> sell or change them away, &amp;c. The Minister is over the
people, as the Nurse over the Childe committed to her, namely,
to feed it, tend it, and take pains about it, but not to hurt, maim,
starve it.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes the contrary in some Ministers,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> who because they
are over the people, therefore (like some yong Husbands, that having
married before they were wise, misuse their wives because they be
their heads) carry themselves haughtily, what are they but a company
of Clowns, Swains, a company of simple fellows? what are they?
They are those you are appointed to tend, and such as you must give
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:65522:338"/>
an account of to God, such as may belong to God as well as you,
haply rather then you; Members of Christ, as dearly bought as you,
and Heirs of Heaven, such as must put a Crown upon your head at
the last day, such as maintain you of their labors, that you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
their souls; you must win them by the Word, by publique and
private perswasions, by a good life, and not by a strong hand, by suing
them at Law, and contending with them.</p>
                  <p>2. If Ministers must not Lord it over the people,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> then much less
people over them; a Minister hath some colour, they none: To set
light by him, to check or controll him, to insult over him, use him at
their pleasure, because they have purses, &amp;c. is wicked; what is he,
will they say? he is but a Minister, a Parson, a Priest, &amp;c. what is he but
a Minister? Is that a disgrace to him? Is that a base Calling? Is there any
more high and honorable? what is he? He is the man you must depend
on for the means of your Salvation, by whose Ministery you must be
pulled our of the jaws of the Devil, and power of sin, and converted
to God; Its he that hath power to binde or loose you, and as he doth,
so shall it be done in Heaven; he hath power to open the door or shut
it against you, as he seeth your behavior: To the good that be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he is their Spiritual Father, to whom they owe more then to their
Natural Father, of the one they had a being, of the other a well-being;
of the one born into the world, a man, and a childe of
wrath; of the other born again into the Church, a childe of grace;
To these also a Nurse to cherish them, confirm, strengthen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, and an helper of their faith to the Kingdom of Heaven:
But for the wicked, he hath power to shut them out as dogs, from
partaking the Childrens bread, yea, to deliver them up to Satan, if
they deserve it;<note place="margin">Luke 10. 16.</note> therefore say not, who is he? or what is he? <hi>For
he that despiseth them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 105. 14,</note> 
                     <hi>despiseth Christ himself: Touch not my Prophets,
and do mine anointed no harm:</hi> He hath rebuked Kings, and the greatest
for their sakes; nay, even the least (as those Children that mocked
the Prophet) have not scap'd free, yea, to misuse them in body, goods,
or name, and offer them indignity, is the ready means to provoke the
Lord to wrath and indignation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Over Gods heritage,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Christians are Gods He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage.</note> A reason against Lordly and Tyrannous dealing,
People be Gods Heritage: The word signifies elsewhere a lot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Heritage used to be divided by lot: The word is of the plural
number, whereby is meant particular Congregations, over which
God appointeth particular Ministers, as being parts of the Heritage of
God, which is the whole Church of God in Heaven and Earth, and
every particular Congregation is a part of it, and as a Farm or Manor
committed to a Spiritual Husbandman, to yield the Lord the fruit
thereof.</p>
                  <p>The word here used, the Papists apply onely to Ministers, but
improperly; for the people also be the Lords lot, portion, and the rod
of his inheritance, though indeed <hi>Levi</hi> was Gods part in a special
maner, set aside for Gods service in his Temple, yet then and now all
Gods Church are his Heritage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="634" facs="tcp:65522:339"/>
The people is the Lords Heritage; He hath bought his Church at
a dear rate, he plants it, waters it, and hedgeth the same in.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those Ministers,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that use them at their pleasure,
kill them, sell them, misuse them, &amp;c. but they shall be countable to
God for them, as <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban</hi> for those sheep that were lost or torn:
We must use them as Gods Sheep, husbanding Gods Heritage care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that it may yield fruit in abundance to the owner the Lord;
we must not use them as we list, but as we will answer for every sheep:
They be dear to God, and he will have account of every sheep in our
fold; we should be thankful to God, that hath trusted us with such a
jewel, as a part of his Heritage, and therefore be faithful to him and
them.</p>
                  <p>2. If People be Gods Heritage,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and every Congregation as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Farm, they must look they yield fruit, that God may
take delight therein, and may say, Its the fruitfullest Farm that I
have within a great way, I have more obedience yielded to my Word,
my Sabbaths better kept, my Sacraments better resorted to, Families
better instructed and governed in that Town, then in many others,
more love,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> mercy, zeal, &amp;c. As an Husbandman that hath a rich
piece of ground, and which bears a great crop, he will delight to be
much in it, looking on it, walking about it, looking that no damage
come to it, &amp;c. but if it prove barren, he cares not for coming at it; So
where theirs a fruitful piece of ground to the Lord, he wil delight in it,
boast of it, bless it, fence it, and continue his favor to it, and to their
posterity after them, they paying the rent of the Gospel, and fruit
which is the obedience thereof, and outward mercies as he seeth best,
&amp;c. But in Towns where there is no fruit, no obedince yielded, no
Prayer, no regard of Sabbaths or Sacraments; but on the contrary,
Prophaness, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Contention, Whoredom,
Drunkenness, &amp;c. God will take no pleasure in such a Farm, but if it
hath had a good Husbandman, will take him away, and put it over
into the hands of some hireling or base person,<note place="margin">See Heb. 6. 8.</note> good enough for such
a place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But being ensamples to the flock,]</hi> Now of the duty exhorted unto,
which is the third and last; the two former are not enough, to those
this must be added; Though it may be said, Better Preach well and
live naughtily, then live jollily well, and preach not, or altogether
without edification, yet indeed, both ought to go together.</p>
                  <p>Ministers must not onely teach well,<note place="margin">Ministers must not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach well, but live well.</note> but also do the same, be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
unto their people, go before them in practice; they must not be
like Statues in a high-way, like <hi>Noahs</hi> builders which framed the Ark,
but were not saved therein, or like the Scribes and Pharisees;
which laid heavy burthens on others,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 46.</note> which they themselves would
not touch.</p>
                  <p>This was signified under the Law,<note place="margin">Lev. 21. 18.</note> none that were to minister
before the Lord,<note place="margin">Acts 1. 1.</note> were to be deformed:<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> Our Savior both taught and
did,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> Ministers must be as shining Lights, they must be unrebukeable; as
people must joyn doing with hearing, so must Ministers doing with
Preaching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="635" facs="tcp:65522:339"/>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. Hereby it shall appear that they mean in good earnest,
and require nothing of others, but that whereunto they themselves are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
willing to yield. 2. Hereby Atheists will be put to silence, whose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
usual speech is after this maner, Tush, if there were any such matter
to be feared, as they talk of, would not they live otherwise; but there's
no such thing, they must say something in place, to scare the people
and keep them in awe: The common sort of ignorant and careless
people profit not by preaching, as long as the Preachers life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Doctrine; as who go more by seeing, then by hearing. If
a man should speak as an Angel, and not live thereafter (such is their
weakness) they would not regard him, yea, in the better sort, it doth
greatly abate the edge of all they hear; yet doth not the power of the
Word, and efficacy of the Sacraments, depend on the lives of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 2.</note>
but whether they be good or bad, sitting in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair,
they are to be followed and obeyed in those things which they teach
truly. 3. Hereby they shall procure themselves a good degree and great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
liberty, and boldness in their Ministery, whereas otherwise, it's not
possible but that their ill consciences must stop their mouthes: How
can they rebuke sin zealously, they themselves being addicted unto
those very sins which they would reprove?<note place="margin">Luke 4. 23.</note> If they do, will it not be
replyed, <hi>Physitian, heal thy self?</hi> 4. Ministers have such a Calling,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
as that whil'st others are busied about worldly things most part of
their time, theirs lies in the study of the Scriptures, and about holy
and Spiritual things, whereby they may daily be further and further
built up. 5. Its the way to do most good, when the one is seconded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
by the other, holy Preaching with an holy life, else there's a very ill
harmony, when upon both good is not done, people are left without
excuse. 6. The Devil labors to stain Ministers lives, as knowing that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
hereby their Doctrine becometh for the most part ineffectual; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he labors by all means to bring in ill livers into the Ministery, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cares he what their gifts be, so their lives be stained; or else he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
with those that be in, to pervert them one way or other, by loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
riot, &amp;c. or get them to be covetous, &amp;c. If he cannot prevail
in those, then in some lesser things, as in their apparel, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Families, and the like; If he cannot do thus much, yet
will he rather play at some small game then sit out, he will then raise
up false reports of godly Ministers, which he knows will be listened
unto, and do some hurt.</p>
                  <p>1. For Ministers.<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> 1. They must live among their people, else
how can they give them good example, and so win them? 2. They
must look exceeding warily to their lives, yea, to their Wives and
Childrens behavior; we must watch over our own hearts, bridle and
beat down our corruptions, avoid all appearance of evil, all the least
occasion of evil, for a mote in us will be counted a beam, and do
more hurt then a beam in another; yea, we must not onely beware
in things evil, but even abridge our selves in lawful things, of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
we might do, and that for the peoples weakness, as of our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
recreation or refreshing, so that we wrong not our selves too much
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:65522:340"/>
herein, and in the matter of the maintenance, seeking our own, or
providing something for Wife and Posterity, which we might and
ought to do, yet we must forbear somewhat for the peoples weakness,
who are ready to think a man covetous, if he hath any thing more
then from hand to mouth, or looks to save any thing, as they do for
theirs: And yet people must here again be admonished, that they
stand not too much upon their Ministers life, but look to his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and labor to profit by it; the Word of God is holy, and ought
to be of power with us, whatsoever the life of the Minister be. But
alas, how many Ministers be as bad as the worst in the Parish, as ready
to run to the Alehouse, to play on the Lords-day, to be Gusters,
Swearers, unclean Persons, Usurers, what not? O we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the state of the Land in this behalf! Such with <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, make
the people loath the Sacrifice of God: They pollute the holy things
of God, what answer shall they be able and to make? even out of their
own mouthes they shall be condemned, as who having often preached
others, yet have hated to be reformed.</p>
                  <p>2. For People.<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> 1. If Ministers must give good example, then must
people imitate and follow the same, for even to this end also are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
enjoyned to live well;<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29.</note> our Savior saith, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> &amp;c. the
Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye followers of me,</hi> &amp;c. But 2. There be some that
will either be catching at somewhat to keep themselves in their old
course, or if they can finde no just ground, then will they say, he is
an honest man indeed, and there is all, but for following his example,
they minde no such matter; some again will bear with themselves in
pride, vanity, ignorance, why? what, we be no Ministers, therefore
need not be so holy; we are beholding to them, that they think we
should be holy, but so must they too (else wo unto them) especially
after so long teaching: Some will be prying into a good Ministers
life, and if they can see or hear by any that he hath any infirmity
(which yet haply is not so) they judge amiss thereof; nay, though it
be his burthen, and he labors against it, yet this shall be sufficient for
some proud prophane men to set light by all his Ministery (which is
approved and powerful to many others) and by all the rest of his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conversation: what, do these think to have a Minister perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
infirmity?<note place="margin">Iames 5. 17.</note> none ever was; <hi>Elias</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> saith) was a man
subject to the like infirmities that we are;<note place="margin">Acts 15. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> also were
stired up the one against the other; <hi>Samuel, Eli,</hi> &amp; the rest, were not with
out their own frailties: Some Ministers are a little too fine, some a little
too worldly, others somewhat too quick and hasty, &amp;c. But will this
discharge people from regarding and profiting by their Ministery and
example: This is not spoken that any Minister should bear with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in any weakness, but for them that hereupon think they may cast
off the regard of him and his Ministery, saying, What are they, or
what is he? he is a man, and hath infirmities as well as others: But
as <hi>Noah</hi> condemned the world by making the Ark, so shall their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
you, if ye amend not thereby: If you be so sharp sighted, that
you can spy what infirmity is in your Minister, then look you follow
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:65522:340"/>
all the other good things you observe in him, and shun that, but they
will do thus with a Minister, yet will nourish many gross things in
themselves: Oh, if Ministers were like the Angels, perfect, and
could do miracles, and heal their sick, and live (as <hi>Moses</hi> did, forty days)
continually without meat, then they would like well of them; but
seeing they must have maintenance, and can do nothing but Preach to
them, and Pray for them, and go before them in a good example, and
have infirmities, they make no reckoning of them, but such shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
carnal and foolish; even such Ministers must be such as must
save us, and no other.</p>

                  <p>He is worthily so called, 1. Because the sheep be his, not ours, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
is the owner of them,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note> and they cost him full dearly; for us, we are

but its he that gives the blessing; we cannot change a goat into a sheep,
nor force one home from straying, but he perswades their hearts, he
gives the encrease. 4. Its he to whom we must give our account, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
who pays us our wages: for, as for the present maintenance we have,
its not answerable to the work we do; the world think it too much,
but Christ will pay us after another fashion. 5. He is over all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
flock in all places and countreys, we onely are over handfuls and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of this great flock, which yet are called flocks, but nothing to the
whole.</p>
                  <p>1. This condemneth that notable usurpation of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Use 1.</note>
who arrogateth unto himself, that he is the chief Pastor and Arch-Shepherd
over all the Church: But there is no other chief one but
Christ on Earth, who is present with his Church to the worlds end:
A Shepherd; a devouring wolf he is, that destroys all souls; A
Feeder; he poysons the people by the dung-hill dirt of false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and his own Traditions, he feeds all for the Devil, but brings
none to Christ to be sure.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth us that are Ministers to look to our Calling by the
chief Shepherd,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> whether besides the outward allowance of men, we
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:65522:341"/>

They must also submit themselves to their Ministery and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

of faithful Ministers; They shall attain a state of happiness, which
God hath provided for his in Heaven; its not to be uttered nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
what it is: Its described, according to our weak conceit, by a
feast, a marriage feast of a Kings Son, a City whose Walls and Streets
are Gold, and Gates Pearls, &amp;c. Its a State free from all evil; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
here there's nothing but crying and complaining, one of his head,
lungs, back, &amp;c. another of his unruly children, losses by sea, by
Bankrupts, &amp;c. There all tears are wiped away; there also there's no
want of any thing, no need of any thing, whether for body or soul,
but a perfect enjoying of all good, for we shall enjoy God himself, the
fountain of all goodness; we shall also enjoy the society and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Lord Jesus, who hath so loved us, and who is the joy of
our hearts: So of the holy Ghost the Comforter; so of the Angels,
of the Patriarks, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, of our godly Friends,
Children, Ministers, that begat us to God, &amp;c. where we shall be so
filled with all comfort, as we shall joy continually, for we shall sing
night and day; the place also adds unto our happiness: Needs must
Heaven be excellent, as being prepared by God for himself to set forth
his magnificence; what its within, appears by its glorious outside, and
the glory thereof, by the fairness of the world, given to dogs and
Gods Enemies; this also is eternal: The glory of this world, as its
not worthy to be so called; so its inconstant and fickle (see it in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,

                  <p>1. This may exceedingly encourage Ministers,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> to take all the pains
that possibly they can in their calling; we serve a good Master: O how
men strive for a corruptible Crown, how much more should we for
an incorruptible! how careful should we be in Studying, Preaching,

                  <p>2. It may serve to uphold us in the midst,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and against all discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements;
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:65522:341"/>
our office is not onely painful, but oftentimes fruitless,
thankless; and perilous: A Minister shall have to do with such dull
ones, as he must teach them as a childe new weaned, with <hi>line upon

means they will be reclaimed; yea, oftentimes they may receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeness

which yet we finde such as we are scarce able to undergo; others
grudge at our maintenance, otherwhile we shall (having delivered

of malice;<note place="margin">Ier. 20. 7.</note> others will raise up lyes and slanders against us, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite

the Copper-Smith did the Apostles; yea, the more painful we are,
the harder we shall be dealt with: Now against all those and the
like, hath not a Minister need to have something to comfort and
hearten him? This will do it fully; the incorruptible Crown will pay
for all, we must look up to that: Contrarily, what will be the reward
and end of all unfaithful Ministers, that starve and mislead their Flock,
that live in jollity and at ease, &amp;c? Oh, their reward will be with the
unfaithful Servant, <hi>to be taken and bound hand and foot, and thrown into

                  <p>THe Apostle proceeds to the duty of another special sort of people,

                     <hi>Likewise ye yonger, submit your selves unto the elder;]</hi> Although I use
to trouble you little with divers interpretations or mens judgements,
taking it that my duty is to shew you, rather what God saith, then
what men say; yet at this time it will not be amiss to propound fome:
Elders may be taken as in the preceding uses, not for elders in years,
but by office; and so by the yonger may be meant, not the yong in
years, but inferior in place, namely the people; or if yong in years
are to be understood,<note place="margin">What we are to understand by the yonger and the elder.</note> then a part for the whole is meant: All the
people must submit themselves to their Ministers, whereof a great part
are yong ones, and they commonly the most unruly, and so the duty
of people towards their Ministers is here taught, as the word likewise
seemeth to imply: Or Elders may well be taken for Elders in age pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and so the yonger in like sort for the yong sort of people, and
so the duty of youth towards them that are aged be here taught, as
it may well be, and the more likely in my minde: But I will not spend
any time to approve or disapprove the one more then the other, but
speak something of both, as in some such cases is not unusual nor amiss,
when both may very well stand, and it be difficult to say which is the
true meaning of the place, this or that.</p>
                  <p>For the first;<note place="margin">Wherein the duty of people towards their Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> The duties of people towards their Ministers laid
down in the fifth commandment, stand in these four things: 1. They
must reverence them for the dignity, highness, and excellency of
their Calling, in which respect they are termed Angels, Stars, the
light of the world,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> Gods Ambassadors. 2. They must yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to them in their Ministery. 3. They must willingly allow them
a sufficient maintenance, that they may wholly without distraction at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on their souls.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 16, 17.</note> 4. They must pray for them, both that their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
may be fruitful,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 18.</note> and that they may long continue amongst
them, of those the second is the principal; Namely, that</p>

Malice, &amp;c. That hear not, though the Charmer charm never
so wisely, and do even stop their ears; God knocks at the door of

their sins, yet they rush on every one after his own hearts lust, and
hateth to be reformed; having a pardon brought and offered them, if
they would come in, they stand out: What will become of these?

saved: What should I speak of worldlings that are so glued to the
world, as they savor not at all of Heaven, or heavenly things? no such
thing can enter into their hearts, either they hear not the Word at all,
or the thorny cares of the world quickly choak that seed: What of
Hypocrites, some professing outwardly, and yet living in some known
sin; others not so bad, that yet fall far short, having gone some steps,
and hoping that all is well? These were never as yet truly humbled,
and so not converted, &amp; so had not that that accompanieth Salvation;
these hear, but not aright: Every man therefore must examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
how he hath heard, and whether the Word hath been a means of
his true conversion, and whether he make conscience to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the precepts thereof? They that can prove themselves thereby
converted, how comfortably may they go on, walking in obedience
thereto? Contrarily, the care of others is dangerous; for, think not
that our preaching will go away unregarded, or that its no matter how
you have heard: Oh! Preachings and Sacraments be dangerous
things, life or death can do a great deal of good, or as much hurt: to
them that obey, its Salvation, but to the disobedient, its the savor
of death unto death: This is a fearful sin in this Land, and the cause

having a new Son, Christ as having another member, the Holy

                  <p>For the second, The duties of youth to the aged; As the Apostle
hath been before in hand, with Subjects, Wives, Husbands, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
duties, and now with Ministers, so doth he proceed to inform
the yonger of theirs towards their elders.<note place="margin">Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form every one of their duty.</note> Gods Ministers must not
onely teach things generally belonging to all, but even special things
belonging to every age, sex and condition of persons: They must
not onely labor that people may become Christians, but that they
may be good in their special calling; like good husbands they must
be in every corner, instructing each in their duties, they must finde
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:65522:343"/>
out what be the special faults of youth, as rashness, pride, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
speaking against them, and laboring to prevent or cure them;
so what be most needful for them, as sobriety, humility, discretion,
stayedness, accordingly calling for these; thus must they do with the
aged, speaking against their testiness and covetousness, and calling
upon stayedness and soundness in all good judgement and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
So they must take notice of the faults most incident to women,
as niceness, curiosity, loquacity, accordingly endeavoring to cure
them thereof; for even in those that be good Christians, yet there
may be some such particular and special failings, as whereby the
name of God and his Gospel may be ill spoken of: Thus did the
Apostles, being herein good and wise stewards, to give to every one
of the Lords Family their portion of meat in due season, workmen
that needed not be ashamed: The Scripture teacheth every man his
duty, wherein accordingly (revealing every piece of Gods councel)
we are to instruct them; for want of this the Gospel hears ill, even
of those that have some good things in them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as Ministers must be wise,<note place="margin">Use.</note> prompt Scribes taught of God,
and careful herein; so people must be content, nay, like well hereof;
not repining nor finding fault with their Ministers, for such weaknesses
and faults as our nature is prone to: Neither must people dislike, and
say, What, cannot the Minister be content to open his Text, and teach
us general things, but he must meddle how we Husbands live with
our Wives, we Wives with our Husbands, how we behave our selves
in our Families, how we Servants should do our work, &amp;c? This is
an ill sign; a good hearer is desirous the word should come home
close to him and tell him of his duty, yea, ere thou come to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, pray, O that the Minister may come home close
to my corruptions! O that I may be so instructed in my duty, that I
may please God by performing the same! yea, if the Minister come
not home so close as we would,<note place="margin">Luke 3. 10, 12, 14.</note> we should go and enquire of him of
our duties, and what shall we do?</p>
                  <p>In particular;<note place="margin">Wherein the duties of the yonger towards their elders consists.</note> The yonger must honor their elders (as its in the fifth
Commandment) here called submiting themselves, under which be

off their counsel and example which God hath given them to follow.</p>
                  <p>1. For Elders;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> If the yonger must honor and reverence them,
then they must be such as deserve it and procure it; they must speak
so wisely and profitably, as yong ones may willingly lay their hand
on their mouth and be silent; they must also give them godly and
good counsel, and an holy example, which the yonger may follow:
when they see you dissolute, disordered, given to this or that vice,
Sabbath-breaking, lewd company, riot, they must advise and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them to beware, telling them from their own observation how
many have by such means brought themselves to ruine; so about their
matching, that they are to be ruled and guided by their Parents; so
when they see any trifle out their time, and defer their repentance, and
live riotously, they must thus from their own experience expostulate
with them, O make use of your time while you have it! This is your
freest time, if I had not got somewhat in my youth, it had been
bad with me now, being so dull and forgetful: or if we lost our time
then, and God hath since brought us to repentance, let us tell them
from our own miserable experience, O take heed, do not as I did, I
lost my time, and spent it away foolishly, when I should have learned
goodness, and now how dull am I? Alas, I shall never come to any
great matters, now I am past (and have lost) my youth; if it had
not been Gods unspeakable mercy, I had perished, and he lets in a
little light into me, but alas, how slow of capacity am I? what a bad
memory have I? So if we see them that will not be advised by coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
we must rebuke them, yea, carry such a gravity and godly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of sin,<note place="margin">Iob 29. 8.</note> as the wicked may stand in awe, and not dare abide our
sight when they do evil: But the most part of old folks are so silly
and ignorant, that they have no good counsel in them, nay, are blockish
and unteachable; they spent their own time badly, and never made
conscience thereof, therefore do not they call on others, not being
converted, how can they strengthen others? Many also are so far
from rebuking them for disorder, and making the wicked afraid,
as they will sit still on their benches, and look upon youths riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
dancing, &amp;c. and laugh at them, aud so they strengthen them
in their naughtiness; and if a yonger man reprove them, whether
Officer or other, they do not make any reckoning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof, for
why, such an ancient old man will stand and look on us, and
when they see such coming, they are so far from fleeing as were
meet, as they are the more emboldned, because they know they
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:65522:344"/>
shall be countenanced by them; yea, these do in effect as <hi>Saul,</hi> who
held the garments of those that stoned <hi>Stephen;</hi> others there are, who
though they will not stand looking on them, yet will pass by, and say
nothing to them, but rather bid them God speed, and so are partakers
of their evil: These also should give good example, be paterns of
piety, godliness, hatred of sin, zeal for Gods glory, love to the house
of God, &amp;c. as those that have had much time, many means,
and now have but a while to live: If their example be good, it may
do much good,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 2.</note> if ill, then no hoe; <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob</hi> were god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
old men; so <hi>Noah, Job, Samuel, Simeon,</hi> their example did much
good: But Oh, how vain, frothy and unsavory are the words of some,
being so prophane, as youths might rather open their mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them, then give any attention to hear them: Some talk as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
as if they had never repented of the whoredom of their youth;
some talk and tell to youths, and laugh at the lewd pranks of their
youth, so reading their Lectures of evil; they shew themselves zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to do evil, that not onely will do so themselves as long as they
can, but would that others should after them; the contrary is a good
sign: Some also even aged, are Swearers, Sabbath breakers, Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. some also, though for the time they might have been
Teachers (though not publique ones, yet of the youths) had need to
be taught even the easiest Principles of Religion; they can onely
tell you of old Stories, they can remember since King <hi>Henry</hi> went
to <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and can remember the old learning, and that they helpt
the Priest say Mass many a time: If they could remember that they
had repented of it, it were well; or could remember of any good
they did forty years ago; or that they were greatly moved at a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and ever since have made conscience of their ways, took such
and such pains to hear, such delight to read in the Scriptures, and
other good Books, have sate up half nights in doing good, O this were
well: If they could talk of our Saviors birth, life, miracles, death; of his
Apostles &amp; their acts; of the Israelites carrying into captivity, coming
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> so of the Flood, of the Creation, &amp;c. these things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
would become them;<note place="margin">See 1 Iohn 2. 13, 14.</note> as they can tel you how old they are, and in
what Kings Reign they were born; so if they could tell you when
they were born again, and how old they are in Christ, it were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:
But alas, in such things they have no more skill then <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
had when he first came to our Savior: They are dumb when they are
put from their old Stories, <hi>I knew his Grand-father, his great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 65. 20.</note>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the older a man is, the worse he is, if he be not godly: O
that such would consider why they came into the world, how near
death is, what good counsel or good example they have given, whom
they have kept from evil, or furthered in good, what good they have
done for their own Souls, how they should have served God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and righteousness all the days of their life, and that they have
not thus served him, for which they have a fearful answer to make,
Though there be no great hope in respect of your dullness, as also
that God will not accept such a lame Sacrifice, and the Devils
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:65522:345"/>
leavings, who requireth the firstlings, and lest the Devil will not be
put out, nor sin accustomed unto be done away, yet nothing is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God; therefore despair not, onely ply you with exceeding
haste, lest you be shut out; and that you may turn to God, get some
assurance of his love, redeem the time, make some amends, do some
good ere you dye, as the good Thief that rebuked his fellow. If old
folks would not live, without being desired, nor be a burthen, nor dye
without being mourned for, let them live to good use, and do good, so
shall their age be honorable and honored: There be some good old
ancient men, but alas, their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>umber is but small, and they not so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as they should be; old men also in Towns must use their power
and place to the good of the yonger and Church wherein they live,
and not to ease their own bodies or purses, laying the burthen on
their inferiors;<note place="margin">See Tit. 2. 3. 4.</note> and as old men, so are old women also here meant,
who must give good instruction, and do good also by example; they
must speak graciously, and to good purpose, not given to Tale-telling,
Malice, idle Talking, &amp;c. as most are.</p>
                  <p>2. For youths,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> it rebuketh the notorious pride and malepart bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the youths of our times, in their gesture, carriage, speech to
their elders, whether in publique or private; what a universal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
do men make of their children? what a complaint, especially
of Servants, that there were never the like for pride, idleness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustiness,
&amp;c. never looking for more maintenance, never less duty.
In former times, when they had not the tythe of the means they now
enjoy, servants were plain, diligent, trusty, careful to please, painful,
&amp;c. What a shame is this? Hereupon they that be ill minded blame
us and the Gospel, never good servants since so much preaching: O
woful mouth, is our preaching or the Word of God in the fault? Is
there one word in the Bible, or doth any one come from us at any time,
that teacheth them so to do? Do not we teach them the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?
and do not you give God a good mends for the Gospel?
There are some which do even profess Religion, that yet suffer civil
servants to go beyond them in diligence, and trustiness, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and good behavior: Oh, what may we not fear upon the Land,
for the ungraciousness of this generation, seeing they will not bear the
easie yoke of Government of their Elders, they may look for some
heavy yoke or other; God will set up houses of Correction for such.
How few youths make any account that it belongs to them to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious?
or that their youth should be otherwise spent then in vanity;
but the Scriptures call for Religion, even at the hands of yong men.
There are also Reasons to disswade yong men from tainting their
yong years, and laying up matter for their age, to roar for the sins of
their youth, from losing this freest and fittest time: The fittest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they be fresh, and apt to conceive, remember, and are strong,
which way they set themselves to good or evil:<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note> The freest, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incumbred with cares, worldly businesses, &amp;c. old age also is dull,
and unfit to learn; the trade of Christianity is to be learned betimes:
You yong men and maids, and yonger women, shew your humility
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:65522:345"/>
in being ready to listen and follow any good councel or example: If
you have seen God go before you in your Elders, and follow them
not, your judgement will be great, and sin without excuse: There
be indeed Religious and sober good youths, and yong folks, married
and single, and such as shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Elders, children before their Parents, and Servants before
their Masters, and yong men which be able to instruct, and be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
to the aged:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1.</note> These are comely persons, but how few be of these?
These also must remember to reverence their Parents, Masters, Elders,
though they should not be for knowledge or grace as they ought, and
themselves have more then they.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All of you be subject one to another]</hi> He lays not this duty on the yong
onely, as in the former words, but now requireth it of all, even of
Superiors to Inferiors, and equalls each to other; not that he forgets
himself, or would lay all common, and make a confusion, as if the
Superior ought as much submission to his Inferiors, as they to him,
and so equals each to other; not so, but they must submit themselves
to them in another kinde, as Superiors to Inferiors, to care for them,
and seek their good, and bear with them; and equals to stoop to do
each other good, and to bear one with another, and yield and give
way to each other, not standing stifly upon terms.</p>
                  <p>For Superiors,<note place="margin">How superiors must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their inferiors.</note> they must submit to their Inferiors, even Princes.
Councellors, Nobles, Judges, &amp;c. must beat their heads, study and
take pains for the good of the Subjects, as the Subjects must submit
to them in reverence, obedience, tributes, &amp;c. So they care for
them, put themselves to pains to do them good, for God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
no Calling to take all and pay nothing, but every honor hath
a burthen of care going with it.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As in the Members of the the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Body, not one is allowed to be idle, but every one works for the
good of the whole; the eye looks, the tongue talks, the foot walks,
the hand works, &amp;c. Now some may think that all these work, and
the stomack and belly in the midst lie still and be idle, doing nothing;
but its not so, for though they work not as the other, yet their work
is as profitable and necessary, without which they could not long stir;
namely, they concoct the meat, and nourish the whole body; the like
may be said of Princes and Magistrates: So Ministers, even the greatest
must stoop low, and take care publikely and privately of the meanest
in the Congregation:<note place="margin">Luke 22. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is chief, must thus be servant of all:</hi> So
the chief men in Towns, must take care for the good of the poor; they
must visit them into their poor houses, and look in their cupboards,
&amp;c. its their glory thus to do; The Angels tend on us, and scorn not,
yea, God stoops to take care of us poor Creatures; He numbers the
hairs of our heads, and makes all our beds in our sickness; So our
Savior Christ, <hi>being rich, became poor for us;</hi> and the Holy Ghost takes
up us miserable Creatures for his lodging; Housholders also, as they
look for submission from their Families, so must they submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to have care not of their bodies only, but to instruct, teach and
admonish them for the good of their souls; so Husbands must bear
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:65522:346"/>
with their Wives weakness, and not stand strictly upon every word
amiss, when they are at sometimes disquieted: Neither is it any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagement
for a Superior to yield to his Inferior, but a commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for so did <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot;</hi> let every one know we be the Lords
Stewards, and therefore must lay out as well as take in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For equals,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How equals must be subject one to another.</note> There must be a doing good each to other, being not
born for our selves: The useful man is the man that will be beloved
and have comfort, we may stand in need one of another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must do good one to another; also we must yield each to other,
not as they that will strive for the wall or way, and lay each other in
the dirt; in reasoning we must not be stiff, and seek to have the last
word; in fallings out, if our adversary will not come at us, we must
go to him; In matter of commodity, if he will not yield an inch,
we must; if he be angry, break off, be silent, or answer mildely, &amp;c.
This is so far from being any disgrace, as that its our honor and credit,
what though we could master and subdue another? we are far wiser
if we can overcome our selves, and subdue our own hearts to the
word and will of God:<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 9.</note> This also tends greatly to peace, <hi>and blessed
are the peacemakers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Simile.</note> without this no peace. A flint and steel being the
one beat against the other make fire, not so if we strike it against a
cushion: The world thinks, shall I yield to him? O this great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to stand out, but its carnal and beastly courage of Bulls and
Bears, not of Christians; How many might have saved an infinite
deal of trouble and charge, yea, haply their lives, if they would but
have yielded a little at first, which afterwards they have wished, when
it was too late.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Humility the fountain of submission.</note> He exhorts to another vertue, which is
the mother and fountain of this submission; would you thus submit
your selves, then be humble: whence as we may note, that where
this submission is not, its for want of humility, and pride bears sway,
(which its needful we should take knowledge of, that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seek the cure) so we may learn, That</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever submission proceeds not from humbleness of heart,<note place="margin">Whatsoever submission proceeds not from humility, is hypocrisie.</note> is
but dissimulation and hypocrisie; as <hi>Absolom,</hi> that behaved himself
so lowly to all the people, which yet had a most proud heart in him,
to aspire to the kingdom in his fathers life time:<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 5.</note> So the Pope calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>Servus servorum Dei,</hi> when yet he lifts up himself above all, makes
himself head of the Church, to have Supremacy over Princes, to
set up and cast down at his pleasure, &amp;c. So the Monks and Fryers
that pretend great humility, in fasting and punishing themselves,
which yet proceeds from a proud heart, thinking hereby to merit at
the hand of God: So they that profess voluntary poverty, which yet
live in abundance of all things; so many among us use low conges
and crouches, which yet have all ensigns of pride upon them; so some
that be mean enough in apparel, and will speak so lowly, and give so
much to others, even more then is fit, and abuse themselves too much,
which yet do it but in cunning and with a proud heart, as may appear
by their gibing and jesting at those whom it may be they have thus
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:65522:346"/>
spoken to and preferred; as also their jesting at others, whom if you
shall stir a little, you shall finde them more like Lyons, and unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasable,
which is the sign of a proud heart; yea, some will put down
themselves too low, that all may advance them the more, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise
themselves, to have others set out their commendations.</p>
                  <p>The cloathing which is here principally meant, is the inward: The
filthy Soul must be cloathed with the white raiment of Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
The soul (behang'd with the filthy rags of beastly lusts)
must be adorned with the sanctifying graces of Gods Spirit; <hi>The
Church is all glorious within:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 45. 13.</note> Thus must both men and women of
all sorts be adorned, and herein be paterns unto others. Here is not
now present any naked body (you would be ashamed that there
should) but I am afraid that there's here many a naked Soul, nay worse,
even defiled with many noisom lusts of Pride, Ignorance, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
Prophaneness, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In particular,<note place="margin">What humility is.</note> the vertue exhorted unto, is Humility, which hath
his place in the heart, and sheweth it self outwardly by fruits in the
countenance, gestures, speeches and actions of the life: This is a
vertue and grace of Gods Spirit, whereby a man not out of cunning,
melancholly, carelesness, or discontent with himself, but from a true
knowledge of God, himself and others, doth with an unfained, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
free meekness of minde, set a low value of his own worth,
or doth esteem meanly of himself:<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 29.</note> Though the natural man may
seem more humble,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 16.</note> then some Christians,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 1.</note> yet the proudest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
hath more humility then the humblest carnal man:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 3.</note> This is
often called for in Scripture,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 10.</note> and taught by our Savior Christ in
the matter of the guests, and is also commended much in the
Proverbs: Besides, pride, which is opposite to it, is continually
forbidden and condemned, all which are of many commendations
of humility.</p>
                  <p>To point it out the better, see it by the fruits thereof, and then by
examples.</p>
                  <p>The fruits may be considered,<note place="margin">The fruits of humility in respect of God.</note> either in respect of God or men. In
respect of God, 1. It makes a man, seeing his own woful state by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by his guiltiness in <hi>Adam,</hi> by his actual sins also, and bondage
under sin, and all the curses due thereby, to renounce and abhor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and to flee for pardon, mercy and deliverance; and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all in himself but wretchedness and deformity, to desire to
finde all in another; which if he do, he counteth himself infinitely
bound to God for ever,<note place="margin">See Luke 9. 23</note> as the poor Publican and Prodigal childe,
the Patriarchs shewed it in sackcloath and ashes: This is the first step
to Heaven, and without which there is no coming to the Kingdom
of God. 2. It makes a man acknowledge himself unworthy of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of Gods favors; as <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Peter,</hi> with others: See <hi>Gen.</hi>
18. 27. and 32. 10. 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 18. Psal.</hi> 8. 4, &amp;c. 3. It makes a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
acknowledge whatsoever good thing he hath, to proceed from God
and his meer grace, and therefore to give God the glory thereof in
Thanksgiving: See <hi>Dan. 2. 27. Act.</hi> 3. 12. and 14. 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:65522:347"/>
As they in an Hospital,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they are not ashamed of the Founder thereof,
but keep the memory of him; neither are they fit to receive any thing,
who will not acknowledge it: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was seven years in
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> learning this. 4. It makes a man to see his own weakness and frailty,
his unability to do good, and proneness to evil, and that he hath no
strength to stand one blow in the Spiritual Warfare, so that he doth
always fear and suspect himself, and craves continually of God to be
kept from the one, and enabled to the other; as <hi>David, Open mine eyes,
stay my feet in thy ways, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ead me forth, forsake me not, teach me, quicken
me, &amp;c.</hi> so that the humble man is full, as of thanks, so of Prayers.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. It makes a man prest, and ready to yield obedience to God, seeing
both his Soveraignty over us as his poor creatures, and then that he
hath been so undeservedly merciful:<note place="margin">See Ier. 43. 2.</note> Thereupon he saith, <hi>Speak Lord,
for thy servant heareth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 5. 21.</note> Humility is the mother of Obedience, as
pride of disobedience; therefore we are willed to receive the word
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> with meekness. 6. It makes a man, if he have done amiss, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
grieved, and to confess and humble themselves; even <hi>Ahabs</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> counterfeiting the same, did him good. 7. It makes a man meekly to
bear the hand of the Lord, as well in respect of his Soveraignty over
us, as 1 <hi>Sam. 3. 18. 2 Sam 15. 26. Psal.</hi> 39. as in respect of our own
unworthiness,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 22.</note> as <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 9. knowing that we have deserved a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

This will be further seen into by examples of humility,<note place="margin">Examples of humility.</note> which will
not onely serve to perswade us thereto, but shew us further the nature

yea,<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 14.</note> was ready to have sacrificed his onely Son. <hi>Moses</hi> was very
humble, refusing to be made Ruler over the Israelites, till he saw God
was angry; also he followed the counsel of his Father in Law, and
would have had him gone with him into <hi>Canaan,</hi> which would have
somewhat darkned him, to have an Equal or Superior to go with him:
So when the people murmured against him,<note place="margin">Exod. 17. 4.</note> and were ready to have
stoned him, he prayed to God on their behalf. <hi>David</hi> acknowledged
all his confidence to be from God, being continually in thanksgiving,

of God patiently:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 23.</note> So to menward, <hi>What am I</hi> (saith he) <hi>that I should be

<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> but the most absolute patern of all, was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
Christ;<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8.</note> who as he bad us learn it of him,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note> so the Apostles <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> do often set forth his example to be followed of us. He was
born of a woman of low degree, in a mean place, laid in a Cratch,
subject to his Parents till he was of the age of thirty years, once one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he shewed himself among the Doctors when he was twelve years

is a most excellent vertue, greatly pleasing to God, and greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of by men:<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 9.</note> Every man loves and likes them that are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
though many will not so be: As its of absolute necessity to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
so its greatly behoofful for a mans well passing his time: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he shall escape many dangers and evils, and pass his time more
safely, with more favor of God and men: The humble man hath this
priviledge, that he cannot fall, he makes himself so low; he judgeth
himself, and so shall not be judged of God: Humility gives glory
to God, and God gives honor to the humble; its a beautiful Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
wherewith we are to deck our selves: its the Ornament of all
graces, have a man much or little: Let a man be empty and proud,
its most odious, as often it falls out, the emptiest vessels make the
loudest noise: If a man have but a little, yet walking humbly he is
esteemed:<note place="margin">Eph. 41, 2.</note> If a man have never such good parts, if he be puft up with
them, its a disgrace to them all, as dead Flies in a precious box of
oyntment. This is an helpful vertue, also a peaceable vertue, tending
greatly to a quiet life.</p>
                  <p>1. This should teach us to examine our selves by the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
notes,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that we may finde to our comfort that we have attained the
same in some good measure: He that hath it, hath an ornament, hath
a jewel indeed.</p>
                  <p>2. As those that have it are to labor by all means to encrease there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
so for those that want it, they must labor for it: To this end we
must pray for it, we must set the forementioned examples before our
eyes, and often think of them: We must look into our own vileness
and wretchedness, by reason of our many great sins, and the curse
due thereto, and this will drive us to God; into our own baseness,
and this will make us thankful into; our own inability to good,
and this will make us pray; into our own meanness, and Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and goodness, and this will make us stoop to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and to his Cross: Also to men-ward, we must look on our
own faults and others vertues, and aggravate our evils above theirs,
and the good things in them above those in our selves. O let us walk
humbly both in respect of God and men: Let us not be proud of
our gifts, not trust to our selves, nor despise, reject and condemn
others; else whereas great honor might redound to our profession,
and we might do much good, we shall do much hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For God resisteth the proud, &amp;c.]</hi> The Reason of the Exhortation
taken from the benefit, and illustrated by the contrary. Pride and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
are like <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 42. 8. and 48. 11.</note> hates the one, as much as he loves the
other: The proud man either gives Gods glory to another, or detains
it from God, which cannot be without his wrath: This is in respect
of God and men, as was said of humility, and by the notes of that,
this may be discerned.<note place="margin">The fruits of pride in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In respect of God, 1. Pride makes men think themselves not so

bad, but they have something in them, and can do something to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them to God, and whereby to be saved; these be the whole and
righteous whom Christ came not to call:<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> These are like the yong man
in the Gospel, like the Church of <hi>Laodicea:</hi> Thus the Papists think
they have some natural strength in them to deserve the first grace, and
with the help of that to merit the next, and eternal life: Thus many
boast of their Civil Righteousness; Thus ignorant persons hope to
be saved by their good meaning and good prayers, and that they have
a good heart in them, and that they love God above all, and their
neighbors as themselves. This is most detestable pride, for a base and
woful creature, a lump of misery and sin, to think himself good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
enough for heaven, and to come into Gods presence, whereas the
childe of God sees he is not worthy to think thereof, and wonders
that he should be advanced thereto; yet numbers of civil poor people
think themselves not proud, because they be not proud of apparel.
2. It makes a man think himself worthy of the benefits he hath,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
whereat he wonders not, but rather that he hath not more, and gives
not daily thanks. What pride, for a poor woful creature, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
every day to be plagued with one judgement or other, yea, to
be cast to Hell, that yet receiveth continual favors, and goes his way
with the nine Lepers, and never returneth to give thanks. 3. It makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
a man account of the gifts or graces he hath, that he hath them of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
or if from God, yet for some worthiness in himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he useth them as he will, to his own glory, and seeks himself in his
wit, preaching, speeches, doings, &amp;c. and so stands as it were in Gods
light. The proud man thinks he hath that he hath not; as many a
one thinks he knows much, that knows nothing, and that he hath faith,
repentance, a good heart, when its nothing so, or that he hath more
of a thing then he hath by much, more wisdom, strength, &amp;c. or
what he hath, he attributes it to himself, as if he had it of himself,
or got it by his own wit and industry, when its onely given him, and
he but received it, and so is but proud of borrowed cloathes. 4. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
makes a man think himself strong in himself to avoid this sin, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
this temptation, or to do this or that duty, and therefore prays not;
goes out in the morning upon all the temptations in the day,<note place="margin">See Prov. 28. 14.</note> goes to
the Word and prays not; so into ill company, &amp;c. 5. Pride makes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
a man that he stoops not to God in his Word: This is horrible pride,
when a poor mortal creature shall shake off the commandments of the
most glorious God,<note place="margin">Ier. 13. 15. and 43. 2. and 44. 16, 17.</note> yet many living in sins, even contrary to their
knowledge, think they be not proud. 6. Pride makes men that they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
not grieved when they have done wickedly, they cannot stoop and
be humbled; they cannot see their sins, at least nothing as it is, and
then pride hardens their hearts, as if they could finde many ways
to escape the hand of God. 7. Pride makes men impatient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
Gods hand; for either they murmure, blaspheme, use unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means, will not wait on God for an end (as hath been already
said) or are full of revenge against those whom God hath raised up
to punish them. 8. Pride makes men curious to pry into things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
                     <pb n="654" facs="tcp:65522:349"/>
as the Israelites, that would go out and seek Manna on the
Sabbath day, though they were told before they should finde none.
The men of <hi>Beth-shemesh</hi> would pry into the Ark: Some there are
that delight in curious questions, some meddle with matters beyond
their reach, some with things out of the compass of their calling,
some also will not rest satisfied, when they see what Gods Word
saith in a thing, but cavil and make objections against the same. Thus
in respect of God.</p>
                  <p>In respect of men:<note place="margin">In respect of men.</note> 1. It makes men prefer themselves before others,
thinking more highly of themselves then of others, looking on their
own vertues, and on other folks faults: It makes men look for great
Titles, high Places, and to be preferred and set up, and strive, and
be discontent if they have not the same, as <hi>Haman</hi> was vexed that
<hi>Mordecai</hi> did not stoop to him. The Scribes and Pharisees did love
greetings in the Market-places, and to be saluted, <hi>Rabbi; Saul</hi> would
have <hi>Samuel</hi> honor him before the people, the Disciples strove who
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> should be greatest. 2. It makes men unsociable and strange, either
scorning to be beholding to any, or else too burthensom, loth to
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> help, &amp;c. 3. It makes men loth to submit themselves to their equals
or inferiors: To their Superiors oftentimes they be most base and
cunning, which yet be lordly and cruel to their Inferiors, and stiff
and stern to their Equals; they will not yield an inch: If they take
an Argument or an Opinion, they will carry it away, or else fall flat
out: If they be fallen out with any, they will not yield a jot, but look
they should be sought to: They are very contentious, ready to offer
occasion of offence, thinking so highly of themselves, and meanly
of others,<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 10.</note> that they are ready to embrace the least occasion, stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it, contend, and will not be pacified. 4. It makes men very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to censure, finde fault, make light of others gifts, extenuate
and deprave their good actions, aggravate their faults; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
either their own faults that they daily commit, or their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and readiness to fall. 5. It makes a man that he will neither ask
nor take counsel, being wise in his own eyes, but would have every
body do as he doth, or follow his counsel, else he is ready with
<hi>Achitophel,</hi> to hang himself in discontent, nor will he abide rebuke or
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> admonition. 6. It shews it self in proud looks, haughty eyes, scornful
speeches, imperious commands, stately carriage, jetting and mincing
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> as they go. 7. Excessive apparel, for the matter, not fit for ones cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor according to ones place and ability, but quite beyond their
degree; Ladies like Queens, Gentlewomen like Ladies, Waiting
Maids like their Mistresses, poor Milk-maids, as if they were the
wealthiest mens daughters in the Countrey, too garish and gawdy for
the colour, too full of slashes and cuts, too soft and delicate, especially
mens; so for the fashion, new, strange, garish: Fashion-devisers or
followers cannot free themselves of pride.</p>

                     <pb n="655" facs="tcp:65522:349"/>
This is a most wicked and dangerous sin,<note place="margin">How abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable it is.</note> hateful to God, that
which lieth open to his judgements,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 17.</note> as the highest Trees and Pinacles
are burnt down with lightning,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> stricken with thunder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or overturned

even proud men cannot abide it in others; Yonder, say they, goes one
will not give his head for the washing, that thinks better of himself
then all the Parish besides; He hath a good wit, but he knows it;
She is very fair,<note place="margin">How hurtful.</note> but ye need not tell her thereof: It makes a man run
into many sins, into many absurdities, and draws on many punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
It disgraceth all good gifts, and so stains them, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unprofitable: It makes us uncapable of the grace of God, as
the hilly ground shuts off the rain, therefore those profit not by the
Word, nor by the Sacraments, nor can pray, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is naturally bred in our hearts,<note place="margin">Whence it comes.</note> and very hardly rooted out;
it comes much, either of abundance, or of conceit and opinion of
much; usually or abundance: If any have more Beauty, Wit,
Strength, Skill in any Calling, Knowledge, Gifts, Wealth, Authority,
or the like, this makes the heart swell, in a base or mean condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
affliction or misery to be humble (at least in shew) is nothing, but
in abundance of gifts to be humble, this is a great grace and rare.</p>
                  <p>This is not onely in the common sort and wicked,<note place="margin">The very best not free there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</note> but haunteth
even the Servants of God, and riseth of the ashes of other sins;
when we have got the mastery over them, and grace and ability
to do good duties, then pride thrusts in to make us think well
of our selves, as if we had done them by our own power, and
so even in our best duties; there's most danger of this. Hence
it is that the Lord leaves corruptions and infirmities in the hearts
of his Children to hold them under: Therefore are they so often
foiled, when they seek themselves most. Hence many Christians
of good parts are held in a poor estate,<note place="margin">See Iob 33. 17</note> lest they should wax
proud; yea, if it prove very rank, and bear a great stroke in them, he
lets them fall into some foul sin, or some notable disgrace, to cure
them of pride: for desperate diseases must have a desperate cure. Its
the Devils practice, if he can no way else prevail with a man, to win
him to evil, or to live in any sin, but that he hath got good gifts, and
is careful in the use of them, then he seeks to blow them up with pride;
as Enemies when they have long laid Siege to a Town,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and can by no
means win it, at last they undermine it, and seek to blow it up with
Gunpowder.</p>
                  <p>1. Let us examine our selves concerning this sin;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> this may be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said, and too truly, that this Land is universally overspread with the
same in a fearful maner. How is <hi>Christ</hi> preached, and how few imbrace
him, at least in their hearts, and stoop to him? How few use the gifts
they have to Gods glory, as acknowledging they come from him, but
seek themselves onely; using their wealth, wit, skill, &amp;c. as they list?
Universally men obey not, nor will stoop to the word of God, but
do what they list, whatsoever God saith. How generally do men use
unlawful shifts in their crosses? what contentions, stirs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some about places? what notorious pride and excess is there in
apparel? whereby we may justly fear the Lord hath a quarrel against
us; yea, though we are in such a fearful state, we think highly of our
selves, and as if our care had never been better, cannot endure
to be told that these are dangerous and evil times, yea, its dangerous
to say that these are dangerous times: What measure soever we have
of pride, its both dangerous and damnable. If men trust to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in themselves; if they stoop not to the word; if they use un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
means in their afflictions, as good have Ratsbane in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
as this pride in their hearts: If we be conceited of the good
things in us, take too much to our selves, set too light by others, think
too well of our own strength, lift up our selves above others, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,

with a sword drawn to resist <hi>Balaam</hi> in the way: See to this purpose
<hi>Prov. 6. 17. 16. 5. 18. Psal. 119. 21. Luke 1. 52. &amp;</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> This stands in Gods light, and robs him of his glory; its
not <hi>Caesars</hi> friend, the arch-Traytor: Will God suffer himself to be
spoiled of his glory by a poor creature? God delights to disgrace
them that think so highly of themselves, and so lift up themselves
above others; so, lest they should do too much hurt, for if proud
men get wealth and authority, there is no hoe. This also will be more
taken knowledge of, then if many inferior ones were cut off; and will
also prevail more, for if God hath crossed and cut off those, others
will beware.</p>
                  <p>God resists them,<note place="margin">How God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists them.</note> sometimes by taking away that they be proud
of, wit (sending them phrensie) beauty (sending them deformity) gay
clothes, sending them rags, &amp;c. Sometimes he makes their pride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them ill, and so they be noted and disgraced thereby: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he makes their gifts unprofitable, and blasteth them, that they
dye, foils them, when they seek themselves most, lets them fall into
some foul sin, and so shames them, or crosseth them by some punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or other, &amp;c. God will cast dung in their faces, and besmear
them; he delights to disgrace such. Call to minde the forementioned
Examples, of the evil Angels, ths Builders of <hi>Babel, Pharaoh, Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezek,
&amp;c.</hi> and how God set himself against them.</p>
                  <p>1. If we observe any to be very proud,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> do not we envy them, but
rather pity them;<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 5.</note> for God is their enemy, and their destruction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be far off.</p>

                     <pb n="657" facs="tcp:65522:350"/>
2. As we would avoid destruction, let us take heed of pride, and
labor to be purged of it more and more; let us resist it and stamp it
down. God will not give his graces to those that will rob him of the
glory of them. If we strive not against this, but yield hereto, God
will either let us fall into some foul sin, and so shame our selves to
cure us, or at least he will thwart us with many crosses, which by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
we may avoid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And giveth grace to the humble,]</hi> The direct Reason to move us to
humility,<note place="margin">See Ier. 57. 15. and 66. 2.</note> Unto the humble, God giveth the gifts of his Spirit, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
deliverances and favors,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 53.</note> respect among men, favor with him
self;<note place="margin">How God giveth grace to the humble.</note> he dwells with such, and filleth them with good things. This
may be shewed in all the properties thereof before mentioned: 1. They
that be vile, and nothing in their own eyes, and be poor, mourning,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
sighing, hungring, &amp;c. obtain mercy with God. They are fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
thereof (witness the poor Publican) will be thankful,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 14.</note> and do any
thing at Gods command. 2. Such as acknowledge themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of any mercy, God honoreth with many; as <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi>
the Centurion, the woman of <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> with others. 3. They that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that whatsoever grace or gift they have, they have had it
of God, and refer it to his glory, shall have more, as he that had
gained five Talents: He is not worthy to be an Almsman, that will
not acknowledge the Donor. 4. They that acknowledge their own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
insufficiency and inability to good, or resist evil, these will pray, and
God will keep them, and give them the grace they want: they shall
be satisfied,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 100.</note> as the thirsty ground with rain. <hi>David</hi> prayed to be taught,
and got more understanding then the Ancients; to this end also they
will hear, read, come to the Sacraments, &amp;c. as knowing the need they
have of help, and so are holpen. 5. They that humbly submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
to the obedience of Gods word, them he will teach, and they
shall profit:<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 9.</note> These shall save themselves from many a sin and sorrow,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 17.</note>
which else with <hi>David, Jonah</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> they may bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
6. When having sinned, they humble themselves, God is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
near them to receive them to mercy (as to the Prodigal) and to turn
away evil, as from <hi>Josiah.</hi> 7. Them that humble themselves under <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
Gods afflicting hand, God graceth with deliverance, as <hi>David</hi> from
<hi>Saul,</hi> from <hi>Absolom.</hi> 8. Them that keep themselves humbly within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
their compass, God teacheth, and keepeth in their places to do good,
when others medling with matters above their reach, run into
some error or heresie, and bring shame upon themselves. So 9. Them
that be humble towards men, preferring others before themselves, and
being low in their own eyes, God graceth with favor, credit, and a
good report.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Apostle having shewed that Humility is an ornament to be
labored for, and given a Reason thereof, he doth here press
the same with an Exhortation, teaching both us how to preach, and
you how to hear: We must deliver sound Doctrine, prove it strongly
by Arguments and Reasons, and then urge the practice thereof, to the
avoiding of evil, and performing good, else we do nothing. People
also must thus hear;<note place="margin">How Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ought to preach, and people to hear.</note> when they know a thing, then must they yield
to the obedience thereof, else all is nothing. We must be cast into the
mold and shape of the Doctrine delivered; we must follow the sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and patern of the Word; we must write after our copy, though
haply we do it not so fairly as were requisite; we must be like the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
that answereth the same sound to the voyce,<note place="margin">Psal. 27. 8.</note> though not perfectly:
Our lives must in some measure be answerable to the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humble your selves therefore.]</hi> Humility is the way to Gods grace.
If in seeing our own vileness and sin, we do humble our selves, God
will have mercy on us: Shall not the grace of God allure us, which is
more worth then the whole world? what else will? But of this
before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Under the mighty hand of God,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two other Reasons per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading to humility.</note> Now follow two other Reasons to
perswade to humility; One from Gods power, with whom we have
to do; the other, from the preferment whereunto we shall attain in
due time, he will exalt us.</p>
                  <p>From the 1. <hi>The mighty hand of God,</hi> either to lift us up being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or cast us down being proud. Note, that</p>
                  <p>The consideration of Gods Almightiness is a good mean to make
us humble:<note place="margin">The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods power a good means to perswade to humility.</note> See this in <hi>Peter,</hi> at the great draught of fishes, <hi>Depart
from me, for I am a sinful man:</hi> So <hi>Abraham, I am but dust and ashes:</hi> So
<hi>Isaiah, Wo is me, I am undone, &amp;c.</hi> Hence God gave his Law in such
terrible maner, and humbled his Servants whom he was to send unto
his people with fearful visions;<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 5.</note> so when God would somewhat
take down <hi>Job,</hi> he did it by shewing him his power in his creatures.
Gods hand indeed is mighty, that made the world of nothing, divided
the Red sea, opened the earth in sunder, made the mountains to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and will raise us out of our graves in the last day. This ought much
to affect us, that so we might seek to get into his favor, stoop to his
Word, submit our selves under the cross, and be humbled: The
want of this is the cause of pride, and that we do not stoop before
the Lord: We think because we can make our part good one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we can do so with God: <hi>But O potsheard, who art thou that strivest
with thy maker?</hi> What is the potsheard to the bar of iron? whether
it give or take the blow, it breaketh into pieces; the proudest Gyants
have not stood before him when he hath been angry: If the Lyon
roar,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Beasts tremble. If a Gyant should take an ordinary man in
hand, what could he not do? would he not fling him against the
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:65522:351"/>
ground, and make the earth to ring? so doth God by many a proud
man in a year, he flings him on his back against the ground, and
makes all the Countrey ring of the fall.</p>
                  <p>O then consider this, and humble thy self for thy sins past; labor
to get into Gods favor, stoop to his Word when he speaks, yield and
bow under his afflicting hand, lest he tear thee in pieces, whiles there
is none to help,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 12.</note> if his wrath burn but a little: Oh, <hi>Kiss the Son lest he be
angry, and ye perish in his wrath:</hi> Little did <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
and others, think God had such a mighty hand: Be wise by their harms,
stoop in time, lest he make thee have woful experience of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness
to thy confusion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he will exalt you,]</hi> Namely, with grace here and glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This is the second Reason, from which note, that</p>
                  <p>Humility is the way to glory:<note place="margin">Humility is the way to glory.</note> This may be shewed in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
properties of humility: If a man confess and humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the sight of sins, God will exalt him with comfort; so will
he outwardly advance the humble and dejected. <hi>Leah</hi> being despised,
God made her fruitful,<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 31.</note> as <hi>David</hi> from the Ewes to be anointed, and
after he was humbled under many afflictions,<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 71.</note> God exalted him to the
Kingdom in his own time;<note place="margin">See Iob 5. 11. and 22. 29.</note> so were <hi>Joseph, Esther, Mordecai</hi> exalted;
so will he exalt to glory in Heaven all his that have humbly walked
before him amidst their sorrows,<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 23.</note> and the many afflictions of this life,
as <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Labor we therefore for humility,<note place="margin">Use.</note> if we would be indeed exalted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In due time.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God doth all things in due time.</note> Though Gods servants be not always advanced or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
when they will, yet shall they in due time: God is not onely
able and willing to exalt his humble servants, but infinitely wise to
know the fittest time:<note place="margin">Ier. 5. 24.</note> He doth all things in due time: If he deal with
the insensible earth (if our sins hinder not) he sends rain,<note place="margin">Psal. 145. 15.</note> the former
and latter in due season: If with bruit Creatures, he gives them
meat in due season, on whom they wait for it, much more will he
give unto his own servants:<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 35.</note> He that teacheth men to do things in due
season, to sow, plant, reap, fell timber, all things to their best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
will do his in season. As he pulls down the wicked in due
time (though often not when we think good, or so soon as we would,
but when it shall be most for his glory, the comfort of his servants,
and the greatest shame and astonishment of his adversaries, as it was
with the builders of <hi>Babel, Haman,</hi> and others) so will he also exalt
his own, as were <hi>Joseph, David, Moses,</hi> with others.</p>
                  <p>Let us wait upon God patiently,<note place="margin">Use.</note> think not long, use the means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
and pray, but murmure not, use no unlawful means: We
must not despair, though we be not holpen by and by, knowing that
the due time is not yet. <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> failed herein, and used un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
shifts, the one to obtain a childe by her handmaid; the other,
the blessing for the Son she loved. <hi>Isaac</hi> would not do so, but waited
and prayed twenty years together for a childe, and never would med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with any handmaids bed: We may not appoint the Lord the time,
whose are times and seasons.</p>

might rise from the former point, which concerneth humility: If we
should be thus humble towards men, then should we be misused of

take the care of them, and that both for body and soul: Here then
we have an Exhortation and a Reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Casting all your care on him,]</hi>

to get Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, &amp;c. therefore must
hear, read, meditate, pray, confer, &amp;c. for though God work both
the will and the deed, yet he will have us work out our salvation with
fear and trembling; he will not save us without us: So for this life,
we must be painful; as <hi>Adam</hi> both before and after his fall: Every man
must have an honest calling, and therein take pains (else he must not
eat) that he may be a profitable member in his place:<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 4.</note> As the wise
man commendeth diligence, so doth he as well speak against idleness;
yea, we must have an honest and moderate lawful care; therefore is
the sluggard sent to the Ant to forecast,<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 6.</note> and save somewhat in youth
against age,<note place="margin">Gen. 41: 48.</note> in health against sickness, as <hi>Joseph</hi> in the time of plenty
saved for the years of famine; All this God likes well: When these
two meet, as they did in that good woman, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. or when one is hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandly
both for soul and body, as either of them is better then nor,
so both of them are excellent: Who may tend upon the good of
their souls, better then the diligent and provident? Who may do
more good to others then they? for idle persons and unthrifts, are
neither good for themselves, nor any body else.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh slothful Christians,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> that have no care of their
souls, regard not the Lords Market-day, the Sabbath, care not for
the Word, or else come coldly unto it, without buying, or laboring
to make provision of those graces needful to Salvation; care not for
Prayer, the Sacraments, Religious Company, &amp;c. Hence it is that
they have ragged, beggarly souls, void of any true riches or spiritual
graces, and so will be cast out with Dogs: This will be fearful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demation,
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:65522:352"/>
that so few wise Merchants purchase the Pearl, lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for their souls, or seek the true riches in Christ; few labor for the
meat that endureth to life everlasting: O the soul is little regarded,
and yet what profit is it to win the whole world with the loss thereof?</p>
                  <p>2. It rebuketh idle persons,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> that have no Calling, no skill in any,
no minde to follow any; or if they do, then do they unthriftily waste
their time in drinking, gaming, &amp;c. and when they come home, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through their own pride and unthriftiness or their wives, they lash
out as long as their means lasts, without any frugality or moderation,
whence poverty taketh hold on them, whereof they should take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and reform: Oh, its an ornament in a Christian to be diligent
and frugal.</p>
                  <p>The other extreme which is forbidden,<note place="margin">They must not be too careful.</note> is, Excessive care; and this
is for soul or body: Soul, when we cast distrustful thoughts, or have
cares out of our own reach,<note place="margin">About their souls.</note> and which be in Gods power; as thus,
If one that hath been a notorious bad person, hearing the Gospel
preached, and Mercy proclaimed to such, should be held off, because
he never looks that any such thing should be done to him, but thinks it
impossible he should ever come to good, that hath been thus and thus
bad, and so hold off, and thinks as good never being to seek to God,
for it will never be. This partly must use the means that God hath
ordained for miserable sinners to come unto him, and finde mercy
by, and commend the success to God. Another having begun to
finde some comfort, and enter upon a good course, is held off, hearing
he must renounce all sin, and labor to please God in all things, else
no salvation; now he hath one sin or corruption he thinks verily he
shall never prevail against, therefore as good never go further: He
must use the means of subduing this by the Word, Prayer, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
&amp;c. knowing that as God gives him strength against some,
he can also and will in time against all corruptions; in the mean time,
take it. Another having begun, hears, that he only <hi>that endures to the end
shall be saved,</hi> and he thinks he shall never, but shall fall either finally,
and perish, or at least most foully into some error in judgement, or sin
in life, and shame all, and therefore as good go no further: But God
bids us use the means, and look for good success, and cast our
selves on him. I grant indeed, if we should look upon the world, the
Devil, our selves, we might fear; as also considering that many great
ones have faln; but its like either they trusted to themselves, or
neglected the means; which if we do not, God will keep us: If we
should use the means, and yet torture our selves with care, how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
were our lives? Another saith, he shall never be able to abide
persecution and the fire, let such labor for faith and love, and yield to
God in what he calls for; bearing present afflictions patiently, whom
God will enable to greater, if he shall call them thereto: So some are
afraid they shall dye a raving death, some that they shall be bedrid and
lame, some that if they should have the Stone, or such a grievous
torment, they were never able to endure it, &amp;c. Its good in some sort to
hove some such forethought to quicken our care, but not distrustfully
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:65522:353"/>
to discourage our selves. Again, if a man should be so careful for his
soul, as to neglect his Calling, and think he should not follow it,
this were excessive care.</p>
                  <p>Excessive care for the body;<note place="margin">About their bodies.</note> its either for fear of evils, or for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
good things: For the 1. O what if I should lose all I have,
and come to misery, by Bankrupts, fire, &amp;c? What if I should fall
into such a cruel mans hands, he would undo me? Also what if I
should for my well doing and profession have my Landlords displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
be put into Courts, brought into trouble, &amp;c. we must labor for
grace to bear us out in such things, and for heaven, doing our duty
wisely and godly, as <hi>Daniel,</hi> and leaving the issue to God, on whom
we must cast our selves and our care.</p>
                  <p>For the 1. Its either when we take care for the successes of things,
which is Gods part, or when we use excessive care, that makes us sin,
by neglecting some duty, or committing some evil: For successes, as
when we have made a bargain, and used the means, then we fall to
take thought for the success too; but Oh, if it should not prove well,
I should be hindred or undone, but we must use the means, and leave
the success to God, when we have used the outward means, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so sanctified our labors, then ought we to live by faith, and
be assured that we shall have that success that God shall see best. If
it shall fall out to my desire, I shall desire to be thankful, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,<note place="margin">Hest. 4. 16.</note>
I know God will dispose it to the best, as <hi>Esther, If I perish, I
perish.</hi> For excessive care for worldly things, when men will for these
neglect good duties to God, their own Souls, Families, Poor, Word,
Sacraments, Prayer, &amp;c. or shall commit evil, by stealing, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
dissembling, defrauding, breaking the Sabbath, &amp;c. This is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Would God have us provide for our selves with his dishonor,
with the wounding of our own souls, and hurting our brethren? or
cannot he provide for us sufficiently without these? When we follow
our Callings (all duties discharged) and be provident and thrifty that
nothing be lost, this is as far as we must go, further we must not, any
further is too far.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes the universal sin in this Land:<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> Poor people take
such thought what they shall eat, &amp;c. that they lye, steal, &amp;c. The
richer sort use all unconscionable courses, dare not come to the Word
for fear of wanting, nor read nor pray in their Families, but dare do
any evil, or at least be so excessively careful, as that thereupon they
use lying, deceit, oppression, racking rents, &amp;c. and this is not the
fault of the bad onely, but even of Gods servants, who be tainted
with too much care, under the the colour of lawful care going too
too far: They are careful oftentimes about the successes of things,
when they might by faith rest quietly on God: They do often neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
good, or post it over, and do evil with more care.</p>
                  <p>The root of this in the men of the world, is want of Faith, for
had they any perswasion of Gods love and care, they would not be
thus careful; so also the want of prizing, seeking and regarding Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Spiritual things. In Gods children, the weakness of Faith
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:65522:353"/>
is the ground hereof; as also their too little esteeming of heaven and
heavenly things: For if we were assured of Gods particular caring
for us, aud that heaven (so excellent a place) is ours, and did more
highly esteem of Spiritual graces, with the means thereof, we would
spend much time in them, and so be kept from so much worldly
care.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us therefore labor to be purged of this distrustful care,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> or
being free, to keep our selves so: To this end we must labor for faith,
and to encrease therein, and highly to prize grace; and the rather
must we thus do, because as this vice hath so ill roots, so the fruits
are as bad. Excessive care for the world hurts the body, brings gray
hairs, distracts and rends the minde asunder, makes a man unfit for
any good, unfit to be a good Magistrate (as who will never tend or
regard the publique good) so to be a good Minister, nay, to be a good
housholder, as which will justle out or hinder Reading, Prayer, good
Duties, &amp;c. It hinders a man from the Word, or if he doth come
thereto, he is already so full, as all runs beside, or falls asleep, and so
cannot meditate thereon,<note place="margin">Luke 14. 18.</note> or receive any comfort thereby; it choaks
the Word,<note place="margin">Luke 21. 34.</note> yea, in time makes a man mock at it: It makes him
unfit to pray or perform any other duty, yea, unfit to dye, and for
Christs coming; but fit for all evil, for its the root of all evil, and
easily leads a man to the breach of any Commandment: The Devil
can fasten any temptation on such a one.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore take heed of it,<note place="margin">Why we ought not to be too careful of worldly things.</note> and the rather for that 1. These things
be good in a very mean degree, cannot breed contentment, nor make
a man happy. 2. They are base, bones for Dogs, such as Reprobates
have more in plenty, then Gods Children, more meet as wages for
slaves, then portions for Children, even the wicked have these, but
the godly have spiritual graces here, and hereafter eternal life. 3. They
be very vain, subject to many losses and changes; yea, and we are
as vain as they, which if we should never lose, yet might be taken
from them not twenty or forty years hence, but ere to morrow; and
whether we shall leave them to our children, we cannot tell, haply it
may be to strangers, yea enemies; if to our children, we know not
how they will spend them. If some miserable men that have robbed
God, stoln from the poor, sold themselves to the Devil, had but
leave to look out of their graves a little, and see who dwells in their
houses, and have got that they left, it would encrease their torment to
see they were such fools: Therefore to be excessively careful, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good for our selves nor our children, we must follow our calling
and be thrifty, and go as far as we may lawfully, and no further: We
must give our children good education; and if we can do that by
good means, all duties discharged, then there's great hope of Gods
blessing, and if they fear God, it shall be blessed, and that shall be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
and if they fear not God, the more we leave them, its the worse,
and the more hurt they will do: how happy would it have been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a youth, if he had been left at a trade hard at work, &amp;c. he should
not have run into many sins that his abundance hath led him into: If
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:65522:354"/>
we leave them the poors part, the Ministers part, &amp;c. God will rifle
in their pack, and have so many quarrels against them, so that a little
by lawful means gotten, shall do them more good, then a great heap
of Lambs grease, when the heat of Gods wrath begins to beat upon
it: A mans house cannot be established by iniquity. In all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
let us take heed of distrustful and excessive care: O how sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might a Christian live, if he would follow his Calling diligently
and thriftily, and go no further, but leave the rest to God: Thus might
we be freed from a world, nay, rather an Hell of cares that now distract
us, and make us unfit for good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For he careth for you.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">God cares for his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> A main Reason; we may spare all our care,
any more then the lawful use of the means; for why, if God care for
us, we are well enough; He is infinite in power, therefore nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to him, nothing can hinder him; He is infinite in love and
mercy, therefore ready enough to do us good; so in wisdom, therefore
knows what we need, and is good for us: Its not so with the children
of any earthly Parents, for they sometimes would care and do for
them, and cannot; some can, and will not; some both can and would
if they knew, but through distance of place, and such like lets, they
know not their state.</p>
                  <p>Now that God doth care for his, appears, for he chose us before the
Foundation of the world; In <hi>Adam</hi> He created us happy, and fully
furnished us with all things needful for us; In our own Creation, he
gave us our shape in our mothers womb, and kept us that we were not
stifled: So in our birth, infancy, wanton youth, and wilde time, when
we cared not for him nor our selves, he provided for us, as ever since
by his Spiritual goodness: He hath provided us a peaceable Land, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
to rule us, Ministers to teach us, given us his Son reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Gospel: He chose us ere we were, therefore will not forsake
us being his; gave us his Son, therefore with him will give us all good
things; called us of his own free grace without our desire, and will
he not fulfil his good works, now we desire it above all things; he
gave us life, therefore wil give us food and raiment for the preservation
thereof: He gave us those without our either care, help or pains,
and will he not give us the lesser with our pains?<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 26.</note> He feeds the fowls of
the air, and clothes the Lillies of the field, <hi>and are not we much better

                  <p>1. For so many of us as know God to be our God and Father, let
us rest our selves on this promise, and help our selves against this world
of cares, which through the want of faith doth so much distract us:
O the state of Gods Children, is a safe happy state, if they knew it,
which through faith they might.<note place="margin">Use 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. For the world, no marvel though they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k and use all unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means, seeing they have no Father to care for them, and are poor
Orphans: If a poor fatherless boy should run up and down, toil and

its a fatherless childe, &amp;c. but if a rich mans Son should so do, and

<pb n="665" facs="tcp:65522:354"/>
stealing a loaf, into anothers cellar, and stealing drink, into anothers
field, and stealing his hedges, would not every one cry out on such a
one,<note place="margin">See Matth. 6. 32.</note> and would it not be an horrible disgrace both to the Son and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?

may stand with these three main ends, the glory of God, our own good,
and the Salvation of our Brethren: Our lawful liberties are meat, drink,

                     <note place="margin">What watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness is here required.</note> He means not of the bodily sleep (that's not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,
so it be in fit time; the night not the day, so it be in fit place;
our Chambers, not the Church, in fit measure to enable us the more
for the duties of our Calling) but of the sleep of the soul, for there
be many that be awake in body, rising early, and go late to bed, which
yet are in a spiritual sleep in respect of their souls, fast asleep in their sins,
and lie snorting in deep security of sin.<note place="margin">What Spiritual watchfulness is.</note> Watchfulness is a diligent and
continual looking to our selves, that both in thought, word and deed
we may resist evil,<note place="margin">A man must be awakened before he can watch.</note> and do the good we ought. This is the work one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a good Christian, who being awakened out of his sins, hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the pardon of them, and assurance thereof, and therefore hath
set his heart to lead a godly life,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 14.</note> and to please God in all things: Its
requisite then that a man be awakened before he can watch, as we bid
not a man fast asleep look to this or that, but first to wake, and then
look to it; we bid not a man that is down, run, but first to get up
on his feet, and then run.</p>
                  <p>By nature we are asleep in sin,<note place="margin">By nature we are asleep in sin, which is diversly prov'd.</note> yea dead therein: For 1. As in the
bodily sleep all the sences are bound up; So in the Spiritual, a natural
man hears not the voice of God, hears not the alarms either of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or judgements: He sees not one step of the way to Heaven, nor
the danger he is in; Though he wallow in the mire of foul sins, that a
good man will stop his nose at, yet he smells nothing; he cannot taste
good and evil asunder, but calls sweet, sower: The Word, good
Counsel, good Company, &amp;c. wherein Gods people take most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:65522:355"/>
are bitter to him: Though the word hit him never so hard
blows, he feels not, as neither, though he wound his own consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with never so foul sins. And 2. As a man asleep loves not to be
awaked, so a natural man out of his sins, and to be called upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
3. As in sleep men dream of that they have not, so a natural
man dreams he is in a very good case, hath faith, repentance, love, &amp;c.
when its nothing so, and when he awakes he confesseth it. 4. As a
man in sleep speaks some good words, but knows not what, and by
and by is out; so a natural man in good company will speak good
words, but hath no feeling of them, and will again be quickly out of
them. 5. As a man before he sleeps, gives direction that none awake
him, and turns from the one side to the other, sleeping now on the
one, then on the other; so a natural man will not be called upon to
repentance, having slept long enough on the one side in prodigality,
will haply turn on the other, and lie as long in covetousness. 6. As a
man that hath been in a long deep sleep can hardly be awakened,
though it thunder, though the winds be ready to blow down the house
he hears nothing; so its hard to awaken any out of sin, especially when
they have lain long, and lived therein, no Preaching or calling on,
no Judgements of God, though never so apparent, can awake them
from their security. 7. As sleep is an image of the first death, so is
sleep in sin of the second.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we must endeavor for faith,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and set upon a good life,
we must learn to watch and keep us well while we be well:<note place="margin">Iohn 5. 25.</note> To this
end, we must make use of the Trumpet of the Word daily sounding
in our ears, and take notice of Gods Judgements, both on our selves
and others: What may not induce us hereunto?</p>
                  <p>Reasons are many.<note place="margin">Reasons for watchfulness.</note> 1. We are of the day, and the light of the
word shines in our faces: Its enough for them in the night of Popery,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and where the word is not,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 5.</note> to sleep in sin; he is a sluggard indeed that
sleeps, when the Sun shines his face: Some of you have slept till nine
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a clok, till high noon, till three in the afternoon, for shame awake. 2. He
that sleepeth in Harvest,<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 5.</note> is the Son of confusion. <hi>This is the plentiful
harvest of the Gospel:</hi> Now there is good to be done, good gathering
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of faith, knowledge, repentance, and such other graces. 3. Its a shame
to sleep when others be at work: Many through Gods grace be
awakened by the word, and are busily working out their Salvation,
laboring for grace, and using the means diligently, and will you lie
snorting in sin? then will they be provided of necessaries, when you will
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> perish. 4. Its a shame to sleep, when all one's work lies to do, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
among us have done just nothing of that that God hath set them
here for, nothing done towards their Salvation, but all against it;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> awake therefore ere night come, when you cannot work. 5. It were
strange if a man should sleep when he were in great danger,<note place="margin">See Ionah 1. 5.</note> the house
burning over their heads, or in an hideous Tempest, ready to be cast
away, but every natural man hangs as it were over the pit of Hell by a
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> twined threed. 6. It were strange if one should still sleep, having many
Messengers sent to awake him: Some will say, If any had called me,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:65522:355"/>
I would have awaked with all my heart; we are called by Sermon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sermon, by this Preacher, that Preacher, the other, &amp;c. to whom
the Lord will say, Did not I send you and you to awake such a man,
&amp;c. you are now come under the means of awakening; O that it
might please God to bless his Word, in piercing the ears of your soul
to this end: And be not half awaked, and afterward when you be
gone hence, fall asleep again; as a man in a deep sleep, being called
upon, he begins to stir, and lift up an eye, and it may be his head from
his pillow, but hearing no more, he lies down again, and falls again as
fast asleep as before; let it not be so with us. Some, I doubt not, begin
to think with themselves about awaking, and that it were good for
them so to do; but beware when you be gone hence, you lay not
your head down again, but come and hear again and again, till you
be soundly awakened, that you may not hereafter sleep any more; if
you be not awaked, you must perish for ever. A man would be loath
to dye in his Natural sleep, having gone well to bed, and thinking of
no such thing, yet this cannot hurt a good man; but to dye in the
Spiritual sleep is damnable. And I beseech you yong men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
be awakened betimes, defer no longer, the longer the worse:
Come to a man newly gone to bed, ye may easily awake him; come
an hour after, more hardly, but come at midnight, and then though
you call and shout, you can scarce awake him: Sleep not till your
middle age, you can hardly be awaked then, but if till your old age,
with exceeding difficulty, if at all. But of this also I have spoken
before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lyon, walketh about, seeking
whom he may devour.]</hi> A Reason of the forementioned Exhortation:
By yielding thereto we shall take away advantage from the Devil,
who else will draw us into manifold temptations: He is here described
by all things that make a dangerous Enemy; as Malice, called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Our adversary, the Devil;</hi> Strength, called therefore <hi>A Lyon,
A roaring Lyon;</hi> Subtilty, <hi>That he walketh about,</hi> seeketh by all ways
and means, as by violence and craft to draw us into evil; Diligence,
<hi>That he walketh about, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His malice is exceeding against God,<note place="margin">Satans malice exceeding great.</note> and man especially, Gods
people, and against all goodness: It hath been so from the beginning;
from his fall he was filled with malice against God, laboring by all
means, that no reasonable creature might praise him on earth: His
envy also against mankinde continueth, he is still a most deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against all goodness and means thereof, against good persons,
good duties, good meetings, the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. laboring to hinder these, and the good success of them;
as the good Angels are filled with love and zeal to God and goodness,
rejoycing at the conversion of a sinner; so is the Devil on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
yea, his malice is deadly, nothing will content him but our
blood, and destruction both of body and soul; therefore called
<hi>Satan, An Adversary, The Envyous man, The Accuser of the Brethren,
A Murtherer from the beginning;</hi> and because there is no man so vile,
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:65522:356"/>
but hath some reliques of humanity in him, he is compared to the
Beasts without reason, and so termed here <hi>A roaring Lyon,</hi> as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<hi>A red Dragon, &amp;c.</hi> he it is that first tempts, and then accuseth
us to God, and ready to be the executioner: Let him suck the blood
of never so many,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 12.</note> yet is not his malice the more satisfied; he hath
been so from the beginning, but now more by much, because his
time is but short.</p>
                  <p>Strength:<note place="margin">Satans strength.</note> He was strong by Creation, which though it be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
yet continueth it exceeding great: He can do marvellous
things, though no true miracles. Through Gods permission he were
able to do infinite mischief, see in <hi>Job,</hi> what havock he soon made;
his names declare it, <hi>The strong armed man, A Lyon,</hi> yea, <hi>A roaring
Lyon,</hi> his strength being doubled with hunger, <hi>A great red Dragon,
Principalities, Powers, &amp;c. Prince of this world,</hi> bearing a great sway,
and having many at his command; <hi>The God of this world,</hi> yea, that
doth almost what he list, and who in respect of mans power to resist,
hath as it were an Omnipotent strength to do what he list: And as he
is wonderful in strength, so he knows it well enough, and is audacious
and bold to put it out to the outmost; when he may (as to <hi>Job</hi>) he
wil set upon any the greatest and worthiest servants of God, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
foil them: He set upon <hi>David,</hi> a man according to Gods own
heart, and foiled him twice shamefully, and again got him to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the people: He winnowed <hi>Peter</hi> that was so couragious, he buffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Paul</hi> that valiant Champion; yea, he set upon our first Parents in
their innocency, when he had no great likelihood of prevailing; yea,
upon our Savior Christ himself, having no likelihood at all, and that
again, and again, and again; and when he had been so often foiled,
yet he departed from him but for a season, who no doubt was busie
with him in his passion in the garden.</p>
                  <p>Subtilty:<note place="margin">Satans subtilty</note> He was made exceeding wise by Creation, which is not
lost, but perverted and turned to evil; much hath been revealed to
him, and wonderful much he hath gotten by his almost 6000 years
experience, which would make a simple body wise, yet he hath not
an absolute knowledge; He knows not our thoughts and hearts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
nor things to come, but he can guess very shrewdly and nearly
at them by signs, and comparing things past with present, as at our
thoughts by observing our speeches, actions and desires; So at future
things, by knowing and seeing further into the nature of things, and
of mens bodies, then men can, but he is exceeding cunning to do evil
and compass his purpose; He was so at first, much more now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 3.</note> not a Tempter, but <hi>the Tempter,</hi> by way of excellency;
he that hath the Art and Trade of Tempting,<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 9.</note> that is the Master
thereof, all others learning of him: So the old Serpent, which was
subtile at first,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 1, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> but now much more; How cunningly dealt he with
<hi>Eve?</hi> 1. He goes to her, not to <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. When she was alone.
3. Pretends great good will. 4. Takes away the fear of all danger.
5. Tells her of great benefits which would come by eating of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit, yea, such a benefit as she most desired, and was most
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:65522:356"/>
fit to tempt her, she wanted nothing but to be as God, &amp;c. 6. He shews
her the beauty of the fruit, and how like it was to be good meat, and
so perverted her: So dealt he with our Savior Christ, when he had
fasted forty days,<note place="margin">Matth. 4. 2.</note> and was alone in the wilderness, then he tempts him
to trust; and not prevailing therein, to presume; wherein failing, he
propounds wealth and honor: So now, he tempts some to be Atheists,
and of no Religion; if not so, then to be of a false Religion; if not
so, then to be careless and idle professors of the true; if not so, but
that men will be somewhat careful, to read, hear, get knowledge, be
forward, then he labors to lift them up with pride, and blow them
out of the Church to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> make them too forward, &amp;c. yea,
some he will not leave there, but provoke them further, to be Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists,
nay Sebaptists, as Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who Baptized himself: If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tempt men to keep from Church, then will he go with them, to
hinder them from receiving any good there, and there bring them
asleep, if they be inclined that way; or if not, then fill their
heads with worldly thoughts; if not so, then he brings in good
thoughts of some good things, that at another time were good,
but now out of season, as thoughts of some other Sermon; so in
Prayer, he fills the head with odde and strange thoughts, or else with
thoughts of the Sermon, to keep them from lifting up their hearts
wholly to God: If he cannot keep men in presumption, but that they
be troubled about their estate, then he seeks to drown them in dispair:
Bad men he will incite to those evils they be most apt to; Civil men
he will keep in a coldness in Religion, and carelesness in the matters of
Salvation, as about the Word, Sacraments, Sabbath, Prayer; Good
men he will incite to do good things, but to ill ends, or if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
good ends to themselves, to compass them by unwarrantable
means; Thus is he a cunning fisher and fowler? He hath baits and
nets for all kindes, high and low, rich and poor, learned and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
men, women, yong, old, he will spread them, and so lay them, that
he will not lightly miss: He hath for every sex, age, constitution, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
state and condition; he will make his shraps of profits, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
or honors, and then get in some, especially of the fairest
marks, and set them up as a stall, and by both together tills in
many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diligence.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Satans Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> He will spare for no pains, he rests neither night nor
day, but goeth about continually; His occupation is to compass the
Earth: If he prevail not at one time, he will come again and again;
yea, he will not leave a man as long as he lives; and though there be
such an infinite number alive at once in the world, yet what with the
multitude of Devils, and with their most exceeding diligence, and
unwearied pains, no man is free: So that he is armed on all sides to do
mischief: If he were malicious and had no power, we might despise
him; if power and no malice, or but a little, we might the less fear
him; or if malice and strength, yet if he had no wit nor cunning,
there were much less danger, for he were as a Gyant without eyes,
one might keep out of his hands; or if he were all those, and yet
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:65522:357"/>
were lazy, and could take no pains, we might be free most what, but
put altogether: O Lord, who shall escape him?</p>
                  <p>1. No marvel that most men go the broad way,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and perish, and so
few be saved, seeing there is such an enemy, and so armed, and so
followed, that hath sworn all mens destruction; he so malicious, and
we so careless of our Salvation; he so strong, and we so weak; he so
subtile, and we so simple for our souls, and in Spiritual things; he
so diligent, and we so retchless and lazy in the great matters of our
soul. Every man by nature loveth sin, and carrieth along with him
as ready a disposition to yield to temptations, as Satan is to tempt him:
Marvel not that so few, but that any are saved; and if thou hast any
hope and assurance, wonder and praise: If God were not infinite
in wisdom, power, love and care over us, we should certainly perish.</p>
                  <p>2. See what wonderful need there is of diligent,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> continual, zealous,
earnest and plain preaching of the Word; its that must cast the strong
man out:<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> This is the mean to scale his walls, batter his Kingdom;
were it not for this, he would do what he list in the world, and carry
all to destruction: Where this is not, he may sit and sleep, for his
work and will goes forward; What should let? therefore its no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
he is such an Enemy to it, and the Preachers thereof. O what
should become of Gods people already pluckt out of his Kingdom,
if they had not the Word to shew his subtilties, what is the will of
God, what good, what evil, how to do it, what be the advantages
that Satan takes, and how we may be able to resist them? Hence
Gods servants are made wise, and strengthened against his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
they come weak to the Word, but go from thence mightily
strengthened: What do they then that seek the hinderance of the
faithful and zealous preaching of the Word, but gratifie the Devil
in an high degree, and work journey-work to him in the best maner;
its to learn the Devil to have his will, to devour what souls, and as
many as he lists.</p>
                  <p>3. We may wonder and praise God,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that seeing there be so many
Devils, and such as we have spoken of, that the Church of God can
be upon the face of the earth, that it is not rooted out and swallowed
up, the Devil having so many and such armed instruments in the
world: A wonder the Church hath any abiding, but that God
Almighty hath a care of it, and will defend and preserve it; Christ
Jesus the Husband thereof, will not suffer his Spouse to be trodden
under: We may wonder we be yet a people under this peace of the
Gospel, there being so many Papists within and without the Land;
and such an infinite number of most subtile and malicious Jesuits, that
like the Devil, go up and down compassing the earth to work mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief:
That poor weak men and women in themselves, sinful and
poor creatures, should yet be got out of Satans power, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
from his malice; not in body, goods and name onely, but
from his deadly temptations, and to escape them, and get safe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
O this is Gods Almighty power and goodness; so may every
poor Christian man say, and wonder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="671" facs="tcp:65522:357"/>
4. This rebuketh 1. Such as make a League with the Devil to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their purposes;<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> It was death by the Law of God,<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 18.</note> and so ought
to be still: What fools be these? They think the Devil serves them,
and is at their command, when indeed he hath got them to serve him,
and that in an high degree of sin to their destruction. 2. Such as seek
to such for things lost, or for cure from them, for them and theirs:
Those woful Creatures, seeking to the sworn Enemy of mankinde for
help, are like to speed, as if a Lamb should run to a roaring Lyon to be
kept from harm.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Think they that he will do them any little pleasure
outwardly, unless to fasten deadly on their souls to work the ruine
of them? His help is as the milk which <hi>Jael</hi> presented unto <hi>Sisera.</hi>
3. All such as live in sin, and so serve the Devil; These count him
not a deadly Enemy, if they did, they would not be at his beck, as
the most part be; Though they stop their ears against God, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
Magistrates, Friends, yet they open them to all his temptations;
no Servant can serve his Master so diligently, as the world doth the
Devil, even with all the might both of their bodies and mindes,
speaking, and writing, and employing both their goods and pains on
his behalf, and for sin, and that both night and day: What he bids
them do, they do, Lye, Swear, Curse, break the Sabbath, Oppress,
Cozen, Mock, &amp;c. who yet (for that their humor likes it, and its
agreeable to their own minde) observe not Satans policy herein, nor
suspect him for an Enemy: They will say, they hate the Devil as much
as any, and defie him; alas, he can give them leave so to do, as long
as they serve him, and do his works; This is as good as Popish holy
Water, and crossing themselves. 4. All civil persons that say they
never found the Devil so troublesom as they hear folks talk; They
never doubted of their Salvation, were ready to make away themselves,
were never troubled with such wicked and blasphemous or trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
thoughts, were never so troubled but that they could go to
Church, and serve God quietly, &amp;c. True, the Devil tempts them
not to dispair, because he hath them fast enough in pride and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:
He tempts them not to foul sins, because he sees God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
them, and so that there's no great likelihood he shall prevail,
neither cares he, seeing he hath them fast enough in the main; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in ignorance, unbelief, or carelesness of the first Table: He trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
them not with thoughts it may be when they go to good duties,
because he knows they are likely not to do any good duty; yet he
tempts them in things, which through blindeness they discern not,
as being none of the foulest things as they think: Though in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word they have many wandring by-thoughts, they feel not
that the Devil is at their elbow, and at work with them, because they
make no account of such smal things; also about worldly idle speeches
on the Sabbath, they see not Satan going along with them, because
they count them small, whereas a good Christian in these espies Satan,
and is troubled thereat: when the strong man hath and holds his Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
all things are at peace, the Devil having these fast enough, he
cares not for troubling them; but let him be about to be cast out, and
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:65522:358"/>
then Ile warrant you he will bestir himself, and they shall have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Let a civil man that lived never so quietly before, be smitten in
conscience for his sins, and begin to be converted, he shall finde his
case altered, and that the Devil will do him all the mischief he is able,
and this is a great deal better then before; and men should labor to
be at enmity with him, and must pray that the stronger man, even
Christ, would put him out of his possession.</p>
                  <p>5. This should rowze up the servants of God out of security and
intemperance:<note place="margin">Use 5.</note> Have they need to be drunk with the world, or be
asleep, having such an Enemy? ought they not rather to be sober,
and continually to watch to save themselves from his deadly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p>Against his malice let us have Christian resolution, and earnestness
to seek after salvation.</p>
                  <p>Against his power let us set the power of God, and be strong in his
might, craving his assistance continually, for we have no power of
our selves; he that should trust to himself, should speed as this our
Apostle; we must always have recourse to God, saying with <hi>David,
God is my Castle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Rock, Tower of Defence, in him will I trust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against his subtilty,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note> let us labor to be wise in the Word of God,
read, hear, meditate, confer, that it may dwell plentifully in our
hearts in all wisdom, and labor for the wisdom of the Spirit of God,
that thereby we may spy Satans subtilties, and be holpen to avoid
them; and let us have the fear of God always in our hearts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes, which is true wisdom: Through this alone we avoid
Satans snares, and are not ignorant of his wiles; who so <hi>Achitophel</hi>
like, think by worldly policy to resist the Devil, the Devil will make
fools of them, and ensnare them at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Against his diligence, let us be as diligent and watchful; we must
not be weary, or give over our watch at any time, if we do, we must
prepare our throats for destruction; Satan gives no truce. Not a few
Christians have no such fear of this enemy as they should, neither do
they furnish themselves against him as they should, but are careless,
silly and negligent. Hereby it comes to pass that the Devil hath his
will too much, and too often of us, and catcheth us here and there;
as to neglect one duty, to do another untowardly, and to fall into this
or that evil, and so makes us to dishonor God, to wound our own
consciences, and to give ill example to others: If we had a bodily
Enemy thus armed, how would we fear? If there were a great Lyon
in our fields, and which did haunt our grounds, how afraid would
we be? but there's a roaring Lyon, a red Dragon, an old Serpent, lies
in wait for us, who may do us more mischief then all the Lyons, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
or Serpents in the world, and yet we are careless. Here he is
not thus fearfully described to discourage us, or make us cast away
all our weapons, as though there were no resisting, but to watch and
be careful; and then, though he be as he is, we may be preserved from
his anger; for though he be malicious, yet God is most merciful and
careful for us: Though he be strong, yet God is stronger: His power
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:65522:358"/>
is limited, he cannot do what he will to the godly (as to <hi>Job</hi>) nay, not
to reprobates, as to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Devils had leave, before they
could do their feats, nay, till they had leave they could not enter into
the Swine: And though he be so subtile, yet the wisdom of God is
far beyond his craft to catch him in it, as he hath done many a time; as
in the fall of our first Parents, he thought the same should have been
to Gods utter dishonor, and that he should not have a Creature on
earth to serve him, which yet turned to Gods greater glory; the like
might be instanced about the death of Christ: So he can turn his
temptations to nothing, to folly, to our greater good: And though he
be diligent,<note place="margin">Psal. 121. 4.</note> yet have we a God that keepeth Israel, who neither slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
nor sleeps.<note place="margin">Rev. 5. 5.</note> The Devil is a Lyon, but we have a Lyon of the tribe
<hi>Judah</hi> to fight against him: He is strong, but God is stronger then
all; they be innumerable, but God is greater then all together; and
to help our weakness, we have the good Angels to take our part, more
with us then be against us: He is a Spirit, but the Spirit of God is in
us more active, nimble and wise then he; we have no cause therefore
to be dismaid: Let us hold our Faith, Hope and Confidence, and go
on in a godly course, and in the end we shall get to Heaven. Praised
be God, praised be God alone: To God onely be glory for
this.</p>

                  <p>1. We have a warrant and command for this.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 2. We promised so
to do in our Baptism. 3. If we resist not, we can never come into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

<pb n="674" facs="tcp:65522:359"/>
it were a disgrace to him if we should be overcome; nay, most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that no Soldier of Christ Jesus, resisting by the armor of
his appointing, can ever be finally or wholly vanquished.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh all those that resist not Satan at all,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> or as they
ought; as 1. The prophane sort that live in sin; these resist not, but
rather serve the Devil: They resist God, his Word, the Spirit, good
Counsel, all the means which are used to draw them from their sins;
but Satans temptations (as serving their humor) they resist not; this
is the cause that Hell is so full: If the Devil perswade them to any
evil, they are as ready to yield, as he to tempt. 2. Civil persons, they
resist not the Devil, as conceiving their case to be good enough, for
that they are not (as they conceive) so bad as others, though to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
all duties in their families, and towards their souls, and to pass
the Sabbath in worldly talk, and to be little at the Sacrament, or
without any preparation, be frequent with them. 3. Hypocrites,
who though they resist him in some things, yet in others yield, which
is enough to their destruction. 4. Backsliders, that resisted him a while,
and seemed to be wel minded, &amp; to be sorry for time past, &amp; were fully
purposed to take a new course, and seemed so to do for a time, that yet
afterward returned to their old vomit, and yielded to his wil and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
as they did before: This resisting was nothing, unless they had
so continued to the end, and until they had overcome; for not they
that make a flourish, and strike a few blows, and then flie or yield
themselves to the Enemy, shall be crowned: O let all such repent of
their baseness, and yielding themselves into the Devils hands, and
to his temptations, as also of their breach of promise in Baptism; and
for the time to come, let them learn to know what is the will of God,
and which be Satans temptations, and resist the same, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
and in all things; so shall the second death have no power over
them, but they shall conquer here, and be crowned eternally hereafter.</p>
                  <p>2. This reproveth weak Christians,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> yea, sometimes even them
who have well profited, and yet will shew themselves weak in this,
that if the Devil have any temptations against them, telling them
they be hypocrites, and that they shall not be pardoned, their sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so great, and their hearts to sinful, what do they but consent, and
say as he saith, against themselves, and so yield; what a folly is this?
Is not the Devil adversary enough, but that you must also be an enemy
to your selves? and do you know its the Devil, who is a lyar, and
yet suffer your selves to be carried away by him, and say as he saith? a
murtherer, and yet yield to him? fie upon it, you ought to resist, &amp; have
recourse to your friends for aid; even seek unto God by prayer, search
the promises laid down in the Word, listen to good counsel, &amp;c. yea,
when a man hath spent a good time in laboring to comfort them by
the Word, they yet are at the same stay, and yield more to a temptation
which is a lye, then to all that can be said against it; also, many and most
Christians, alas, how little do they resist? how often do they yield?
If he tempt them to lay aside prayer for trifles, or to keep them from
the Word, there being this or that to do, how quickly do they yield?
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:65522:359"/>
Many also are so filly, that they see not one of ten of Satans tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and are so careless, that they fear them not: Thus sometimes
they omit good duties, sometimes marre a good duty in the doing, are
sometimes overcome in small things: What if they be not great
things? The least sins be against God, hurt our souls, hinder our
peace, make our comfort the less. If Satan come with some great
thing, we fear, and look about us, he would wound us at the heart;
but would we be willing to be hurt in the leg or arm? we must not
yield at any time, in any thing, how small soever, but manfully and
constantly stand in opposition.</p>

                     <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> A Reason to perswade us to
resist the Devil, and not to be discouraged, because its not our case
alone to be tempted and molested by Satan and his Instruments, but
of all the Servants of God every where: Satan spiteth not some few,
though he doth them most, which most oppose him, but he hateth
and seeketh to mischief all the Servants of God whatsoever: As <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
pursued not some few of the Israelites, but all of them, to fetch
them back again; so doth the Devil set himself against all the Israel
of God: There's enmity between the seed of the Woman, and the
seed of the Serpent; He set upon <hi>David,</hi> resisted <hi>Jeshua,</hi> &amp;c. tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth
all,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 12.</note> spares none: <hi>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
persecution:</hi> There's none so tempted, but others have met with
the like; Thus will the Lord have all to be humbled, thus prove
them, thus set their graces on work, yea, thus encrease grace in
them.</p>
                  <p>We must therefore be the more comfortable,<note place="margin">Use.</note> seeing we have so
many, and such Companions, would we go to Heaven an easier way
then all the Servants of God have gone? we are well if we go the
same Sanctified way; And as we go in no harder way then others, so
we must not look to have a soft and fine way strewed out for us alone,
this were too much daintiness. True, it is the Devil that will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us, and we are ready to think no bodies case like ours: O I have
had such temptations. That there is no God, that the Scriptures
be false, innumerable blasphemous thoughts! so to rebel against God,
to hurt my self, &amp;c. O be not discouraged, others of Gods Servants
have met with all these: So we are ready to think our pain, or cross,
or kinde of life, to be more painful then any others, whereas it is
nothing so; and this the Devil perswades to, that we might conceive
that God hath pickt us out for his Enemies, and so might move us to
distrust, and put us out of comfort.</p>

of it, as to be heartened by it: Its one thing to know a thing, another
to be able to apply it, and make use of it, according to our need: The

yet they make no use of their lives, and live as if they knew no
such thing, whose knowledge doth but procure them the more

onely, but to labor and work upon the dull affections, and to bridle
the unruly lusts of the heart, and bring them to stoop: If people
could make use and apply a thing as soon as they knew it, a Ministers

into the peoples hearts, and to work a love to that they know is good,

prayeth for them whom he hath taught, and desires an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
blessing upon that he hath written to them: Thereafter he
commendeth to them his Epistle, and lays down the sum of it, next
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:65522:361"/>
sends his salutations, then wisheth them to love each other, and testifie
the same, &amp; lastly with a short prayer for them, takes his leave of them.</p>
                  <p>In this Verse he prays for them, even that God would daily increase
them in all grace toward perfection, and at last perfect them, after
the few afflictions that he hath here appointed them to go through;
and in the mean time, that he would confirm, strengthen and stablish
them in knowledge, obedience and faith, that they might not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
nor shaken through their troubles, from their good beginnings.
Hereof also he rendreth some Reasons, 1. Because he of whom he
begs the same, is the God and Author of all grace; not of every
kinde of grace onely, but of every measure of grace. 2. He hath already
shewed them mercy, and bestowed grace on them, and called them out
of the world, and from their corrupt estate of blindeness, unbelief, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
to the knowledge, faith &amp; obedience of the gospel, &amp; of Jesus
Christ, therefore he will go on and finish his work: And in this 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are sundry others couched; as that he hath called them to his etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
glory, &amp; therefore wil not leave them in the mid way; that he hath
called them in Christ, and therefore that its firm &amp; fast, and cannot be
shaken; so that this is a most excellent and sweet comfortable prayer,
worthy to be remembred of us all,<note place="margin">Note.</note> &amp; laid up with us for ever. Herewith
a couple of ancient good Christians (that I knew, and who were as full
of troubles, and as deeply tryed as ever I knew any) did wonderfully
comfort themselves, and were so affected therewith, as I never visited
them (as I did often) either together, or when God sundred them, but
they had this in minde, and would utter it so feelingly, as they declared
themselves much sustained thereby.</p>
                  <p>From the coherence, in that the Apostle prayeth for the people,
and for a blessing on that he had taught them, note, That</p>
                  <p>Its the duty of Gods faithful Ministers,<note place="margin">Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters must fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Salvation by all means.</note> to seek to advance and
further the Salvation of Gods people by all means: Thus must they
do by Preaching, Example, Prayer, &amp;c. Thus did <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,
Ezra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 6. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Apostles, &amp;c. so ought we for the gathering of
more to God, for the edification of those that be won, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the feeble, the rowzing up of the drowsie, the reformation of
what is amiss, the daily encrease of that that is good: This is no
small forwarding of the work, of no small avail with God: Thus
shall we manifest our zeal to the glory of God, our unfained and
hearty love to the peoples souls, and this will be for our own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
that we may have boldness and a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon people must do for their Ministers,<note place="margin">Use.</note> both for love to him,
and to requite like for like, and for their own benefit, for encrease of
knowlede in the Word of God, Wisdom, Zeal, Love, Patience, and
all graces that may tend to further the work of Salvation in them, the
fruit whereof shall redound to them; for according as the Minister
is, much after are the people, and for direction and assistance every
time he is to preach to them: This no doubt is much neglected on both
hands; and the Ministery of the Word must be followed with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
for the success thereof depends upon Gods blessing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:65522:362"/>
is to be obtained by hearty prayer: It depends not on the Preacher,
if he could speak with the tongue of men and Angels, he could not
of himself open the eyes or convert the soul: The Apostles had
power to work miracles, to heal the sick, cast out Devils, &amp;c. but to
convert the soul,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 6.</note> that God reserved ever in his own hands: Paul <hi>may
plant, and</hi> Apollos <hi>water, but God giveth the encrease:</hi> The best Preacher
in the world cannot with all his skill, grace and pains, change the
heart of his wife, sons, daughters, or dearest friends. True, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
may help or hinder by the maner of his preaching and living, as
if he Preach ignorantly, confusedly, coldly, or mingle unsavory and
galling speeches, or live badly, he may hinder the likelihood of good
by the word; and if a Minister preach understandingly, orderly, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
zealously, and live thereafter, he provides the medicine the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and more fit to work, yet he cannot convert a soul; If we meet
with any speeches sounding that way,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> as to <hi>Timothy, Thou shalt both save
thy self and others,</hi> &amp;c. we are to understand them to be meant instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally:<note place="margin">See also Acts 26. 18.</note>
The work is the Lords, and above all created power, yet
a greater work it is, then the making of the world: Nor doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on any hearer, be he of what wit, memory, dexterity, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
soever, for even such have long lived under the Ministery, and
yet are as far from conversion as ever; we are by nature blinde, dead
in sin, not onely not apt to any good, but full of Rebellion: See <hi>Deut.
29. 4. Jer. 24. 7. Acts</hi> 11. 21. and 16. 14. Therefore the success of
the Word depends on blessing, which is to be sought by humble and
hearty Prayer, the same being all in all.</p>
                  <p>Its a good sign in the Minister that he hath a desire his Ministery
should prosper; when he is not content to Preach onely, but follow
it with Prayer.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As women having set herbs or sown seeds in a dry
ground, following them with the watering Pot, have a minde they
should grow; and as we sow not our seeds in the field, but we ask Gods
blessing thereon, so much more should we on this precious seed: Thus
shall it appear that they trust not in themselves, and that they are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
that their Preaching should not be in vain.</p>
                  <p>So ought the people; for the blessing of the Word, namely, the
fruit of it is all in all; what though we hear never so much, if the same
be not made effectual to us, the threats to humble us, the promises to
comfort and quicken us, the sins forbidden to bring us into an hatred
of them, and love of the contrary duties, and we be so altered by that
we are: This is the end of all; See <hi>Jonah 3. 5, 6, &amp;c. Acts 2. 37.
1 Cor.</hi> 14. 25. Therefore they should, as pray earnestly before that the
Word may be made of force and efficacy; so afterwards must their
mindes run on the things delivered, and their Prayers in their Families
by themselves, relish of the same: But what neglect is there this way?
How few pray before, and how many after they have heard, suffer
worldly business or pleasures to put out the same? Oh! there is no
such care that this precious seed should take root and fructifie; we
complain of our bad crops, but not of this, yet here there's not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        </gap> of all grace.</note> He is so called of the effect, because he is the
Author and Giver of all grace; he is the Author of all that may be
called good, which may be divided into gifts and graces in this world;
gifts of all kindes, as of body, minde, &amp;c. In him we live, he makes
the Sun shine on us, &amp;c. also gifts of health, strength, beauty; so of
the minde,<note place="margin">See Exod. 31.</note> as natural vertues, also gifts to rule Kingdoms, as to <hi>Saul;</hi>
so of Trades, Arts, Sciences, nay, of gifts yet higher then those, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
understanding of the Scripture, Prophesie, Prayer; yea extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
too, as of miracles: So is he also of graces, which are such
as accompany Salvation, and he bestoweth onely on his Elect, as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
knowledge,<note place="margin">Rom 15. 13. and 16. 20.</note> faith, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost,
repentance, love, meekness, patience, &amp;c.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 3.</note> Hence it is that sometimes
he is termed the God of hope, sometimes the God of peace, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the God of all comfort, so here the God of all grace: He gives
every good gift and grace, and not that onely, but every measure of
every grace,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 16.</note> the beginning, continuing, and finishing grace: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
grace is in Saint or Angel,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 7.</note> is the gift of God, either by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to the Angels and <hi>Adam,</hi> or sin by restitution: What grace
is in any man alive, of what kinde or measure soever, is onely of
God, for we are so far from having any of our selves, that we
have nothing but the quite contrary, even Opposition and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
none else ever did, or can give grace: The best Parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
convey grace into their Children by generation; nor can the
best Minister into any by preaching or counsel, God alone is the giver
hereof.</p>
                  <p>1. Every one that hath grace,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> in what measure soever, must be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and thankful, acknowledging the same to be onely from God, and
giving him the praise thereof: O be exceeding thankful for it, that
he hath given it to thee, denying it to most; and to thee, as unfit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
grace, as the worst in the world, and who didst no better deserve
it, then they that shall never have it; and especially be thankful for it
for the worth thereof, one dram of grace is of more worth then the
whole world, its the quintescence of Gods favor, and like Pearls of
great value in a little room. A true humble heart in the sight of thy
misery, a little true faith in Christ, and Sanctification, with an hatred
of all sin, and care to please God in all things, is worth a Kings Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
and an honest upright heart, careful to be be ruled by that it
knows, is better then all knowledge without this.</p>
                  <p>2. Every one that is without it,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> must endeavor for it: Whether
goeth a woman with her pot or pail for water, but to the Fountain? so
must thou have recourse unto God; there is grace enough in him, and
he hath it to bestow, and its his honor so to do: But how shall we
come by it, the Well is deep? God hath opened the Fountain of his
grace in Christ Jesus, and conveys grace by the Conduits of the
Word, Sacraments, Prayer, &amp;c. so that its not lockt up in Heaven;
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:65522:363"/>
wouldest thou therefore have thine heart humbled and broken, God
can do the same, come to him, wait on him in his word for it? would'st
thou believe thy sins are pardoned through Christ? would'st thou be
changed, and have thy heart altered to hate every sin, to love what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is good? would'st thou have grace against thy strongest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
that thou could'st never master, and do duties to thy think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impossible, as to love thine Enemies, abide persecution for the
Truth, &amp;c? come to him in the same word, and by prayer; he can do
these things for thee: Why then is the world so graceless, seeing there
is abundance in God?<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 6.</note> Its because men see not their emptiness of grace,
and know not the worth thereof: They desire Health, Wealth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
Pleasure, true grace they regard not, prize not: O that men did
see themselves woful naked Creatures, without grace! They would
not then content themselves with any shadow of grace, hearing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
a little restraint, some few gifts, &amp;c. but labor indeed for
grace.</p>
                  <p>3. The Servants of God that have obtained some measure of grace
already,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> should be provoked still to wait upon God for increase, for he
gives all grace, the last, as well as the first and the middle: According
therefore to our proceeding, let us beg fitting grace of God; Why,
are there all kindes and measures of grace in God, and we have so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle?
we beg not earnestly, we open not our mouth wide, that God
might fill it, we have not hunger-bitten hearts, we prize not
grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who hath called us,]</hi> Another Reason to perswade himself and them,
that they should obtain this request of being confirmed to the end, even
because God had already begun with them, and called them, that is,
had pulled them out of the state of ignorance, unbelief, impenitency,
into the state of grace, knowledge, repentance, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Whom God means to save,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> he calls them out of their sinful state
to grace;<note place="margin">Whom God will save, those he doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually call.</note> There's an outward calling, and there's an inward calling:
This last, through the operation of the Spirit going along with the
outward means, is made effectual, as to <hi>Lydia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This stands in three things, enlightning the understanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
opening the heart to believe, and changing the whole man from
that it was before; not onely he calls them, but awakens them; not
onely invites them to come, but gives them an heart to come: of this
you may read <hi>Rom. 8. 30. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 15. This is proper to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and is the work of God, none else can do it; without this there's
no Salvation, as those that have this shall be certainly saved, this being
a mark of their Election past, 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 10. and of their glory to come,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.</p>
                  <p>Let every man examine himself,<note place="margin">Use.</note> whether he be effectually called
(heretofore I have laid down the marks hereof) if thou findest thou
art, then be of good comfort: Be thankful, for that God hath called
thee, leaving others, there being no more worth or aptness in thee
then in them; and study how to walk worthy of this high and holy
calling, even in all zealous and godly conversation, not fashioning our
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:65522:363"/>
selves like unto the world, from which we be called, but differing as
much in our behavior, as we hope to do in our end, not defiling our
selves with any evil, not yielding to our lusts, not doing any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming
our holy calling; but as he is a holy God that hath called
us, and its an holy Gospel whereby we are called, so we may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in all maner of conversation:<note place="margin">Eph 1. 4.</note> This is the end, as of our Election
and Redemption;<note place="margin">Luke 1. 75.</note> so of our calling:<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note> So that we must not serve God
coldly, who hath singled us out from the world, but look we be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
persons, a peculiar people to him.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, if our hearts tell us, that we be not effectually
called, then is our case bad: Gods callings, which we have not
obeyed, will be accusations against us. O how few be truly called?
most hold on in a prophane and bad course; others having reformed
some things, and thereupon counted themselves in a good estate, nay,
given some good hopes, yet have after fallen shamefully; some to
the world, some to open prophaneness, for there is no stay of a man
till he be effectually called: O then entreat God now to work on your
hearts, you know not whether you shall ever be called more or not:
<hi>To day if ye will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts;</hi> listen to Gods
voyce, call upon him to open thine eyes, and change thine heart.
When thou comest to the Word, pray, O Lord, strike that stroke that

                  <p>Now in that the Apostle useth this as an Argument, that the Lord

as our Election, so also our effectual calling.</p>
                  <p>1. Its therefore not from any merit of ours,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> but for Christs sake
that we are called;<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> we must not be proud of our selves, but thankful

                     <hi>After that ye have suffered a while,]</hi> He prays that God would make
them perfect, &amp;c. but in the due time, even when they had passed
the few afflictions and tryals he had appointed. Here note,</p>
                  <p>1. That we must go through troubles,<note place="margin">Gods children must here suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, before they can partake of heaven.</note> ere we come to our perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Heaven. There's a time for all things; a time for Soldiers to
fight, and a time for them to rest and enjoy the spoil after victory:
The cross is the Christians companion. Many are the troubles of the
Righteous,<note place="margin">Psal. 34.</note> and we must look for such in this world: It hath been
the Kings-road and High way to Heaven,<note place="margin">Iohn 16. 33.</note> that sanctified way,<note place="margin">Acts 14. 22.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
from <hi>Abel</hi> until this time,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 12.</note> all Gods Worthies (the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apostles,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> Christ himself, &amp;c.) have walked: Neither is this
without cause, for afflictions serve to humble us for sins past, and
fetch us from wandring (as the Shepherds dogs doth the sheep) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>David</hi> had experience,<note place="margin">Iob 33. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.<note place="margin">Isa. 27. 9.</note> and 119. They serve also to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
our lusts, tame our pride, subdue and kil our rebellious old man,
helping us against it, which would else be too strong for us; so to hold
us in compass when we be well, as an hedge of thorns. Children must
be washed and made clean,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> though they cry, so must we from our
sins; and as they by mustard, or the like, must be weaned from the
dug, so must we by afflictions from the world, which we love too
well; and as as there were no rule with children without the rod, so
would we be unruly, were it not for afflictions: They also make us
heavenly minded, and hereby our Faith, Patience, and such other
graces are tryed, as whether we have such or not, whether more or
less then we thought; yea, they serve to purifie and encrease that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
we have, for as standing waters gather mud, and bodies without
exercise wax unhealthful, so but for afflictions we should be in a bad
case. Hereby grace is made more active and fruitful, as the vine is
by pruning.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore we must be content to go this way to heaven,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and
glad to: We must not think to have a new way strewed and paved,
and covered, as it were, with carpets, when as the other Worthies of
the Lord have waded to the ankles in blood.</p>
                  <p>2. How can they that give themselves to all jollity,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and put away
all hearts grief, and do wholly give themselves to profits, pleasures,
feasting, &amp;c. How can these, I say, think they are going to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
They will have their will here, whatsoever befal them
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>3. If any should hereupon doubt that they are not in the way to
Heaven,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> because they have no troubles, &amp;c. What, have you no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
Are you not troubled with a rebellious and sinful heart? and
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:65522:364"/>
fight you not with Principalities and Powers, and Temptations, that
make you cry our sometimes, <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c? and do
you never meet with ill tongues for the profession of the truth? you
do: Then are not you without troubles, though it may be you have
not had so great troubles as some: Well, thank God, and use prosperity
well, and store your selves with grace against troubles come; It may
be God hath spared you hithertil, because you are old vessels, too weak
for new wine, in time you shall be met with. Besides, all are not in
trouble at once; neither our whole life troubles, but God gives many
breathings: Therefore discourage not your selves, neither pray for
troubles, God knows what is best, we know not how fit we should be
to bear them.</p>
                  <p>2. That the afflictions of Gods Children are but small;<note place="margin">The afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods children are small.</note> They are
so in respect of quantity and continuance, not so in respect of us, or
of our strength; for small ones would be too great for us, if God did
not assist us, and they be small in respect of that we have deserved
Hell torments, or the joys of Heaven we be called to. Alas, they
are not a flea-biting that any of Gods children endure here,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 18.</note> to that they
deserved,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> and the wicked shall suffer in Hell, nor to be compared to
the least part of the joys of Heaven. And for the continuance, our
life is but short, a span long, and in it we have many respices; See
<hi>Psal. 30. 5. Isaiah</hi> 17. 14. and 54. What are sixty years to Eternity?
as a drop of water to the whole Sea, as a Mote in the Sun to a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:<note place="margin">Isa. 4. 5.</note>
God moderates the afflictions of his Servants; if he deal with
his Enemies he lays it on, let them bear it if they can, if they cannot,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 10,</note>
choose them, as <hi>Judas:</hi> The just time is set down for the godlies trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
It shall not be as we will, nor as the Devil and his Instruments
will; If as we would, then should they be so small, as we should be
never the better; If as they, we should be spoiled: God will rule
the matter, it shall be neither too much nor too little, but just enough
for our best good.</p>
                  <p>We should praise God for his mercy and goodness,<note place="margin">Use.</note> that respects
our weakness thus, and hath delivered us from the eternal torments
we had deserved, and turned them into a few merciful afflictions for
our good: If they press us any thing hard, then they are but short and
small, and laboring for a good measure of faith, they will be the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler?
They are nothing to that we have deserved: Turn thine eyes
downward to the torments of Hell, then lift up thy thoughts to the
joys of Heaven, these will make us account them but small, and bear
them quietly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Make you perfect,]</hi> That is, lead you on daily towards perfection
more and more; perfect is taken in two sences in Scripture, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
that hath perfection of parts and absolute, which is perfect also
in degrees and measure; for parts, as a childe new born, so is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
in his first conversion:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 9.</note> Absolute none can be here,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> aym at it and

namely, they that have well profited in respect of novices.</p>
                  <p>We must labor to grow forward daily, and forgeting what we

have attained,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 1.</note> run forward as they in a race: we must neither be so
proud,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 3.</note> as to think we are perfect by and by (as some in their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do, not knowing they are but babes) nor yet so lazy, as to content
our selves with any measure, how small soever, but joyn measure to
measure (as a covetous man doth house to house) coveting Spiritual
gifts, and growing in grace more and more; what man is content if
he have but from hand to mouth, and scant that to live on, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
rather a little elbow room, and to have a competency to live in
some good handsom fashion, and to have for himself and his friends,
and wherewith also to relieve the needy? and wiltst thou rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with any measure of grace, especially having the means of
growing?</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes them that be grown worse:<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> O fearful! either
they never began in truth, nor laid a good foundation, which is most
to be feared (whom therefore it now concerneth to begin right and lay
sure, for better begin twice, then perish once) or if they did, then it
much concerns them to repent and amend,<note place="margin">Rev. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>2. It rebukes such as stand at a stay,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> like an Apple-tree in a cold
clay ground; that lives, and it may be every year bears two or three
shrunk Apples, but shoots not out her branches, nor bears plenty of
good fair fruit as we desire; what's the reason? when we see a Beast
in good Pasture, which hath not cast the old coat, we say its surfeit, it
must have a drink; so are these surfeit with the love of the world, then
which there is no greater bane to godliness: Its like a great high Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
that will suffer no tender plant to grow thereby or thrive; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reason may be, for that they compare themselves with them that
have less, or nothing in them; another, for that they neglect the
means, or live under lean means, or they use the means carelesly, What
a shame is this? we might have with care attained a far greater measure,
so as our worst time might have been as good as our best was wont, as
it proves with thrifty persons, who through Gods blessing come to
have better fare any day, then they had at first on their best day: If a
man should have an Apprentice many years, and he be worse and
worse, or learn nothing, what would he say? were he likely to attain
skill in his Trade? If God should call most of us to an account, alas,
we have but small skill in the trade of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>3. It may comfort those that desire to grow forward and use the
means carefully,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> and mourn that they can do no better, and grow so
poorly, surely they are like to thrive apace.</p>

                     <hi>Stablish, strengthen, settle you,]</hi> Here he prays for their perseverance.
Hence note, That</p>

other.</p>
                  <p>Use all means diligently to this end,<note place="margin">Use.</note> and pray earnestly to God, for
we shall have many opposites: Confirm your judgements in the truth,

you in your good course and godly conversation: we shall meet with
subtile deceivers, that will seek to ensnare and withdraw us, as the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi>
were misled,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note> and those mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 10. They of the
Separation trouble many honest people of a tender conscience, and in
their first love, and yet have not sufficient knowledge to try what they
say, but come with a great colour of zeal: Its a great trouble to be
distracted in minde, therefore use the means, resort to those whose
Ministery God hath blessed to convert your souls: And is not the
Church and Gospel as well able, and as like to confirm you, as it hath
been to beget you to the faith: Let us take heed of being removed from
our Faith, either in general or in particular; let us take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shaken and put from our good course, and drawn into evil through
prosperity, or of being choked by preferment, or daunted by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

out to the end, considering what man is in himself, what the Devil,
what the World, &amp;c. but though we be subject to fall away every
hour, and if we should compare our selves with the oppositions of
our Spiritual Enemies, we might even utterly despair, yet we are in

                  <p>ANother part of the conclusion, namely, A commendation of his
Epistle: 1. From the Messenger he sends it by, <hi>Silvanus,</hi> whom
he commends for a faithful Christian and Minister, and one that loved
them well, and was careful for them, as he was perswaded, and saw
cause to move him so to think. 2. He sets down the sum of his
Epistle, consisting of two parts: 1. His testifying by infallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
That that was the true Religion and way of Salvation, which
they believed and yet stood in; though there were other false Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
yet was this the onely true Religion. 2. His exhorting of
them earnestly, not to suffer themselves to be removed from the same
by any means whatsoever; so that he wrote not about trifles, but
about the main, namely, To signifie and prove to them the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to perswade them to constancy therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Silvanus,]</hi> The Apostles had some to attend them, and assist
them to write and send to the Churches; not for pomp, but necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
use and furthering of the work: This grew after to pomp and state
under Popery; but pomp and state beseems not the Ministers of the
Gospel, howsoever, its meet that they should have necessary fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance.</p>
                  <p>He sends this Epistle by this <hi>Silvanus,</hi> whom he so highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
he pickt him out of purpose; for he would not commend
such a jewel, a prime piece of the Churches treasure, to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

therein, and preach out of it to them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A faithful Brother,]</hi> He was a good and faithful Christian, and a
faithful Brother in the Ministry, good both in his general and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

&amp;c. and he that is no good Magistrate, &amp;c. is no good Christian: In
that the Apostle gives him such a good commendation,</p>

they might resort again and again at their pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Hence I might speak of the profitableness of writing Epistles,<note place="margin">The profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of writing Epistles.</note> how
much good Gods servants may do to each other being absent, by
Prayers, by Letters: How much good hath been done by the Letters
of the Fathers, and of godly men in latter times, as of <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi>
the Martyrs, &amp;c. who knoweth not? what a fault is it that its no more
used, as Parents to their Children being absent, friends to friends,
&amp;c. whereas wanton Letters, and Letters about worldly businesses
are frequent enough.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Written]</hi> Thus God moved the hearts of his Servants, and assisted
them extraordinarily to pen the parts of holy Scripture: O what a
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:65522:367"/>
a benefit it is that we have the whole, and most holy Word of God
written and before us, and how should we in token of thankfulness be
exercised therein? But most busie their heads with other matters,
namely, Their worldly profits and pleasures, fools bables, in the
mean time little using or regarding the Bible.</p>

                     <hi>Briefly,]</hi> 1. Because he would have them the oftner in it, and take
the more delight to read it over. 2. Because he sent <hi>Silvanus</hi> to open
and unfold it at large,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 22.</note> by preaching out of it, and making applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof for their good.</p>
                  <p>Here see how God in his infinite wisdom hath provided us his
Word,<note place="margin">Gods wisdom in providing for us his Word, and goodness in ordaining Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reveal unto us his will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note> wherein is all his minde, and that in few words, to provoke
us to be exercised therein; for if the Word had been written as large
as we had need for our understanding, the world could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the books that must have been written; but the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
his will briefly, laid down much in few words; yet for our
further benefit, God hath Ordained the Ministery of his Word, and
given gifts to men to preach it, expound it, apply it to every bodies
use, so that both together do most happily: How should God have
provided better for us? If therefore people profit not, their answer
must be heavy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhorting and testifying, &amp;c.]</hi> These words afford sundry
points; as</p>
                  <p>1. In that the Apostle testifieth by sound Arguments that they were
in the right way,<note place="margin">People must particularly know that the Religion they profess is the truth of God.</note> note, that</p>
                  <p>Its needful for every one to know and be well assured of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
he professeth, that it is the truth of God, for there be many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
yet but one truth, miss that and perish; we must not go by
guess in our Religion: Its not enough that we have the true Religion,
except we know it to be so, <hi>that we be not wavering, and carried about
with every wind of contrary Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes those that take occasion,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> because there be so many
Religions, therefore they will meddle with none, but take their ease,
and tarry till all agree.</p>
                  <p>2. It rebukes those that profess a Religion,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as all do, but know
not whether it be truth or not, but believe as the Church believes, as
they be told, but have no ground from the Word for the same:
Turks may not, its death to question about their Religion; Papists
may not, especially the Laity, who are forbid to read the Bible, or
any good Book that way, but we may; yet how do the most in this
Land profess the Gospel, which by Gods goodness is the truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?
alas, how few know and are able to prove it?</p>
                  <p>3. As its our duty to testifie and prove our Religion,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> to be the
onely true way of Salvation; so its yours to know and acknowledge
it, that if an Angel should come and inform you otherwise, you
might not give ear to him.</p>
                  <p>2. In that the Apostle thought it not enough to prove to them that
that was the true Religion they were in,<note place="margin">Christians must persevere in the truth.</note> but exhorted them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
constant in the same, note, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="691" facs="tcp:65522:367"/>
They that know the truth, ought so highly to esteem it, and be
so thankful to God for it,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 23.</note> as they never suffer themselves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
therefrom, whether for hope of gain, or fear of trouble, &amp;c.
we must buy the truth, not sell it. The Martyrs would rather lose
their lives then the truth; if we let that go, we lose our Souls.</p>
                  <p>3. In that the Apostle takes such care and pains with those Jews
that now stood in the truth, to hold them therein, we may note, that</p>
                  <p>Its an hard matter for those to hold out stedfast,<note place="margin">Constancy in well-doing difficult.</note> that have begun to
do well, for our heart is deceitful, the Devil is subtile and strong,
and there are also many Seducers, many baits, many discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What are they then that say,<note place="margin">Use.</note> there's too much Preaching and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
They know nothing that belongs to true Christianity. A little
means may serve to keep men in a loose, carnal, and prophane course,
but to keep us in a good course, there must be <hi>precept upon precept, line
upon line, &amp;c.</hi> and all little enough.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Ministers ought to continue with all diligence, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to gain home more, but even to hold on and confirm them that be
gained, that they fall not away into error, sin and security, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have also need to use all good means to this end.</p>
                  <p>4. In that his Epistle consisteth in testifying by sound reasons, for
the confirmation of their judgements, and then of the Exhortation for
the whetting on of their affections; Note, That</p>
                  <p>Both parts are necessary in Preaching,<note place="margin">Doctrine and Application must go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> the one still to accompany
the other.</p>
                  <p>1. Ministers therefore must labor in and for both.</p>
                  <p>2. People must make use and account of both,<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> regard Doctrine for
knowledge,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> and suffer Exhortation for practice: Some cannot endure
Application and Exhortation, but are all for knowledge and to feed
the understanding, and it appears in their lives, for they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
but to live at elbow-room, as they list, notwithstanding the
profession some make in hearing Sermons.</p>

his Church in the worst places, where Satans Throne is, and though
most of the Jews rejected Christ, yet some here and in other Cities
embraced him.</p>
                  <p>The Papists will needs have this meant of <hi>Rome,</hi>

get no plainer then this, the Pope may sit besides his Chair: They
have no place to prove it by,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Willets</hi> Synops.</note> and yet they say, he sate there as Bishop
five and twenty years, which that it was not, the Learned have proved
by divers Reasons.</p>
                  <p>But thus the Pope comes by his Supremacy, <hi>Peter</hi> had it, and he left
it to his Successors, the Bishops of <hi>Rome:</hi> But neither had <hi>Peter</hi> any
such Supremacy, or if he had, it was not tyed to place, but to Truth

(so called mystically for the likeness to <hi>Babylon</hi> in Idolatry, and vexing

his mercy upon it, though no doubt there be numbers of Gods
Elect in it, as in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet many may be Reprobates,
especially in such a Church where Religion is enjoyned by authority:
in such a company as this of the Jews where they were voluntary, there
was likelyhood of the more, and yet even among such were Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
that voluntarily joyned themselves to the Church, as <hi>Ananias</hi>
and <hi>Sapphira.</hi>

                     <pb n="693" facs="tcp:65522:368"/>
1. Know we that its a great mercy to live in an Elect Church,<note place="margin">Its not enough to live in an elect Church, but we must finde that we are Elect.</note> as
the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, when most of the world sit in darkness, and

                  <p>2. Yet must not we content our selves herewith, but be able to
prove our own particular Election, which is an unspeakable favor, and
for which we ought to be exceedingly thankful.</p>
                  <p>Now in that the Apostle calls them an Elect company,<note place="margin">Why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls them an Elect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</note> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew there was a number of Gods chosen among them, as he
saw by their fruits; but who they were particularly, and who were not,
that he could not justly tell, because its unknown what the heart of the
one is, and what God may do in time for the other.</p>
                  <p>We must not take upon us precisely to determine of other mens
Election or Reprobation,<note place="margin">Use.</note> but judge modestly and charitable, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God for being sure of our own, and laboring more and more for

                     <hi>Saluteth you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> wisheth all good unto you: What, would the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
trouble himself or his Epistle with such a trifling matter, as send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of commendations? Its no idle or small matter, but of very good
use; So that as it hath been an ancient custom in the Church of God,
so being Christianly performed its worthily continued, and is of great
use.<note place="margin">The sending of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions how use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is.</note> For 1. It testifieth to our selves that we are of the number of
Gods faithful ones, that we not onely love the brethren with us, but
even those which are absent, yea, not onely no kindred, but not
known by face, onely heard of, that we so love God, that we love
his grace wheresoever. 2. Its no small encouragement to the Servants
of God that be thus saluted, against the many unkindnesses, yea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
they meet with from the world, that yet they see themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
loved and prayed for of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>1. This should provoke us to perform this Christian duty to the
Servants of God,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> for our own discharge, and both their and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
we must not be all to our selves, nor to those we be with, but
even have our hearts with the Church of God elsewhere, rejoycing
to hear of the free passage of the Gospel, the zeal of any embracing
it, and that we help them forward the best we can.</p>
                  <p>2. If we have salutations sent us by any of Gods Servants,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> we
should make special account thereof, and be much comforted thereby,
and set the same against all the scoffs, ill will, and hard measure that
the world affordeth; and if we be in any heaviness, that we stir up our
selves and be thankful to God, that we are remembred of him and
his Servants, and make more account of commendations from a mean
Christian, then from a great Knight or Noble man thats not in
Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. They that are Messengers hereof,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> must not forget nor deal care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
herein; even civil and courteous Salutations onely of friends or
kindred each to other, are of use and not to be omitted, but much
more such as those here, who knoweth how seasonably they may
come? what good they may do? what heaviness they may remove?
They must not count so lightly of them being sent, as to forget them,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:65522:369"/>
or let them (as they say) flye away by the way, but as a token
wherewith they were entrusted, and which it were no honesty to keep
back.</p>

beget men again to God.<note place="margin">The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word is the instrument of Regeneration.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh those that disgrace, either simply, or under colour
of magnifying, praying and reading; so also those that withdraw
themselves from this,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> and staying at home, say, They read good
Books,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> &amp;c. They do as the Israelites, who having Manna allowed
them by God, which should have been unto them in stead of all the
food in the world, yet would have Quails, but they had leanness sent
into their soul, and so have these; either they get no knowledge, or
if any, onely a little swiming in the brain, but not sinking down into
the soul, to the changing thereof.</p>
                  <p>2. It teacheth all Ministers so to preach the Word,<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> as by all means
possible they may win some; what should our desire be, but so to do,
whether we consider the love we owe to God or to our people, &amp; that
their salvation will be our crown? To this end we must preach those
points most diligently and carefully, that be most effentially necessary
to work conversion; we must beat upon mens misery, labor to bring
them to Faith and Sanctification, &amp;c. without these all other points
will be unprofitable: Unpreaching Ministers have no possibility of
winning souls.</p>
                  <p>3. People should so hear the Word,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> as they labor and pray it may be
powerful by the Spirit to their conversion and new birth; they must
have a Spiritual Father, as well as a Natural Father; must be born again
ere they dye, else happy had they been if they had never had their
first birth; lets try our selves herein: Its not hearing the Word, yea,
with joy, and reforming some things that is Regeneration; its not to
be restrained from the gross evils of the world, or to be somewhat
changed in some things; alas, Regeneration is another matter then
that, wherein many deceive themselves and perish, knowing no more
what is Regeneration, then <hi>Nicodemus</hi> when he first came unto
Christ, nor laboring after it to finde it, with the fruits and signs
thereof.</p>

                     <hi>My Son]</hi> He calls him so also of tender love,<note place="margin">Ministers must love their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as their Children.</note> as <hi>Paul One simus,</hi>
his own bowels. Here note, That</p>
                  <p>The Ministers of God ought exceedingly to love all Gods people,
but chiefly such as have been won to God by their means: They
must cherish and further such all they can, as the Hen when she hath
hatched her Chickens, broods and tends them; and as the Mother
after she hath brought forth her childe, is careful to keep it from harm.
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:65522:369"/>
and to provide all necessaries for it; they must watch over them,
preach to them, pray for them, not depart from them, but in the
case of absolute necessity; as the Apostles having won any to God,
would come again to them, exhorting them to continue in the grace
of God, confirming their hearts, &amp;c. so must we; they be our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and joy here, and crown hereafter; our Epistles of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the seals of our Ministery, they that make us rejoyce and give
thanks, therefore we are much beholding to them, and must love them
most dearly, and desire the work begun may be happily perfected,
knowing, its no less wisdom and thrift to hold that we have gotten,
then to get more.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly must the Spiritual Children love their Spiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
dearly:<note place="margin">So people their Ministers.</note> They ought to love all Instructers; but as Children
their Parents, so they them best by whom they have been begotten
to God: They ought to give them double honor, to reverence them,
and not to suffer them want necessary comforts: In doubtful cases of
Conscience, they must resort to them for counsel, as Children to their
Father: They must obey all their godly precepts, endure their severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
be guided by all their godly directions, receive no accusation against
them under two or three witnesses, &amp;c. A childe will not hear, much
less believe any evil reports of his Father.</p>

to want, fall out with them (if he be gone, we shall have one as good
as he, &amp;c.) its questionable whether ever they were converted by
their Ministery; for we see by experience, that such as are converted,
their hearts be so knit to their Spiritual Father, that they think best
of his counsel, praise God for him, as the instrument of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
love him dearly, &amp;c. we love the fathers of our bodies, and
ought so to do, and yet they help us to a being in sin, and into a sinful
world and state, and should we not love our Spiritual Fathers, through
whom we are changed therefrom? The Separatists therefore are either
unconverted persons (as I doubt not but sundry are) or else they be
most unnatural and unthankful persons, in railing against all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

peace makers;</hi> Its a sign they are endued with the wisdom which is from
above: All our words should tend to make love, the Devils Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriers
and Bellows that blow up strife, rejoyce in folks contentions,
and further encrease the same: A woful office; who gets hereby but
the Devil, except the Lawyers hap to get too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Greet one another,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christians should salute one another.</note> To Salute each other hath been an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
in the Church of God, whereof you may finde the forms, <hi>Judg.
6. 12. Ruth 2. 4. Psal. 129. 8. Luke</hi> 1. 28. and 10. 5. <hi>John</hi> 20. 19. and
elsewhere: Ours also are commendable, when we meet any, we say,
God save you; when any goes from us, God be with you, or Fare you
well; in the morning, we say, God give you a good morning; in the
afternoon, God give you a good night; when any is at meat, we pray
God that much good it may do them; when one goes a journey, we
say, God speed you in your journey; when at work, God speed your
work; when one is come newly to an office, God give you joy of your
office, &amp;c. These ought we to use as occasion serveth, both to our
Superiors more reverently, by the Titles that are due to them, of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
honor, &amp;c. our equals with good respect, and somewhat fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly,
as we look they should to us, and to our inferiors, that they
may not think themselves despised, and so be discontent with their
place, and with God; and its a base thing to tread under ones inferiors:
Thus we must salute not our friends onely, but strangers, but our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
<hi>Even blessing them that curse us, and praying for them persecute us:</hi>
Else we shall be but like the Publicans, who salute those that salute
them; so we must salute not onely good men (though those most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively)
but even the bad, for we must have peace with them, though
not with their faults, and give them their due, though if we have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of their sins, we must deal plainly, except we know
them to be Gods Enemies, then ought we to give them no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                  <p>Reasons hereof may be these:<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. Its a good testifying of our love,
which we should do upon all occasions. 2. Its a part of urbanity and
courtesie. 3. Its a good means to procure love from them whom we
do salute;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 6.</note> so did <hi>Absolom,</hi> &amp;c. 4. The neglect hereof, as it cannot
but bewray some defect in us, so it breeds suspicions, and thoughts
of emulation in our neighbors, and works in them no small discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
for our nature can abide nothing less, then to see our selves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebukes not so much those that of rudeness,<note place="margin">Use 1.</note> or for want of
good maners, go by and regard no Salutations, seeming so to minde
their businesses, as they regard none but themselves; but those that
of a prophane minde neglect it, especially towards those whom they
think not to be of their disposition, as some prophane rude wretches,
that will come by a Minister or godly Christian after a scornful maner,
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:65522:370"/>
without shewing any courtesie; This being done in respect of their
Religion, is abominable and vile, and a very bad sign.</p>
                  <p>2. Such as of pride;<note place="margin">Use 2.</note> If they have a little more wealth or gay cloaths,
or any gift more then another, they are so puft up; that they pass by
others scornfully or carelesly: What is one worm to lift up himself
thus against one that is his own flesh, that it may be is as good or better
then himself? The more God hath given any, the more humble they
should be.</p>
                  <p>3. Such as of frowardness,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> malice and old hatred, cannot speak
at meeting, are tongue-tyed; They have a tongue, but the malice of
their heart taketh away the use of it; They look like Tygers on each
other, and would as readily kill them, if they could as safely and easily;
This is seen to God,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 15.</note> before whom he that hateth his brother is a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayer.</p>
                  <p>4. Let us labor to purge our hearts hereof,<note place="margin">Use 4.</note> that we may give every
one his due.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With a kiss of charity,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ancient maner of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting among the Iews.</note> The maner of saluting among the Jews, was
by kissing; Thus did <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> at their meeting, <hi>Laban</hi> and his
Children at their parting, so <hi>Joseph</hi> and his Brethren, <hi>Jonathan</hi> and
<hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. we finde it also practised in the new Testament; See <hi>Luke</hi>
7. 45. and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 37. It was a Custom in some Churches before the
Communion, to kiss each other, signifying the joyning of hearts; this
we retain in part: But men Salute by uncovering, and shaking hands,
the joyning of our hands signifying the joyning of our hearts; This
was the use till courtly Congeys and Crouchings have put them by,
taking one another by the knees and by the elbows, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of charity,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Our Saluting one another must be in love.</note> But be the Salutation what it will, kiss or shaking hands,
or uncovering head, it must be of love, and thence proceeds; for as
we must not be content to have love in our heart, except we shew it by
outward signs; so must all outward tokens proceed from love as the
ground and root, else its lying diffimulation.</p>
                  <p>Those kisses they are elswhere termed holy;<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 16.</note> not a wanton kiss,
not a dissembling kiss, much less a treacherous kiss, but such a
one as proceeds from a Sanctified affection of love seated in the
heart.</p>
                  <p>1. This rebuketh the customary and formal saluting which wants
this ground;<note place="margin">Use. 1.</note> Many do thus greet one another, who yet have but small
love to the parties they salute: This is a taking of Gods name in vain,
its a dissembling with our neighbors,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> whereas love should be unfained
without dissimulation.</p>
                  <p>2. Treacherous courtesies and greetings, when there are fair speeches,
How do you? I am glad to see you well, &amp;c. when mischief is in the
heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 28. 3.</note> as did <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> Thus the Devil pretended love to <hi>Eve,</hi>
this is the note of a wicked man: Many after kinde salutations, will
straight rail, gibe, slander, plot mischief, &amp;c. Those should rather make
known their malice, that others might beware of them, then cloak their
mischief with the shew of love.</p>
                  <p>3. Let every one of us labor to possess our hearts of true love,<note place="margin">Use 3.</note> that
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:65522:371"/>
so we may not onely salute one another, but in a right maner do the
same: O let us labor for this most lovely vertue of love, so often
commanded of us, so highly commended to us; Its the bond of
perfectness that tyes up all together,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 14.</note> without which all duties shatter
asunder;<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> Its the fulfilling of the whole Law; Its that vertue which
is so pleasing to God, that which so long continueth, that wherein
the Angels and Saints now shine.</p>
                  <p>To this end,<note place="margin">Hinderances of love.</note> let us labor to be more and more assured of Gods love
to us, which will make us not onely to love him, but our neighbors
for his sake, the godly best, but all because God bids, yea our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as who loved us when we were Enemies; we must also strive
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> against, and purge out the cankers of love; as namely, 1. Pride,
which esteems so highly of ones self, and basely of others, offereth
occasions of offence readily, and taketh occasion for every thing.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Covetousness, for this also hinders love, he that's covetous cares
not how he gets, by right or wrong, nor how much he wrongs his
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Neighbor. 3. Frowardness and hastiness; This also stirs up strife:
If there have any things fallen out otherwise then well between us
and any (as there may be even between good persons) let us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof, acknowledge and be sorry for the same, seek reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Rom. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31.</note>
be pacified, forgive and forget as we are required, and expect
forgiveness from God: O an unappeasable minde is a fearful thing,
a note of a Reprobate! Such are unlike God, who is slow to wrath,
ready to forgive; like the Devil, who is irreconcileable: O woful,
a poor mortal man to bear immortal hatred! How can he look God
in the face? little doth he think what fearful things he hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God; did he, he would think how ever he could look up to
God for pardon of 10000 Talents,<note place="margin">See Matth. 18. 28.</note> when he catcheth and holdeth
his neighbor by the throat for 300 pence, nay, it may be if it be truly
examined, for nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peace be with you all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What meant by peace.</note> &amp;c.] Now he prays for them; by Peace is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
meant outward prosperity, as health, conveniency of outward
things, welfare of our selves and ours, freedom from grievous evils,
and a quiet estate and condition in the comfortable enjoying of Gods
blessings, in our bodies, wives, children, goods, names, &amp;c. also that
which is the fountain hereof; namely, peace with God and our own
conscience: But I will speak here first of outward blessings: Where
note, That</p>
                  <p>We may lawfully desire for our selves and ours,<note place="margin">Outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how.</note> or any other, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
portion of Gods outward favors; so did both <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Agur.</hi> True, we have no warrant to pray for abundance, that were
a sign of a proud and earthly heart; but if God send it, we must
crave much grace therewith, lest we surfeit thereof, and it make us
like a Camel over-burthened, that we cannot go: So we may crave
Peace in a Land,<note place="margin">See Psal. 1. 3. and 112. 3. &amp; 128. 3. and 84. 11.</note> in Towns, in Families, between particular persons;
so health, a dutiful fruitful Wife, religious and obedient Children,
&amp;c. These things are promised of God, neither will he withhold
any good thing from them that love him,<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 33.</note> and therefore we may pray
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:65522:371"/>
for them: But, because they be good but in a mean degree, we must
desire grace first more and more earnestly, these things onely conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
we must seek his favor, forgiveness of our sins, faith, grace,
absolutely without taking; nay, for the outward, we must submit
our wills to his will, and desire them onely so far, as may stand with
his glory and our best good; for God seeth, that though these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
be goodly things, over the contrary, yet we abuse them, and
are the worse for them, and therefore God is fain to take them away,
and send the contrary; as see what an abundance of iniquity this our
long peace and plenty hath bred, so that though we may not pray as
<hi>Elias</hi> did, for a punishment on the Land, yet surely we might rather
be glad, if God would scourge the Land one way or other to the
amendment thereof, then that it should thus go on to be destroyed;
and for our selves, how do we abuse our prosperity, if it do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
some small time? we must therefore pray for that which may
stand with our best good, and for grace to use it well, we shall enjoy
it the longer; we must be content for our selves, rather to have an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
soul in a sick body, then in an healthful body a surfeited soul with
sin and security; so a meaner Estate with some losses, but with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
gains in grace, is better then abundance with a worldly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
heart; so for our Children, we may desire that they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
in this world, and have a competency, and live to do good, but
must desire most that they may be gracious, and rather so in a poor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
then to swagger it out, or be worldings in great wealth: Its found
true from experience, that such as be earnest and much in desiring these
outward things, they seldom or never crave Gods favor, or seek grace
for their souls; If we be shortened in these things, look we cause it
not by our sin; If we have, we must repent and amend; If we have
not, then may we think that the Lord knoweth this state to be best for
us, and thereupon to be content therewith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That are in Christ Jesus,]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christ is the fountain of all peace.</note> Here's the true fountain of all Peace,
namely, to be in Christ; Hence all Peace comes to us, and without
this, there is nor can be no true Peace: By nature we are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, are at enmity with God, are Rebels and Traytors,
and guilty of eternal condemnation, so that there must be a peace made
between God and us, else we perish: This is onely done by Jesus
Christ, who is our Peace-maker, who by his All-sufficient Sacrifice
of himself, hath made an atonement; when our sins is taken away
in his death, and his righteousness imputed unto us by faith, then is
God at peace with us, and become our merciful Father: when we be
assured hereof by Gods Spirit, and able to prove it by good Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
then have we peace in our own consciences, even such as
passeth understanding, yea joy, and that unspeakable and glorious:
Then,<note place="margin">Hosea 2. 18.</note> being at peace with God, all Creatures be reconciled to us,
the Angels to become our friends and attendants, the Devils not to
have their wills of us, men to respect and regard us, &amp;c. and thus have
we right to all outward peace and prosperity, for Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased,
as Heaven, so Earth for us, and its promised to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:65522:372"/>
and they have right thereto, though with exception of the cross,
when God seeth it best.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see how peace flows from Christ; no peace in conscience
till God be at peace with us; no Creature at peace with us, till God
be reconciled, yea, without this peace, we have no right to any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace; so that a bad man can have no peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But the common sort of men,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> prophane worldlings, and civil ones,
will say, We are none of those you think very well of, for we are none of your
precise fellows, yet we have peace with God we doubt not, nor see we any other
cause, and if he loved us not, he would not do for us as he doth; and for my
conscience, I thank God I am at peace therewith, I was never troubled in my
life; and for outward prosperity, I thrive (I thank God) well; nay, these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
fellows are most without peace, for they are not in Gods favor its like, for
no body cares for them, but hates them; besides, they be troubled in minde, and
sad, and some of them are at their wits ends; and for outward peace, they
be ever sickly, a number of them, and one cross or other is upon them, so that
I think you are quite wide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> How foolishly do these reason?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> They are loved of God
because of their outward prosperity; This is but <hi>Esaus,</hi> but <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels</hi>
Portion, yea, and <hi>Judas</hi> bare the bag: <hi>The Lord maketh his sun
to shine and the rain to fall, even on the bad:</hi> He casteth such bones to
dogs; and for their peace of conscience, its no peace, but benumbed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and an hard heart for want of sight of their deadly danger, which
yet is never the less, and will one day break out in most fearful maner;
they peace that were never humbled for their sins? Its woful peace;
they peace that live in their sins, what to do have they therewith? had
<hi>Zimri</hi> peace that slew his master?</p>
                  <p>For outward peace,<note place="margin">Iob 21. 7, 8, &amp;c.</note> health, welfare, &amp;c. its often the portion even
of Atheists and contemners of God; but what is it whilest they have
no peace, with God, have it in wrath with a wo and secret curse?
There's no soundness in this peace, it cannot comfort the heart, its
but flashing vanity, if any contrary blow come, they are dead in the
nest, as <hi>Belshazzar.</hi> Besides, how uncertain is it? subject to be lost
every moment;<note place="margin">Iob 20. 8.</note> The wrath of God is still ready to seize on them, as
on the Philistines sporting at <hi>Sampson,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Psalm 37. 2. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Pharaoh, Herod,</hi> &amp;c. They pass
away as a dream, their rejoycing is as the crackling of Thorns; How
soon is their Candle put out? They stand in a slippery place, how
suddenly are they gone, leaving nothing but a stink behinde? Their
end will be eternal howling with <hi>Dives.</hi> And are not the godly in
Gods favor, because men favor them not? They are the more; and
for their trouble in minde, when is it? even in the beginning, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when God opens their eyes to see their woful case, whereupon
they are humbled; but them by the Gospel have their hearts direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see the right way of comfort, and so in time attain sweet peace,
which if at any time they interrupt, they never leave seeking till they
have recovered it again: For their crosses, they have often prosperity,
though not so much or continually as to surfeit, but when they meet
with crosses; God makes them wholesome, as our corrupt nature
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:65522:372"/>
makes them needful,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 27.</note> but in the midst of them, they know themselves
at peace with God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 9.</note> and have peace in conscience, and this sweetens
their affliction; Their case is in shew miserable, but in truth happy.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let none content himself,<note place="margin">Use.</note> till he can prove himself in
Christ,<note place="margin">Isaiah 48. 22.</note> else there's no peace for him.</p>
                  <p>All that are in Christ Jesus,] <hi>Here note,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That we should not neglect the poorest or weakest Christian in a
Congregation,<note place="margin">Respect is to be had of all Gods people.</note> but have respect unto them as well as the greatest or
wealthyest: Its an ill sign when men can make no difference in their
judgement between a Civil man, and one truly Religious, and that
can give no countenance to those in whom they see the grace of God;
They account of every thing in great men, but despise or slight even
the greatest things in mean ones.</p>
                  <p>But there be some professors which yet be not in Christ Jesus, but
are hang-byes and hypocrites, what wisheth he to them? none of this
peace; its not for them, sorrow is fitter for them, that they may be
humbled, and endeavor after true repentance: So do I wish to all true
hearted Christians, as much peace and welfare as may be good for
their souls; but those that be hypocrites, professors, but neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in Christ, nor reforming their ways, I wish they may have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
rest and ease, till they set their hearts to seek to be at peace with God.</p>
