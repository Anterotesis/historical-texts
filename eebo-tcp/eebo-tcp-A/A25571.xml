            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ANSWER to ſome of the Linnen-Drapers Objections.</head>
            <p>Firſt, THey Object, <hi>The Indians will not ſell us their Raw Silk and Salt Petre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we will take their Wrought Silks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Why did not the <hi>Indians</hi> deny us their Raw Silk and Salt Petre ſixteen years ago? For then little or no Manufactured Goods was brought over. We will ſhew your Lordſhips an Inſtance of this kind: The Turky Company brought over, Forty or Fifty years ago, great quantities of Mohairs and Grogorams; and although at this time we take not one Piece of them, yet they take our Cloths and Stuffs as freely as before; and we have in Return greater quantities of Raw Silk and Grogoram Yarn than before, which Employs our Poor, ſpends our Growth, and is of great Advantage to the Nation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They Object, <hi>That we cannot make our Manufactured Goods ſo cheap as the</hi> Indians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ours will be as cheap in time, (if this Reſtraint be not laid upon theirs) but then the Price of Land will fall accordingly: For we humbly conceive, Your Lordſhips will Grant, That there muſt be a Proportion betwixt the Price of Labour and the Value of Land; for Example, If a Man works for Two Pence a day, he muſt buy Beef for a Farthing <hi>per</hi> pound, and his Bread, Drink, and Cloathes proportionable, or ſtarve; and the Farmer muſt have his Land accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, or he cannot pay his Rent; and ſo it is plain, the Value of Land and Workmens La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will go together.</p>
            <p>They would have us wear their ſlight Shadows and rotten Calicoes in <hi>England,</hi> and ſend our own Manufactures abroad.</p>
            <p>This ſhews plainly, they deſign the Ruine of our Home Manufactures; for where can we find Markets that will take off ſuch vaſt quantities as we ſpend at Home? Beſides, 'tis more proper for them to carry abroad their <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Silks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is the Bleſſing of Heaven, that we have ſo good Woollen Stuffs of all ſorts to wear in this cold Climate: And not only ſo, but we are able to demonſtrate it to Your Lordſhips, That if Encouragement be given, we can furniſh all Forreign Markets: The truth of this is demonſtrable by what their Council declared, That the Weavers were encreaſed from One to Thirty in twenty years time; now if Your Lordſhips be pleaſed to conſider, that as the Weavers encreaſe, ſo do their Dependants, as Combers, Spinſters, Dyers, Callenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Throwſters of all ſorts; and as all theſe encreaſe, ſo much more of the Growth of the Nation is Manufactured to ſend abroad, which bringing Returns in unmanufactured Goods, when work'd up, will be ſent out again, and this will bring the King double Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They Object, <hi>We want Hands, and cannot make Goods to Anſwer the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of</hi> India <hi>Silks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> We have not half Work enough for the Hands we have already: But if we want Hands, we may ſet up Factories in a great many Cities and Populous Towns in <hi>England,</hi> that would be glad of Work at a much cheaper Rate than we now give, (which will remove the Linnen-Drapers groundleſs Aſſertion as to the Riſe of Goods, for it will certainly make them Cheaper) and then if the Company will bring us greater quantities of Raw Bengal and Cheny Silk, and fine-ſpun Cotton, all which we want in vaſt quantities, to mix with Wooll, and for Warps for Antherines, which anſwers the Uſe, and is better and cheaper than <hi>Perſian</hi> Silks, and is Nine parts in Ten Engliſh Wooll: But if the Company will be angry, and will bring nothing but what will ruine our Home-Manufactures, there are others that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Trade thither, and bring nothing but what is for the Good of the Nation. As for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licoes, our Tammies and Tammarines, Says, and Stuffs of all ſorts, made of Wooll, Figured or Printed, will do better, and were better approved of before Calicoes were in uſe: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Linnen, which we have in Return for our own Manufactures, as we can prove, will be cheaper to us than Calicoes bought with our Money.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Wiſe</hi> ſaying, That One Weaver told him, he would raiſe his Goods if the Bill paſs'd, it is very inſignificant; for what is One to Five Hundred Thouſand? And it is alſo a thing impoſſible; beſides, he is an <hi>Indian-Gown-Man,</hi> and was a great Stickler againſt that Bill, and ſet his Hand to a Petition againſt it, and therefore we cannot tell what he meant in appearing as a Witneſs for the Bill.</p>
            <p>But we entirely truſt in Your Lordſhips Great Wiſdom and Care for us, and that you will never throw this Bill out, which is not only for the good of Landlord, but alſo of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Artificer and Labourer, even the whole Nation, except a few <hi>Eaſt India Men</hi> and <hi>Linnen-Drapers,</hi> which are all nothing in compariſon of the Lands of <hi>England,</hi> its Noble Growth, and its Growing and Encreaſing Manufacturies.</p>
