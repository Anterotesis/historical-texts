            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CErtainly my most dere and welbeloued Ioyce / I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue had of long tyme / a right great desyre to write vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>: but hyderto I haue kept sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / more for shamefastnesse than neglygence: for I drad leest whan I prepared my selfe / I that am nat moche elder than thou / but in other thinges far vnder the / to exhorte the that arte a man of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler prudence and erudition / shuld be seen and reputed to take in hande / a laboure that neded nat / as one wolde caste water in to the see: nat for that I haue any doubte / that thou (whiche arte so excedynge good and gentyll) woldest nat after the beste maner accepte myn exhortation / but leest I shuld seme to take vpon me the office of an immodest or an vnshamefaste persone / to presume to gyue the admonicion / where it were more conuenyent that I shulde be exhorted and monyshed of the. Therfore what shall I do? Shall I wryte or no? Shamefastenes forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me to wryte: but than on the other syde / the loue that I beare to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ioyce wyll nat suffre

Loue on the tone parte coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayleth me to wryte / and shamefastnesse on the other syde moueth me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary. And there is welnere nothynge more greuous or peynfull than a doutfull mynde. But at the laste / it that of ryghte oughte to ouercome shall haue place? Shamefastnes shal obey vnto loue. For I shuld rather esteme thy profytte / yea thy soule helth / than what men wyll saye by me. If that this myn enterprise shall be more applyed to pryde than wysedome / trewely myn offence shulde so moche the sooner be forgyuen / in as moche as it procedeth of loue. For vndouted / I had leauer wrytynge louyngly / do boldely / than wysely ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge sylence / to do more wysely. Nor I doubte nat, but by this patron and aduocate (I meane our loue) I shalbe absolued and quited. For our loue is nat symple or of the common sorte / but very entier / trusty and sure. The causes of our twos frendshyp be ryght great and manyfolde: our bryngynge vp together of chyldren / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous agrement of our two myndes / one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of study in mooste noble scyences / the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable pleasures that thou haste done for me / the singular beneuole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and speciall good minde of the and of thyne borne alwaye towarde me. And also to these causes / is ioyned alyaunce of blode. What thynge canne be more gluynge or claspyng than this our frendeshyp / the whiche

as it were with a double theyne / is bounde and knyt fast together / on the one syde with kynred / and on the other syde with fyxed charite or enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly louynge myndes. Therfore Ioyce I wolde thou shuldest thynke and surely trust that neuer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loued hym selfe more hartily than I loue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. And seyng that I loue the as moche as my selfe or more / I muste nedes care as moche for thy soule helth as for myn owne.

And brefely to speake / trewe loue causeth one man to loue an other more tenderlye than hym selfe. Whiche thynge in the I nede nat to mystruste / but on my parte I maye surely affyrme hit. This thynge hath so moche enbolded and enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged me / that I laied shamefastnes aparte for the tyme / and wrote vnto the this letter of exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation / by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche my mynde is to withdrawe the from the hurly burly / and busynesse of the worlde / and brynge the to a lyfe monastycke / that is to saye / solytary and quyete.

The dyuels promotion is disceytefull / his warfare is sower / and his wages (whiche as the scripture dothe witnes is deth) is mooste sower of all. Goddis obligation is faithfull and sure: the longer that his warre endurethe / the sweter and more plesant hit is: and his wagis / whiche is blessed immortalite / is moost swetest of all. The lyfe of them that folowe the diuell is wretched / the deth more wretched &amp; after dethe a lyfe mooste wretched of all.

heuen euerlastyngly / with mooste highe renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med pompe / to whom the labour of the warfare here is so delectable?

Than truelye I wolde that they shulde gyue credence to those that haue proued religion. For sothe I dare affyrme it with an othe / that euery thynge in religion is full of pleasure. Nothinge is more plentiful or abundant tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our pouerte / nothy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge is more restfull than our labour or trauayle / our abstinence and fastynge is ryght suffisant / our narowe or strayte rowme / is to vs large / wyde / and brode / our watchyng is to vs more gladder than any slepe.

            <head>Howe that farre greatter liberte is in religion than in the worlde. The .ix. Chaptre.</head>
            <p>BRefely to speke / these .iii. thynges be in religion / Libertie / Tranquillite &amp; pleasure. Of Libertie (wherof I wyll fyrste en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate) all we be moost desyrous / euery man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orreth seruage and thraldome: in so moche that many haue kilde them selfe for very hate therof, whiche estemed lybertye better than lyfe / and deth better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seruage. wherfore if folkes delite so moche in libertie / that to bye false libertie cost them so derelye / howe gladly oughte they to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and desyre the institution of our lyfe / as it wherin is perfecte and trewe libertie? But here some ignorant felowe wyll say to me: If libertie (after Ciceros diffinition) be to lyue as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wylte thy selfe / I can nat se howe you religious men shulde haue any libertie at al: for ye lyke byrdes shutte in a cage dare aduenture to do nothinge / neither to eate nor speke / to slepe nor wake / to go nor come / nor so moche as ones to yane / without the abotte or superiour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde you.

No certaynely / no more than horses or asses be at theyr lybertie / the whiche are brydled and pryc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the spurtes / to go here &amp; there / where so euer the ryder wyll haue them. But all this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is sone dasshed. For we wyl nothynge


<pb facs="tcp:25891:33"/>
but that that is leful: and therfore it is lefull for vs to do what so euer we wyll. But touchynge our lybertye / I wyll speake more afterwarde. Nowe gyue me leaue to question agayne with the a lyttell. Tell me / arte thou nat ashamed, to say thou arte at thy lybertie in the worlde / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast mo maysters than thou canst nombre in a daye? Fyrste / thou must attende and apply thy mynde about the worldly busynesses / to the whiche who so euer ones gyueth hym selfe / they are wonte to wrappe and with suche cheynes to lynke hym in / that whither or whiche way so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they drawe / he muste nedes folowe after.

O good lorde / in to what a bondage and thraldome arte thou than ironne? Nowe loke howe many vices thou haste / and to so many maysters thou muste obey / yea suche maisters as are most terrible / abominable / and cruell.

This man as I rede. was cruell out of all measure: so that hit is a thynge ryghte myserable to tell howe many he banished / or commaunded to be slayne: and also he was nat a lyttell garnyshed or decked with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices. But of this tyran / the very selfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce that was in hym / toke vengeance / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che no man els coude do. For he was so turmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and vexed with the conscyence of his yll and wicked dedes / that by no wytte nor helpe of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytyons he coude nat recouer agayne his slepe / that he had lost: and so at the last he dyed of the moost fylthy disease called the lowsy yuell. The olde and manifest example of Cain dothe yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne. We rede that he beynge moued with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie / slewe his brother / but he dyd it nat vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. For he was punyshed forth with / and that diuersly / but no way more cruelly / nor more mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taliye / than of conscyence. The remorce of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scyence for his wycked dede was to hym more greuous / than any other punishement that god his creatour toke. Our lorde god rebuked hym yea he rather reclaymed hym / to cause hym to


<pb facs="tcp:25891:42"/>
take repentance and to confesse his offence: but he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wretched caytyue estemed his synne great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than coude be forgyuen. God graunted hym his life, but he iuged him selfe vnworthy to liue. What a vengeable turmentour thynke ye thus cruelly vexed his stomake? What swete or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant thynge suppose ye coude chance hym in his lyfe / the whiche beynge sore greued with hym selfe / and dispeirynge of hym selfe / as one all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and pensyue demynge his lyfe to hym bytter and sower / he dredde and was ashamed to come abrode in the syght of folkes? For he wente that all other had ben suche to hym as he was hym selfe. Thus ye se good Ioyce / what turmentes / what defilinges / what grudgingis / what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles / and what braydes a wycked and a synfull mynde endurethe. Nowe take hede and marke / howe restfull / howe peasible / and howe pleasant a thynge it is to haue a clere and an vncombred conscience / and for no gylte to waxe pale? What thynge is it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can disturbe or trouble his mynde that is well setled and ordred? What thynge of ryght ought he to drede? Shulde he be a gast of any man? Certaynely he nedethe nat to drede though man be his ennemy / that is holly bente on god his frende. Shall calamitees and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make hym afrayde? No truelye. For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth them to be his wynnynges. But shal he lyue in drede of dethe / the whiche also he gladly desireth and wissheth fore? Finally / shall he nat


<pb facs="tcp:25891:43"/>
feare god hym selfe? No truely. For he hopeth and surely trusteth / that he is in goddes fauour and kepyng. What can be thought more restfull quiete / more vncarefull or more happy / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this thynge? Ioyce / one may fele or perceyue it / but playnely it wyll nat be declared. Parauenture / thou arte so blessed or happy / that thou haste al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy lyuynge in the worlde / the selfe same thyng that I call the vnto. And I verylye truste that thou hast. But my mynde is / that so moche the rather thou shuldest flye and leaue the worlde. For here in religion / thou shalte fynde and haue hit more heapingly / and farre more surer. What thynge maketh the so carelesse / that thou wylte beare so dere a treasure amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge theues? If thou haue ought / it shal encreace here in religion / but in the worlde is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual feare / lest thou forgo it: Here mooste specially is the ilke inwarde peace: and excepte the outwarde quiete be here / it is no where. In the worlde is no inwarde peace / and as for outwarde peace / if there be any / it is very scante / and nat very sure. And this is certayne / that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religious houses reduce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yl men to good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse / and they that be good hit maketh better: But contrary wyse / the worlde is wont to make good men yll / and yll men worse.</p>

Undoubted all folkes are so obstinately inclined to pleasure / that for no maner yuels they can be feared fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it / nor no reason can withdrawe them from hit? And parauenture hit is nat without great skele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epicure saythe / mortall creatures in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of pleasures do erre moche: but yet all creatures by one assente / some by one meane &amp; some by an other / seke for pleasures. So that for this cause moost speciallye secular or worldly folkes are wont / bothe to flye and hate the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our lyfe: the whiche they repute to be harde / strayte / greuous / peynefull / and cleane without pleasure. But to the ende that this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour shulde nat abashe or make them agaste / I shall playnly declare / that it is farre other wyse. Yea our lyfe is so moche without pleasure / that I durste entyce to vs all the delicate Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals / as to a paradise of all delites &amp; pleasures. Thou wylt obiecte and say: yea fayth / pleasure is in monastaries / lyke as the delphin is taken in the woddes / and the wylde bore hunted in the see. I assure the good Ioyce / that all the maner of our lyfe is pleasaunt. Thou askeste me howe that shulde be: &amp; I shall shewe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> howe. Epicure


<pb facs="tcp:25891:44"/>
denyeth those thynges to be pleasures / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be cause of gretter greffes. We kepe no drab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes / nor lyue nat in aduoutry: nor we feede nat / nor ingurge nat our selfe / lyke as the wanton ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall felowes are wont to do: we be sobre at the sonne goynge downe / and sobre whan the sonne ryseth / the whiche thynge they can nat say. For those thynges are neuer in so good plyte / but they be cause of more grefe than delyte. Nor we neyther can nor couet to be enryched: nor to be ennobled by any hyghe magystrate or rowme. Nor in these thynges we omytte nat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Epicure. For seynge that they cause littel pleasure &amp; moche grefe, me semeth we do wisely, in that that we wyll nat bye a small commodite with a greatter inconuenience. More ouer Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure teacheth / that other while sorowes must be ventred on / or taken well in worthe / to the ende that greatter and more greuouser dolours may be fledde &amp; eschewed. And lyke wyse ofte tymes we must forbeare smal pleasures, to thende that we maye optayne greatter. What speake ye of vs? We religious men suffre and gladly endure watchynge / fastynge / solitarinesse / sylence / and suche like thynges / to thende that we wolde nat susteine greatter sorowes.

<pb facs="tcp:25891:44"/>
folishe toyes: but wolde to god thou coudeste se &amp; beholde with wath great auantage we wante those thynges. Haddest thou thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had for gone pleasure? Nay we haue nat so done / but we haue made a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge / yea in suche a wise / that for a fewe and smal pleasures / we haue receiued many great pleasures. Me thought nowe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yore / that these / picked / delicate felowes gaue an eare / on trust that I wolde shewe some newe inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of pleasure: and for certayne so I wyll. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane tyme I wolde they shuld with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe their myndes from foule stynkynge &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull pleasures / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche they vse with beastis in commune. I wolde they shulde for sake theyr beastilynes / and vnderstande / that in man is some what more higher and more diuine, where vnto theyr delectation shulde be rather applyed than vnto the bodye. For seynge that in beastis there is nothynge more noble than the body / hit is nat vnskelfull / that theyr felicite resteth in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of theyr bealies and in bodily luste. But the condition or state of man is more worthye / than that he shulde esteme hym selfe to be borne for none other cause than beastis be. For man is nat onely made and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pacte of the body but also of the soule. In body / saue onely in shappe / we differre nothynge from beastis: but in the soule we resemble very moche the deuine and eternal nature. The body is a thynge erthye / beastly / slowe / mortall / syckely / caduke / vncrafty / and


<pb facs="tcp:25891:45"/>
vnnoble: Contrarie wyse / the soule is a thynge heuenly / diuine / immortall / perpetuall / pure / and noble. Therfore as moche as the bodye is lower and vnder the soule in dignite / so moche more the pleasure of the soule shulde excelle the wanton and lewde lustes of the body. For that pleasure / lyke the soule it selfe / is perpetuall / ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lothesome / pure / honeste / diuine / &amp; helthfull. Contrarie wyse / the bodily pleasures / are discei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable / soone vanyshynge / lothsome more sower than swete / foule / and deedly. But it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enioy the pleasure of the body &amp; of the soule bothe at ones. The one muste nedes be forgone. What wolde Epicure saye to this / if one asked hym counsayle? Forsothe that we shulde expelle and put awaye from vs those fylthye and foule lustes of the body / that they lette vs nat to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne / the swete and most excellent pleasures of the soule. The whiche thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge (as I haue sayde) is nat away to lose / but greatly to wynne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. But me thynke thou lokest that I shulde tell / with what pleasures of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule we be fedde here. Fyrste as Epicure sayth / whose authorite I wyll nat yet forgo, to wante the horrible vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and grudge of an vnclene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science / is the greattest pleasure that can be. For he hath nat a lyttell to reioyce of / that hath nothinge to be sory fore. Farther / is nat the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly and immortal delectations / vnto the whiche we hope ones by goddis grace to come / a thynge of


<pb facs="tcp:25891:45"/>
great pleasure. Who is so blonte of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge / that whan he beyng wery of this lyfe / dothe remembre the felicitie celestyall / wyll nat wepe for very ioye? Whose mynde is so agreued and oppressed with heuynes &amp; sorowe / the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che whan he remembreth the lyfe to come / doth nat rise vp / and waxeth very gladsome / yea and wolde fayne be out of this worlde? What &amp; one myght taste and sauoure these thynges? For all be it that they / to whom the worlde is as yet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory / can fynde no sauour or swetenes in them / yet vnto holy and well dysposed mindes there is nothynge more surely approued. And thoughe that the great ioye and pleasure of the lyfe that is reserued in tyme to come / can nat be ꝑceiued / be fore the soule deꝑtynge out of this yll fylthy / and vnswete prison of the body / resorte thither agayne / from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it came: yet neuer the lesse / me semethe that good deuoute myndes haue a smacke and some perceyuynge therof / and are weate as hit were with a dewe of heuenlye sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers: and of that same lyght that neuer shall fayle / they se as it were a glymeryng or a gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The whiche thynge howe great a pleasure it is, it can nat be perswaded vnto hym that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant &amp; vnexperte therof: but vnto them that be experte therin / it can nat be estemed nor spoken howe pleasante it is. And all thoughe (as saynt Bernarde sayth) these delytes are but outher whyle / and are wonte to tary but a shorte space:


<pb facs="tcp:25891:46"/>
yet are they so great / that if all the pleasures of this worlde were layde to gether on a heape / in regarde of these they wolde seme lyttell worthe / yea and nat to be set by. And if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rewardes / for good dedes to be hoped fore (whiche thyng is farre other wyse) yet forsothe hit wolde neuer greue me / for this onely hyre or mede to suffre and endure all maner labours / and wolde deme them so worthy / that to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to opteyne them / I wolde nat onely despice and set naught by all other lustis and delites of this worlde / but also bydde them batayle. Go to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / what mowe we suppose &amp; thynke that the great plentie or abundance of these ioyes wolde do / if a littell smacke or a very thynne sauour of them so moche deliteth / so recreateth / and maketh one so ioyfull? O / howe great a pleasure shall it be / whan that diuine lyghte shall shyne ouer &amp; ouer vs, the whiche can nat be seen but with most pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified eies: so that we also shall all shyne bryght: seinge that a lyttel glymeryng or a gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof / the whiche quickely cometh and vanisheth / cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth so great pleasure? Farthermore / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / that the holy goste many tymes secretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trynge in to the cleane &amp; pure myndes causeth / howe ofre in the moste chaste chambre he enbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and clyppeth his spouse / languishynge in his loue / and lamentynge as louers are wonte that loue feruently / with most gentyll &amp; frendly familiarite / dothe comforte and chere her: this


<pb facs="tcp:25891:46"/>
great swetenes I say / wherto shulde I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre? Let them reherse hit that haue knowlege therof. But they knowe hit and that happilye / the whiche pleased god shulde haue experience. I am vnworthye as yet to be admitted to come to these delites: or though I haue a lyttell skle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly tasted therof / yet I had rather tell it by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by my selfe. And thoughe hit be more certaine to tell it by my selfe / yet it is more come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I shewe it by other. I haue harde some say many tymes with wepynge teares / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these worldly pleasures / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche vnto folyshe brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge felowes sauour so well / haue semed vnto them so bytter and so sower / that theyr mynde hath nat onely aborred those thynges / but also their eares to here speake of them / as whan the vse of bread was founde / acornes began to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and naughte set by: so the false delites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to waxe lothsome to them / after they had taken a taste of the very trewe pleasures. But helas very many worldly people of that rustical and blounte sorte / haue taken suche a smacke in this swynishe fedynge / that nothinge saue their acornes can sauour vnto them. Nor they vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stande nat what iocundyte of lyte there may be / or whye they shulde desyre to lyue here in this worlde / if the acornes / that is to say y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voluptie and pleasure of the belly and mouthe / shulde be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaye from them. And therfore so often as they se vs religious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take suche labours and


<pb facs="tcp:25891:47"/>
peyne as they suppose they coude nat endure / &amp; yet to be more lustye / more merye / and in better plite and lykynge than they be that do nothyng els but banket and make good chere / they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle out of all measure: Nor they can nat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue howe we shulde haue any pleasure / after we haue forsaken and throwen awaye from vs the delectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and pleasures of the fleshe. And yet these men se tender yonge men and also dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate virgins / they se theyr yeres and shap / and they remembre / howe softe and wantonly they were a lyttell before cherished and broughte vp: and on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other syde they leaue nat vnreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred / if in our religious lyfe be any thynge sharpe / greuous or peynefull / as solitarinesse / labour / watche / fastynge / and suche like thinges. They se that it is nat only lefull vnto these yonge chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to leaue and forsake this maner of lyfe / but also with what great instance of theyr parentes and frendes / they be intyced / monished / prayed / and vehemently stered to forsake their religion: But contrary wyse / the more they be ꝑswaded / the more obstinate they be. Theyr mother that wepeth and waylethe they comforte and bydde to be of good chere / with theyr eien drye: Theyr syster collynge them about the necke / they shake of and despice: And from their mooste dere play feres / from whom but a littell before to be abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te a day / was a very harde thynge / they be nowe right easily all their lyfe duryng plucked away.


<pb facs="tcp:25891:47"/>
Fynally they take theyr leaue and byd fare well with so mery a countinance / &amp; kysse at theyr last partynge with so glad chere / that no man that is by / though he be a stranger can forbeare we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge. It pleaseth me here (and I pray the be nat agreued therwith) to remembre the heuye and lamentable soupper / whiche was the laste soupper / that Margerete the good virgin / the whiche I loued as she had ben myn owne sister / had with her parentes and fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. I was there present the same tyme / and so were many mo as well as I / the whiche the mayden had desired to come thither / to thentent / that by our procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and helpe she myghte opteyne of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther / that that she had frustratly or in vayne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired of hym .vi. yeres daye before / that was to gyue her leaue to be an nunne. For she had than gotten her mothers good wyll. And yet to saye the treuthe / this difficultie of eyther of them / dyd nat chaunce of any vice. For lyke as they were in theyr countrey both reputed &amp; of linage with the beste, euen so they were in vertue: that there was no man but that he did both loue and preyse them / whiche thynge is rathe or seldome seen in them that be in welthe and felicite: But they be so tender ouer and loue theyr children so / as though they greatly loued them. So we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to entreate &amp; perswade her father. What shulde I make many wordes? He beinge ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partly with shamefastnes / partlye with


<pb facs="tcp:25891:48"/>
pyte and compassion of his daughter / and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye with our eggyng, granted her request. But than thou shuldest sodaynely haue seen there a ryght miserable syghte. The father in collynge and kyssynge of his daughter / beganne so to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wepe / as though she shuld forth with haue ben layde in her graue. Her mother for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sorowe fell downe deed in al wounde. Her one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brother and her syster that was a lyttell elder than she / wepynge &amp; crienge out / enbraced their dere syster / and sayde: By these our wepynge teares / &amp; for what so euer brotherly and systerly pite and tender loue may do / we pray you swete syster / that ye forsake vs nat thus your misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brother and syster / leest that you beynge but one distroy vs twayn. The other frendes wept, some priuely, some openly / some entreated / some perswaded / and some blamed or rebuked: but there was none amonge them all / but that the teares ranne from his eyen. And we also that came to entreate for the mayde / were so moued / what with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wepynge of other that were there, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation of her father from whose eies the teares ranne as he had ben a childe / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan lyke wyse to wepe / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche thyng though I say it / besemed vs nat. Yea and it almoost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented vs / that we had gone so farre in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What trowe ye dyd the yonge virgin this whyle / the whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideryng her sexe or kynde / her tender age / her softe nature and bryngynge


<pb facs="tcp:25891:48"/>
vp / was so delycate? Saynte Paule hym selfe wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he toke leaue to depart from his bretherne / shewed that he was moued with their wepyng / though it were nat greatly / sayeng / what do ye wepynge and troublynge myne harte? But the virgine (all though she was of a greatte pitie or mekenes to her father &amp; mother) with her eies drye / a mery chere / and smylynge on her father / she sayde / that he had no cause to be so vexed and greued / but he oughte rather to reioyce and be gladde / as he that had nat loste his daughter / but as he that was sure to fynde her, the whiche shulde praye to god for hym. She also endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her selfe dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly / with kyssynge / prayenge / and pratye exhortation to ease and appease her mothers heuy harte / and other that were there. But all was in vayne: for they droue forthe and prolonged the soupper with syghynge and sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynge / wepynge / and complaynyng / tyll it was very late in the nyghte / and except Margarete / there was nat one merye amonge them all. So often as they se these thinges (for they must nedes se suche thynges other whyle) I meane these felowes / the whiche as I haue sayde / ben all gyuen to bodily pleasure / they wepe with the other / they maruayle at the stoutnesse &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of theyr yonge myndes / yea and are ashamed of theyr owne softe delycacy.

<pb facs="tcp:25891:49"/>
inclined, yea so vtterly to set naught by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the worlde / excepte they founde other / that be to them more leauer? Wolde they so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately / and with so good a corage take these labours vpon them / if they dyd nat knowe very well / that they be swete and pleasant? So it is good Ioyce / so hit is playnely: a thynge that is swete and pleasant to them that be expert ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in / semeth sower and harde to them that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expert therof. But howe longe shall it be er thou perswade these felowes to beleue the? For as saynt Bernarde saythe / they se our crosses / but they se nat our vnctions: Truely I wolde they had a better mynde / ne were hit that they haue a pleasure frantyckely to erre / lyke as Argiuus dyd / of whom Flaccus speketh.

In the whiche the discipline of religion dothe flourysshe in suche a wyse / that they be none other thynge than Scholes of impyetie.

other entente / but to lyue more commodyously at theyr pleasure / myndynge more the bealye than the soule. And so those that very indigence and nede to lyue honestly in the worlde / shulde haue induced to vse frugalitie / to haue ben dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and industrious, in monasteries they gyue them selfe to sleuthe and luxure. And those that were in the worlde very poore and of lowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree / vnder the profession of pouertie they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and folowe the pompe, the sumptuousnes, and stately araye of prynces and great lordes.

So that by feyned profession of pouertie / they flee pouertie: by feyned profession of chastite / they prouide for theyr carnall lust: and by feyned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of obedience / they fynde the meane / that they wyll be constrayned to obey no man.

<pb facs="tcp:25891:54"/>
bicause he was stryken with great feare in the tyme of a tempeste / of a sickenesse / or of an other peryll / he made suche a vowe. Some be drawen to religion by one that hath bene afore tyme theyr derely beloued companyon. Some with shamefull eggynges / as hit were buguls be drawen in to the ditche by the nostrils. Some also be truste in to religion by theyr vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde and vngentyll parentis: or elles by theyr tutours / to the entent to be eased of theyr coste and charge: they moost specially lay awayte to attrappe and disceyue the symple youthe / the whiche is verye easye to begyle.

One ought to be a christen man betymes / and a monke at leiser / howe be hit he is a monke at the ful / who so euer be a pure chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten man.
