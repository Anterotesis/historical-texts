         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>DEo, Patriae, tibi,</hi> ſeems a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Motto, that all Mankind
are equally fond, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of; <hi>I</hi> will not ſay, that
they all Anſwer it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alike:
But the Character which is
ſo univerſally approv'd of,
ſurely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needs no Apologies for its Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And yet, after all, <hi>I</hi> know a Cenſure
that will as naturally, as unjustly, follow it;
What! <hi>Saul among the Prophets,</hi> or a
Man attending Buſineſs in Print? And ſo,
O Sir! you are an Author! And why not?
What is the ſhame of it? Is not a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
a Maſter of as great Charity as an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65770:3"/>
An <hi>Author</hi> not Licens'd by Common Vogue,
as well as Authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looks like one with the
Plague-ſore upon him; and every one that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
by him, is ready to Write, <hi>Lord have
mercy upon him</hi> on his Door; and not a
Man-Goſſip, but what is for paſſing his Verdict
upon him. But, whatever others imagine,
for my part, I am none of Captain <hi>Tom's</hi> Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
nor ever will be: I ſhall never think
any Man, for that Reaſon alone, to be Reflected
upon in his Buſineſs, becauſe withall, he is a
Maſter in Science, and Notion alſo.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is no more agreeable to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
than my Inclinations, to glide away
inſenſibly, and leguile my ſelf of half my Time
at a Tavern: I know there are a great many
petty Arts full as advantagious, as real Skill
in Profeſſions; but uſe them who will, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
not to <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n-man my ſelf for Intereſt: and
I neither can, nor will buy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Favour at the rate
that 'tis beneath me, to purchaſe it at; if it
come in a more regular w<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, 'tis welcome.</p>
            <p>'Tis a much more pleaſant Exerciſe to me,
thus to beſtow my leiſure hours in curing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Errors of my Mind: And, whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may fancy, I ſhall never think it loſs of
<pb facs="tcp:65770:3"/>
time, nor barely a diverſion, pertinently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
my Vnderſtanding: True Senſe is a
Sword to him that Commands her; and he's
an ill Maſter of her, that having once got her,
is not able to turn her to all Advantages upon
Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis a prudent Rule in Life, not to
ramble out of the way in needleſs Excurſions:
Nor do I think that in this I have tranſgreſt
it; it is my deſign but to perfect my Notion, and
in what is abſolutely uſeful, and not to run to
either Folios or Trifles: Nay, and even this is
not a VVork as of to day with me. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
I Preſent the <hi>Reader</hi> with, are not new,
I have had them Years by me; and what I
have done of late, has been only to Correct and
Reviſe them a little for the Preſs.</p>
            <p>But, Do I ſeem too Pert, or Pragmatical
in what I Write, in pretending ſo Confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Instruct our Seniors and Masters? why
I have juſt the ſame Excuſe that all other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have had before me: You may be ſure, I had
never Wrote what I have, had I thought it had
been, Impertinence and Arrogance only; and,
after all, VVill you ſay I am deceiv'd? truly
I have no other Anſwer for you neither, than
that Authors ſeldom call a Council, to know
<pb facs="tcp:65770:4"/>
whether what they Write, be all juſt Orthodox
or not.</p>
            <p>So, Do you think, in Humility, I ought to
have forborn preſuming thus? Why truly, and
as to the Point too, I am a little conceited, I muſt
confeſs it; nay, I were an Aſs for Printing
what I have done, if I did not think it to
the purpoſe. But what! after all, I am miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in my mighty Imigination; and it may
be ſo: but ſurely then alſo, I have done no
more, than what a whole heard of Fools has done
before me.</p>
            <p>And yet, after all, the World may be deceiv'd,
and find my matter better than they expect it:
All Perfections are entail'd on no Man, and
there is many an excellent Spokeſman that
makes a bad Writer, as well as there are a great
many good Writers, That, as <hi>St. Paul</hi> and
<hi>Moſes</hi> Write<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of themſelves, are neither of
Voluble Tongue, nor Extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>It may be too, you think my <hi>Stile</hi> too light;
and truly if you do, I ſhall not alter it, nor
quarrel with Nature for not giving me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Genius, or Diſpoſition: Alaſs! our <hi>Stile</hi>
is like our <hi>Stature,</hi> no more to be altered by our
Thought, than our Bodies: ſuppoſe, with the
<pb facs="tcp:65770:4"/>
ſame Reaſon, you ſhould quarrel with the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of my Face, or the Gate or Meen of my
Body; And why may not I, with as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Complain, and be aggriev'd at the ſight of
yours?</p>
            <p>After all, Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rimer</hi>'s
Mettled <hi>Stiles</hi> to me, look with full as much
Native Beauty as ever a ſlow-pac'd Don's in the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe: Every thing in its way; 'tis as
natural for the Cholerick, and the Sanguine, to
be daring and ſprightly, as 'tis for the <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi>
and <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> to be heavy and
dull.</p>
            <p>But will not all this pleaſe you neither?
Truly, I ſhall not cramp my ſelf to a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Cutt to do it; if it won't, I have wrote what
<hi>I</hi> have, and <hi>I</hi> have thought it worth Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
accordingly, <hi>I</hi> have publiſh'd it; and <hi>I</hi>
hope, <hi>I</hi> have no need to be aſham'd to Father
it; <hi>I</hi> have deliver'd it in my own way, for
<hi>I</hi> am reſolv'd never to turn fool by an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Imitation.</p>
            <p>After all, I have made my Title, Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and Book, all of a piece; if thou likeſt
it, 'tis at thy ſervice; if not, I am reſolved
not to be melancholly upon it: I won't ſay,
<hi>Ad captum Lectoris habent ſua fata Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belli;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65770:5"/>
for I am willing to ſubmit the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Book to the Readers, and to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it no greater weight than he is pleas'd
to ſtandard it at: but ſurely, I might add
alſo, That a great many good things have been
loſt in the world, becauſe men have not known
the value of them.</p>
            <p>And, however the World may relliſh it,
yet ſurely, I think, I may ſay too, That there
is a Gift of Thinking and Digeſting, as well
as Flouriſhing and Bantring, or writing tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Tomes or Volumes either; 'tis not every
tall Boy that can jeſt with flaſhy Wit and
Thought at random; nor every Author that
can appear in Folio, that can either ſpeak,
write or judge of Good Senſe, or true Wit;
and though even ſuch may prove Maſter
Criticks in a Coffee-Houſe, or Well-Titled
in a Bookſellers Shop; but then, <hi>Ne ſutor
ultra crepitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In plain terms, the haughtieſt Combatants
through the meer dint of <hi>Extempore</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Parts only; and the greateſt Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks
diſguis'd with the falſe Paint of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prove but as Pigmy Drolls to a moderate
Man at Arms, and one truly accoutred with
the Weapons and Defence of good Thought
and Literature.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65770:5"/>
            <q>
               <l>Non Cicero, Cicero, nec Appelles, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Appelles;</l>
               <l>Id, quod uterque fuit, fecit utrumque
Labor.</l>
            </q>
            <p>After theſe, I know no other conſiderable
Apology, but that thou paſs by ſome roughneſs.
Perhaps thou mayſt be offended at too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in my Stile: I tell thee before-hand, 'tis
greatly collective; In the Temple Church there
are Stones that they ſay are caſt, and many
compos'd out of one; alaſs! we have loſt
the Art: And when thou conſidereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Building I am rearing, lays it's
Foundations as wide as all the Knowledge of the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, thou needſt not wonder that every
ſtone in it is not melted or cemented as into
one, or carv'd, or gilded and adorn'd, like
bawbles in Ladies Cloſets.</p>
            <p>Surely, he's a good Workman in ſuch caſe
that joints his Building well, and that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
purſues his Draught and Deſigns: If
therefore the ſenſe and ſincerity of my Work
has been full and juſt, I think I may well
<pb facs="tcp:65770:6"/>
leave the Fretwork and Chequering it to an
after part. Perhaps I know as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Man, what it is to have my Stile hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
bodg'd, and incoherent; but he muſt be
more than a Man, yea an Angel, that can
perfect ſo laborious a Task as I have deſign'd,
without ſuch faults.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort; As to the ſubſtance of my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
I hope <hi>I</hi> have anſwer'd it to the full;
as for the reſt, Reader, uſe thy pleaſure; thou
ſeeſt <hi>I</hi> unde<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eive thee before hand; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if it diſpleaſe thee, be angry at thy ſelf,
and not me: And yet, <hi>I</hi> hope, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not
vex thee ſo much neither by it; for I have not
taken a little pains in the matter, to make
my coherence as poliſh'd as needful.</p>
            <p>To ſhut up all; Are you offended that <hi>I</hi>
write ſo little of Logick, and ſo much of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and Reputation? Heads that ſeem to be
but as Trifles, when compar'd with a Science;
and ſo in many other the like caſes. Why truly,
at preſent you muſt conſider, That you are with
one that ſets up for a Reformer, and perhaps at
laſt, thou mayſt be convinced by him too; not
only that too many of our Sciences are trifling,
but that there are many other Subjects that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
far more of our care than any of the
<pb facs="tcp:65770:6"/>
little Kick-ſhaws, that the Schools have dreſs'd
up for us; if not, I can but again tell you,

            <p>To conclude; after theſe, <hi>I</hi> might add, <hi>I</hi>
expect a whole Troop of petty Carpers, Criticks
of the moſt noiſe, but juſt of as much judgment
as to be able to make Errata-men for the Preſs;
and truly, as for theſe, the Author is willing
to let them applaud themſelves in their Kack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
their Cenſure is not likely to do either
much harm or good; if it were, he would tell
them, he does not pretend to be able to correct
every Comma, Letter, or little Variance in his
very ſenſe, by the Preſs from his Copy: But, as
for theſe Men, the Author is rather of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That they want an Apology for what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do, than he in Vindication of himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. And ſo he bids all</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Turkiſh Spy</hi> tells us, the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
ſay, That a Man muſt forget
twice, and learn thrice, e're he
can expect to be perfect. If that be a good
Rule, I am perſuaded theſe Eſſays will
pleaſe; for if to perfect and lay by, and
then to mend and lay by, and then to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
again and lay by, be the way to render
a Book compleat and uſeful, I am ſure theſe
Eſſays cannot be defective; which like
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Veſſel, have ſuffered through
time, ſo many Corrections and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that the Author himſelf hardly knows,
whether there is ever an Original Piece
loſt in them. Painters ordinarily preſent

you with your Picture after twice or thrice
ſitting. Books are the draughts of our
Souls; and why then ſhould we be leſs
curious in the Pourtraictures of our Souls
than our Bodies?</p>
            <p>Some Men again think it enough, if their
Porch be well adorn'd, and their Reader
when firſt uſher'd in by a brisk Sally,
wheedled with the hopes of an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
accordingly; but ſurely, how agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſoever ſuch Methods are for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the Bookſeller, the Author gets no
Reputation by ſuch Arts: For my part,
I declare, there is not an Eſſay herein, that
to the beſt of my knowledge, has not coſt
me full as much pains as this Entrance; and
I don't know of one thought that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
throughout, that I would not have
expunged, if I thought it would nauſeate
with my Readers; that in ſome caſes I
am a little larger in explaining my ſelf,
ſurely may be very well allow'd: Are all
Mens Capacities either equal to receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
or their Prejudices eaſy to be
rooted out?</p>
            <p>As for the deſign of my Book, it may
ſeem to interfere with a great many lately
publiſh'd. We have every day <hi>Journals</hi> of
<hi>Abridgments,</hi> and the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
the Authors of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65770:8"/>
Bibliotheque,</hi> together with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian
Society,</hi> have obliged us with large
Volumes of Abſtracts; but none of all
theſe is what I have here propos'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd.
They abridge Books, I Subjects;
they refer you to Authors at large, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize
ſeveral on the ſame Subject; I on
the contrary have endeavour'd to extract
the Marrow of all, by all to render each
Subject entire, and to trouble the Reader
with neither Catalogues of Authors, nor
Quotations, but purely the very heart of
his Subject entire, or Reflections in what
is uſeleſs in it.</p>
            <p>And ſhall any one after this, acquaint
me, that my Performance is ſhort, that my
Deſign is large; alaſs! he forgets what I
propoſe is but in Eſſay, nay, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Knowledge is more than human;
and that more than Eſſay is not modeſt.
If therefore by theſe ſhort Eſſays, I can
prove a faithful Remembrancer to the
Learned, of the preſent State of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and a happy Guide to the Student,
through the ſeveral uſeleſs Labyrinths, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by Pedantry into human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to keep him from thoſe unhappy
Rocks, that have Shipwrack'd many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Parts, I think my brevity in it will
be the more acceptable, and my deſign
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65770:9"/>
ſuch, if well anſwer'd, as all the World
muſt cheriſh.</p>
            <p>For my part, I could wiſh I were even
yet ſhorter than I am, 'tis the bane of good
Books, when their length makes them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious:
But to be more brief, I as much
deſpair at, as to be more perfect. The
whole Field of Wiſdom and Science is my
Subject. What Man ſo vain, as to think
to contract it in a Sheet? So that Body of
Knowledge that has puzzl'd whole Ages
of the wiſeſt, who is ſo weak as to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Maſterdom of it alone in himſelf?
Surely, one might as well expect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher
a Court in a Cottage, as Univerſal
Science in a little Tract; nay, the Bounds
of Univerſal Wiſdom are ſuch, that the
beſt of us know but in part; and GOD
has made it one of the Bonds of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
that we mutually rely on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our Imperfections.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by all further Apologies, and
to deſcend into the very reaſoning of our
Methods, both of our Writings and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
let us conſider a little: We Study,
but why? that our Knowledge may be
profitable to our ſelves and others, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
Poſterity. But inſtead of this, and
for want of a due Method, what do we do,
but intangle our ſelves in the Cobwebbs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65770:9"/>
of nicer Notions, and even confound all
that follow us?</p>
            <p>Alaſs! the very Source of Wiſdom is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
corrupt amongſt us; and a Learned
Man is a Chimera we have now no
Idea of. Shew me one in a million that
can tell you the Bounds of Learning, that
can tell you Abſtract from Pedantry, how
much is fit to be known, and that can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
the mind, that all further Enquiries
will be needleſs?</p>
            <p>A Youth that is now bred a Schollar, is
like a Veſſel launch'd at Rovers, and in the
midſt of the Ocean, without either Pilot
or Rudder; he may do well or not; but
if he does ſucceed, 'tis through the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of his own Parts: For, as for the
Directions and Helps he is to expect, they
will rather amuſe and diſtract, than lead
him right.</p>
            <p>We enter upon Languages, and their
Criticiſms are infinite; ſo we proceed to
Sciences, and there we are loſt in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of Subtilties; our Metaphyſicks
puzzles us, our Logick fetters us, and
our nice Mathematicks is a Field, where
even our greateſt Maſters are loſt.</p>
            <p>Nor is even our Morality better; our
Vertues and Vices are loſt in endleſs
Schemes and Subdiviſions; and our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65770:10"/>
is wrangled to Pyroniſm, ſo that
when we look about us, we know neither
where to begin, nor where to end; and
when we would proceed, we do not know
where we are.</p>
            <p>Hence alſo, if a Man be Learned, yet
he is never known; there is no Standard
to try him by. And hence it is, that there
is no Encouragement for real Wiſdom;
all that the World looks for, or knows how
to eſteem, is but the little Cant of Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and if a Man leave that, tho' on ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo good grounds, he is more likely to
get the Name of a proud illiterate, than of
a Schollar or Wiſeman.</p>
            <p>But where is all this while then our real
improvement of Wiſdom? Alaſs! this
is but a more perplex'd and ſubtle Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and a Chaos of Literature. And
what does not this Lumber require a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſter
then? Indeed a Man of Vigorous
Parts himſelf may diſpoſe it ſome way to
his uſe; but how many become meer
Schollars, and are loſt in the Confuſion,
and that dare not ſo much as look out
of this Cloud?</p>
            <p>What a ſhame 'tis, that Man that
was made to be as a Lord of the Creation,
ſhould thus be loſt even in his Dominions
over his own Notions! And what ſhall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65770:10"/>
we call this Art that leads us thus? no, 'tis
a laborious Diſtraction. Were this an
Art, 'twould facilitate our Actions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
inſtead of that, it clogs them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
our natural Force. A Bird that's
wild, ſings better than one ill taught.</p>
            <p>Beſides, can that be an Art for the uſe
of life that would require even two Ages
of us, if we had them to attain them? Or
ſhall we ever eſteem that as an helpful
Speculation that muſt drown us in the
Theory, before we can come to Practice?
And is not this too true in the common
Circumſtances of Learning? Is not what
we call a moderate competency of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
now become almoſt even a work
for our Lives?</p>
            <p>Who can almoſt enumerate, much more
think to peruſe the infinite Volumes of
Science? Nay, let us but ſtate any one of
the Arts and Sciences in the whole Enci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopaidion,
and let us ſee who has the
command of all her Branches, and to
whom we may not add; nay, let us ſee,
how many are imperfect Plagiarys, and
how much is wanted in the beſt, that
might be added on the peruſal of all.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee likewiſe what vaſt Bodies the
Sciences even contracted compoſe, is <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteds
Epitome,</hi> in his <hi>Enciclopaidion,</hi> fit to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65770:11"/>
enlarged: Or can we reduce the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to a Nut-ſhell? Nay, or can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
the uſual Tables, much leſs an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>Curſes Mathematicus,</hi> in one managable
Volume?</p>
            <p>And what then! Are all theſe fit for
a Schollar to ſtudy? or can we not obtain
a competent Idea in theſe things without
our Leaders melancholly Schemes and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceties?
Alaſs! if we Cant, we had better
baniſh Studies, and burn our Books, and
live like true Philoſophers altogether, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum
Naturam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The miſchief of it is, we have a ſort
of men Title and Table learn'd, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they can manage the inconſiſtent
Scraps of Authors, to get themſelves a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
by it, cry up, and endeavour to
ſupport this Gallimaufry; and without one
had a 1000 mouths to out-cry the little
Beagles, that theſe men raiſe up to ſupport
their Reputation, one had as good ſave
ones Breath as ſpeak, tho' with never ſo
juſt a Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs for my own part, I have
not been wanting to ſtudy, and may be
as much as the beſt of them, and that in
the whole Body of Learning too; and
whatever Mountains others can eſpy in
it, I declare, I am unfortunate and thick-ſighted,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65770:11"/>
for I can find but few.</p>
            <p>This I find indeed, that the weight of
Univerſal Learning, as it now ſtands, is
too great for mortal Shoulders, too long
for their peruſal, too nice for their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
too various for their Imagination, and
too confus'd for their Judgment; but this
I muſt declare withal, I ſee not why it
may not bear a rational Contraction; for
the moſt part of it is meerly curious and
impertinent, or at leaſt it ſeems ſo to
me.</p>
            <p>So curious may I ſay, that could any
Man foreſee the fruitleſs Labour that our
Pedantry would coſt him, before he would
be able to lay by her Spectacles, as he ſhould
do, he would as ſoon go into an Houſe of
Correction, as undertake ſo irkſom a Task,
as to be a Schollar, and ſo impertinent. That
in the moſt of his Studies, could he but
judicially ſee what he was doing, he
would as ſoon buſy himſelf in catching of
Butterflies.</p>
            <p>But the Matter is, when a man enters
thus amongſt the Crowd of Learned Fools,
'tis a Thouſand to one, if ever he keep his
Senſes longer for to be able to bring him
back again. And hence it is, that we have
few or none to lead us from it, whilſt we
have almoſt infinite Examples to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
us in the Dotage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65770:12"/>
And thus when I firſt begun my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
I could quickly ſee that there was a
World of Pageantry that ought to be laid
by, that our Books were even compos'd of
a ſpecious Empty Vein, and which beguil'd
us with Appearance in ſtead of Subſtance:
but how to ſeparate this Droſs from the
Finer Oar, or how to cut off the Excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and preſerve the Body, that ſeem'd
a work almoſt as difficult even as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s
in Conquering the World, I may ſay
<hi>Herculean,</hi> and harder than to cleanſe the
<hi>Augaean</hi> Stables.</p>
            <p>I plainly ſaw alſo, that as the Preſent
State of Learning was a Vail for the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
being too dark to let Men really
Ingenuous, be otherwiſe than Modeſt,
and leaving full room for Confidence and
Ignorance to vent their pretences; ſo I
ſaw plainly that there was a ſort of Men
in the World, that would oppoſe any
ſuch attempt, were it only to keep their
own Blindneſs from being expos'd.</p>
            <p>But as withal I ſaw, that if ſuch a
Work were finiſh'd, it would even force
its own way in the World, and illuſtrate
its ſelf; and, through its uſe, turn its own
Advocate in proving ſo Beneficial to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
ſo I was reſolved to ſee what I
could do about it; and as I was ſatisfied
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65770:12"/>
of the Lawfulneſs and Charity, nay, and
I may add, Goodneſs of my attempt, ſo
I durſt truſt the Succeſs of it to God, in
duty to whom I deſign'd it.</p>
            <p>As for my Method in it, I have not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followed the excellent <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> I never
yet engag'd my ſelf to a Nine years Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion
of what I formerly Read, nor have I
tied my ſelf to any Principles whatever,
abſolutely, whether Divine or Moral; I
always thought both thoſe courſes of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
advantage to him that ſtudies Wiſdom,
in truth rather Obſtacles than Aſſiſtants.</p>
            <p>Indeed in this I have imitated him, I
have Meditated moſt freely; but withal,
I have both Read and Heard too: for my
part, I have neither fear'd Errors, nor
been jealous of my Genius; but I have
truſted it freely, as it were upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
in my Judgment, that at all hazards
'twould be ſincere to me, nay, and in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and againſt all prejudices whatever.</p>
            <p>And to this purpoſe I perus'd all the
Books I could come near; nor did I care
on what Subject, ſo they were Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
for my Deſigns were after an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Reformation of Learning; and tho'
I deſign'd, in a manner, to Re-build all
a-new, yet I did not think to be ſo ill an
Husband, as to tear up all the Old Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65770:13"/>
where I found them ſound and
ready before me.</p>
            <p>So that, by this means, I Collected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
without end; I took the Notion, and
left the Dreſs; nay, and I carefully ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
what I thought might be of uſe, and
left what I ſaw as needleſs: I did it but
in Sentences indeed at firſt, becauſe I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for only Matter, and not Form: but
then I did it carefully, that if poſſible I
might not leave any thing material that
I ſhould not reduce to its proper Head.</p>
            <p>Indeed, in my Method how to deliver
it to the World, I was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
for as I ſaw that to heap up
Precepts without Order, were to make
them uſeleſs: ſo on the other hand, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
to tye my ſelf to a clear coherence,
were a burthen intollerable; and beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
not conſiſtent with thoſe perpetual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
that would be neceſſary to a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Idea.</p>
            <p>I choſe therefore a Mean for my Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and as ſuch a looſe Eſſay, a Body that
could either Retract or Dilate, ſo I choſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
rather to deliver my <hi>Eſſays</hi> in Confuſion
than Order; for ſince ſo vaſt a Subject
could not rationally ſeem to bear an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
coherence; I did not ſee why I
ſhould affect it, eſpecially when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65770:13"/>
that ſuch a careleſs change and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
would not only eaſe and delight my
ſelf, but my <hi>Reader</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, Wiſdom, in full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is too great for Man: and, as one
would reduce that uſeful part of her, that
is within our capacities, to an apt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
brevity for uſe, ſo withal, one
would not arrogantly think to force her
to Bounds too exact for the reach of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality:
as I deſpair'd therefore of ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
any preheminence in her, by the
vigour of any ſingle attempt, ſo I rather
choſe to leave my Method freely to an
eaſie looſneſs, that might be apt for any
Addition or Amendment.</p>
            <p>Whether what I have now done, may
be ever done fuller or better, I cannot
tell; I am ſure it has mine own full Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
in it, and I ſhould have been glad
with all my heart, could I have met with
a Companion, to have improv'd and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
my Deſigns: but 'tis generally
the Misfortune of Men, who are Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in ſo great and laborious Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
to be forced to walk alone.</p>
            <p>I have no more to trouble thee with in
this place, except it be that thou excuſe
the Roughneſs of my Stile; remember
'tis Collective, and though by pains I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65770:14"/>
might make it more Correct, yet I hope
already 'tis ſufficient for Uſe, if not for
Ornament. Oratory was never agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the rigidneſs of my Genius, I could
never yet leave Matter to catch at Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes,
and gather Flowers.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Niceties of Curious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
are infinite; and I am ſenſible, that
after my greateſt care, I muſt Write with
a Style and Method imperfect, or not
venture at Five Words a day: Pure Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in all things in only God's; and
when a Man has once atchiev'd in any
thing the full ſtrength of his Genius, what
he attains after, is but by Sallies, and at beſt
makes but Abrupt, Imperfect, and Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Efforts.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I Court thee thus
with Apologies? if thou art <hi>Ingenious,</hi> thou
canſt not but follow thine own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
If thou art <hi>Humourſom,</hi> I had as
good endeavour to embrace the Wind,
as to move thee. Whether therefore thou
likeſt me or not, I am not deceived in
thee: That Man muſt think of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
Contraries, yea Impoſſibilities,
that aim at Captivating all Men, the
Perverſe and Tractable, the Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and the Modeſt, the Virtuous and

Ignorant, with the ſame <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>

'Tis full time now to ſweep away theſe
Cobwebs of Superſtition, and Relicks of
Paganiſm; were we to contract with the
Devil, then theſe Little Blinds might be
wiſely ſet to Diſguiſe the Predictions he
acquaints us with, and to ſeem to tell
that little Fore-knowledge he hath, by our
own Skill; but for us otherwiſe to dive
into Senſeleſs, Groundleſs, and Irrational
ways of Prediction, I declare, in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
is ſuch a meer ſtupidity and
weakneſs, that we had much better caſt
the Dye for our Fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>So, would not a Man of Moderate
Thought be aſham'd to imagine, that God
has given an Extraordinary Power of
Conjuring by his Name <hi>Tetragrammaton
Adonay Sadai,</hi> &amp;c. So, Who but a
Madman would think the Number Five
Cabaliſtically ſanctified, becauſe a Man
has Five Fingers, Five Toes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo
who but one that has more Fancy than
Judgment would mind the Climacterical
Years, when indeed the year is ſince
much lengthened? yea, ſeveral days
ſince that Whymſey was firſt broach'd,
ſo that 61 now would have been 63
then.</p>
               <p>So, that ſhall I ſay of our Common
Croſſes and Charms? the Devil fights
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65770:19"/>
with us, like a <hi>Parthian,</hi> flying; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
himſelf to be vanquiſh'd by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that he may the better Conquer us
through Superſtition by his flight? So
what ſhall I ſay to your Set-form of
Words, the <hi>Seeve</hi> and <hi>Sheers,</hi> and your
other Trifles and Gewgaws? If words
do any thing really, it muſt be through
Faith, and if Faith be once ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it can eaſily effect without a Set-form,
like Conjuring; but if Words
prove powerful without Faith, <hi>Latet
anguis in herba,</hi> we have all the Reaſon
in the World to apprehend ſome Deluſion
from our Common Enemy the Devil.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed, with all the Power of the
Devil himſelf, are we likely to do or
know much, whatever our Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Rebellion may promiſe us; Alaſs;
the Devils are under perpetual Chains of
Darkneſs, the beſt of their Oracles were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
doubtful; and if God has denied
the Foreknowledge of things even to the
good Angels themſelves, as Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
us, How is it likely he ſhould ſhew
a greater Favour to the Wicked Apoſtate
Spirits?</p>
               <p>So we are curious in other Predictions;
we are deſirous of an exact Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
alaſs, Shall we never be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65770:19"/>
with the plainer Diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence?
Is God obſcure and myſtical in
his Propheſies, even to lead his Church
its ſelf? And ſhall we deſire preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
a Prerogative he has not vouchſafed
even to the Univerſal Church; nay, and
when all the Pious and Learned Men of
Ages have not been able to unfold thoſe
Holy Propheſies that in the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
and otherwiſe he has given us? Can we
be ſo mad to expect, or rely upon more
certain Predictions of their own?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if there be any Divination law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it muſt be through the ſigns of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Cauſes; thus Chriſt himſelf allows
to Divine by the Face of the Sky.

what a pack of Brats and Monſters <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology</hi>
brings forth with it; it marks you
out Natural Magick by Planetary Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Characters on Herbs; it tells you
Mens Fortunes by Figures, the Planets
make through Moles, Lines, and other
Marks; and hence it teaches you <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romancy,
Phyſiognomy, Metapoſcopy,</hi> nay <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury</hi>
depends on the ſame Root; and not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65770:23"/>
a Bird that flies to the right, but portends
Ill-luck, though to a Thouſand Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
indeed, there is not a Man, either
Mad, Bewitch'd, or Propheſies, but ſtreight
the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> will give you a Reaſon for
it; though by and by again, to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at a Fault, he will tell you, a Good
Man is above the Stars.</p>
                  <p>Thus Teleſmes, or Taliſmans alſo, and
our Divining Rods, are a Spawn of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;</hi>
but, in my Judgment, of juſt as much
force as Powder of Poſt, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and then I don't
know but a Man may do feats, like the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians, but by the power of
the Devil, and not by our little Conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Blind Arts, unleſs Ceremonially; for
my part I once made a Teleſme of <hi>Venus</hi>
my ſelf in Silver, but found no more effect
in the Mettal than before. So <hi>Brown</hi> in
his <hi>Vulgar Errours,</hi> ſays, he tried the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vining
Rod, but he found it all Cheat and
Deceit.</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>Geomancy</hi> is another Off-ſpring
of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> indeed her very Ape, for ſhe
follows her into her Diviſions and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Houſes, <hi>&amp;c. Cornelius Agrippa</hi> wrote
a Book of this; and in his Treatiſe of the
Vanity of <hi>Arts and Sciences</hi> tells you, he
believes it as good as the beſt; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65770:23"/>
that it is all Lyes. And indeed,
What an odd Chymera Foundation this
Art has, that Men, by making Points
backwards, with their Left-hands upon
the ground, ſhould fancy the Stars ſhould
lead them, by drawing thoſe Points into
Figures, to Predict by them; a Man had
better by half beſtow leſs pains, caſt a
pair of Dice, or dip a Leaf in <hi>Virgil,</hi> if
he is reſolved to be Superſtitious, and ſo
diſcover his Fortune that way, rather than
run himſelf to the Niceties of <hi>Geomantick</hi>
Houſes, and Fathers, your <hi>Laetitia,</hi> &amp;c.
for it.</p>
                  <p>So I cannot but wonder too, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
and of what Planet it was
that taught us the Juriſdiction of Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Days and Hours? 'twas very happy
the Natural Day was not divided into
Twenty Hours, as it is now into Twenty
four; for if it had, our Divinors had been
forc'd to have made a New Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
beſides, that as it is, every Planet has
not his equal ſhare in the day, And why
ſhould he not have it in the Day, as well
as he has it in the Week?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſtrology</hi> therefore, if it ſerves for any
thing, it is to be as the Devils Lure into the
more obſcure and black Receſſes of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick:</hi>
I my ſelf remember too well, what
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65770:24"/>
Studies it wheedled me into, when <hi>I</hi> gave
it the favour of my Thoughts; as firſt,
to ſeek to the Planets intelligences for my
Knowledge, and after to other Spirits:
Now, though <hi>I</hi> reſolv'd to pay an exact
deference to the Duty <hi>I</hi> ow'd to God all
the while, yet <hi>I</hi> could not, in a long time,
perſwade my ſelf, but that ſuch Arts, as in
the caſe of <hi>Balaam,</hi> might be lawfully
attainable, though at length <hi>I</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
they were preſumptuous.</p>
                  <p>But where ſhall we end the further
Whimſies of Predictions? <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Lot,
Predicting by the Number of our Names,
the Jewiſh Caballa telling Myſteries, and
Prognoſticating from Titles, Numbers
and Letters; your <hi>Roſacrucian Figments,</hi>
what ſhall <hi>I</hi> ſay, Do not Men deſerve
to be deceiv'd, when they imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to catch ſuch ſhadows of Wiſdom?
indeed, 'tis their due reward, that they
miſs and loſe the ſubſtance by it.</p>
                  <p>So what ſhall we ſay to <hi>Hydromancy,
Puromancy,</hi> and <hi>Aeromancy,</hi> nay and <hi>Alect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romancy,</hi>
that fore-tells by the pecking up of
Corn by a Cock, Are they not trumpery,
that ſcarce deſerve the naming? So of
<hi>Palmeſtry;</hi> How ſhall we reconcile the
giddy and ſenſeleſs contradictions and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
of <hi>Authors</hi> about it? So in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65770:24"/>
Who but one that had it from
ſome <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Star-Intelligence,</hi> could be
brought to think any uſeful or certain
ground in it? Only Man that runs a
Whoring out of the Ways of Truth, ſeeks
to, and believes every thing he ſhould not.
Or elſe who would fancy, that <hi>Mars</hi> muſt
be thruſt into the Palms of the Hand,
while little <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> have the
honour to poſſeſs in chief, with the grand
Planets, the Thumb and little Finger?</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe, there are <hi>Omens</hi> alſo,
the weakeſt of all Fore-tellings; but how
often of fatal conſequence, not from the
Prediction I mean, but from the deadning
the ſpirits of them that ſuperſtitiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, <hi>I</hi> need not mention; indeed
they are ſo uncertain, that their very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi>
are forc'd to fly to the Mind of
the Perſon <hi>Omen'd,</hi> and what conception
he had of the accident, to Conſtrue it;
and which is, in ſhort, to make Mens
Thoughts and Fancies Predictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror was an evident
confirmation of this Truth; at his firſt
Landing in <hi>England,</hi> his Foot ſlip'd, and he
fell flat on the Earth; and the Morning
he fought, his Eſquire put on his Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
before, by miſtake. Now theſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
daunted ſome, but the Conqueror
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65770:25"/>
Interpreted them beſt, who merrily ſaid,
the Fall ſhew'd the Earth was willing to
be acquainted with him; and the change
of his Armour ſhew'd, he was to change
his Dukedom for a Kingdom, as it after
hapned.</p>
                  <p>As for Propheſies, when they relate to
State-Affairs, they are dangerous; and have
deſervedly drawn down many good Laws
to ſuppreſs them, not that they are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
in themſelves neither; but that
which gives them credit, is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Men
mark when they Hit, and never when
they Miſs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Nature of Man,
which loves to turn all to Divination, calls
even probable Conjectures, and obſcure
Traditions, Propheſies; And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> and
laſtly, that almoſt all of them being near
infinite in number, have been Impoſtures,
and by idle and crafty Brains, meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
and feign'd, after the event paſt,
with ſome evil deſign and influence on
the preſent times.</p>
                  <p>But why do I ſtay ſo long upon Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars?
Where ſhall we end the more noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<hi>Theurgy,</hi> Devilliſh <hi>Geocy</hi> and <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy?</hi>
as if the Devil could not perſonate
a Ghoſt: So where ſhall we conclude,
with the Faeiry Siſters, the Inviſible Ring
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65770:25"/>
                     <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Conjuration,</hi> the uſe of

ſinks them into all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,

out upon the Antient Uſe of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in other Kingdoms, which, by its very
Name, I am perſwaded a great many
Learned Men are not unacquainted with;
I ſhall wholly confine my ſelf therefore to
ſhew, of what a General and Great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
ſuch an Office muſt needs be to this
preſent City; and, in doing that, I ſhall
fully Anſwer my End in this Little <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that I may the better do that,
therefore, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall, briefly as I can,
give the particular State of ſuch an Office.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall Anſwer all manner of
Objections againſt it: And <hi>Thirdly</hi> and
laſtly, I ſhall ſhew the wonderful Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of it; And in all theſe I ſhall be
the ſhorter, becauſe the very hinting at
the Great Uſes and Conveniences of it,
will be ſufficient to excuſe all need of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Apologies for it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Reflections upon this Table, are theſe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all things Found ſhall be
Valued, at a Rate, by Appraiſement, and
that if any Difficulty ariſe between the
Finder and Loſer, ſo it ſhall be decided,
each of them chooſing an Appraiſor, and
if they ſhall not agree, nor find an Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in two days, that then the Office
ſhall do it for them; and that ſhall be
Deciſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:65770:30"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If either finder or looſer, or the
Lord on Eſcheate, in two days notice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to appoint their Appraiſors; that then
the Office upon both or either of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults,
ſhall be able to get Appraiſors to
ſet a value, and to give the finder his due
thereon, and to keep the Goods, or ſell
them, if periſhable, and keep the Mony
till the Looſer, or the Lord of the Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhall allow him both his, and the finders
Fees.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That all things enclos'd, as
Writings in a Box, Mony in a Bag, or
Cloaths in a Trunk, ſhall not be open'd
till the Looſer come, or the Lord of the
Royalty claim them; but that then the
Finder may have them to be open'd, to
be Apprais'd, or otherwiſe as he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, before they be deliver'd out of the
Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That all things of real value,
the Office ſhall be ready on bringing in to
receive, and to give the Finder his due
immediately; but for Dogs Pocket-Books,
and Keys, it ſhall reſerve them to give an
account of them, or elſe make an Entry
where they are to be found, as the caſe
ſhall reaſonably require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If Goods, periſhable are found,
that then the Finder and Office ſhall have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65770:30"/>
power in convenient time, to ſell them by
Appraiſors, and ſo to be anſwerable for
the Mony only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That if any thing above 20 <hi>s.</hi>
value be found, that it remain in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at leaſt a Week, that the Right Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
be not cheated by a Colluſion of the
Finder; So if Goods, or Money, above
20 <hi>l.</hi> value be found, that they remain in
the Office a Months, before they be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
except the Pretended Loſer give in
Security for their Forth-coming; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Month, that they be delivered him
only on a Note of the Loſers place of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
and quality, to inform after Claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That all Pocket-books, or
Dogs that are found, ſhall be valued as at
5 <hi>s.</hi> and Keys of all ſorts, as at 12 <hi>d.</hi> to
avoid all Diſputes; and that Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
by which the Mony might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
ſhall be valued as Mony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> That all things under 20 <hi>s.</hi>
value ſhall be forfeited to the Lords of the
Royalty, if not called for in ſix weeks;
and all things under 10 <hi>l.</hi> value, if not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for in a Quarter of a year: As for all
things, of a greater value, to remain a
Year and a day, as the Law directs before,
the Lord to have them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65770:31"/>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let no Man think that to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to the Finder and Office, in this caſe,
12 <hi>l. 10 s.</hi> in the Hundred, is too much;
for, as when he is in hazard of all, it's well
if ſo little will procure it; ſo indeed, leſs
will not be ſufficient, either to incourage
the Finder, to bring in what he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
or to Anſwer the truſt and hazard
of the Office in Keeping and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
it.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The <hi>Objections</hi> that ſeem likely to be
made in this Caſe, are theſe;</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſuch an Office will deſtroy
Royalties.</p>
                  <p>As to that I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> 'twill rather vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promote them: For, as now, all Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are Conceal'd; ſo, by this Means,
they being Diſcover'd, they will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd
of them: indeed in this caſe they
will be forc'd to make ſome allowance
to the Office and Finder for their Care;
but that ſurely will be Reaſonable, when
'tis no more than is required of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Gazette</hi> will be
wrong'd in their Publications.</p>
                  <p>But as to that I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> It muſt needs
be very inconſiderable; For Publications
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65770:31"/>
there are generally of Dogs ſtolen of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and of Horſes, and of other things loſt
in the Country; and, as to thoſe, you ſee,
this Office gives no diverſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this may be apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Thieves; but, as to that, I ſay, on
the contrary, that it cannot but be the
greateſt diſincouragement to them imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
for when they who have loſt, or
been rob'd of their Goods, ſhall repair to
this Office, and make their Entry of them
there, not only the Office will be ready to
ſeize them, but every one that happens on
ſuch Suſpicious Goods, will know ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where to repair to know whoſe they
are, and whereupon a Diſcovery muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That we ſhall want power to
make the Loſers, and Lords of Royalties
allow the Fees of finding, and the Fees of
the Office; but, as to that I propoſe, we
may be effectually help'd by an <hi>Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi>
if not, by the <hi>King's Patent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But you will ſay, What Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
ſhall the Loſer and Finder have, not
to be wrong'd by the Office? I ſay, they
ſhall have a Publick Security given in by
him that keeps the Office, to ſee that
what ever is left there ſhall be forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Office-Books lying always
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65770:32"/>
Publick, they ſhall make their Entries, if
they pleaſe themſelves; and if Goods of
Value be found, the Office ſhall be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the Finder, that it give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to have a juſt Appraiſe<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nt, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
it, before the Goods are deliver'd to
the Loſer; and in the ſame manner ſhall
the Lord's Right be ſecured alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> But you will continue to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that Finders will ſtill conceal their
Goods and Mony notwithſtanding: I
ſay, to prevent that, a Clauſe in ſuch an
<hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> That if the Finder
bring not in the Goods or Mony within a
Week after they are found, he ſhall not
only loſe the Profit of ſuch his Finding to
the Informer, but be liable to an Action
of Trover, with treble Damages on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
I ſay, ſuch a Clauſe would make

                  <head>The Benefits of ſuch an Office, would be
ſuch as theſe.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> You ſee this Office will be as a

as Threaten a return of Found

Goods; For when Men ſee they may
have honeſtly a good Reward, they will
ſcarce, by being diſhoneſt, hazard the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all, and paying for it too, by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former,
which, in the preſent Caſe, they
will be in great danger of, eſpecially
when we conſider, that Finders have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
too much Joy to be Silent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An Informer, in this Caſe,
would be ſo far from a contemptible and
ſervile Office, that it would not be too
mean, even for a Gentleman to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take;
and, though he might give his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to whom he would, yet, in honour,
he might aſſiſt any one, when ſo baſely
and meanly injur'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As nothing is ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that ſome People have not a Fancy
for; ſo nothing ſcarce can be of ſo little
a value, that this Office would not draw

tempt thither, even things of Six pence
worth; and he, that in ſuch caſe, will not
care to carry the thing to the Office him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
will not want ſome one or other, that
he might oblige by it.</p>
                  <p>So that the benefit of ſuch an Office

                  <p>In ſhort, if Uſe and Innocency can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
any thing, this Office has all the

his own Thoughts, and not be convinc'd
of it, and that even in many things not

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That for the eaſe of Finders,

Mony be fetch'd daily from thoſe places
of Receipt, about the hours of 8 and 12
each day; So that Goods left in the

for a certainty in the Afternoon; and thoſe

at the one Principal and only Office of
Delivery.</p>

able to loſe their Rights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Goods being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
to the General-Office, the Finder
may receive notice when to meet at an
Appraiſement, if he has not receiv'd his
due before; and the Loſer may know what
his demands are; ſo that, if he agree to
them, there will be no more, but that the

                  <p>But as for the Entry of Suſpicious Goods
to be ſeiz'd, that as it ought to be in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct

               <p>THe Cunning Man and the Wiſe
Man differ not only in point of
Honeſty, but Ability. He that can pack
the Cards does not always play well.</p>
               <p>Cunning Men, like Juglers, are only
vers'd in two or three Little Tricks, while
Wiſdom excels in the whole Ring or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Action.</p>
               <p>But is Wiſdom to be deſpis'd, becauſe
others ſculk through their Cunning? Shall
a General abandon all Diſcipline, becauſe
his <hi>Parthian</hi> Foe fights flying? No; rather
diſcovering his petty ſhifts, let him deſtroy
him in his Wiles.</p>
               <p>Surely, Cunning Men are too weak for
Council; for Practice, and Underſtanding
Men, indeed, they may do well enough;
but he abuſes himſelf that turns them out
of their Channel, and truſts them.</p>
               <p>Were Men always Skilful, they would
never uſe Craft or Treachery: Alaſs! that
Men are Cunning, is from their little
Minds, which, if it can conceal its ſelf in
one place, quickly diſcovers its ſelf in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Hence the Cunning Man is as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65770:35"/>
as odious; while the greateſt art of ſuch
Subtile Men is, to conceal their Skill; the
wiſer ſort of them know therefore their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and are Subtile only on ſome great
Occaſion, and for ſome great Advantage.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he that is out of the plain way to
deceive others, has not ſo ready a proſpect
of the Cheats deſign'd againſt him; ſo
that not only a Man is ſooneſt deceiv'd,
when his conceit of Cunning beats him
from his Guard; but Cunning Men are
afraid of us, when they ſee an exact ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>
               <p>And thus 'tis the Perfection of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to ſeem to fall into Snares laid for us,
for fear of worſe, and yet to avoid them;
but, by Subtilty, 'tis as eaſie to deceive ones
ſelf, and not perceive it, as 'tis difficult
unperceiv'd to deceive others.</p>
               <p>Uſual Tricks of Cunning, are, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
and faſcinate with the Eye, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in buſineſs, when our Friend is in haſt,
to ſurprize with bold Queſtions, and to
foyl, by Ungrateful and Unſeaſonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,

               <p>And yet Wiſdom conſiſts not in trifling

not only ſolidly pourtraictures Vertue,

               <p>The Fool hates Wiſdom as exceeding

it, as the Touch-ſtone to his Actions. But
ſurely he that hates Wiſdom: hates his
own Soul with it.</p>
               <p>Wiſdom is as our guard aſſign'd us by

               <p>Surely, 'twas by Wiſdom, that holy men

               <p>Was it nothing, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was skill'd
in all the Learning of the <hi>Aegyptians?</hi>
Surely, God had neither gather'd his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
into a Colledge at <hi>Bethel,</hi> nor made
the Learn'd St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the chiefeſt of the

So that when we have lookt for the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

And why may not we as well bring in
the <hi>Metaphoricum, Ironicum,</hi> and an 100
more? And ſo for your <hi>Voces abſtractae,
concretae, ſimplices, complexae:</hi> Why may
not you as well add, <hi>finitae, relativae,</hi> and
infinite others? In ſhort, Is not this
meer Trumpery, and fitter for a Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65770:39"/>
or a <hi>Caſtaneus's</hi> diſtinctions at beſt;
but ſurely, not worthy of a Philoſopher, to
ſtrut up a Science withall. Indeed it makes
Logick appear like a Gouty Leg, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Body of Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>So the Predicaments in new Philoſophy,
are:
<q>
                        <l>Mens, menſura, quies, motus, poſitura,
figura,</l>
                        <l>Sunt cum materia; cunctarum exordia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why may not theſe do as well as
<hi>Ariſtotles 10. Subſtantia, Quantitas, Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
Relatio, Actio, Paſſio, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi, Quando, Situs, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitus:
Ludovicus Vives</hi> is of opinion, that you
may add many more; and for my part I
think 'twere no hurt there were none at
all; indeed if they are of any uſe, 'tis to
help invention: and as for invention it
ought to be treated of diſtinctly, at leaſt
it belongs more to <hi>Rhetorick</hi> than <hi>Logick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So alſo, what Predicamental Diſtinctions
we have got, as <hi>Quantitas Entitativa, &amp;
quantitativa?</hi> So that there are five intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Habits under <hi>Quality, viz. Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
Sapientia, Scientia, Prudentia, &amp; Ars;</hi>
whereas they may as rationally make fifty,
and by the ſame reaſon diſtinguiſh every
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65770:40"/>
ſeveral Object of Wiſdom into a ſeveral
intellectual Habit.</p>
                  <p>And to ſhut up all I have to reflect of
this nature, I ſhall add, what has Logick
to do with Definitions? She is only to teach
men to reaſon: Let the Vocabulary help
them to Terms, particular Sciences to
Principles, and Definitions; her buſineſs
is only to caſt up the Account. So what
hath ſhe to do with Diviſions into Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
Eſſentials, Integrals, Subjects, Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let her leave all to their proper
places, to <hi>Analitica</hi> and Method, and the
Principles of the Subjects ſhe diſputes of.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of Arguments.</head>
                  <p>But as we would thus take away our
too formal Univerſity Diſputes, as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Quibling and Wrangling; ſo on
the other ſide, one would leave ſo much to
Art as might be able to lead a Diſpute to a
Criſis. Thus we ought to let our Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Definitions, Genus and Differences,
be laid down as <hi>Poſtulata</hi> or <hi>Principles;</hi> and
if they be denied, prove them from the
Fountain Topicks of Sciences.</p>
                  <p>So we ought to skill, how to run an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to a Contradiction or Abſurdity;
not I mean a Nice and Logical Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and Contrariety, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more Pedantick; but to a real and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65770:40"/>
obvious Contrariety and Inconſiſtency,
and under which every one ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and not to diſpute on, as if he aim'd at
Victory, and wrangle, rather than to
ſearch for Truth; and therefore, in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we ought to deſiſt, as if we had no
further Reaſon for what we firſt affirm'd:
Where we are ſenſible, we are not able
to make any thing further appear.</p>
                  <p>But as for your common Logical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
as I have ſaid nothing, is more
impertinent: Thus, that two <hi>Negatives</hi>
make an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> can only be from
cuſtom. Indeed, did Men follow the true
Concatenation of Thought, and were
they not more Artful than Wiſe; two
<hi>Negatives</hi> were Nonſenſe. So what need
have we of the puzle of Contrary, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrary,
Subaltern,</hi> and Contradictory; is
it not to maze us?</p>
                  <p>So when two Diſpute, is it not much
eaſier to bring all to the Teſt of a plain
Contradiction to find Truth, than to ſtand
quibling, <hi>Quidam homo eſt doctus, quidam
homo non eſt doctus?</hi> Indeed, as <hi>Cornelius
Agrippa</hi> well reflects, Logical Terms and
Niceties are like the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, which
tho not powerful enough to enter by force
of Reaſoning, yet when once admitted,
and taken for granted, will at leaſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65770:41"/>
baffle and deſtroy your Cauſe, by their
ſtarch'd and empty Formality.</p>
                  <p>And yet this we muſt needs grant of
Arguments in general, that they are as
much better for the growth of Wiſdom,
then Lectures as many Heads are than one.
As the Underſtanding is more lively when
whetted and ſharpned by Contention,
than when flat in its ſelf; but yet your
ſingle Diſcourſes are better than Diſputes,
when debauch'd to a perverſe Wrangling:
And hence, how often have our wiſeſt men
reflected on the Formality of Syllogyſms?</p>
                  <p>In the infancy of Philoſophy indeed, ſuch
a ſhew of Wiſdom were tolerable; but
ſuch Pedantry at theſe days, that the two
or three firſt Years of a Univerſity Students
time, ſhould be ſpent on ſuch Traſh, as
I remember too well, is intollerable.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, therefore as nothing but Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs
and Malice can come from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and Wrangling; ſo if you diſpute,
let nothing provoke or confound you. Is
your Adverſary hot? be calm and ſlow;
meaſure your Words as it were by the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum</hi>
of a Clock. Is he interrupting and
violent? Let him alone; 'tis eaſie after
an hours Diſcourſe by three or four words
quite to confound him, if he is in an Error;
and remember there is a way to Anſwer
ſhort and ſmart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65770:41"/>
But as in Set-Diſputes, for the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,
we ought to limit each ones ſhare
to a propoſition or two at a time. Thus
ſuppoſe it were only by <hi>Enthymems,</hi> that
we entertain'd our Diſputes; ſo we ought
never to admit of <hi>Metaphors</hi> or <hi>Similes</hi> in a
rigid Argument; to let a man diſpute us
ſo, is to let him fight in a Cloud, when he
ought to appear on equal Terms, and nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and ſo to grant the leaſt point in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
wrongfully, is a confuſing Folly; and
ſo not to be able to reduce your Argument
to particulars; what is it, but to make it
recoyle in its ſelf?</p>
                  <p>Are you in a Diſpute therefore, and do
you find your Adverſary perverſly through
a Spirit of Wrangling, to withſtand you
in clear and evident Principles of Truth?
Never ſuffer him to move you to further
Argument after that. If you have no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator,
ceaſe for good and all, ſtanding
firmly and eternally on the firſt Error. He
that admits the leaſt corner of a falſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
forgets that his whole Building
will ſurely fall by means of it; and beſides,
that Sophiſtry in its ſelf, is Diveliſh; and
when it has other ends than a fair and
candid ſearch for Truth, is to be hated
and avoided by all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65770:42"/>
Further in Arguments: Without you
are ſure to ſpeak alone, and not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
as in the Pulpit, never multiply
Reaſons; for ſince one or two is enough
for Conviction, and ſufficient moſt times
for an honeſt Mind; to alledge more, what
is it but to leave room for Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to give the better opportunity
for Wrangling?</p>
                  <p>But above all, in Diſputes you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to proceed from Words to Senſe;
for 'tis in vain to argue, when you do not
underſtand one anothers Terms: Nor is it
leſs neceſſary in your method to proceed
firſt to ſome Fundamental Principles, ſuch
as Self-Preſervation, Demonſtration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To
think of arguing otherwiſe, is weak and
fooliſh; and tho one would explode and
baniſh the Formality of Syllogiſms, yet
if one takes away the method of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of clearing firſt Terms, and granting
firſt Principles, one had better never ſpeak
than argue; for it muſt be endleſs.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to the laſt part of Logick or
Method.</p>

Method is for Matter, and not Matter for
Method. I muſt confeſs, as to general
Learning, I wholly eſteem Eſſays, firſt, as
by their ſhort and pithy fulneſs, they are
more apt and aſſiſtant to a complete Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And, Secondly, as by their looſeneſs,
they are moſt ready for Corrections and
Additions.</p>
                  <p>To write too largely of a Subject, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and diſtracts the Sight, and to write
too little of it, leaves determination to a Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
The beſt method therefore is to be
ſhort and full, to give moſt large and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
general Directions, and to leave the
judgment to manage leſſer Corollaries,
Particulars, and Conſequences; and as for
the advantage of ſuch good Methods, 'tis
ſcarce expreſſible; you will not think how
gently, and with what eaſe, even the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulteſt
parts of Wiſdom well rang'd,
will lye in our minds by it.</p>
                  <p>And in this one may juſtly ſay of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
the Diamond or Jewel is not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ready ſo ſoon as it is got; it wants
poliſhing and trimming, yea, and beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

even after it is gotten and obtain'd,
by exact Method and Order, to addreſs
it, and ſet it out to the beſt advantage.</p>
                  <p>In truth, Method is not much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
than Matter its ſelf; 'tis obvious
every day to obſerve how much deliberate
and orderly proceeding, confounds even
truth when irregular. Indeed, Method
is a ſort of Truth, and Confuſion a Lie,
and as generally Men judge of the Cauſe
by the Proceedings, by a kind of precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
and haſte in Judgment; ſo thoſe

                  <p>As for the form of Method in General,
'tis beſt to purſue the Order of Fact, and

may know the better how, and to what
to bind their Attention, and then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

take care that nothing be either wanting

               <head>Of <hi>ANGER.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THere is an Anger from Pride, and an
Anger from Complexion more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable,
but ſurely neither tolerable when
raiſed to a Paſſion.</p>
               <p>The Picture of a full Paſſion'd Anger
is a <hi>Tiger</hi> bath'd in Blood, aſſailing, fierce,
cruel and inexorable: And can any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
then juſtifie a Vice ſo inhumane,
and barbarous?</p>
               <p>As <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, Anger appears like ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
which breaks its ſelf upon all it falls.
While the Man in Anger is out of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of his own Mind, he's like the vext
Bee, that ſtings all, nay equally the next
unconcerned Perſon, as his Enemy: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimamque
in vulnere ponit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all, Malice and a ſetled Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
are moſt pernicious. If Anger is
able to endanger our Quiet and Safety;
What muſt Malice do? Surely a ſetled
Anger, or Malice, muſt needs tear up the
very Roots of Humane Society.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Anger leaves neither room nor
mercy for failty or miſtake. Be there
but a poſſibility that the Adverſary is in
the right, yet is the Angry Man in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65770:45"/>
to conſider and do him Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſays, <hi>Be Angry and ſin
not.</hi> Learn to turn the courſe of your
Anger therefore, and inſtead of ſhewing a
bitterneſs, and an irrevocable reſentment
of Indignation, learn the Courage to
change it to Pity.</p>
               <p>Above all, beware of revealing Secret,
and of Bitter Words, whether Rayling or
Satyr in your Anger; For why ſhould you
be perfidious in the one caſe, and add need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
fuel to an unreaſonable fire in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>Alaſs! Man is ſuch a touchy thing, and
yet ſo unconſtant, that almoſt all his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
depend upon his opportunity and
temper. To day he bears Abuſe, without
meaſure; and, to morrow, every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of Contempt and Reputation whets
the Edge of his Reſentment.</p>
               <p>Undoubtedly therefore, Anger is the
Child of Weakneſs and Baſeneſs. Is it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to a well-ballanc'd temper and
courage, and a due reſolution, to make even
deſperate efforts of reſentment for trifles?</p>
               <p>Women, Children, Sick Men, and Old
Folks, we may juſtly allow them to be
Angry, as fit Subjects for the Weakneſs of
Paſſion; but Men ſhould be above it, and
learn to make others tremble, while

begin with evil words, Do you know
what actions they may lead you to?</p>

reaſonably expect to ſtop the ſtream, that

               <p>The Scripture ſays, <hi>He that hates his
Brother is a Murderer.</hi> And you ſee, not

The Laws of God and Man allow us
even to kill another in our own defence;
nay, whether Chaſtity, or a Limb be only
threatned; yet even then we are excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But ſhall I deſtroy my Brother for

               <p>What though mine Enemy is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

diſtruſt the Providence of God in
my Protection, ſo as to kill him for it
therefore?</p>
               <p>But above all, the Self-murderer is
the moſt ſtupidly preſumptuous. What,
ſhall I fly in the Face of my Maker, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his Trials of Patience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Virtues, nay, and for which he
has Promis'd to Reward me in another
World?</p>
               <p>What, now that I am as Gold in the
Furnace to be tried, will I rather Rebel
againſt his Will? nay, and if I do, What
can I think my God to be, either Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or Juſt, and not expect but that as
he at firſt gave me a Talent of Life, ſo he
will Reſuſcitate it again to an unhappy
Immortality for my contempt of him?</p>
               <p>The World, I know, has Sainted ſome
Self-murderers, as for Chaſtity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe:
But can the World excuſe
ſuch ſhuffles to the Maſculine Trials of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65770:47"/>
God's Afflictions? Are we to live and
die to God, or to Fantome Honour, and
Humour?</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; 'Tis eaſie and light to
die: The Women in ſome Countries burn
in Complement, with their Deceas'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands;
And what then, ſhall we be leſs

to be of the Nobler Sex?</p>

               <head>OF <hi>REVENGE.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>REvenge is to be Rooted out as Wild
Juſtice. A firſt wrong does but
offend the Law, but Revenge puts the Law
out of Office: Surely when Government
is once eſtabliſhed, Revenge belongs to
none but the Law and God.</p>
               <p>And yet the Vice of Revenge ſhall not
keep me from a lawful Reſentment; nay,
I am as ſtrongly bound to Self-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as againſt Revenge; and even St.
<hi>Paul</hi> would not refrain Appealing to
<hi>Caeſar</hi> to Redreſs his Injuries.</p>
               <p>So the ſame Chriſt that bid us turn the
one Cheek when the other was ſmitten,
yet could himſelf Whip out thoſe that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65770:47"/>
defiled the Temple: And even ſo I, while
I bear anothers Injuries, through miſtake
or frailty, ſurely I may well chooſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to let him ſlave me by it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, Providence can reign in even
the furiouſeſt Tyrants, to Protect us, but
ſhall that Enthuſiaſtically make me ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
my ſelf a Prey to corrupt Men?</p>
               <p>But has my Brother, as I have ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
me through inadvertency, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents?
'tis noble to forgive him; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
would equal us, but Pardon makes
me Superior; and beſides, is it prudent to
rub a Sore to keep it from healing?</p>
               <p>So, Does your Enemy Vow to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
on you? Anſwer him, I Vow I
will perſwade you to be better Minded
if I can. Whatever others are, Can that
excuſe you of your invincible Chriſtian
Charity?</p>
               <p>To conclude, I will dread Revenge
where I have injur'd my Brother; but
when I have offer'd him Reparation, I'll
force my ſelf through a Chriſtian Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
to Satisfaction and Content, and
only be ſorry my Brother has ſo much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

               <p>ARt thou ſorry, my Friend, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
have ſuch Variances and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Ideas? Thou art ſorry then becauſe
they are not Angels: for, as we are Men,
we cannot but Err; and if we Err, 'tis
impoſſible but that we muſt differ. What
remains then to Reconcile us, or preſerve

               <p>Think of this therefore, my Friend, and
pity Mankind in their Weakneſs; do not
enter into Contention, but bear with a
Mercy like God's; nor deſpair, but do all

what <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid to <hi>Melancton,</hi>
when he was too anxious about the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the late great Reformation, <hi>Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65770:48"/>
Melancton <hi>eſſe rector mundi:</hi> Why
ſhould <hi>Melancton</hi> take upon him the Cares
proper to God? For though Man may
Reaſon even Divinely, yet 'tis only God
that can give Conviction, and diſſolve the
ſtubborn Heart.</p>
               <p>Beſides, as a Rational Man, I may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
give my Advice to Reform the
World, as 'tis every Man's Duty, where
he lawfully may and can: But I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
againſt all the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if I ſeek to Impoſe it on others. Is
the VVorld Corrupt? why, and even my
very Knowledge of its Corruption is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain:
And how dare I then preſume
too freely to be its Reformer? I may do
well to Pray to God to Inſpire apt Perſons
in a lawful way therefore, or elſe I ſin;
that with my known weak Performances
I encreaſe the Confuſion.</p>
               <p>You think what you would enforce
thus, may be of uſe and benefit; and it
may be ſo; But will you on the hazard
of that preſume on all the Conſequences
of your Proceedings, and how far you may
ſtir up others to diſturb the Peace by it?
Nay, ſpeak from your Conſcience, Do
not you often vary even in your own
thoughts, and with your ſelf? And can
you expect then to ſet up a better Sect
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65770:49"/>
than ſome already are? Or if you can,
Can you aſſure your ſelf the benefit will
exceed the Blood and Diviſions that may
be occaſion'd by it?</p>
               <p>Alaſs! our beſt and only method to
reconcile theſe our Differences in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is, by ſetting up, or impoſing nothing
on no hand, but reaſſuming the Antient and
Apoſtolick Liberty; more eſpecially a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
is fairly and humbly to be deſired,
where moſt likely, and where there is moſt
Judgment; and therefore I may add,
that if the Magiſtracy to whom we
ought to addreſs in this caſe, and who
ought to be the ſtrong Treſpaſs on their
weaker Brethren, by impoſing on them,
though never ſo innocently, the People
will hardly ever be induc'd to a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to it, though never ſo reaſonable, be
it almoſt only for the very Impoſition
ſake.</p>
               <p>But for Private Reformers, and Quacks
in Religion, Who ſhall ſet any bounds
to their Giddy Methods? In truth, one
may ſay of all ſuch Men, that they have
rather Eſſay'd than proceeded in any
thing like a Reformation, while the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Embrio has turn'd to a Monſter
in the Womb: Alaſs! the beſt of them
have not ſaid ſufficient Fundamental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65770:49"/>
to ſupport or continue it by; and, in
truth, when I conſider this, I wonder not
that their <hi>Flocks go aſtray,</hi> when even as
the <hi>Poet</hi> Sings, <hi>Their Guides themſelves
know not the Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, I have a fair <hi>Syſtem,</hi> ſays one,
and a ſecond ſets up another, and ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And pray what muſt the State
do in this Matter? She is in equal Peril if
ſhe diſregard either, and all have an equal
right to her Hearing: Nay, one tells her,
ſhe is <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> a Second, That ſhe
has the Spirit; A Third, The Dominion
is founded in Grace; And a Fourth, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates
the Supremacy: In ſhort, all would
fain make the State a Property, and Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue
the Sword out of her Hand.</p>
               <p>If She accept one, She's Damn'd by the
reſt; and if She accepts none, like young
Vipers, rather than fail of their Birth,
they'll eat through their Mothers Womb:
And what then, ought She not to cruſh
ſuch Cockatrices Eggs in the Embrio, and
confound their Sanctified Treaſons for
God's ſake? And ſo, if She ſuffer them to
Clamour each other, She's in danger even
by that alſo. So that till you can convince us
Mankind will never diſagree in Reaſoning
theſe Methods and Principles of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo apparently againſt the Peace of States;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65770:50"/>
muſt needs be Seditious and Unlawful,
and after that I need not add Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>You ſay, alaſs! what you do or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
has none of theſe Evils in it; you
do not think to give any General Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
or to offend the State: But why do
you Write then what She will not bear,
and Publiſh Doctrines without Her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence?
Either you Write to be regarded,
or not; you are not ſo ridiculous I am
perſwaded, as to ſay the latter; if not,
can you aſſure your ſelf to Rule all your
Followers, to ſay, thus far you ſhall go, and
no further? or, if you are ſo ridiculous to
think ſo, Is the State bound to believe
you, and ſit ſtill while you Sowe your
Seeds of Diſcord in her Bowels? No,
from a ſmall Spark may riſe a mighty
Flame: And they who will not deſtroy
the Lions Whelp, may ſtrive in vain when
the Lion's Grown.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we forget our Saviour's Advice,
<hi>That we ought firſt to caſt ought the beam out
of our own eye, before we can expect to ſee
how to caſt out the mote out of our Brother's:</hi>
And hence, methinks, conſidering the
Corruption of the World, 'twere hard
to expect a Reformation Perfect, <hi>ſemel &amp;
ſimul,</hi> eſpecially without the Immediate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65770:50"/>
Power of God; and yet, methinks, we
might all have had the Wit in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
not to be offended at Trifles, and
to have Joyn'd againſt the <hi>Roman Wolf:</hi>
But alaſs! our New Reformers are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
into as great Errors of their own,
and our Corruptions will not let us U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
               <p>But you will Object then, What, is it
never lawful to Reform Publickly, but
when the State will give you leave? No,
ſurely: And, in truth, Can you juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it? Can you value your little pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Opinions before the Publick Good?
you ſee plainly, that if this Liberty of
Zeal be allow'd, it muſt Deſtroy the
State: The caſe then is, Which muſt
ſtand, Religion or Government? I mean
your little Model of Religion, or the
State? Surely, as Populous as the World
now is, we had better have none of your
Religion, than no Government: And
therefore if we conſult the Good of God's
Creation, we ought rather to omit our
little Speculations, than Diſturb the
State with them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if every Prejudic'd Reaſoner
were allow'd of himſelf to Diſturb the
State, and to ſet up a New Religion,
Would it not rather Diſtract than Help
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65770:51"/>
the VVorld? But, no, you ſay, you are
ſure you are in the Right: No, you are
Proud: VVhat! Did you never err?
and if you did, VVhat Aſſurance have
you that you do not now? Nay more;
were you ſure you had even the Standard
of Truth; yet ought you not to take this
Liberty? Not, I mean, that any Man
can reach that Perfection; but to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
all Proud Thoughts, I ſay, we
ought to forbear ſuch a Liberty: For
what, Might not many Men think they
might juſtly leave your Standard Truth,
and yet follow your Preſumption.</p>
               <p>Nay, and if I undertake to reform Men,
and know I can do it but Imperfectly,
What do I do by it, but give Offence? <hi>Chriſt</hi>
refrain'd Doctrines, becauſe Men could
not bear them, though he knew how to
Inſtruct them: And what ſhall we Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
then to Teach, what not only Men
cannot bear, but what we know not
how to inſtruct? I would Reform the
World therefore, but I would not put
it into a greater Confuſion: I would put
my Neighbours Houſe in Order; but, I
would not Fire it about his Ears. And
what do I do otherwiſe, if I ſo much as
Countenance every little Reaſoning to be
able Saucily to Diſturb the State? Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65770:51"/>
Government! farewell every thing!
If this may be allow'd, who ſhall ſtint how
high ſuch Liberty may ariſe, and what Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
it may produce? Nay, may be at
laſt, even to reſiſt the Government its ſelf,
on pretence of unlawful proceſs againſt
ſuch Reaſoning, and conſequently to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy?</p>
               <p>Nor is it enough in ſuch caſe to ſay, that
the State is bound to ſee, that they prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
nothing but what is unlawful; for as
Good and Evil in this caſe is doubtful, ſo
the State ought therein to have an entire
Power or Liberty given them, or elſe you
had as good take all Power from them
whatever; when alaſs! in truth, as I
have ſaid, 'twere better there were no
Printing than no Government; and no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Teaching, or religious Inſtruction,
than no Laws.</p>
               <p>Government is the great and only hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Foundation of Religion: To deſtroy
Government therefore, or to diſturb it,
without a particular Revelation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Religion, What is it but to tear up
the Foundation for Materials to raiſe the
Building? nor is it enough in ſuch caſe, to
ſay, that you have a Charity for mens
Souls, and that ſuch Opinions are damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For pray, how come you to judge ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65770:52"/>
of Opinions? or what, have you got a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Warrant to ſhew us, That God has
flung all the Care of the World on your
Shoulders?</p>
               <p>If Chriſt's, or any others Revelation,
have threatned the wilfully ignorant or
perverſe, yet where is your Warrant
either to limit exactly their Damnatory
Sentences, or to raiſe new ones of your own?
If you modeſtly and peaceably offer your
ſenſe in ſuch caſe, you oblige Mankind in
reforming them, and they are engag'd to
you for your Charity. But if you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
either by Might or Calumny to force
them, may they not moſt juſtly ask? And
why have we not the ſame Right of force
on you alſo?</p>
               <p>But you ſay, your Zeal to God moves
you; Does it ſo? And how are you ſure
that it does not move others as well as you?
Beſides, that's ſtrange too; Can the God
of the World be better pleas'd that you
deſtroy his Creation, than that you omit
every little Speculation that you think will
tend to his Honour? And what do you
do otherwiſe, when that you but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſo dangerous a Work, as thus violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to innovate either in State or Religion,
againſt the leave of the Government?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:65770:52"/>
You ſay, God has wrought Deliverances
by ſuch Reformers; ſometimes 'tis true,
and ſo he has by Tyrants and Uſurpers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:
But muſt that juſtify their Methods?
or what think you, that God cannot ſtir
up Reformers where he ſees good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our preſumption?</p>
               <p>Men ſhould therefore think it enough,
that they are ſo happy as to have freedom
in themſelves, and thank God that they
have the Truth; and if they have a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the World, they ſhould ſhew it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,
and in Prayers, that God might
ſend as lawful &amp; real Reformers; and not
thus pragmatically confound us by ſuch
unaccountable Preſumptions of their own.</p>
               <p>And beſides, ſcarce one in the hundred
of ſuch Reformers, but what have miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
and if ever any have got Succeſs in
remedying Evils, they have too often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
new ones, and as bad of their own,
if not degenerated again to the firſt State;
ſo that at beſt, generally they have done
more hurt than the good propos'd. And,
thus we ſee how many have reform'd of
their own heads, and we ſee the effects of
ſuch Reformations, inſtead of reducing the
Church to a Primitive Purity; by them
they have but rent her into uncharitable
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65770:53"/>
and ſenſeleſs Diviſions, worſe I may almoſt
add, than even Popery her ſelf.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Can I expect to prevent all Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in my ſelf? or if I am ſo proud as
to think, I can, am I able to do it in my
Followers? if I cannot, therefore before I
hazard the miſchief of a Change, let me
conſider to what degree of good I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to Reform? nay more, may not God
be willing, that this Generation ſhould have
juſt ſuch a Diſpenſation of Knowledge?
and what, ſhall I croſs Providence then, or
deſtroy my ſelf to reform Mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will or no?</p>
               <p>God allows you to reprove perſonal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where ever you ſee them provided, but
conſiſtent with your ſafety; and ſo natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
ones alſo, where you are not in danger.
But when a Man or Nation becomes ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
as to turn again, and rent you for
your kindneſs, methinks you might rejoyce
that you are quit of your Office, in leaving
them to reform themſelves. And thus
alſo, there is a lawful Liberty for Writers,
and there is an abuſe of it; and there is a
convenient Liberty of ſuppreſſing Books
by a State, and a pernicious one: And thus
it is either the misfortune or the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a State to ſuppreſs thoſe Books that
might give them good Advice. But if it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65770:53"/>
is either, who ſhall call the State to account
for what it does?</p>
               <p>But to turn the method of mine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a little: Am I not preſumptuous to
go before God ſends me? And who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
theſe things at mine hand? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
were God reſolv'd to have ſuch a
Reformation, might not I as rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
he would impower ſome perſon order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Providence towards it, as he has
done before, through <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
without my preſumptuouſly going of my
own head?</p>
               <p>And indeed, were not this God's inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
method, Why ſhould God complain,
that men came that were not ſent, and
threaten them for it, as he does by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
if it were no Offence? and the common
miſſion of the Law of Nature were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
in truth a warrant that needs no
more to confute it, than to conſider: Should
every man take the full liberty of it, what
a World it would make?</p>
               <p>Not that I would mean from hence, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that the Law of Nature is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to direct every man privately in his
Duty: I am not ſo much a Pyroniſt as that
comes to neither. Nay, I think, that by the
light of Nature, and the common Aſſiſtance
of God's Spirit in our Conſciences, we may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65770:54"/>
very juſtly take the liberty to adviſe and
reprove one another; yea, and more that
publickly too, when the Law prohibits
not. But as I have ſaid, Shall this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Commiſſion only Authoriſe us to be
idle to other things, to teach others, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the Publick Quiet or Peace by it?
Surely we need a Warrant from God, like
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as well as a bare
Conviction of Conſciences, to proceed
thus far?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, this is cowardly, and
not to the bravery of a Martyrdom. I ſay,
it is: For tho' every man is bound to
ſtand to the truth, and confeſs it, even to
death; yet no man is bound to preach it,
or ſpread it to this degree, till he has a Call
to it; nor is it enough to ſay in this caſe,
That becauſe Chriſt would not let him be
ſilenc'd, that preach'd in his Name, that
therefore we may follow him without
ſome order; for if God will not deſtroy
our Trials, ſo as forcibly to obſtruct us in
our Ignorances, yet he does not therefore
require us to continue in them.</p>
               <p>Thus even Chriſt, did not go about pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to preach publickly, till he had the
Warrant and Protection of a Miſſion; nor
did <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elijah</hi> hazard themſelves till
God commanded them: And what, would
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65770:54"/>
I ſeem braver than they? Would God have
choſen <hi>Moſes,</hi> if his flight for being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer,
had been Cowardize and not Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Surely not; and that becauſe the
Apoſtles lived and continued in this hazard,
was withall, becauſe they were ſent.</p>
               <p>In ſhort then, ſhould I not be a Self-murderer
to run my ſelf into the fire? and
ſhould I not forfeit God's Protection from
<hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> to arrogate Spiritual Power,
and to pretend to be a Guide where I am
not? What, can God order me to live by
Miracle without expreſs notice? nay, and
am not I an <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> to run my ſelf even
into the very jaws and pit of Deſtruction,
in hopes of his Help, and that even in inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Dangers?</p>
               <p>And indeed, what has made God let ſo
many well deſigning Men be ſacrificed
in this caſe, but Preſumption? And if I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any ſuch thing therefore of my ſelf,
can I expect either to fare better, or have
other ſucceſs? In truth, if I do, thus I go
of my own Errand, and I muſt not expect
the protection of God to bear me out; nor
will it be enough for me to ſuggeſt in ſuch
caſe, that ſuch an Error is conſiderable, or
not; for if we admit that, we admit all; for
all Immoralities are equally perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and the leaſt were no more to be
born with than the greateſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65770:55"/>
Nor indeed is the Vice of ſuch a ſeditious
Practice worſe than the Vanity of it: Am
not I an unſtable doubting thing my ſelf?
and how can I expect then that I, as the
Blind, ſhould be able to lead the Blind?
When <hi>I</hi> am commiſſion'd from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<hi>I</hi> may juſtly preſume on his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
or elſe my Fallibility will make me
a Deceiver, tho never ſo ſincere.</p>
               <p>It is the real Duty of every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to ſay, <hi>I</hi> will not move an inch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
private Advice, till God ſhall give
me Authority; nay more, no faint Dream
or Viſion ſhall impower me, and all the
preſumptions of this nature, that <hi>I</hi> have
been guilty of before, ſhall remain as
Monuments in my Memory, to keep me
from the like for the future.</p>
               <p>Indeed, may <hi>I</hi> ſay, is it not a ridiculous
thing, to ſee a little petty Reformer fond
of his trifling imaginations, and really ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the true ſtate and nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
neither knowing of what nature
<hi>Catholick Communion</hi> is, nor what is the
guilt either of Hereſy or Schiſm, blindly
to run himſelf and others into amaze, that
he no more knows how to get out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
than how firſt he got into it: Alaſs!
what a miſerable Spectacle may <hi>I</hi> add it is,
when ſuch men take fire into their Zeal,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65770:55"/>
and lay a neceſſity, either that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the State, or the State them.</p>

of Conſcience warrants any Man that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
commiſſion'd, as the Apoſtles, and
firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were; and cannot
juſtify that Commiſſion by Miracles, as they did,
to affront the Eſtabliſh'd Religion of a Nation,
tho it be falſe; and openly to draw men off from
the Profeſſion of it, in contempt to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
and the Law. All that perſons of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Religion can in ſuch a caſe reaſonably
pretend to, is to enjoy the private Liberty and
Exerciſe of their own Conſcience and Religion;
for which they ought to be very thankful, and
to forbear the open making of Proſelytes to their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65770:56"/>
own Religion (thou they be never ſo ſure that
they are in the right) till they have either an
extraordinary Commiſſion from GOD to that
purpoſe, or the Providence of GOD make way
for it, by the permiſſion or connivance of the
Magiſtrate; not but that every man hath a
right to publiſh and propagate the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to declare it againſt a falſe one: But
there is no obligation upon any man to attempt
this to no purpoſe; and when without a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
it can have no other effect, but the loſs of
his own life, unleſs he have an immediate
Command and Commiſſion from God to this
purpoſe, and be endued with a Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
as a publick Seal and Teſtimony of that
Commiſſion which was the caſe of the Apoſtles,
who after they had receiv'd an immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
were not to enter upon the Execution
of it, but to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they were
endued with Power from on high. In this caſe
a man is to abide all hazards, and may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expect both extraordinary Aſſiſtances and
Succeſs, as the Apoſtles had, and even a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Protection till his work be done; and
after that, if he be call'd to ſuffer Martyrdom,
a ſupernatural Support under thoſe Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>And that they are guilty however of groſs
Hypocriſy, who pretend a further Obligation of

plain demonſtration, which relys upon Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
generally made on all Hands, and by all

either the Proteſtant Miniſters, or Popiſh
Prieſts think themſelves bound in conſcience to

what is the reaſon? becauſe of the ſeverity of

               <p>THE common abuſive Wit, what
is it but the crude Digeſtion and
Excrement of Reaſoning? What can I
call a Talking Thing, when the truth and
ſincerity of it's Judgment is gone, but a
Parrot at beſt?</p>
               <p>To Ridicule, to Droll, to Banter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
what, are all ſuch Contentious Railleries,
either to be commended or us'd for? is the
beſt of them agreeable either to Senſe, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
or good Manners?</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Raillery is a falſe Theatre
Jewel; and whereas true Wit ſtirr'd up,
does Wonders, and becomes as a Cordial
to alleviate the Cares of humane Life.
Raillery confounds and embitters all.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuch little pedling Satyriſts can't
ſhew themſelves without the company of
Blockheads, and yet not but that they
will rather ſometimes be ſpeaking evil,
even of themſelves, and their beſt of
Friends, than not talking.</p>
               <p>But are not all ſuch Scoffers then taken
deſervedly as common Enemies? nay, and
are any more ridiculous than ſuch, to men
of ſenſe, eſpecially when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65770:57"/>
or as the Player, e're he is in
his Diſguiſe?</p>
               <p>But as for real Wit, there are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
many pretty things, which the mind
ſearches not, and yet finds in its ſelf; it
ſeems they are hidden there, as Gold
and Diamonds in the Bowels of the Earth,
and which when produc'd, even dazle
and enamour all Mankind with their
luſtre.</p>
               <p>And yet, there is a general Revolution
of Wit, that changes its Faſhions, as well
as the Fortunes of the World; and whilſt
all her little Idolaters to magnify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſupport her in them, they too often
ſacrifice their very judgment in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to her.</p>
               <p>Politeneſs of Wit in general, is a frame
of Mind, as always preſents us with things
genteel and delicate; and gallantry of
Wit, what is it but an eaſy way to pleaſe,
whilſt as for its deceits, they are as many
and various?</p>
               <p>Thus, 'tis not fruitfulneſs of Wit, which
makes us find out many Expedients in one
Affair; but 'tis rather a darkneſs in the
Underſtanding, which makes us lay hold
on all that Imagination preſents, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us from ſeeing preſently what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65770:58"/>
To be ſhort, 'tis the Character of a great
Wit, to make a great many things be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
in a few words; and in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of it, I may ſay, the little Wits have
a Talent of talking much, and ſaying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the general Excellency of
Wit is in diverſion, and on a ready turn,
while its miſchiefs are, that its Delicacy
is too often apt to deſtroy the laboriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Conſideration, and its lightneſs to
offend in Seriouſneſs and Buſineſs.</p>

as bad as infinite; and lazily and ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſt in a confus'd view, in deſpair of all
Perfection. But why? becauſe they know
not how to ſeparate the Gold from the
Droſs, and to encumber themſelves only
with what is really material.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs my Genius is too hardy
to approve of Trifles; and as I hate all
Superfluicies, ſo ſuch little Formalities
have been of no annoyance to me: I have
flung aſide all ſuch Embroidery of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as Nonſence; I cannot bear what
cannot be digeſted to uſe; my Reader
therefore muſt excuſe my freedom, if I
have laid aſide all ſuch looſer Thoughts,
as Deluding Chicanery and Speciouſneſs,
and preſented him only with the main and
ſolid Subſtance. But to proceed:</p>
               <p>Among the reſt therefore, 'tis the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
work of this preſent <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to ſhew
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65770:59"/>
wherein ſuch trifling <hi>Pedantry</hi> conſiſts, and
that is it I am now to Write of.</p>
               <p>Now, Firſt, As the Chief among theſe
Diſguiſes may be reckon'd our Terms of
Art, the Cant of Learning, that makes
Trifles Myſteries, and obſcures even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sence, the riſe whereof, one may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, is all Hypocriſy; we would mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
our Reaſoning, and we would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like Gipſeys, be ſhrew'd for our Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beriſh,
than nothing.</p>
               <p>So for our Diſtinctions alſo; how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
it is to ſet up Terms of Art par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount
to Sence; Terms to Sence ought
to ſit like Cloaths to the Body, Uſefully and
Ornamentally; but never ſo as to cramp
its motion; So, What a Senceleſs thing
'tis to Explicate by Diſtinction that, that
is obvious to every Reaſon? An admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
way to reduce Learning to Studied
Ignorance and Trifling, but the only
courſe to divert the real growth of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>For my part, Words are my Counters,
and I make my own Criticiſms on them;
ſurely if a Notion make me wreſt a word
a little, Terms may well bear a compliance
to Arts: If beſides the weight of Sence,
you bind an <hi>Author</hi> to the nice and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Criticiſms of Words, you are unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65770:60"/>
if my Meaning be good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſurely you may well enquire a little
into my peculiar Sence of Words, and
then you leave me a freer liberty for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and to digeſt my Matter.</p>
               <p>Nor were even the Teaching of Arts
and Sciences in this matter difficult nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
were they but reduc'd from <hi>Pedantry,</hi>
a little time would ſuffice; while 'tis the
Weight and Formality of our Rules, that
not only ruines the Perfection of our Ideas,
but obſtructs their Communication alſo.
Thus, what but this has made <hi>Cornelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>
and many others rayl at their vanity
in General; not that I think them in the
Right neither; for ſurely, that <hi>Abuſus tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit
uſum</hi> is a moſt Barbarous Maxime, and
we ſhould rather Reform Wiſdom, than
fling her quite aſide for it.</p>
               <p>So amongſt the reſt, one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Blemiſhes of Learning is, that Men
have made her ſtoop to Trifles; ſo that
when a Man comes and expects to find
ſomething, as it were Divine, inſtead of
<hi>Philoſophy,</hi> he is entertain'd with their
Picking of Straws, Notions ſo idle, and
yet ſo particular and ſuperfinely nice, that
they ſeem rather deſign'd for petty Jugling-Tricks,
to puzzle idle Wits withal, than
to be of any real uſe or benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:65770:60"/>
And from whence but hence comes that
common, but too true Reflection, that the
moſt exquiſite Folly is made of Wiſdom
ſpun too fine; and we are never made ſo
ridiculous by the Qualities we have, as by
thoſe we affect to have; and indeed one
may juſtly add, that <hi>Pedantry</hi> is the very
Plague and Contagion of Learning, that
diverts and mortifies all good Parts, with
the pretence of aſſiſting them.</p>
               <p>'Twere an Heroick Act therefore, would
ſome Prince diſſolve theſe Cobwebs in our
Voluminous Rubbiſh Libraries; and by a
ſelect Committee, collect, perfect, gell'd,
and reduce them into a manageable and
uſefull form: I ſhould rejoice, could this
my little <hi>Rationale</hi> be ſubſervient to ſo
excellent a purpoſe: But, alaſs! I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
this is a matter we muſt rather range
under the <hi>deſideranda ſtudii,</hi> than really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>And, in truth, the Fault is rather in the
Will than the Underſtanding; alaſs! Men
will not reduce their Sciences to Purity, and
to Sincerity and Truth, their Prejudices
will not let them; they <hi>are afraid of the
Light, becauſe their Deeds are Evil.</hi> Our
Sciences indeed ought to repair the pure
Image of God that we have loſt, and they
would too, did we purſue them right; but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65770:61"/>
we make uſe of them only to lead our
ſelves into greater Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>You ſee therefore I have the Fire of the
greateſt Charity to ſpur me on herein; nor
is there any difficulty to demonſtrate the
uſefulneſs of my Deſign: How many inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Men would not only have been
good Schollars, but exceeding ſerviceable
to their Country alſo, were but Learning to
be atchiev'd with a due caſe; whereas, as it
is now, in a deſpair, they leave it to a pack
of Perverſe and Wrangling Sophiſters to
make their ends of it, while Mankind
ſuffers equally by their Villany and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance?</p>
               <p>Like a good <hi>Phyſician;</hi> An honeſt Man
cannot pretend to that Knowledge he has
not; while the <hi>Quack,</hi> that knows little
or nothing, will Swear you, he is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
the one, if you converſe him, ſhall
acquaint you, Learning is at her Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
whilſt the other modeſtly ſhall let
you know, that his induſtrious Labours
have found it imperfect; nay, ſo far, that
he queſtions almoſt in Conſcience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he may uſe the little Skill of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>So if you examin Men of integrity, the
common <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> as
they now ſtand, is a Sea of Learning, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65770:61"/>
hardly ever to be Fathom'd; they'll tell
you, Our Books run in Formal Tracks in
Queſt of them, but never take care of
their full and true Reaſoning; that's a
Gulph that few or none have been ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as to dive after.</p>
               <p>And yet even this has not diſcouraged
me; <hi>I</hi> have reſolved to hint at leaſt, at
the Leading Subſtance of all <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Sciences,</hi> not only towards the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
a Body of Wiſdom, but that <hi>I</hi>
may be the better able to Cenſure what is
impertinent in all. <hi>I</hi> hope my <hi>Reader</hi>
will excuſe me therefore, if when <hi>I</hi> ſee
a Science drawn even Cobweb-fine, <hi>I</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
her Merits, as what portion of our
Memory, or Judgment ſhe really deſerves;
and that we may no longer imprudently
ſquander away our pains in dividing Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Atomes to Infinity.</p>
               <p>Nor need a Man be accus'd of Satyr, to
ſay, almoſt all our <hi>Sciences</hi> are <hi>Pedantry;</hi>
indeed <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
one; but as Learning is now degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
'tis as unnatural as uneaſie; and
he that will reduce it to its full power
and ſubſtance, muſt envigorate it with
brevity, and by docking it from its ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<hi>Pedantry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65770:62"/>
In truth, 'tis the Sphere of Wiſdom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give a general and clear <hi>Idea,</hi> and a
Univerſal Proſpect of the <hi>Sciences;</hi> fully
to trace their nice particulars, were not
only to be tedious and volumnious, but to
cloud your clear and brighter leading
Truth; whereas the general and leading
<hi>Ideas,</hi> well fix'd, will lead, of courſe, the
leſſer Corollaries. When a Prince gives
an Ambaſſadour <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> he only gives
him General Orders; and even ſo Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whom ſhe enlightens, ſhe Teaches
General Precepts; and Accidents, as too
many for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> for fear of a greater
Confuſion ſhe leaves to Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; Both <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> are
then only good, when they are uſeful;
when they Anſwer to our Service, and the
Circle of Creatures about us; and even as
a Watch, though it have Wheels, yet if
the Teeth are not fit, and plac'd apt for
Motion, is good for nothing: So <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Sciences</hi> not diſpos'd for Practice, become,
not only a Burthen, but an idle Evil; nay,
and indeed, as Piety is the only Rule for
<hi>Arts,</hi> ſo, whatever is purely curious, is evil
alſo: And what ſhall we ſay then to thoſe,
who Write Volumes about Genealogies,
and whole Libraries of Notions purely
Speculative? Do they not rather deſerve
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65770:62"/>
an Houſe of Correction, than a Reward
for their Encouragement?</p>
               <p>As <hi>Hobbs</hi> well Notes, we have now
but one true and real <hi>Science,</hi> to wit, the
<hi>Mathematicks,</hi> that begins well, lays down
Principles ſure, and proves its ſelf, as it
proceeds; and yet not, but that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> manag'd, as they
ſhould be, we ſhould not let their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
neither be ſo precarious as they
are; but, founding them on Undoubted
Truths, give them a certainty, at leaſt,
near equal to Demonſtration.</p>
               <p>Nor is this little Cant leſs pernicious
in our Languages and Schools, than our
<hi>Sciences; I</hi> may add almoſt to turn our
Reaſon to Madneſs. If <hi>Ovid</hi> does but
cry, <hi>Omnia vincit amor,</hi> though the
Sence and Words were but worthy of a
School-boy; yet ſtreight, by Pedant Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles,
we are Raviſh'd by an Elaborate
and delicate Adage, with a lofty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
ſtile, and purity of Language;
nay, and a Myſtery ſhall ſupply the Sence,
rather than fail; and, as if the Sentence
were deliver'd Perſonally by ſome God,
and Mortals durſt do no other than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it.</p>
               <p>And thus alſo, Who can Write a <hi>Poem,</hi>
but he muſt ſtreight invoke the mighty
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65770:63"/>
Nine, the Muſes, and by and by, we muſt
have ſome Heathen Gods, <hi>Bacchus, Mars,
Vulcan,</hi> or ſome one or other to Agran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
our Stile, when, in truth, the ſurer
Reaſon why they are brought in, is not ſo
much in Conceit of the Elegancy, but
that they are as lazy Topicks to ſupply the
imperfection of our <hi>Invention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in Reality, What is it but to
drive away Richer Notions from our
Heads, to fill up our Diſcourſes with ſuch
Formalities of the Furies, as Fatal Siſters,
and the Graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we were pardonable, did
we do like Hackney-letter Scriveners, who
Write all <hi>Epiſtles</hi> in one Form, for that
were to confeſs a Downright honeſt plain
Sence: but we forſooth would ſtrive to be
Elegant, and to Charm the World by our
Wits, when, at the ſame time, we ride
none but the Hackny-fancies of Thouſands
of years ſtanding.</p>
               <p>So, our <hi>Gods, Victory, Muſick,</hi> and ſuch
Hieroglyphical Statues and Emblems, are
fit enough to ſet out the Great Mock-Prince
at <hi>Verſailes;</hi> but to imagine them
Learning, or to think to get much out of
their Story or Moral, ſurely is an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
too great for a <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> or, at
beſt, if we muſt value this petty <hi>Sapientia
veterum;</hi> Can't we take the Subſtance of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65770:63"/>
the Advice, and ſpurn away the little fairy
Stories of their Gods.</p>
               <p>Nor do I think it a leſs Vanity, though
more common, that Men, at every turn,
muſt confirm what they ſay, with Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's
from <hi>Virgil,</hi> &amp;c. to make Men think
they are skill'd in the <hi>Poets;</hi> Alaſs! What
is my Opinion the better for bringing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiouſly
every Man's Fancies to ſupport
what I Write? I ſay, let every Man's
Work ſtand and fall by Reaſon, and by
the meer dint and force of Juſtice, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Truth.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Sciences</hi> alſo; What are your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
little formal <hi>Analyſſes,</hi> wherewith
they are Patch'd up, but <hi>Pedantry?</hi> And
what your little ſet, and cramp Forms in
them, but ſo many Myſteries and Blinds,
to keep the Underſtanding from Truth?
'tis true indeed, ſuch trifles hardly deſerve
to be taken notice of; and yet even tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling,
when it appears in Formality and
Method, deſerves a Cenſure, nay, and that
even to a Ridicule, leſt at Weak times they
prevail upon us, and by their meer Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs
byaſs our Judgments; and yet not
that they deſerve to be Carp'd at, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
ſo much as Laugh'd at.</p>
               <p>I have perus'd <hi>Alſted's</hi> long <hi>Enciclopai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion,</hi>
ſincere 'tis true, but beſotted to all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65770:64"/>
the little forms of <hi>Pedantry:</hi> there you
have even all Mechaniſm reduc'd to <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;</hi>
indeed Arts infinite, and Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Niceties without end: in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
ſeemingly ſhort, yet too full for a
ready recourſe; nay, ſo Voluminous with
Diſtinctions, Gloſſes, Philoſophick Notes
and Quotations, that to peruſe him or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
would, at leaſt, require two years
Work: And, is this, think you, a fit Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Wiſdom for uſe?</p>
               <p>Nay, I will ſay more for <hi>Alſted,</hi> though
he handles all Subjects in General, yet in
moſt particulars he is ſo excellent, that I
know few ſingle Treatiſes that exceed
him, even at their own Mark; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in his Rhetorick; and yet for all
that, they that can bear <hi>Pedantry</hi> in
Piece-meal, will be even ſick when they
peruſe his Maſſe of it, though never ſo
Correct.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; his heaps of <hi>Analyſſes's,</hi>
and his incoherent Florilegiums, would
even Diſtract a Man to Comprehend, or
reduce them to uſe: I would as ſoon
think to reduce the Ocean, as to bring
in Order every one of his little Notions:
Indeed, a Wiſdom ſo nicely purſu'd in an
Angel were ſomewhat, but in a Man, 'tis
as if we would try to carry a Mountain
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65770:64"/>
on our backs, beſides the Impertinency of
it in a great many Parts: What, if a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Genius, Hag-ridden by an Art or
Science, dwells, and raiſes Caſtles in the
Air on it, Muſt I be bound to follow the
Dance of his Frenzy?</p>
               <p>Nor would I be thus Uncharitable to
quarrel at the Body of Learning, had I
not, at the ſame time, eſſay'd to make it
more perfect; but now I hope I may be
excus'd, that I endeavour to diſplay its
giddy confuſion: Alaſs! What a Scene
'tis to ſee? here lies one Man confounded
and ſinking into Sceptiſm; another ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like <hi>Cornelius Agrippa;</hi> ſits down and
ſpews up all that he has Read again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot digeſt it: Another Rails
at, and Undervalues all, becauſe 'tis ſo
Intricate he cannot reach it.</p>
               <p>Hence nothing in the World confounds
Wiſdom like <hi>Pedantry;</hi> nay, and when
Men are once ſeaſon'd with it, 'tis as hard
for them to unlearn it, as it is to learn what
is Real Knowledge; nay, to root out a
rotten Leven of Principles, and to rectifie
formal Errors, is more difficult than to
dive into Simple Knowledge; Natural
Folly is bad enough in Man, but when
he has got Letters and Sciences to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Madneſs, his Frenzy is intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:65770:65"/>
But, alaſs! I am afraid, after all, I
Write in vain; Men are ſo bewitch'd to
the borrow'd Counterfeit Ornaments of
Learning, that when the Devil <hi>Pedantry</hi>
is caſt forth, they will be even offended at
the Innocent Simplicity of Wiſdom, and
ſlav'd to their old Pageantry, they'll not
be able to relliſh, even Subſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their old Forms.</p>
               <p>Men delight to continue in the Maze
they are Educated in, they hate to come to
the Light of Truth; So that I may juſtly
ſay, this One Accurſed Knot of <hi>Pedantry</hi>
has baulked all the Improvements and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments
of Learning: So that when Men
have once laid this rotten Foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are unwilling to beſtow the
pains to New-lay it, as Wiſdom and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can never Piece together, ſo they run,
like Sheep in a Flock. I have known Men
following Meditation, hit of Truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly;
but Pedants, like Wild-geeſe, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
one another in Trains, for fear of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelves; the Reaſon is, they have
not Truth, nor any other Method to keep
themſelves in a Body, but to tread in one
anothers ſteps only.</p>
               <p>And hence all thoſe that have purſued
the Natural Powers of Reaſoning ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
have even done Wonders; whilſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65770:65"/>
ſneaking Pedants, whatever blind
Path the firſt happens to enter, you ſhall
ſee Ingenious Men, and even Men of
Parts, afterwards make up the Specious
Train of Fools.</p>
               <p>Nay, and I do not know whether I
may not iuſtly add, that as ſuch Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
wander on, our Learning as we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
have it now, rather corrupts and
diſables, than helps or aſſiſts a Wiſe and
Active Life of Imployment: and I think,
the <hi>Turks</hi> are the only Wiſe Men in this,
in rejecting all our petty Sciences, ſince
they are clog'd ſo far with Artful Vice.</p>
               <p>And, to ſhut up all; Whence but from
hence is it, that one cries Learning is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and will trouble himſelf to know
nothing: A Canter comes, and will
only know <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he Rails at <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
for Dying in a Study; as if Man were
not made to be Charitable and Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to his Country, as well as to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
God; and ſo all have Racked againſt
one Rock or other, and not one in a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
has had the Courage to reach after
the Haven of a True Humane Competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or Perfection of Knowledge.</p>

<hi>Chriſt</hi> could ſay, even on the Croſs,
<hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they
do.</hi> And it makes Men Deſperate, while
we leave them no hopes of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Is it not Cowardize, either to
have Malice, or ſeek for Security through
Vicious Means? Have I Rivals? I have So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
then worthy of my ſelf. Have I E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies?
let my very good Behaviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to an eſteem of me.</p>
               <p>But ſhall we forgive no body that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
us, either through ſurprize or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take?
Surely, then we ſhall no ſooner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
our ſelves than others. St. <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
his Maſter, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a great
Perſecutor, and yet both the greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65770:67"/>
Certainly, God the Prototype may be
our beſt of Examples in this. I will have
mercy therefore to the laſt, but I will not
deſtroy my Juſtice by paſſing by the
Injuries I have receiv'd without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
but who ſhall charge his Brother
on miſtakes?</p>
               <p>To forgive before Repentance, indeed
is never to take offence; if ſuch had been
Chriſt's Doctrine, why ſhould he have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>That if our Brother offend us, we ſhould
tell the Church of him?</hi> and that if on that
he repent not, he be to us as an Heathen or
a Publican.</p>
               <p>I may add, in this it is to be harmleſs
as the Dove, and wiſe as the Serpent, to
guard our ſelves from known ill men; and
yet, were mine Enemy the bittereſt Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
on Earth, I would not only love him,
but truſt him again, were I aſſur'd of his
Converſion.</p>
               <p>But ſhall I pardon out of neceſſity, or
ſave a Murderer to cut my Throat? alaſs!
'tis Cowardize, not pardon, to pretermit
without Repentance.</p>
               <p>To pardon in general is to encourage
Vice; while there are Laws indeed, I
will paſs by Revenge, but the leaſt eſcape
of due puniſhment is unjuſt; and how can
we forgive, where Mankind has the right
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65770:68"/>
of Vengeance againſt a Villain?</p>
               <p>Chriſt bids us indeed, to part with our
Coat, and to go two Miles where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
one, but to regulate a contentious
Claim, and to preſerve Peace, and not to
deſtroy either Property or Juſtice.</p>
               <p>So the ſame Goſpel that bids us love our
Enemies and forgive our Perſecutors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
forbids us caſting Pearl before Swine,
and not flying from City to City to avoid
them: But do I fly my Perſecutor, while
I repoſe too dangerous a Truſt in him?</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, I love my worſt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
he ſhall not want the common Dues
of Humanity from me; nay, and I forgive
him too, as to private Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
but I owe to my Self and Family,
to ſue for Reparation for the Injury he has
done me.</p>
               <p>Nay, and if I have Reparation, I have
but my own again; indeed, if I ſue for
Trifles, I have Malice, and I forgive not
my Brother: but in weighty Injuries, I
am no more obliged to paſs by my amends,
than to truſt him that deceiv'd me again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>RHetorick</hi> is the Art of ſpeaking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully,
and pretily tickling and
pleaſing mens Paſſions by our Diſcourſe;
its Inſtruments are quaint, active, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Figures and Modes of Speech, but the
greateſt Skill lyes in managing them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
lowring our ſelves, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
raiſing a more lively Imagery to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
always in the ſame ſtrain; be it what
it will, at leaſt cloys and ſatiates, if not lulls
the Auditors attention aſleep.</p>
               <p>And hence, we ſhould have a graceful
Embroidery, not a daubery in Expreſſion;
the Criſis of an Affection ſhould be gently
touch'd, and not over-worded, leſt we cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
it. The beſt Mean in this caſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
indeed were, to intermix Sentences;
the firſt material, the ſecond only diverting
and circumſtantial; the firſt weighty and
deliberate, the ſecond eaſy and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and thus to continue through the
whole Speech. For why ſhould we pall
the edge and ſenſe of what we intend to
recommend? and yet even in this I would
not be ſuperfluous neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:65770:69"/>
True Eloquence conſiſts in ſaying all
that ought to be ſaid, and nothing but what
ought to be ſaid, and in giving every Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent
a ſeveral Tone of Voice, Meen, and
poſture of the Body, which is proper to it:
Nay, I may add, 'tis this Agreement that
makes good or bad Comedians; and other
perſons pleaſe or diſpleaſe us in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
And thus there is an Eloquence
in the Eyes, and the Air of the Perſon,
which perſuades as much as that of words;
and there is as much Elegance in the Tone
of the Voice, as in the choice of words
themſelves.</p>
               <p>The common Error in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> is to
make every Quirk in Speech a Figure;
now the beſt method is, to have a few &amp;
choice Figures, Precepts ſufficient to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
our Speech, and yet not to burden
our Uſe or Idea: So for our ſpeaking, a
compos'd Diſcourſe by Memory may have
a more ſet and formal ſtile than another;
but it will want much of the lively cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of a Diſcourſe deliver'd <hi>Extempore;</hi>
the one commands all the helps of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which happen during the Diſcourſe,
whilſt the other, beſides the inſipidneſs of
Formality, quite cutts off all Advantages
that of nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65770:69"/>
To be ſhort, a Man would no more uſe
himſelf always to repeat a Form, than he
would to walk with a Staff; when I am
either too young or too old, I will ſupport
my feeble parts with props: but when
I am Adult, tho I will never ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a condign deliberation, yet will I not
too far confine my Speech neither: I will
remember my Method and Analyſis, but
I will not manacle mine Imagination; I
will rather with a generous Freedom, keep
it ready againſt any new Emergency.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of Delivery.</head>
                  <p>And even ſo for my Delivery alſo, I will
not think to excel by Loudneſs; were I in
a Diſpute, ſhould I be willing to put
the Criſis of my Controverſy on ſcolding,
an Expedient excellent for him that is fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
or in the wrong, but madneſs in a wiſe
or good Man? Indeed, an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
anſwers to a riſe and fall in Muſick,
and carries a kind of Charm on mens
Paſſions, but a continu'd Baulling can have
no Original or Sourſe from Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Men are like <hi>Violins;</hi> if you ſtrike the
Note right in one, the other immediately
anſwers you, and the Affections and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
move together with the Muſick; but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65770:70"/>
if you lay too much <hi>Emphaſis</hi> on your
Words, and more than the Affection will
bear, what do you do but viciate your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
to a Cant? A Man may have a zeal
without knowledge, as well in Wiſdom as
Religion.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame reaſon alſo, it is not good to
be ſhort or abrupt in our Speeches, as <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity</hi>
is, like a noyſom <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in the mind;
So ſhort Speeches are like Stabs, and ſeem
by their fierceneſs and quickneſs too near
a kin to fire: Beſides, as by a long Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
and deadneſs of Speech, we level our
ſelves too much to Cenſure, by abating too
far the edge of Men's Reſpects; ſo by a
Speech too abrupt and ſhort, we let men
anſwer us before they duly weigh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and eſteem they owe to us, and the
Truths we deliver.</p>
                  <p>Above all therefore, we ought to keep a
Mean in our Diſcourſe, neither to let Fancy
run us a-drift from one Subject to another
where ever ſhe pleaſes, nor to let our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
run a gallop, too ſwift for the care
of our Thoughts (like School-Boys that long
to be at the end of their Leſſon;) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as we ought to avoid a Poynancy, ſo
we ought to regulate our Fancy by Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our Celerity by a due preſence of
Mind: Nay, is our Diſcourſe like to be
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65770:70"/>
long? 'Tis a pretty skill in Speech to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
our Hearers by Pauſes. Such little
Reſts revive Mens apprehenſions; and not
only give leiſure for their Refreſhments,
but pre-occupy a ſeaſon for their Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
alſo.</p>
                  <p>So 'tis of excellent uſe in our Diſcourſes, to
condeſcend to the Cuſtoms and Capacities
of our Hearers; the Vulgar admire their
own Phraſes, and applaud no truth ſo
much as what is in their own Dialect; juſt
as when we talk to Children, to pleaſe
them, we liſpe, and bring down our Voices
in imitation of theirs, to perſuade them we
are rather going gently to lead them, than
violently to force them on with the harſh
and manly Voice of Authority; and yet
a Voice loud, clear, and diſtinct, is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
uſe, where we talk to men of Courage
and Judgment.</p>
                  <p>As for our Method in this matter,
I think our old way of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
Thus, firſt, to begin and enquire
demonſtratively <hi>An ſit,</hi> and when we are
fully ſatisfied of the reality and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of our Subject, and have ſatisfied
our Hearers withall, then we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

done this regularly and perfectly, we may
boldly ſpeak our judicially, and cry, <hi>Sic
ſit.</hi>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of Perſuaſion.</head>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to Perſuaſion, in
which caſe as 'tis moſt ſucceſsful and ſafe
to ſayle with the Tide, ſo 'tis a ſingular
Art in Perſuaſion, where we find our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
Affections engag'd againſt us in what
we are about to ſpeak, firſt to plead for a
candid Audience, and to ſtay the entring on
our Subject, till we have moved a convenient
ſtream of Affection in them, to carry and
entertain our Diſcourſe: For why ſhould
we labour in vain? And indeed, who but
one beſides himſelf, is ſo hardy as to engage,
when he hath both the Wind of Paſſion,
and the Tide of Inclination to oppoſe him?</p>
                  <p>In truth, one may ſay the Paſſions are
the only Orators, which always perſuade,
they are a kind of Art of Nature, whoſe
Rules are infallible, and which once mov'd,
are ſtrong both in Hearer and Speaker;
the verieſt fool mov'd to a true pitch of
Paſſion, perſuades more than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Orator without; ſo that, could men at
all times command ſuch accidental Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of their Paſſions, they would never
be without them; but the matter is, we
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65770:71"/>
are fearful to do thoſe things in Temper,
that in Paſſion we make light of.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed a little more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
to perſuade to a thing unknown, firſt
inſinuate your ſelf by things known, and
and yet doubtful, and then without <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles,</hi>
relating what you would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
urge it with a meet confidence;
and yet, taking care as you do it, firſt to
ſhew a due caution, That you be not taken
for a Babler; ſecondly, to ſhew your
grounds for your 'diffidence, that you be
not judg'd as credulous; and laſtly, to fix
all, yet with ſo meet a confidence, that
you be not taken for a Diſſembler.</p>
                  <p>And beſides this to perſuade, we ought
to skill how to lay hold of mens particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Paſſions, and ſo to know to which they
are moſt obnoxious: Thus <hi>the Miſer was
cured of his Lethargy, by being made jealous and
watchful of his Gold;</hi> and thus the <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
Virgins were cur'd of the Humour of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves, by dragging the dead Bodies of
the like offenders through the ſtreets;</hi> and
thus <hi>Selenicus</hi> took away <hi>Womens gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Apparel,</hi> by an order, <hi>that no one ſhould be
allow'd to be a Whore, but ſhe that was ſo and
ſo dreſs'd, and had ſuch and ſuch Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65770:72"/>
But, if you would perſuade one that is
obſtinate, and that neither Senſe nor Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
can immediately prevail on, ſtreight
turn your Reaſoning, and ſeem to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and admire his Methods, and then
by purſuing them on as his friend, run
him as at unawares on abſur'd conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and ſo fright him by thoſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings
in you, that in himſelf he will not
admit to be examin'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Mobile in a certain Common
Wealth, being enraged once at the Senate,
yet voluntarily put themſelves into the
hands of a Friend, to be judged by them;
and he thereon adviſing the Mobile firſt to
chooſe a new Senate for fear of miſchief,
before they proceeded to the cutting off
of the old one, ſtreight thereby he begun
to ſhew them the conſequence of Upſtarts;
ſo that they immediately agreed, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
their old Senate on again.</p>
                  <p>And yet, as when we have not mens
Paſſions of our ſides, we muſt thus by
Preambles, Apologies, Preparatories, Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifiers,
and other Topicks of Argument,
endeavour to root out the old Biaſs of mens
Prejudice, and to implant a new and truer
Idea in their ſtead; ſo on the other ſide,
when we have mens Inclinations on our
ſides, we may avoid this prolixity, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65770:72"/>
begin freely, triumphantly, and openly, or
elſe, till we have engag'd a party of thought
and Paſſion of our ſide, we are imprudent
to launch too freely into the Ocean of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>And yet even in all Caſes, we ought to
know, how to limit our perſuaſions too:
Thus I would not ſeem too fond, leſt I
make men believe the intereſt I perſuade
them to, is more mine than theirs, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by my concern; and yet I would
neither want Fancy nor Vigour enough
to expreſs a thing fully, nor to illuſtrate
what is more rare and ſingular to the life;
but yet then, no more than is fit; for why
ſhould I ſeem either ſo intereſted or poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
as to deaden the Edge of my perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and tho abruptneſs generally be
a Vice, yet ſometimes little hints are of
excellent uſe in Perſuaſions; it ſets men
to beat out our Notions in themſelves,
and they are ever more fond of Bratts of
their own Brain than others: Beſides, that
ſetting men ſo upon ſuch a Scrutiny, makes
them engage in a Party for us, and nothing
obliges men more than to let them ſeem to
be their own contrivers.</p>
                  <p>So further, 'tis good to know the force
of every Argument and Figure: Thus
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65770:73"/>
for inſtance, a Repetition or Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
by Figures and Allegories, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Affections, and charm the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but only Reaſon without Art, and
with Sincerity and Truth, are able to move
a durable and ſteady Reſentment and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage:
Indeed, Figures are but for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and he miſtakes their very end, that
makes them Subſtance, or that diſguiſes
his Diſcourſe by uſing them too far. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
are to recommend and beautify,
and not to blind or deform, if we have not
skill enough to apply our Ornaments
therefore, we had better neglect them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</p>
                  <p>But above all Ornaments and Figures in
Speech, there are none ſo uſeful as Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Fables, Metaphors, and Allegories;
when Reaſoning will do no good, when
the mind is quite blind and deaf with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
Allegories and Parables can revive
it, and by Paralels confirm it. Thus <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
convinc'd <hi>David's</hi> ſin in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah, and
humbled him, and brought him to Repentance,</hi>
by the Parable <hi>of the poor man's Lamb,</hi> when
the bare ſenſe of the Action alone could
never do it.</p>
                  <p>But indeed after all, as I have ſaid, no
<hi>Rhetorick</hi> is like Honeſty, and no Speech
like Reaſon; if we have Truth on our ſide,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65770:73"/>
that's all, and enough, if we take but care
to illuſtrate that ſufficiently; only this we
ought to remember in prudence, to let our
laſt Words be moſt forcible, as they are
moſt likely to be of the moſt laſting Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion:
And indeed, to leave truth and
follow Colours too much, is like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s
Dog, <hi>by catching at the Shadow to looſe the
Subſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not rely therefore on Fancies
or Figures of Speech; but if I uſe them, it
ſhall be as by the by; but my main Weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be clear ſenſe and reaſon; if men
have either any judgment or truth, my
very Sincerity ſhall force their Attentions;
and while Flowers only dally to delight
the mind; by a lively appoſite Expreſſion
with Notion, I'le even ſtrike to the
Quick.</p>
                  <p>So 'tis an Error in Perſuaſion alſo, to
multiply Reaſons, and aim at Conqueſt by
Numbers; the beſt arguing is from few
Topicks and from general Heads, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
of the Diſcourſe the eaſier, and the
Management the better; nay, and the
Memory and Paſſions of the Hearers are
the more eaſily captivated by it, whilſt as
for Figures they may be us'd but ſeldom:
'tis better to be regarded for Matter than
Form, Reaſon than Words, and yet it is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65770:74"/>
not convenient neither to let our ſenſe want
a ſuitable Dreſs.</p>

perſons to make a good Cauſe ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
by their ill Proceeding, ſo 'tis good
to know alſo, what order is decent in an
Oration; and if it be written, to mark it
as it proceeds, for the greater clearneſs with
your Topicks in the Margent: Nay, and
not only ſo, but to be ſure not to neglect
the Cogent Topicks of Recommendation,
as praiſing your Judges, or at leaſt aſſuring
your ſelf, that they have ſo much Honour,
that they would not hear you, if they were
not reſolv'd withall to give you an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Sentence.</p>
                  <p>And thus in an orderly Diſcourſe, I may
ſay, there ought to be five parts: Firſt, A
Preface pertinent and ſhort, to open your
deſign, and to prepare the minds of the
Hearers. Secondly, The Narrative true,
&amp; well circumſtantiated to inſtruct them.
Thirdly, A Confirmation, and that ſolid,
to convince them. Fourthly, A Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
nervous and ſtrong, to refute all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
for them. And Fifthly and laſtly, A
Concluſion pathetick, and forcive to move

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65770:74"/>
But if we extend our Diſcourſe beyond
an Oration, that is, if we write a Book,
then a more perfect Method ought to take
place, and we ought to proceed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt
Rules of a compleat <hi>Geneſis;</hi> our
very method ought to be ſo conſpicuous as
to ſupply the part of an Index; and every
Clauſe, Sentence, Chapter, and part of our
Diſcourſe, whether greater or leſs, ought
to be fram'd ſo naturally, as to fall into a

be able even actually and orderly to force
the Readers Conviction.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>I</hi> conſider this, <hi>I</hi> cannot but
reflect, that had men either any Reverence
for themſelves or others, were they cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Trouble, they would not thruſt out their

Thus, you ſee, I have given you here a
Catalogue of the more Eminent <hi>Figures</hi> of
both ſorts; but I have not given Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
but of ſome few that <hi>I</hi> thought more
Uſeful: indeed, whoever peruſes <hi>Alſted's
Enciclopaidion,</hi> will ſee ſuch a multitude of
<hi>Figures,</hi> that they are not only almoſt
without number, but that there is not a
Quirk in Speech ſcarce, but what that by
one <hi>Author</hi> or other, is reduced to ſome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure:
So that indeed this Exuberancy now
ſeems to require ſome Limitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> For the uſe of ſuch Figures, <hi>I</hi>
ſhall only ſay this, one would Read them
ſometimes curſorly, as ſo many ſeveral
Patterns to form one Speech, and as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Moulds to be committed to our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
in Reading, to ſhape our Utterance
and Delivery by; but to think otherwiſe,
to force our Thoughts juſt to ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Form, or Cut, is to make them more
unacceptable in being unnatural, then all
the Ornaments of Art can add to them.</p>

               <p>WHatever intuitive Knowledge, or
Divine Ideal Truth <hi>Adam</hi> had, his
Poſterity are forc'd to Plow the Soul for
Wiſdom, as well as the Earth for Fruits.</p>
               <p>We muſt track Truth ſtep by ſtep, and
weigh as well Ideas as Propoſitions to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
her: He that takes Truth by the
Groſs, or Jumps into her without a due
Compariſon of things, at leaſt knows not
in Judgment, whether he is right or
wrong.</p>
               <p>The true Judgment is <hi>Mathematical,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
the Scale, and Propoſitions are the
things weigh'd, while Judgment, like
Juſtice, favours the heavier Scale.</p>
               <p>Where there is moſt Conſideration,
therefore there are likely to be moſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and conſequently the more aſſur'd
Deciſion of Judgment; while to Judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Propoſitions forethought, is like weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Scales empty, and Shooting
at the Mark Blindfold.</p>
               <p>As for the Errors of Judgment, they
are either want of Conſideration, or Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution:
The inconſiderate Man leaves
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65770:78"/>
all to happy Chance; while the Irreſolute
is like a ruffled Skein of Silk.</p>
               <p>In Truth, Judgment, like an Army,
ought to March ſlow, with full Trains of
Imaginations, and not a Concatenation of
Thought ought to be unconſulted for
fear of the Ambuſhes of Error.</p>
               <p>To conclude, were <hi>Poets</hi> as happy in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scale, as in their ſprightly and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Sallies of Fancy, <hi>Poets</hi> aſſuredly would
have the beſt Judgments, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make the beſt <hi>Philoſophers:</hi> but our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſhews us the contrary, and where
they fail.</p>

               <p>FOr all the difference of Eſtate and

ſuch a common allay of good
and evil, that all, in the main, are equally
happy.</p>
               <p>Felicity, alaſs! is in Content and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not the things we Poſſeſs. Thus 'tis
what <hi>I</hi> Love, and not what another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
that makes me happy.</p>
               <p>And thus, indeed, what but our Pride
makes us Miſerable, and reſtleſly Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?
Our great concern, in truth is, to
ſhew, that a Man of Deſert is unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be diſputed, but the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of Health, Wealth and Friends are
valuable; But are they comparable in the
making of us happy, to Vertue and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?</p>
               <p>The beſt of ſuch Enjoyments are caſual,
momentary, and diſguſted by Conſcience
and Paſſions; But can any thing rob us
of Vertue?</p>
               <p>Pleaſures enjoy'd with innocence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
are real; But can there be any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65770:79"/>
ſatisfaction with regret, to catch at the
baits of Sin and Vice.</p>
               <p>Nay, were there no Hell, the <hi>Epicure</hi>

that we are doubly bruitiſh, to pall our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
by Luxury.</p>
               <p>The Vertuous enjoy Pleaſures truly,
and can thank God for the Refreſhment,
while neither Satiety nor Paſſion annoys
them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, a vertuous Soul, I may ſay, is as
a Rock againſt the Waves and Storms of
the World, while ſhe looks down with
pity on Giddy and Mudling Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>I want to Coach and Dainties; And
what then? Are not Walking and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance

Cloaths; And what am I not aſham'd to
be ſo like a Peacock?</p>
               <p>Prithee Friend tell me; Can thy Gold
or Purple keep out Diſeaſes? Or thy
Guards, Garriſon'd in Iron, repel bold fears
and deſpair?</p>
               <p>Virtue, indeed, as ſhe is indifferent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch Trifles, ſo is ſhe hardned to
evil; Vertue turns all Misfortunes to
Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>What though mine Enemy Rage?
Can he move a foot beyond Providence?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65770:80"/>
Does he intend to kill me? And can't I
rejoyce to be ſo ſoon with God?</p>
               <p>Does he torment me? And have I not
God and a brighter Crown of Martyrdom
to ſupport me? Nay, or can my deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
relieve me?</p>
               <p>I will allow a Man Groans to relieve
his Spirit, and an honeſt Submiſſion to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
his Enemy; But ſhall I ſurrender
my ſincerity to him, and give him oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to deſtroy both Soul and Body too?</p>
               <p>But, alaſs! thou art Griev'd to Dye ſo

God? The Apoſtle could deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved:
And, Art thou, on the contrary,
ſo unwilling, as to repine at the call of his

               <p>Surely, faithfully to love God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his Laws, therefore as they are the

               <p>WHat good will all the Precepts in

his Preſence of Mind, the neceſſary clue to
lead him through them.</p>
               <p>Surely our Senſes ought always to keep
due Centinel, and our Underſtandings as
readily to attend their ſummons: Can he

died for being too buſy to give

               <p>Careleſsneſs and Diſattention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
undoubtedly are the Daughters of
Folly: Certainly the Judgment ought
to be in readineſs for every new Object
that approaches. I may add, What is
Madneſs but ſuch a Debauch of Thought,
to a greater degree, and when an Idle
Soliloquy disjoynts the whole Reaſoning
of the Man?</p>
               <p>We ought therefore to avoid all ſuch
Violence of thought, as Poyſon; at leaſt
the Plow of Thought, Clogs and Cuts

Nay, even for the very unſeemlineſs
one would avoid ſuch flurts in Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for ſurely 'tis as diſagreeable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as pernicious to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And yet after all, certainly there are
Diſeaſes in the Mind, as well as the Body;
and after our beſt endeavours, our Senſe
will ſlacken, and our Styles vary, do what

               <p>THe Mind, like the Body, expoſes its
ſelf, by appearing naked; it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
its weaker parts, and lies more liable
to Injuries; undoubtedly therefore Secrets
ought to be embrac'd as Armour, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
as Soveraign Prudence; but yet
then, we ought to remember alſo, that we
cannot be too wary in them; our Looks of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſpeak as well as our Tongues, and we
muſt be careful our Nakedneſs appear not
through the little Vail of its Cloaths.</p>
               <p>So, though Secrecy and Silence thus be
undoubtedly Vertues; Diſſimulation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Words or Actions, is the furtheſt
from it imaginable: Diſſimulation is
an act with an intent to deceive, a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

of thoſe, who have not judgment enough

               <p>As for the difference between Simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They leave a room for Retreat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By their Lying, they draw out
Secrets.</p>
               <p>Their Miſchiefs are;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ſpoil buſineſs through Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They barr the Aſſiſtance of
others.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They take away all truſt
and belief, while, as for ſecrecy, it has all
the Prudence, and none of the Vice of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them.</p>
               <p>But to return; if we would keep a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
we are bound, in pain of Indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to diſcern who we truſt with it; indeed,
How can we hope another ſhould keep our
Secrets, if we cannot keep them our ſelves;
So we ought alſo to ſtand in Guard, even
of our Servants, and not to make others
jealous of us, by being too buſy; on the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65770:82"/>
one ſide Cardinal <hi>Richleiu</hi> took care wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to turn away that Man that he found
looking into his Letters; and, on the other
ſide, How can we expect that others
ſhould not enquire after, and gueſs at
our concerns, when we ſeem to buſy in
our jealous inquiſitiveneſs at theirs?</p>
               <p>But, beſides this General prudence of
Secrecy; Secrecy is a Sacred Obligation,
even in Diſcourſe alſo: thus, when Two
Diſcourſe, they render each other mutual
Depoſitors or Thoughts, and which they
truſt one another withal; ſo that, let it be
that we require Secrecy, or not, in ſuch a
Caſe, our Diſcourſe is always as a Pawn,
which ought never to be diſpos'd of but
according to the intentions of him that
truſted it.</p>
               <p>And yet the Rule of Secrets ſeems to be
this alſo; though what I am told, I am bound
to keep as a Secret; yet if I knew it before,
that cannot make that a Secret to me, that
was none before; though with regard to
the Relator, that I make not him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
it is, and yet not, I fear, but that this
Liberty has been often abus'd; and many
that have not known a Secret before, yet
have pretended they have, to ſalve their
Reputations in breaking it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:65770:83"/>
But then, 'tis an undoubted Exception
from all the Laws and Obligations of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
when any one acquaints us with a
wicked or criminal deſign; for Friendſhip
loſes its Obligation in Wickedneſs, and
there can be no tye between God and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial;</hi>
a Man ought therefore to have wit
and honeſty enough to diſcern of what he
ſpeaks, before he requires Secrecy, or elſe
'tis at the peril of his Imprudence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
his own wicked Intentions.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, unleſs in caſe of theſe
few Exceptions, when we enter into a
Diſcourſe with a Man, we begin a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with him, and which, at leaſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the Obligation, not to abuſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence;
now, though this <hi>Friendſhip</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
but for a Minute, or for an hour,
year, or years, under greater or leſſer
Truſts, yet the Obligation to Secrecy is
ſtill the ſame, and all one, whether in
an hourly, or a perpetual <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In truth, a good Chriſtian is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no Man's Enemy; but in this, he loves
all Mankind equally; that he ſhews more
kindneſs to one than another, is from the
Providence of his Aſſociation, his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Compact, or Friendſhip; but this
general tye of Humanity to Secrecy, is,
what nothing can diſpenſe with in us.</p>

                  <head>To attain Secrets.</head>
                  <p>As for the particular Methods to obtain
Secrets, there are ſeveral: Thus ſome have
gotten them by frightning with a contrary
dangerous deſign; and thus the Prieſt that
would know whether ſuch a man frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Church or not, got it out of him
by accuſing him of a Contempt of the
Service.</p>
                  <p>So have you employ'd Informers to find
out Secrets; and would you know whether
they deceive you or not? employ ſuch as
can have no manner of Acquaintance with
each other, and then in what they all agree,
you may be aſſur'd, they are in the right.</p>
                  <p>Some have attain'd a Secret by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they knew in part of it already; and
thus men to ſave their own Bacon, jealous
of others treachery, have been the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Some, when they have not been able to
attain the Secret deſired, have fiſh'd for
ſome other, and by that tempted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Friends, as by Tokens to reveal the
other: And thus the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> by
<hi>asking a Priſoner when he lay with his Wife
laſt?</hi> by that as with a Token, drew the
Confeſſion of the Priſoners Guilt from his
Wife.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:65770:84"/>
Nor is that other Method leſs certain of
obtaining a Secret by a Secret, for men
when they think they have poſſeſſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Secrets, preſume that they have ſo
much advantage of them, that they may
ſafely truſt them with their own: And thus
by Diſſimulation and Trifles, ſometimes the
weightieſt Matters have been diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Sober men you may fathom by obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and reproachful Controverſies; by
which means their very Paſſions will open
them, and as for their Tempers you may
know them by what they were at School;
but as for Drunkards the only way to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
their Speeches, is to examine them by
their other Frolicks, whether they have
not been for a conſtancy foul-mouth'd or
Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, to know whether a ſuſpected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
be guilty or not; do but charge him
with things falſe and true at the ſame time,
and you ſhall ſee it quickly by the different
manner of his Vindication; for as ſound ſleep,
a compos'd mind, &amp; careleſs behaviour, are
great preſumptions of Innocence; ſo you
will eaſily diſcover him as not concern'd at
the fictitious Forgery.</p>
                  <p>A King of <hi>France</hi> being willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
a Treacherous Noble that was in
company with him among others, if he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65770:84"/>
could get the conſent of the reſt, put forth
the Nobles Treachery in a Parable like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
<hi>Lamb;</hi> whereupon underſtanding all
their Reſolutions, he made the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>And now I have wrote thus much about
the Diſcovery of Secrets, I ſhall add a little
alſo about the management of them, and
occult Writing, and conclude.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Occult Writing.</head>
                  <p>If to be Secret be lawful, which indeed
the ſtricteſt Moralliſt and Religious can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny; for, in truth, Secrecy is one of
the conſiderableſt Branches of Wiſdom, and
we are taught <hi>to be ſubtle as Serpents, as well
as harmleſs as Doves:</hi> If Secrecy I ſay
therefore, be not only lawful, but a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
beſure unſearchable ways of Writing
muſt be of excellent advantage, ſince by
ſuch occult Writing, we can communicate
Secrets to whom we pleaſe, and conceal
them from every body elſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to enumerate the ſeveral Methods
of ſecreting our Senſe in Writing, were a
work as frivolous as endleſs: I take it
therefore for granted, that if I deſcribe ſome
of the beſt Methods, and leave them to be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65770:85"/>
improv'd, alter'd and chang'd by every
man's own invention, 'twill be far better
than to tire him with all particulars; for
when once the Myſtery of an Art is unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd,
there is no difficulty to copy it a
Thouſand ways by our own Invention.</p>
                  <p>Some make a new Alphabet, and alter
only the Characters of the Letters, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
I wrote Engliſh with <hi>Arabick</hi> Letters,
not underſtood in this Country; others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
only the ſignification of Letters, and
uſe the common Characters, as ſuppoſe I
ſhould all along write <hi>a</hi> for <hi>b. b</hi> for <hi>c. c</hi> for
<hi>d, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus for Example, were I to write the
word (<hi>and</hi>) it muſt be by <hi>z mc.</hi> for <hi>z</hi> goes
for <hi>a. m</hi> for <hi>n.</hi> and <hi>c.</hi> for <hi>d.</hi> being all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Letters before them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ought to take their places as ſo;
but this method is eaſily diſcover'd by the
<hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>ſhort Words;</hi> and yet it may
be blinded too, by inſerting inſignificant
Letters, and multiplying the Characters
of the <hi>Vowels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some will invent a peculiar Cant like
<hi>Jipſeys,</hi> which is indeed like making a new
Language; others will cover their deſigns
in a dark Metaphor; as ſuppoſe I treated
of a <hi>Common Wealth</hi> of <hi>Bees</hi> to reflect on
Government, or cited ſome anitent Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65770:85"/>
Paſſage to repreſent the preſent Scene
of Affairs, and the correſpondence between
them: And this is the method us'd by the
Prophets in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Some will write with common Letters,
and in common <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but alter the plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Letters; thus ſuppoſe I wrote
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, I write the <hi>Odd Letters</hi> in the
firſt word, and the even Letters in the
ſecond; and ſo it will be <hi>Mſſad Oeſi;</hi> and
ſo I go on with every two words till I
end what I write.</p>
                  <p>Others diſpoſe every 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, or 12. ſucceſſive Letters, according to
a Table of Chimes for Bells, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
them into words at their pleaſure; and
after all to make it the more intricate, you
may diſpoſe the words in Sentences by the
Rule of ſuch Chimes, as you did before the
Letters in the words; ſo that without
you Key, the Table of Chimes, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to read what you write, ſince at this
rate by double Chimes you may vary
your Letters a Thouſand, nay, I may ſay,
Ten thouſand ways, if you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>But all or moſt of theſe ways are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
for as they cannot but infallibly breed a
jealouſy and ſuſpition, ſo many times they
are as miſchievous and dangerous, as if
they were reveal'd: And therefore thoſe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65770:86"/>
methods of Secret Writing are moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
that caſt a Blind before Mens Eyes,
and by giving them a fair and ſeeming
Senſe to read, take away all Imagination
of their being a Secret couch'd under it.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſome will write you a common
and civil Letter, but do it by the Key of
an Alphabet of <hi>Synonemas</hi> for every word;
ſo that when you examine it by your Key,
every word in the Epiſtle ſhall give a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Letter, which being collected in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſhall give you a ſecret Sentence; but
if you read it in the ordinary and currant
ſenſe, you ſee a plain familiar Letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either doubt or difficulty in it.</p>

what are Precepts good for, when ſcatter'd

               <p>Good Precepts 'tis true, are like Rocks

Thoughts. The perfection of Vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
conſiſts in the Uprightneſs of the Will;

               <p>Nay, what will the moſt excellent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

and among huge and numerous Volumes,
where ſhall we find what we want, unleſs
in the <hi>Meridian</hi> of our Reaſon we ſtore up
Precepts for Old Age?</p>
               <p>Alaſs! we have ſeen the force of an

towards it, often enough; we ſee how far
the Waves of proud Fancy can reach; nay,
we are not ignorant even of what <hi>Enciclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paidians</hi>

               <p>

But what! Can a little whifling Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe

Philoſophy and an Army of Thoughts much
more; nay, what is even a Library, but

               <p>No doubt, a general Body, if ſo prepar'd,

               <p>To conclude, Reaſoning like figur'd Silks

               <p>THere are ſeveral methods to Vertue;

an Harrangue make you good; and why
not the Precept in ſhort?</p>
               <p>Examples are lively 'tis true, but time
alaſs! will allay all their Emulation; while
as for the cloſe Reaſonings of Precepts, can
they ever fade?</p>
               <p>The Man's a falſe Proſelyte that does
not love Vertue for Vertues ſake; and are
long Examples then comparable to brief
and wholſom Precepts?</p>
               <p>What avails it, as I have ſaid, to have
Volumes of Cautions one knows not where
to find? By Precepts I will ſtore up Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
againſt Age; nay, I will fortify my
Vertue by Reaſons impregnable, the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence
of Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Our firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoughts are too crude for
Wiſdom; Nature does not give Vertue:
And 'tis a kind of an Art to become good.
Nay, without Precepts our Wiſdom is
bruitiſh, and our Vertue, Conſtitution and
Inclination, not judgment.</p>
               <p>While petty Vertues ſink in their Trials,
Precepts will level every wrinkle that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65770:89"/>
the Tranquility of the mind.</p>
               <p>Pure Precepts will ſmell ſweet, when the
little Guſto's of Fancy ſhall fade. I know
the World love to hide their Vices under
the broken Fragments of Morality; but
are not wilful Ignorance and Diſobedience
equal, as well in Morals as Divinity?</p>
               <p>Beſides, Can any thing excel good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts?
or is any thing more deſirable?
Nay, is not Wiſdom the Unchangable
Good of God himſelf?</p>
               <p>True Precepts will compoſe thy Spirits
beyond Muſick, and lull thy Paſſions aſleep.
True Precepts are a perfect Antidote to
Vice, if thou but uſe them duly.</p>
               <p>The true Philoſophy is clear and ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
it leaves neither Difficulties nor
Scruples, but chears the Mind, enlightens
the Underſtanding, and confirms the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
where e're it comes.</p>
               <p>Some admire Precepts; but why? they
want Variety and Change. Alaſs! they
want but diverting Strains: True Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
are one, and eternal.</p>
               <p>Can true Vertue be ever out of faſhion?
Surely then, 'tis a defect in God, that he
is not vicious for Variety; if not, I will
not be giddy in my Precepts, leſt I become
giddy in my Morals alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:65770:89"/>
In truth, Is Vertue ſuch a Trifle as to be
ſacrificed to Novelty and Curioſity? or am
I ſo wretched as to think ſo of her? No:
let her be as unchangable in my Breaſt, as
ſhe is pure and chaſte in her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Neither Reading nor Meditating, neither
Study nor Diſcourſe, neither Paſſion nor
Zeal, therefore ſhall give me that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that I will not ſecure by Precepts;
but then to perfect, not to change my Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I may add, 'Tis even ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to ſee what ſlight Paſſions can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe
us, when Reaſon does not Rule.
Surely therefore, good Precepts are as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and the only way through which to
attain the Perfection of our Nature.</p>

               <p>I Am ſorry, I may ſay too often, our heart
by habit is apt to cheat our Reaſons,
while our Sincerities become but as a more
curious Art, to draw a Religious Reſpect
to what we ſay.</p>
               <p>The true Sincerity is good without a
witneſs, and can love unfaſhionable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue?
The true Sincerity never fails: Is
it frail? yet at leaſt it keeps in the Track
of Vertue.</p>
               <p>A pure Integrity has no Reſerve; ſhe
dreads not the Scrutiny of the beſt of men;
ſhe will not do evil even that good may
come: her Loyalty for Goodneſs can ſerve
her without either Livery or Dower.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou be good therefore? let no
Temptation impurify thy Will: or if thou
wouldſt be wiſe, let not the leaſt Error
blemiſh thy Judgment. Is a Caſtle ever
eaſier maintain'd, than when without
Breaches and Diſunion!</p>
               <p>Alaſs! the exactly Sincere is ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and himſelf only: the World
has but the Colour of Integrity; The true
Sincerity would not be hired from the
Paths of Vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65770:90"/>
How earneſtly do ſome men ſeek Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
to be corrupt? But can we ſay, that
man is good, that does not wiſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to be better? Surely, God and
Vertue elect by our Wills, and not by our
Powers or Actions.</p>
               <p>Pure Vertue is even in the bottom of the
heart: Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that luſts after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Wife commits Adultery with her.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
why ſhould I tantalize my ſelf ſo
with Luſts, did I not love the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>When I reflect on the integrity of <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
and <hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> and other <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
methinks I am aſham'd to hear cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter
Chriſtians ſay, <hi>That ſuch Divine Men
are damn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are we the better for knowing or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
only? and, Why not the Devils
alſo, who tremble with it? Are we rich
in grace? alaſs! we forget that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the Widows Mite.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the true ſincerity will even
in this life benefit us; it leads us to Truth,
and it gives us credit; nay more, 'twill add
us reſpect alſo. 'Twas Chriſt's ſincerity that
made him ſpeak as with Authority.</p>
               <p>Nay our ſincerity will benefit us, tho in
a miſtake: Thus what but Integrity could
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65770:91"/>
bring St. <hi>Paul</hi> from the greateſt Perſecutor,
to be the greateſt Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Surely, both Piety and Vertue lye only
in ſincerity; if Action without Intention
were valuable, we ſhould even make Bruits
vertuous alſo. And if any thing be Vertue,
or there be any Vertue, 'tis mixed with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity;
for Sincerity is really the great and
only Touchſtone both of Religion and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>

               <p>ALl Vows, of that which is unlawful,
are void; Nor availes it in ſuch
caſe, whether the thing Vow'd be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or leſſer evil, ſince nothing can oblige a
Man to what is really evil: 'tis as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to tell a Lye to fulfil an Oath, as it is
to Murder a Man: And as it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that God ſhould love to have ill done,
ſo it is impoſſible that he ſhould engage
us to it, purely becauſe we have Vow'd or
Promis'd it.</p>
               <p>I may add, the Nature of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
ſtill remains, notwithſtanding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of any Vow, Oath, or Promiſe
whatſoever, and is in the eye of God and
Reaſon only Obligatory; and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Scripture, and the beſt Caſuiſts,
it is, that it happens, that the Vows of a
Servant, or Wife, may be good in part, or
void in part, as conſiſtent with their Prior
Duty; and ſo alſo where there are two
Oaths, the Prior ought only to take place.</p>
               <p>And, in this Caſe, that the Superſtitious
Notions of Vows and Oaths have been
wrong, ought not therefore to make us to
follow them: 'tis true, in the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we ought to preſerve Piety, and not to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65770:92"/>
contemn what is really Sacred; and yet
we ought to examine matters ſo ſincerely
alſo, as not to leave our ſelves partial, blind,
or confus'd in the Search.</p>
               <p>What ſhall not a Man pay his Debts,
becauſe he has Vow'd he will not? And
muſt a Man Starve, or Murther himſelf,
becauſe he has Sworn it? This were for
him to ſet up a New Law in oppoſition
to God's Sacred Law of Nature; and, by
Artifice, to ſubvert the moſt holy Will of
God: And thus I may add alſo, Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Charity are as great Debts even as
a Bond; and therefore if I Vow not to
pull off mine Hat to another, that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
void alſo.</p>
               <p>Upon this therefore, I conclude, that no
Vow can change our ſtate, or bind our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
to confine our ſelves againſt a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Good, is an ill; and it is the only
power of a Vow to bind us to a known
Duty, from a known Evil, or in a thing
indifferent; nay, if any thing be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
if the confinement fret us to the
injury of Body or Mind, from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
it becomes ill, and ceaſes to obliege
us as not indifferent alſo.</p>
               <p>And thus a Vow may engage me to
the greateſt ſelf-denial, ſo as conſiſtent
with my duty, but not to the leaſt evil,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65770:92"/>
though even but of imprudence: A Vow
to fling away my Wealth into the Sea, is
void; but I may well Vow all I gain to
the Poor, and yet even then <hi>I</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
me Maintenance, and beſtow it
with Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>So I may bind my ſelf from Wine and
Fleſh; but if ſo, their want impairs my
health, I muſt uſe them: And ſo I may
bind my ſelf from going into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
till my Health, or a better ſervice
from God and my Country require it;
but I may never thereby obſtruct the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of any greater Good or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
And ſo, though I Vow to go to
<hi>Rome,</hi> if I cannot propoſe ſome good by
my Journey, the imprudence of it makes
it void, in idly neglecting my Buſineſs;
and ſo alſo, though it were but to go half
a Mile, the evil is the ſame.</p>
               <p>So alſo to ſerve a Man's Country in the
beſt imploy he is capable of, is every Man's
Fundamental Duty; and to neglect it, is
to bury our Talents: For any Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to Vow ſuch a Vow, as engages him
from his beſt capacity of Serving his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as to lead a Monks Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is of it
ſelf unlawful, and, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, as it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
an apparent Duty, and renders us lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than Drones in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
we live in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:65770:93"/>
Nay, and ſuch breaches of Oaths and
Vows, in ſuch caſe, like that of <hi>Corban,</hi> are
no ſin; that we need not fear not to keep
them, they being of themſelves void; the
raſh making of them indeed was a ſin, but
they have not the guilt of a black and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Perjury, as the World too often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes,
but rather a raſher reſolution only
in them.</p>
               <p>A Falſe Witneſs is guilty of a wilful
Contempt to God, and Injuſtice to Man:
but, in this, we have nothing more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of, then that we called God too light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Witneſs to a Reſolution not well
weigh'd and underſtood: And, if this
were a ſin, How could the <hi>Jews</hi> leave
their Vows to the Law on <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
them? Or how can the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
break his Marriage-bond, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
as even <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives leave for Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and be guiltleſs?</p>
               <p>So, if I make a Vow, it does not bind
mine Heir; Or if as an Officer, it does
not bind me as a Private Perſon; So, Are
you a Prince, and would you know how
far Your Parliament-Oath engages? all the
Power not transfer'd to You remains, the
Law of Nature makes all States compleat
in themſelves, though by Compact it
may be limitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:65770:93"/>
So alſo, as 'tis impoſſible to think of all
neceſſary Conditions, as Life and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Parties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo we muſt have an
Implicite regard to ſuch Conditions, in
whatſoever Vows we make; and yet on
the other hand, <hi>Chriſt</hi> Teaches us, That
though I Swear but by my ſelf, yet am I
as much bound, as if I Swore by God; ſo
though I Swear by falſe Gods, yet my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to Verity and Sincerity is ſtill the
ſame.</p>
               <p>But to return; Though there may be
many things that may thus make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
void, although confirm'd by an Oath,
witneſs Adultery in Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet
Juſtice, in many Caſes, will bind a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
much ſtronger than a Vow, becauſe
of the Expectance and Dependance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and it's neceſſity in Commerce and
Converſation; and yet little pety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative
Promiſes to ones ſelf only, as,
I'll go to <hi>London</hi> to Morrow; or, I'll buy
ſuch an Horſe, have no Obligation at all,
but leave the Speaker free to his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>So alſo a Mutual Promiſe is not valid
till accepted; and yet even ſo, I am bound
ſteadily to my offer as a Propoſer; but if
Matters after change upon my Promiſe,
and before acceptance, I am not then
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65770:94"/>
bound, till you make my firſt Terms
good: Thus if a Perſon be offer'd, and I
accept to Marry, if ſhe fail me, I am Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd
of my Promiſe; if not, I muſt ſtand
to it: And thus God reſolv'd to deſtroy
<hi>Nineveh,</hi> when, on their Repentance, he
Revok'd their Sentence.</p>
               <p>Further, I am bound by the Promiſe
of my Ambaſſadour, Deputy, or General,
to the utmoſt of their Commiſſion, and
that though againſt private Inſtructions;
and yet if by their Commiſſion I leave
them the Power only to Treat for me, none
but the Sponſers are engag'd beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Order; ſo I am bound, by my League,
though even to an Heathen, ſo far, as to
preſerve him: But, as wicked Leagues are
void, I may not fight for an Heathen to
deſtroy Chriſtians, for that is to add more
ſin to raſh Swearing, like the Death of
<hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to <hi>Herod</hi>'s Fooliſh Oath.</p>
               <p>So alſo, no Promiſe can engage me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Self-preſervation; 'tis not lawful
for me to lay down my Life even to ſave
my Friends; I owe my Life only to God;
and yet I may joyn with my Friend even
to Death in a good Cauſe; but then I
muſt Martyr for the Cauſe of God, and
not my Friend: So, though I Promiſe to
go a Journey, yet <hi>I</hi> may not go if there
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65770:94"/>
happen a Dangerous Tempeſt at the time
to endanger my Perſon.</p>
               <p>But indeed, a Man has generally little
need to add all theſe Cautious Limitations
to Promiſes; we are too apt <hi>to promiſe
according to our hopes, and perform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our fears,</hi> without theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements;
but ſurely, in truth, all
our Promiſes, whether confirm'd by Oath
or not, ought to be equally Sacred: and
though, in one Caſe, we are in danger of
Perjury only; yet ought not that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile
us into a conceipt that a Lye is of
a weaker Guilt; and yet not but that tho'
I may neither Equivocate, nor ſtrain the
Words, I promiſe, or declare, if they are
propos'd me knowingly doubtful, I may
juſtly take them ſo.</p>
               <p>Where ever therefore we have made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and we have reaſon to Judge them
faithful with whom they are made, we
ought ſtrictly to obſerve them; but when
they are made with perſons falſe, either
by Practiſe or Principles, they are void,
though confirm'd by Oath, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the moſt Sacred Law of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
and yet, in ſuch Caſe, I offend
God, by Treachery, indeed Black Perjury,
by offering to engage my ſelf falſely where
I cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:65770:95"/>
Thus, for Inſtance, 'tis impoſſible to
make a League with a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> who cannot
onely, by Principle, Swear what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
not, but diſengage himſelf from
Oaths by Equivocations, or otherwiſe,
at pleaſure; for, as Leagues and Promiſes
are mutual in their Obligation, and are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
of no force; ſo is it impoſſible
that there be Faith Oblig'd to, with ſuch
Men; and if there be any Method there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make Agreements with them, it
muſt be by Securities and Hoſtages; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the late Perſecution in <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo, if a Man has been known to
be falſe to his Promiſe by practice, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
no Mutual Obligation can tye
us to Fidelity with him; and yet even
then, if there be no danger of Life, but
only of ſome Temporal Damage, and I
make a Single, not Mutual promiſe, I
am bound to Fidelity. So in a Mutual
promiſe, if the falſe perſon has actually
perform'd his part, without he give me
a Releaſe, and then I am Diſcharg'd,
though on Oath.</p>

                  <head>Of Praiſe.</head>
                  <p>We Cenſure others to be Commended
our ſelves; and, in truth, it is rather to
exalt our own Judgments, than the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of thoſe we Praiſe, that we enlarge in
their Commendations; ſo that at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
we Praiſe our ſelves, when we would
ſeem to Praiſe them. In plain terms,
one might almoſt conclude, That neither
Vice is blam'd, nor Vertue commended,
but out of Intereſt; and, that for Intereſt
we can admit any Praiſe: and ſo alſo, the
Modeſty which ſeems to refuſe Praiſe, is
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65770:96"/>
indeed, nothing elſe but a deſire to have it
in a way leſs viſible, and more delicate.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo we do not love to give Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
nor do we beſtow them but rarely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for Intereſt. Indeed, <hi>I</hi> may ſay,
Praiſe is a conceal'd and delicate Flattery,
that ſatisfies differently him that gives it,
and him that receives it; the one takes it
as a Recompence of his Merit, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gives it as a Mark of his Equity and
Judgment; and yet Praiſes have at leaſt
this good, that they ſerve to fix us in the
Practice of Virtue; and the Approbation
that is given, to Wit, to Beauty, or to Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
at leaſt augment and perfect them,
and make them do more than they were
able to have done of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides this, ſome Men too often
uſe poyſon'd Praiſes, and which ſhew, by
a ſide-glance, the Faults of thoſe they
Praiſe, and which they dare not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
otherwiſe; thus they exalt the glory
of ſome, thereby the better to leſſen that
of others; and give Men a little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
that they may be the better
able to Accuſe them alſo.</p>
                  <p>And thus it happens ſometimes, that
there are Praiſes that Reproach, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
that Praiſe; and yet there are
few people that are wiſe enough to love
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65770:96"/>
the Reproof which does them good, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the praiſe which betrays them;
and yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſhall refuſe praiſe too; but
yet then 'tis as with a deſire to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
prais'd.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, he that always prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
me, is undoubtedly a Flatterer; but,
he that ſometimes praiſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
reproves me, is probably my Friend,
and ſpeaks his Mind: And yet in ſuch
caſe, did we not flatter our ſelves, others
would do us no hurt; but, when Men
take ſhelter under the Arch-flatterer ones
ſelf, then it is that they injure us.</p>
                  <p>And as Men are thus apt to be fond of
praiſes, ſo are they no leſs inclin'd to be
avers'd to contempt: In truth, I may
ſay, nothing makes Men greater ſlaves
than Mockery; yet not but that Flattery
is more dangerous than Contempt, though
leſs acceptable: Contempt at leaſt keeps
us in the Methods of Plain-dealing;
whilſt Flattery carries multiply'd Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
in it, and not only cheats and cozens
us, but eats out and deſtroys the very
fountains of Truth in us.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort; Well might <hi>Auguſtus</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for <hi>Varrus</hi>'s death, becauſe, ſaid he, <hi>I</hi>
have none in my Country that dares tell
me Truth: And, if any thing upon
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65770:97"/>
Earth can make us miſerable, ſurely it muſt
be to be fool'd and cheated by the falſe
Lights of flatterers: I do not mean your
little common flatterers, that ſeek no deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than into a few General pleaſing Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
only; but your Arch-flatterers, and
ſuch as are too common in Courts, and
who, perverting the whole courſe of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and Truth, aim at nothing elſe but
ſcruing up all things, juſt to pleaſe and
delight the party Courted.</p>

                  <head>Of Contempt.</head>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, as for Contempt,
one may ſay, the Rich and the Poor have
the ſame appetites and paſſions, only diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
expreſs'd and diſguis'd; and all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nay even the meaneſt, are alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of Diſcountenance or Contempt,
be the perſon never ſo great from whom
they receive it.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and we all agree further in this,
that we are more impatient to have our
Underſtandings reflected on, than our
Manners; and we can better bear the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Vice than Folly; the reaſon
is, we value our Credit and Intereſt more
than our Honeſty, and we had much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſave our Eſtates and our Pleaſures, than
our Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:65770:97"/>
But indeed, had we courage enough to
be wiſe, we ſhould regard Reſentments
only from their Reaſon, their Depth and
Weight, and not from Popularity and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion:
Now, ſhould we do ſo, I ſay,
not only our greateſt concern would be at
Vice and Sin, when they reproach us, but,
as 'tis evident, that Contempt, Scurril and
Laughter, are but as the Froth of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and have no other bottom, but Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Folly; ſo they ought not to be
regarded in no ſort, but as the effects of
Weakneſs, and want of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Wiſdom bids us be Charitable, and bear
with others; nay, and not only ſo, but
aſſiſt them in their Infirmities: How
contrary then muſt this Malitious Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Contempt be, which Delights
and Rejoyces in others Misfortunes, and
endeavours all it can, to advance them?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Contempt is a ſet, ſtubborn, and
reſolute averſion and hatred: Now, I ſay,
as this can neither with Juſtice or Charity
be paid to any thing but Vice or Sin, ſo we
are unjuſt to give it to any thing elſe: And
hence, What though a Man be Vicious,
and his Crimes deſerve all the Contempt
in the World; yet his Perſon, and as he
is our Brother, he rather deſerves our
Pity?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:65770:98"/>
And, in truth, we are Raſh Fools to
hate any thing that God does not; he
only and wholly ought to be the ſtandard
of our Affections; and beſure as he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
does nor can hate us for our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
as indeed it were to hate us for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his very Creatures to do it, and which
is impoſſible; ſo the only occaſion of his
contempt of us, is our Miſaction, and our
Aberration from his Law; and yet even
then alſo he has Mercy: and we, if we
will be like him, ſurely ought not to be
without it.</p>
                  <p>Nay more; Is any one weak and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
'tis my poſitive duty to pity him,
and, in Charity, where I can, to adviſe
him, much more not to deſpiſe him? So,
Is there any one Wicked, 'tis my duty to
Reform him, and not harden him by Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
at him? And, indeed, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by his
Example, ſhews us, That we ought to
Pray for, and Adviſe, not only our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but our Murderers alſo. And, With
what Arrogance then ſhall we preſume
to leave our Stations, as Creatures I mean,
in continuing in invincible Brotherly
Love; and, to take upon us, like God,
through a raſh and peremptory Contempt,
to Judge, Cenſure and Condemn, as our
little Fancies ſhall lead us?</p>

                  <head>Of Libels.</head>
                  <p>But, above all things, in this matter,
our Perſonal Satyrs and Libels are the moſt
Pernicious, the moſt Vicious and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable:
I might ſay, nothing deſerves
Satyr, but Sin and Satyr. And if a Man
would ask the Queſtion, When a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man moſt reſembles the Deſtroyer of
of Mankind? 'Tis when he is Maliciouſly
dipt in the Barbarous Guilt of Satyr, and
flinging Fire-brands about him, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
and Confuſion of all he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes.</p>
                  <p>Nor know I any Remedy againſt this
Peſt, but ſuch a ſcorn and contempt as
it deſerves. Some have preſcrib'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
and ſay, a Flint is eaſieſt broke on
a Feather-bed: Others, to avoid it, like
Sir <hi>John Sucklin,</hi> have Laugh'd at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
firſt; but, my ſenſe is, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
none of this care. What a Waſp,
a Child, or a Fool fleers at my Actions!
and he underſtands no more a true Reaſon
for his Cenſure, than a Parrot; only he is
well-skill'd at the Elegancy of Rayling;
and, for prevention, cries Blockhead
firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:65770:99"/>
And, hence it is as a Secret belonging to
the Wiſe, to give full liberty to the Malice
and Envy of ſuch, the baſer ſort, and to let
them vent themſelves in Calumnies, and
falſe Reports; ſo that when they have
ſpoken very ill of brave and worthy Men,
at length finding their own Reputation
and Fortunes to lye at ſtake, for fear of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
they may be brought to forbear.</p>
                  <p>And, indeed otherwiſe, the only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
againſt Satyrs and Libels, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Silence: Nor can you half ſo
much vex their Authors, by a Witty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,
as ſuch a Neglect: By the firſt, you
at leaſt acknowledge their Power, and
you may be ſure they will not be without
hopes or endeavours to be even with you
again; for, they have ſeldom that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as to forbear abuſing you, while, by
the latter, you ſhame them, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievably
condemn them as <hi>Billinſgates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, our beſt Leſſon that
we can learn from hence, that I ſee, is to
know the true Value of Contempt, and
Reputation: Now, as the only benefit of
a good Name therefore is like Cloaths to
defend us from outward Accidents, and
the only real miſchief of Contempt, the
Impediment of our Affairs; So, Why
ſhould we value it further? Alaſs! What
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65770:99"/>
is a Name when we are dead? were it not
to advance our Children and Poſterity? the
Honour otherwiſe that is not paid us in
perſon, vaniſhes into idle Air: And what,
tho' our Names remain, our little tickling
and fond <hi>Vain Glory,</hi> which is the only itch
we aim to ſatisfy, periſhes with our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                  <p>This I grant, I would not rip up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

a mean and cowardly ſneaking to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
falſe idea'd Honour, a gilding the way

                  <p>The <hi>Vulgar</hi> indeed, like unskilful Dawb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65770:101"/>
to painting <hi>Bears</hi> through their Malice and

without ſome Beſtiality; either they add
Claws to him, and make a Beaſt of Prey of

Peacock, or add him a Tayle, and turn

                  <p>But to return, and proceed a little more
particularly to falſe Judgments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
                  <p>Moſt people ſee nothing in others, but
the Repute that they have in the world,
and what their Fortune merits; and yet
they are as confident in their Cenſures of
them, as if they had Windows into their
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65770:102"/>
Hearts. Indeed, we are perfectly known
only by our Friends, and yet our Enemies
and Strangers will judge us moſt, and who
know leaſt the truth of what they Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>And one might ſay in ſuch caſe, our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to be evil without examining, is pride
and lazineſs in a Medley. We would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
find perſons guilty, but will not
give our ſelves the trouble to examine their
Caſes: But alaſs! had we no Faults in
our ſelves, we ſhould not be ſo apt to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
them in others: I may ſay, we are
naturally apt to diſapprove in others what
we think in juſtice, others may diſapprove
in us.</p>
                  <p>To cure this raſh Judgment therefore, I
may add, We ſhould take care as well to
rectify our own Faults as our Reaſonings:
In our Reaſonings we ſhould be rather
ſlow to ſpeak, and conſiderate, than fiery
and precipitate. In our Errors, ſhould we
but have perpetually <hi>Memorandums</hi> of the
Failings of our ſelves before us, we ſhould
not be ſo apt to have ſo little mercy for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but alaſs! we are neither ſo juſt as
to reflect on our own Faults, or the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of the Perſons we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</p>
                  <p>And hence indeed, I may add, were our
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65770:102"/>
principal Quarrel at Reports for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
of their raſh Cenſure, and not from
Self-love, we ſhould be equally cautious
and concern'd at their Injuſtice to others
as our ſelves; but really our general Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
is, when our ſelves are the Object
of them; and ſo in truth, all our Judgment
of them is partial.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and we are the more concern'd at
ſuch raſh Cenſures, as if we fancied our
ſelves the only Objects of them; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
indeed, we are not: but all the World
in general, are apt to judge by Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and whoever has ſuch and ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
or where ever they happen, juſt
ſuch a Cenſure follows, whether in our
ſelves or others, of courſe.</p>
                  <p>So that, I may ſay, till we can hope to
rectify this common, but unjuſt Judgment,
by Appearances, and which to me ſeems
next to an impoſſibility, we had as good
fancy, that common Robbers had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
deſign upon us, that meet us, &amp; rob us,
with all that they meet in ſuch a Road: For
juſt ſo Men cenſure ſuch and ſuch, that
they find mark'd with ſuch offenſive Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and it is even Ridiculous therefore
to expect to be the only Perſon the World
will ſpare, ſince Chriſt himſelf was nor
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65770:103"/>
priviledg'd in this caſe: Can you walk
the Streets and not expect to be daſh'd?
Surely, if ſuch Judgments can put us
out of Humour, we ſhall never be pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>So alſo, ſuppoſe that any man tell thee
of ſuch a Cenſure; what is it, but that a
whiſper is reveal'd to thee, and a giddy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
Publiſhed? for thou art beſide thy
ſelf, if thou expect there ſhould be no Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of thee; and if ſo, no wonder that
ſome of them happen to be Publiſh'd,
of thee, and to thy diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, do we expect an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Love? we are unjuſt, and there is
none of us that deſerves it; nay, and as
there is nothing more free than Love, ſo
we ought not to pretend to purchaſe it
by Complaints and Reproaches, but Love
and Complaiſance: Nay, and ſuppoſe we
deſerve not this Love, yet would we put
a force on Mens Paſſions, and make them
to love us whether they will or no?</p>
                  <p>Nay, and indeed ſuppoſe we really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be lov'd of Men, but ſome light
appearances make them Cenſure us, we
ought rather to complain of their weakneſs
and lightneſs, and of the frailty of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
than of their Injuſtice; 'tis not
he that miſtakes, but he that wilfully
Cenſures wrong, that is Unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:65770:103"/>
Beſides, ſome love us not ſo much that we
deſerve their Love, as that they fancy an
Idea we have ſuch Qualities as they eſteem
amiable, and which poſſibly we have not:
Suppoſe then that Truth were ſetled in
Cenſure, we ſhould loſe as much Love as
Hate; for Mankind is giddy and unſteady,
and has not ſet the ſure grounds of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Vertue for their Cenſure; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
thoſe Qualities are only really ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and all other Friendſhip unſtable and
fleeting.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, if ſuch raſh Judgments
and Cenſures of any ſort really injure us,
'tis more that they join with our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by them affect us and diſturb us,
then that they have any real Power in
themſelves; alaſs! in themſelves generally
they are but Air, and their Love and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
is more hurtful than their Spite and
Miſchief; for that too often poyſons our
hearts with a mortal ſweetneſs; while
as an indifferency leaves our Journy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God with more liberty.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, if others are faulty in their
Cenſures, their injury is to themſelves and
not to us: It deſerves our pity, not our
complaint. When we do our Duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
we do it for God's ſake, and fruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
our ends; when we expect our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65770:104"/>
and return from Man, we ſhould
be glad, that God gave us the opportunity
therefore; and we ſhould dread a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
from the World, leſt our hearts ſhould
accuſe us, and ſay, <hi>This was not done purely
for God's ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, when you are charitable to the
poor, Do you expect they repay you? and
ſo, when you are charitable to the Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to the poor in Fame, muſt be return
your Complement? Well may God, may I ſay,
puniſh us by their ingratitude, when we ſo
baſely tranſlate the true end of our Actions
from himſelf to his Creatures; and indeed,
what Fools are we to value a Complement
and Trifle, before the great Rewards of
an All-ſufficient God.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of Reports.</head>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>I</hi> think, that by this time,
we may very well conclude that.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As for Reports, 'tis a common,
but grievous Error among Mankind, that
Juſtice ſhould let Mens Tongues looſe to
a full liberty, in reſpect of them, more than
in the more ſolemn diſtributions of <hi>Meum</hi>
and <hi>Tuum;</hi> whereas certainly, in truth, and
if Men would but duly conſider their Duty,
they would find, that Juſtice and Charity
engage them equally in Reports as in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:65770:104"/>
And thus, ſuppoſe any perſon of Credit
inform'd me, that ſuch an one was a Cheat:
I ſay, I have no Title hereby to condemn
or call him ſo, no more, than to hang a
Fellon through common Fame: and yet
I may juſtly refuſe thereby to give him any
great degree of Credit; nay, and to indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
my Friend from him, I may acquaint
him with the juſt grounds of my Jealouſy,
but then it muſt be to preſerve his real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and not malitiouſly; and therefore,
I am bound in Juſtice not to add to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
I have heard.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a leſs Vice in Reports, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
wicked Perſons more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
than to defame and blemiſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Innocent; for thereby we
Authorize and make an Example of what
is abominable: And ſurely, nothing can
be more pernicious than ſuch a Courſe!
Thus we ought not to praiſe the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Man that is a known Cheat, nor
the honeſty of a Robber or Pyrate: Can
we aſſure our ſelves how far the influence
of ſuch our Commendation ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend?</p>
                  <p>But to ſtrike at the Bottom of Reports;
Did we proceed with Juſtice, we ſhould
do like Judges; and not condemn one ſide,
till we have heard t'other, till we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65770:105"/>
Witneſſes and Proofs, even ſcrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
on both ſides. I am ſure, no man
but would think himſelf hardly us'd with
other Meaſures in a Court of Juſtice; and
why not in Reports alſo, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
with confidence to affirm groundleſs
Scandals of one another?</p>
                  <p>I may add, How often are the Senſe and
Coherence of Men's Words wreſted, quite
contrary to their Primitive Intention? And
who is more apt for ſuch an Injuſtice than
a captious and idle Tale-bearer? So, how
often are the beſt and faireſt Actions repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
even as Vices? And if ſo, What
care can we take ſufficient in our Cenſures
and Reports? or what real value can one
place on Reputation, when one conſiders
the Inconſtancy and Injuſtice of the
World?</p>
                  <p>To conclude, When Reports therefore
are faulty of us, we ought rather to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the World in their Weakneſs, than to
be angry at them: For is it not a ſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle
full worthy of our Compaſſion, to
ſee men love to ruine one anothers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation?
and if they entertain an eſteem
of any one, 'tis as it were againſt their
Wills, and in ſpight of them, and they are
glad of every little Scandal to blemiſh the
fair Character.</p>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:65770:105"/>
Upon the whole, defame not good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
tho' for accidental Blots in their
Actions, in juſtice to the reſt; and for
evil perſons, tho' never ſo mean, do not
too eaſily defame them, in juſtice to thy

               <head>Of POETRY.</head>
               <p>THE Traffick of Poetry is but in the
froth of Reaſoning, and the colours
of Morality. I muſt confeſs, for its Light
and careleſs Touch to the Mind, like
Muſick, 'tis an excellent Recreation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
but for any Man to ſet his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
upon it, is to Trade in Cockle-ſhells,
and to catch at meer empty Noyſes and
Shadows.</p>
               <p>Give me the Diamond that is true <hi>Bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant</hi>
cut in its ſelf, and that needs nothing
of the <hi>Golden Caskanett,</hi> to ſet it off, or
adorn it: I may ſay, 'tis a kind of Whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of true Wit, to dreſs it in Poetry;
and if a true Poet hates to ſee the Plot,
and turn of his Play fum'd away by <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
into Shew and Noiſe; much more
may genuine and vigorous ſenſe, ſcorn
to be cramp'd and manacl'd by Verſe,
for the ſake of a little paultry Rhime
and Metre, to ſet it out with.</p>
               <p>And to me therefore, it appears no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than a Reflection on Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi>
who would otherwiſe ſeem a Philoſopher
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65770:106"/>
to tranſlate <hi>Homer;</hi> not that I would ſo
much undervalue <hi>Homer</hi> neither, as the
imployment of his Judgment, and that
he ſhould ſquander away ſo much time in a
meer Diverſion, and the endleſs gingle of
Words.</p>
               <p>Would you know why Poets are poor;
I think it is their due Reward; for when
men weakly are too much enamour'd with
Butter-fly Fancy, 'tis fit, as a piece of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Juſtice, that Poverty, as an arm'd
Man, ſhould come upon them, and force
them to Reaſon, and to worldly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
real Cares to imploy them better.</p>
               <p>And yet, to ſhew the Vanity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
'tis wonderful to ſee how they are
bewitched to the Charming Rhymes of
Verſes; but more eſpecially, if they are
<hi>Satyr,</hi> men are naturally envious, and love
to admire themſelves, chiefly, in the
degrading of others: And hence 'tis, that
you ſhall find a Lord <hi>R</hi>—maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Wit, cry'd up for a Miracle, when
may be a fifty times greater or diviner
in a good Man, is ſcarce diſcernable.</p>
               <p>But above all, what infinite Lies and
Fables our Poets, Ancient and Modern,
have fill'd the world with? Who can
end the Stories of their Gods, their Ryots,
and Metamorphoſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65770:107"/>
means in the Debauch of the Old Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Morals; and ſo even now, Who looks
into a Poem and expects truth? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs!
What is it but our common Plays
and Poems that paint Vices for Vertues,
and turn even the Devil to an Angel of
Light?</p>
               <p>And what, ſhall we call theſe Poets <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
then? No: if their Rage be inſpir'd
them, 'tis by the Devil; if they deal in
Hiſtory, they ſophiſticate it; or if in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
they rhodomontado it: So that in
truth, Poetry may very properly be call'd
<hi>Vinum Daemonum,</hi> and deſerve no manner
of reſpect with men of Judgment; for
tho' the Subject be good and pious, yet
who delights to ſee it ſtrain'd beyond truth?
Surely, Poetry when it is exceſſive, deſerves
rather to be called a Madneſs than an Art.</p>
               <p>As for the Laws of Poetry, 'tis idle
to ſet fixt Forms or Bounds for Rhymes
or Metre either, ſince the only Rule for
Poetry, is the adding the Delight as it were
of Chyming Words to the Senſe; nay, and
that may be as well without Rhymes as
with. Witneſs <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> and
the <hi>Latine Poets,</hi> or without ſet Metre, as
<hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Cowleys</hi> Pindaricks, or indeed,
any other way whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:65770:107"/>
And, ſo as to the Feet of ſuch <hi>Meter,</hi>
whether <hi>Dactils,</hi> or <hi>Spondees,</hi> &amp;c. and as to
the bounds of ſuch <hi>Meter,</hi> whether <hi>Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks,</hi>
&amp;c. the ſearch is both idle and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs:
Indeed <hi>Alſted</hi> reckons up no leſs
then 124. ſeveral Feet; ſo that Cuſtom is
only able to limit them, and Pleaſurable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is their greateſt Excellency. Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
even in Oratory is neceſſary, that its
Roughneſs may not interrupt Attention;
and more even in <hi>Poetry,</hi> is idle.</p>
               <p>So, What ſhall I ſay to our ſeveral
ſorts of <hi>Meter</hi> alſo; your <hi>Acroſticks,</hi> your
<hi>Anagrams,</hi> and an Hundred other little
Bawbles; as <hi>Ecchoes, Riddles, Meter,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
in the ſhape of <hi>Pots</hi> and <hi>Crowns;</hi> ſo
your <hi>Verſes</hi> that are to be Read backwards,
and that contain the Year of the Date in
<hi>Roman Letters?</hi> Are not theſe endleſs
and innumerable Trifles, and fitter for a
Toy-ſhop, than a Wiſe Man's Head?</p>
               <p>So alſo, What a ſputter we have to
know the Long, and the Short of a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!
forſooth, we muſt have Whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
for the ſake of ſuch a Trifle: So,
What a Noiſe we have to know the due
Bounds of a <hi>Poetica Licentia,</hi> as if there
were ſome Myſtery, or Divinity in the
Impertinencies of <hi>Poets; Riſum teneatis

               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:65770:108"/>
And yet after all, not but that <hi>Poetry</hi> not
abus'd, may be both pleaſant and uſeful
too, in its time; but then it ought preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to follow Truth in Story, and not be
cramp'd in the <hi>Meter:</hi> To be ſhort, the

are, when Men either cripple it with too

contempt? ſurely our ſelves: If
we reverence him not duly, 'tis we
ſhall ſuffer for it: Alaſs! he himſelf ſtands
in need of none of our honour.</p>
               <p>Some Heathens have never deliver'd
the Name of GOD but in Great Letters;
nay, others have never Printed any other
Word in the ſame Line, leaſt the haſty
Reader ſhould heedleſly paſs it o're; but,
Can this be to the honour of us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who thus care not how we treat
him?</p>
               <p>Were we to Write the Life of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
the Great, and after ſome ſingular
Praiſes and Encomiums, ſhould Dedicate
it to ſome illuſtrious, over-grown, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
well qualified Mouſe; Would not
this redound, by way of Matchleſs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to <hi>Alexander?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:65770:110"/>
Even ſo, when we treat with the
Great God of Heaven, Is it decent to
magnifie even Princes in his Preſence?
nay, Is there any Parity between Finite
and Infinite? and the diſhonour to God
and <hi>Alexander</hi> in ſuch caſe?</p>
               <p>Surely, all our private Dedications are,
at beſt, but an Injuſtice to God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but ſuch as theſe a manifeſt Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
to him: VVe ought not to Name
the Name, much leſs to treat any thing
relating to the Divine Being, without
the greateſt ſence of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>VVhen we Name therefore the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
Infinite and Eternal Maker of all
things, Is it ſuitable, even to Aggrandize
the whole Earth in his Preſence? and to
whom the whole Globe is but as a drop of
the Bucket?</p>
               <p>VVhen we deliver his Truths, Is it
ſuitable to any ſence of Providence to
crave the Protection of any Man on
Earth for them? Good God! How great
is the vanity, as well as the Impiety of
theſe flatteries?</p>
               <p>He that alone endures for Ages, that
diſpoſes of Kingdoms at his pleaſure,
and in whoſe hand, are, and have been
all the Mightieſt Men upon Earth;
Needs he an Aſſiſtant, leaſt his eternal
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65770:110"/>
VVill ſhould fail? And, if 'tis not his
VVill, VVho ſhall ſupport it?</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; I wiſh what <hi>I</hi> VVrite
could Perſwade Men to a more truly
Religious frame in this Matter; if not,
I yet ſhall be content, that I have done
my duty in VVarning them, and to
the VVill of God be left the Succeſs
on it.</p>
               <p>But, for my own part, I declare,
were I either to loſe or gain the <hi>Indies</hi>
by ſuch Methods, I would ſooner burn
my Self and Papers, than ſtoop to ſo mean
and corrupt a Practice.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay, that like the Apoſtles, we
may not juſtly write <hi>Epiſtolarly</hi> to a <hi>Church,</hi>
or Brother; for certainly, ſo long as we
preſerve the due Decorum of Decency
and Verity, that muſt be moſt Innocent;
but ſurely, whatever exceeds that, muſt
ſavour either of Vanity or Evil.</p>

Diſpoſition of Buſineſs; and yet to ſpend
too much time in Study, is ſloth; to uſe
them too much for Ornament, is Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and, to confine our Judgment too
preciſely to their Rules, is Formal and
Pedantick.</p>
               <p>And thus likewiſe, Reading makes a
full Man, or copious Notion; Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
a ready Man, and a temper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable;
and Writing an exact Man, or a
Complete Idea. Indeed, there is no ſtond,
or impediment in the Wit, but that may
be wrought out by fit Studies: And if
there be any knot, that I cannot by Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

do it at another.</p>
               <p>But he buyes himſelf but a melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Now, ſuch our neceſſity appears
by this, either in attaining agreeable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments,
or in preparation for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
or in a Charitable inſtruction of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65770:111"/>
our Brother: But rather than Study be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
theſe ends, we ought to confine our
ſelves even to ſet-hours, and to times and
ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; Crafty Men contemn Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as the longeſt way about, and, as
true Wiſdom is too laborious for them;
ſimple Men admire them, as it is their
very Exaltation to be in Wonders; and
Wiſe Men uſe them: they perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and are perfected by Experience:
for Natural Parts, like Natural Plants,

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Method of Study.</head>
                  <p>But, as we love to do nothing in vain,
and are not willing to beſtow pains, where
it will not make us any return; ſo, no
Prudent Man will venture on any courſe
of Study, till he has firſt throughly ſetled
the exacteſt Meaſures of his Method.</p>
                  <p>And thus, if you Read, obſerve nicely
to do it deliberately, chooſing your times,
when you are not likely to be diſturb'd;
but, above all, be ſure to maintain a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
and ſteady apprehenſion in whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you do; and whenever you find that
diſturbed, or deſtroy'd, never diſtract your
ſelf further, but ceaſe Study, leaſt you loſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65770:112"/>
as much in the Confuſion and want of
Method, as you get in the Quantity.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I may add, to Study more
than four or five hours a day, except it be
purely in Copying Writings, is too much;
it precipitates our Judgment, and ſowrs
our proceedings; And, what Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can you expect then, when as you
increaſe in the Maſs, you loſe in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion;
nay, and may be, for want of
Conſideration, indiſcernably engage your
ſelf in nothing elſe but Trifles.</p>
                  <p>Nay, and beſides, What is it that makes
our Studies uneaſie to us, but when we
are thus careleſs in Examining their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances?
if we are too violent in them,
well may we be confounded and fatigued;
and if we Thoughtleſly ſet about them,
in the midſt of Interruption, Can we
juſtly charge it on the Nature of Study,
when we complain of its uneaſineſs?</p>
                  <p>So in Reading, Can you think that
when you gallop over a good <hi>Author,</hi> you
do not flatten him, and loſe half his Life
and Subſtance? ſurely you do: Alaſs! if
you intend to be a Student to effect, you
muſt learn to purſue your Subject with
Patience, and Diſcipline your ſelf to a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
conſtancy; but, above all, if you
intend to Study much, riſe early, and have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65770:112"/>
time before you, For why ſhould you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
your Health by it for want of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe?</p>
                  <p>Nor be diſcouraged, that thou canſt
not ſucceed in thy Studies immediately, or
at the firſt engagement; if thou aimeſt at
Perfection, thou muſt not Muſhroom-like,
think to ſpring up in a day, no, nor
a Year; no, alaſs! thou muſt cut thy
way even through Mountains of Errors
and Prejudices: And, though thou mayſt
patch up a Cottage in an hour, yet a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
City of Thought, a new <hi>Rome,</hi> fit
for an Humane Soul to reign in, is not
to be hew'd out of the Rocks, rear'd and
adorn'd in a day.</p>
                  <p>And, in this caſe, had the World been as
diligent in a ſincere and impartial Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as they have been in their Pedantry,
I am perſwaded that by this time, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
had been Quadruple to what it is;
not that I would have Men wholly fling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
all former helps neither; but I would
have them make their Reading as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to their own digeſtion; for my
part there's nothing that I have either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
or borrow'd, that I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to my own Method and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:65770:113"/>
Hence ſome Books are to be Taſted, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be Swallow'd, and ſome few to
be Chewed and Digeſted; ſome Books
may be Read by Deputy, that is, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts:
But, in all our Methods we ought
never to Read, to Contradict and Confute
only; nor to believe, nor take for granted,
nor meerly to find Talk and Diſcourſe;
but duly to Weigh, Conſider, and Digeſt
alſo.</p>
                  <p>And, in this Caſe, I may add, that, as
an ill Stomach craves for more than it can
digeſt, ſo 'tis an irregular Student that
Reads more than he Conſiders how to
Command: and, as he that in ſuch caſe,
eats more than he Digeſts, breeds Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
ſo, ſurely, I may as juſtly add,
that a Reader, beyond the true Capacity
of his Comprehenſion alſo, breeds Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.
And, to carry the Simile a little
further.</p>
                  <p>As the ſoundeſt Meats prove the beſt
nouriſhment, though they are often diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to digeſt, ſo the Intricateſt Notions
commonly prove the Students beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,
though for a little time they may
amuſe his Conception; for, as Marrow
lies in bones, ſo Valuable Secrets lye gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
wrapt in Difficulties; beſides that,
any one Difficulty left unconquer'd, is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65770:113"/>
enough to cloud and confound the whole
Idea of our Studies and Notions that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it.</p>
                  <p>As for Collections in Writing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, to Study by Reading, is but to
try to fill <hi>Proſerpina</hi>'s Seeve: Think
firſt with your ſelf, what will be really
material and ſubſtantial in them; and learn
to diſtinguiſh Dreſſing from Subjects, and
Ornaments from Things; the firſt may be
Abridg'd, and Compris'd in ſhort, while
the latter is various, nay infinite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
impertinent: Thr firſt is the
compoſure of ſolid Judgment, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but the Froth and Wantonneſs of
Fancy.</p>
                  <p>As for your Method in Collecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let it be clear, ſhort, and well-advis'd;
clear, that you may make an eaſie recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and eaſily continue your courſe; ſhort,
that you may not beſtow more pains in
Shadow than Subſtance; or Method
than Matter; and well-advis'd, that you
may proceed without Repentance, and
that you may not be perpetually imploy'd
in laying of New Foundations, but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cheerfully to build your Superſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
on.</p>

For my part, till I purified thus my
Method, the more I ſtudied, the more I
was confounded; but thus I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerv'd my Idea entire, but one part of
my Study has help'd the other, while my
whole Body lies eaſie for me, either for
Correction or Improvement, and as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
I ſhall ſee occaſion. But beſides this,
we ought to conſider to keep our Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
within the bounds of a due Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
alſo.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The true Limitation of Studies.</head>
                  <p>And thus, firſt, we ought to limit our
Studies to our uſe, and to fit them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our defects; Thus Hiſtories will teach
us Wiſdom, through Experimental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts:
<hi>Poets</hi> will make us Witty, but
Light and Flaſhy; the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> will
make us Subtile and not Credulous; <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Philoſophy</hi> Deep and Reaſoning; <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
Grave and Good; And <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi>
will teach one Faction, and make
one able to Contend.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo, if a Man's Wit be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
let him Study the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi>
for if in Demonſtrations he go never ſo
little aſide, he muſt begin all again; ſo if
he be not apt to diſtinguiſh, Read
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65770:114"/>
the Schoolmen; or if he be not apt to
beat our Matters, or to call up one thing,
to prove and illuſtrate another, let him
Study the <hi>Lawyers Caſes,</hi> and ſo every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the Mind may have a ſpecial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.</p>
                  <p>So if he be apt to be Idle, let him borrow
the Books he is to Study, for a time, and
that will make him either diligent, or
want; nor let him, in Studying, only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
or Read, for that is but to ſee his
Face in a Glaſs, and to leave fleeting Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
in the Memory only, and that will
inſtantly be blotted out; whereas by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
alſo we draw a more laſting Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe Reflection on Converſation
is far better than crude Books, and too
much Reading; in Truth, one may ſay,
Not only that Book-learning is commonly
too Pedantick and Formal to benefit; but
indeed, that Books, in themſelves, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as idle as infinite; and ſo that, in
Truth, 'tis a matter greatly worth our exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
how far to Study, and what to
Read; and alſo, what to fling aſide as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>
                  <p>And thus the knowing what's fit to be
Studied, ſaves half the pains; and, in ſuch
caſe, juſt enough in Charity and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65770:115"/>
is ſufficient: We are not here to get
Knowledge for the other World, as ſome
idly have imagin'd; our ſincerity indeed
will ſtand us in ſtead there, but our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not in the leaſt. Alaſs! the Preſent
ſtate of our Nature and ſences is Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and not to laſt.</p>
                  <p>Before therefore we deſcend into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
branches of Humane Learning, it
were the higheſt prudence firſt to diſcern
between Knowledge, profitable and uſeleſs,
curious and ſolid; and in which caſe, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
as I have ſaid, 'tis equally vain and
fooliſh, to think to arrive at a nice perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Wiſdom, the prerogative of God;
and we ſhould confine our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as well to what is rationally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our powers, as to what is uſeful.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Philoſophers Stone, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it acquirable, yet it were both lazy
and an uninduſtrious encroaching on the
publick property to attain it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
deſervedly puniſhable by Laws. And
thus, there are ſome things alſo more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
unlawful to be ſtudied, as I have
already ſhewn, and which will much
ſhorten an Univerſal Idea, as Witchcraft,
as Rebellion to God, and ſuperſtitious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
as tempting him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:65770:115"/>
But, beſides theſe greater Evils, How
many may I add, ſpend their time about
Words, and never dive into Senſe? How
many pleaſe themſelves rather with the
ſlight imaginations and fancies of other
than trouble themſelves to look for truth?
I ſay, we need only reflect, how eaſily we
may diſpence with theſe, and many others
ſorts of Knowledge, and not envy the
Poſſeſſours of them; and indeed, what but
ſuch Exuberances in Studies, make our
preſent Philoſophy a meer idle Chimera
and Vanity?</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, the true end of Study, as
of all things elſe, is the glory of God, and
the good of his Creatures: Now, as we
cannot ſay, we purſue either of theſe ends,
when we ſtudy Trifles, ſo are ſuch imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſinful; and tho' I would obtain a
complete Knowledge, and raiſe its Banks
too high for the Storms of raving Wit and
trifling Error, to be able to deſtroy; yet
withall, I would not beſtow the leaſt pains
on what might look either unneceſſary or
evil.</p>

                  <head>Of the Choice of Books.</head>
                  <p>And thus alſo we pity our loſs of
Books; alaſs, fond Fools that we are!
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65770:116"/>
What is loſt that occaſional induſtry and
neceſſity cannot retrieve? Beſides, we are
miſtaken to ſeek for Wiſdom in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Authors; we had as good look for
it in the Mobile, where ſome are moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'd,
ſome purblind, ſome confident, as
Mountebanks, and others, perverſe even
as Devils.</p>
                  <p>Nay, when we conſider the meer mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of Books, tho' I would allow my
ſelf to conſult the choicer for my Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
yet in general, I would as ſoon hear
every Man's Dream as read his Works;
and I ought therefore, rather firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what Books I ought to read, and next,
what may be convenient for me by way
of reſort.</p>
                  <p>Now, as for the Election of Authors,
I know no other method than the Vogue
of the Learn'd; in Morality and Divinity,
thoſe whom Time and Antiquity have
commended, and who have ſtood the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Ages, are to be choſen; and not
every Modern Author, whoſe gawdy Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and popular Prejudices make him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at Noiſe than Reaſoning: But as for
experimental Wiſdom, as intereſt is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to improve the World with her Age, ſo
the latter Authors are there to be prefer'd
before blind Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:65770:116"/>
But wouldſt thou know a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Teſt for good Books, I mean moral
ones; they are ſuch as have Learning and
Sincerity, but more eſpecially Sincerity:
And hence the Scriptures which no one can
eſteem, to exceed in regular Learning; yet
as being moſt pure and tranſcendant in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
infinitely exceed all other Books:
Alaſs! 'tis not Notion but bright Sincerity,
that duly and juſtly gives the Preference.
Indeed, what good can a ſiniſter, cunning,
or Pedantry do us?</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, 'twere too tedious for
me here to give you long Catalogues of
Books; and beſides, my deſigns is rather
towards a general Advice; if the Student
want particular Authors Names there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
let him conſult the proper Artiſts,
and the peruſal of Books themſelves; and
yet let him even then rather chooſe a few
and choice Books than a Library; for a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
will confound us, where a moderate
Quantity will aſſiſt and help us; and in
truth, Maſters of great Libraries too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
like Bookſellers, deal no deeper
than in Titles.</p>
                  <p>As for the encouragement of diverting
needleſs Studies, I ſhall only ſay this, 'tis
fit a Gentleman ſhould have at leaſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
into all things; he need not aim at
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65770:117"/>
being a Maſter in all, and yet he may take
a ſlight View or Lanskaf of all: for tho'
he intends but one thing as his buſineſs, yet
he may juſtly make the Survey of all, the
Ring of his Recreation and Diverſion:
For who can diſtinguiſh things better than
he that has the largeſt proſpect?</p>
                  <p>And yet in ſuch looſer Studies, I would
not read a mean Book: Suppoſe he help
thee to a good Notion or two, will that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
thee for thy pains and loſs of time?
Nor needſt thou doubt in ſuch caſe, but that
if thou readſt the choicer Authors upon
the ſame Subject, that they will give thee
the ſame thing, and in much better order,
than a little pretender ſhall. I may ſay,
our dozing our ſelves with an unprofitable
reading, What is it, but like poyſoning
and cankring our minds, and which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
us to dote away our time in perpetual
maze and confuſion?</p>
                  <p>When thou haſt therefore tryed ſome
few pages in an Author, and canſt not like
him, reject him: for as 'tis impoſſible for
a man to read all Books, ſo 'tis enough if
he do the beſt; and 'tis our Unhappineſs
if a Pearl lye ſcatter'd in an unproper
Soile: and if a good Notion be loſt, becauſe
deliver'd by an ill Author, I ſay, 'tis a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
in diſcretion inevitable; for the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65770:117"/>
Man is mad that thinks to read all Books:
and yet, if an Author lye in a good method,
a little pains may ſerve to Examine
him.</p>
                  <p>Further, there is a weak and cowardly
prejudice in men, I mean, when the dread
of being ſeduc'd by ill Books, makes them
afraid to read good ones, if they have but
a bad Name: But why ſo, I ſay? If what
an Author write be true, Why ſhould I
be Bug-beard from an opportunity of being

the integrity or ſtrength of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning?
and thus is it not a ſhame, that an

                  <p>I am afraid, the too common and Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Notions of the World are a little rotten
at the heart, or elſe methinks their Abettors
need not be put to theſe ſhifts and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to confute their Adverſaries: Alaſs!
Truth, like the Sun, of its ſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
force, is able to cleer all the Fogs of
Fallacy and Sophiſtry; and nothing but
Error and Prejudice need dread the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of Argument, and the Teſt of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p>An affected ſingularity indeed in all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
is odious; but this Perverſeneſs in
the popularity of the World, makes it, that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65770:118"/>
if ever we intend to ſtudy Truth, we muſt
be ſingular ſometimes, and dare converſe
with Men and Books that are ſo; or elſe at
laſt, we may find to our loſs, that we ſhall
explode Truth and Sincerity too often
with ſuch Authors. I ſhall add a little in
general of Speculation and Practice, as the
main rule of our Study, and conclude.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of Speculation and Practice.</head>
                  <p>Our Speculation in general, ought to be
ſo far ſubſervient to our Practice, that I
may ſay, we profane Precepts as well as
Piety, when we take their words into our
mouth, or tranſcribe them with our Pens,
and do not live and act accordingly. In
Divinity nothing is more dangerous than
Knowledge without Obedience: Chriſt
tells us, <hi>That he that knew his Maſters Will,
and perform'd it not, ſhould be beaten with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtripes:</hi> And he that pretends to Vertue
no otherwiſe than in Notion, is no better
than an Hypocrite, or at beſt a Chymera
Book-worm.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we ought not to neglect Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation;
and yet as Practice is the end of
Speculation, ſurely no man will prefer the
means before the end. Practice without
Speculation at worſt, makes us but impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65770:118"/>
but meer Speculation renders us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
and drones: And in truth, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
by meer Speculation, is confounded,
and only ripen'd by Action.</p>
                  <p>Nay, Knowledge without Practice, is
but a Luſt of Curioſity; and the man that
cannot propoſe a good Moral End in his
Studies, had as good divert himſelf with
the Purling of Brooks and Pibles, as the
meer change of Words and Notions; and
yet 'tis the curſe of your dreaming Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts,
that they not only have no taſte of
real Wiſdom, but miſpend the time that
ſhould lead them to it. Wiſdom is Folly,
and Prudence Madneſs, in ſuch a man;
and yet, Hypocrite-like, he ſhall read their
Precepts even with delight, as long as their
Novelty laſts.</p>
                  <p>The meaſure therefore of our Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ought to be this; ſufficient to advance
our Practice, and not impede it, of things
uſeful, and not of unprofitable Whimſeys,
of bettering Life, as Vertue and Religion,
and not turning men into thinking, and
reading Melancholliſts; 'tis a Vice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that knowledge that is not of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
when had; and we miſemploy our
method of thinking, if we engage it pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a puzzle of Thoughts: Indeed, the
Mind working on matter, produceth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65770:119"/>
Notions, but on its ſelf nothing but
Cobwebs and Trifles.</p>
                  <p>And thus alſo, there are ſome men ſo
weak as to look for Morality even in Plays
and Romances; but alaſs! they but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves, and ſeek but for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of Vertue, while they dare not the
Brave and Nobler Self-denial of her purer
Precepts: Poor Pretenders! Why do they
ſhuffle ſo? a courageable Enemy is better
than a Baſtard Friend: Think you ever
to reconcile Good and Evil, or God and
the Devil? Surely, the man that even ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouzes
in his Luſts, is an innocent to ſuch
as Hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole therefore, you ſee I
may make my ſelf learneder by reading,
but only wiſer by moderating and regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Actions: I will not therefore ſpend
all my Vigour in Diſcipline, in the Dreſſing
Room of my Soul: I muſt live as well as
think; and yet, as I know Error is too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to ſtrong for me, I will always leave
room for Repentance, Amendment, and
new Precepts.</p>
                  <p>And, as our Speculation therefore ought
not to be continual, ſo at length, I would
have a man ſay, <hi>Lectum, conſideratum, &amp; Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
eſt, &amp; nunc vivam;</hi> when once <hi>I</hi> have
made my Rule to live by, I'le ſee how I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65770:119"/>
can draw my Life and Actions by it;
Wiſdom was never intended to be acquir'd
only, but enjoy'd; and that Knowledge is
Folly, not Wiſdom, that does not apply
its ſelf to the uſes of Man.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude; the only Reaſon that
makes Speculation and Practice differ
ſo much, comes from the vicious and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera
Prejudices of Mankind: indeed,
were our Knowledge reduc'd ſincerely to
the due bounds of Wiſdom, we ſhould
find our Precepts would be like to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration;
and a man would no ſooner read
them, but he would be convinc'd beyond
all doubt, to act by them.</p>

               <p>ONe may ſay, the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> and
all things about us, contribute to
make us what we are in every reſpect; but
our minds, and the purity thereof, ſo that
indeed, who ever loves us on any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than that, their love muſt needs be
tranſitory; for being made what we are
by our circumſtances, and they changing
as they perpetually do, we become others
than we were; ſo that in ſuch caſe, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be juſtly called an Unconſtancy, to
change our Affections, when the Objects
themſelves have chang'd.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that our Conſtancy in
Love, What is it but a perpetual Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
and which cauſes our hearts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
ſucceſſively to all the Qualities of the
Perſon that we love, giving ſometimes the
preference to one, and ſometimes to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
So that, in truth, the beſt of our
Conſtancies, except to God, want a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
and really, what are they but our
Inconſtancys limited, and unreaſonably
bound up in one Subject, by an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Obſtinacy?</p>
               <p>And thus, What but this is it, that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65770:120"/>
makes us ſeek for new Friends, and freſh
Faces every day, and yet not but that that
which makes us love new Acquaintance, is
not always ſo much a wearineſs of our old,
or the pleaſure of Change, as the Diſtaſte
which we have, that we are not enough
admir'd by thoſe that we know too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly,
and the hope we have to be more
admir'd by thoſe that know us but a
little?</p>
               <p>But to return; there are two ſorts of
Conſtancy in Love; the one is, becauſe we
find perpetually in the perſon we love (as
in an inexhauſible Fountain) new Cauſes
to love; the other is, that one holds it diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to change or break ones word; and
ſo alſo, there is an inconſtancy which
comes from a Levity of mind, and which
changes every moment its opinion, or out
of weakneſs, which makes it receive all
the Opinions of others: and ſo there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Inconſtancy, which is more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable,
and which comes from the things
themſelves, through their loſing their reliſh.</p>
               <p>Nor is ſuch an Inconſtancy, except in
Vertue or Friendſhip to be diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;
for why may not I juſtly
follow my Inclination, and the change of
Things? But he that is falſe to his friend,
or that complains of his friend, that he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65770:121"/>
may be able before hand the better to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
his own levity, is guilty of a perverſe
Treachery; or elſe, I may ſay, our perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
deſerves neither praiſe nor blame;
for indeed, 'tis no more than a continuance
of our Taſte and Thoughts, and which we
may as innocently as juſtly be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from us, or change at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>But as for our conſtancy in Goodneſs,
Sincerity, and Truth, it is the chief and
crown of all Vertues, and even the beſt of
Vertues: Vertues themſelves degenerate
to a Vice without it; if we have either
Bravery or Goodneſs therefore, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to crown all ſuch endeavours with
Conſtancy. Conſtancy will make even
condemn'd Innocence glory in her Vertue;
and Patience and penitent Guilt ſubmit
and co-operate with Juſtice. Whilſt I am
conſtant to the Tracks of Vertue, my Breaſt
ſhall be immovable and eaſy, and neither
Crowns ſhall make me proud, nor Rags
aſham'd.</p>
               <p>Nay, and while I thus mix Conſtancy
with Wiſdom, my Affairs ſhall be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Prudence ſhall cut out their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
I'le foreknow the variety and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of buſineſs, and neither Accident nor
Novelty ſhall confound or ſurprize me; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that man ought not ſo much as to

has not ſtrengthned and gariſon'd his
Reaſon, and given it an entire proſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the common little Mountains of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, I would even hate my mind
till I make it ſpeak the ſame thing to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that it does to day; my certainty and
my faith ſhall be the ſame, and <hi>I</hi> will have
an equal regard for them at all times.
Cannot human Frailty bear this? purified
Reaſon and Precepts ſhall.</p>
               <p>My Ideas ſhall not be fleeting and
changable at every blaſt of Reaſoning, nor
my Reſolution wavering; I will know the
certainty of Piety, Vertue and Truth; if
they have no bottom, I'le never hamper
my ſelf with them; if they have, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
I will follow them; nay, and I hope
by the help of God, by the ſame rule, to be
able to reduce my Notions to Principles
that ſhall laſt as long as the Sun ſhines.</p>
               <p>Have I misfortunes? and what then!
does not the ſame reaſon of things always
continue? or was I ever ſo weak as not to
expect Accidents? if not, Why is my Mind
and Reſolution chang'd? is not my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the ſame ſtill? or what! muſt I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my ſelf to the Wind, and be as change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65770:122"/>
as the Weather-cock; be a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
to day, a Fidler to morrow, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day find ſome new Whimſeys for my
Entertainment?</p>
               <p>No, Conſtancy is the moſt potent and
crown of all Vertues; and through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
I will, nay I doubt not, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
all things. Conſtancy even in drops
wears Stones away, while nothing is more
weak than a Pretender; if we have never
ſo great an Appearance in our Actions ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Vertue or Courage, yet if we want
Conſtancy and Perſeverance, our Profeſſion
is idle, and our Pretences are vain; nay,
and they reflect more upon us, than if we
were abſolutely negligent.</p>
               <p>And yet, tho' nothing can recommend
its ſelf more to us than Conſtancy, yet it
ought to be with this Limitation, in what
is good, and truth only; and not in a lie, or
evil. Conſtancy in Vice enhances our Guilt,
and Perſeverance in Error after Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be it on any pretence whatever, is the
ſure method of Folly and Ignorance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
Conſtancy is only in good things;
and 'tis Obſtinacy that fixes us in evil, and
that makes Sin and Vice eternal, and that
forbids Repentance for fear of Change.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And yet tho' hence we ought to abhor
War, yet we ought never to forget it, no,
not even in time of Peace: if the rigour of

Precepts ſhould be preſerv'd pure;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65770:123"/>
for nothing ſurely can Diſengage us of
our Self Preſervation.</p>
               <p>And yet not that, not to be backward
in juſt Wars, ſhould forward us therefore
to Rapine or Murder neither; God certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
has Plagues and real Cauſes of Wars
enough to eaſe the World of being over-peopled
by, without our Preſumptious,
Murders and Deſolations: Have I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the juſteſt cauſe of War, if poſſible,
I will ſtifle it.</p>
               <p>Thus, Is my Merchant injur'd? I will
ſatisfie him by repriſal. And, have I wrong'd
my Neighbour? I will acquit my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, in tendring him ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Princes ſhould conſider the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of an unjuſt War upon their Subjects,
before they begin it. I might add, Is the
Right doubtful? And what, will not an
Arbitration ſerve and ſave humane Blood?</p>
               <p>In truth, War without Cauſe is preda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and bruitiſh, and a meer Souldier is
worſe than an blangman; a Generous Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
ſure would die rather than fight
without a good Cauſe declar'd. In doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
caſes indeed, I'le obey my Prince; but
ſhall he make a Man-Butcher of me?</p>
               <p>Not but that War undoubtedly may be
moſt lawful too; for even the ſame Chriſt
that could aboliſh the rule, of an <hi>eye for an

               </p>
               <p>To be ſhort; God has given us a Being,
And ſhall we not value his kindneſs, by all
the lawful ways of ſelf-preſervation? And
what, may we not then juſtly reſiſt all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Aggreſſors, and avenge our ſelves of
our ſecret Enemies, to incapacitate them in
their evil deſigns?</p>
               <p>Nay, and if this be the Law of Nature;
Pray where is't aboliſh'd? and ſurely, it is
ſuch, nay, and to that degree, that a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may lawfully Raiſe a War of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their own heads, and without the
Authority of their Prince, where 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
even as all Caſuiſts allow.</p>
               <p>And yet, not but that I may wickedly
Proſecute the Juſteſt War too; War ſhould
be manag'd, as by a Judge, to Pay the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Debt, and not as by a Robber, to
Murder and Plunder.</p>
               <p>Thus I have a juſt occaſion of War,
when I ſee another aſſault me, nay, when
I have a good Ground of Jealouſie and Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,

               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:65770:124"/>
So, Do I ſee my Neighbour's Subjects
miſerably diſtreſt? 'tis my Duty not to
ſee Piety, Honeſty and Innocence diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
and yet, though to Relieve the
Oppreſt for Religion, may be a good cauſe
of War, yet, to propagate it, can be none.</p>
               <p>So, Is my Brother Ignorant, or an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?
Charity will let me adviſe him, but
not force him: But does my Brother
Sacrifice his Children? Is he a Sodomite,
or a Murderer, as <hi>Benjamin?</hi> ſurely I, with
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> may War with him, to bring him to
a better temper.</p>
               <p>So Papiſts, by their Principle, That no
Faith's to be kept with Hereticks, give an
Immortal cauſe of War: We ſight a more
generous and open Enemy, And are not
we Bewitch'd to forgive one, Bloody, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
and Inveterate, as the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is then?</p>
               <p>'Tis pity, indeed, we don't Indulge
their Tender Conſciences, and let them
Murder us; 'tis their Principle and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
If it be their Religion, I ſay, 'tis
from the Devil, and let us fight them till
they alter it: What! Profeſs our ſelves
Sheep for the ſlaughter? I don't know
whether Proteſtant States may not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for't to God, as Self-murderers, that
they have tender'd ſuch Vermin-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:65770:124"/>
So, ſurely, I have a right to take a
Sword from a Mad-man, to Arbitrate my
Neighbour's Popular Commotions, and to
interpoſe towards ſetling the Peace of my
Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Thus, If my Neighbour begins a
War, though with another Neighbour;
the Wolf ſhall not think, by my ſtanding
Neuter, to devour me next; and yet I will
not help a too Potent Prince abus'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
For why ſhould I aſſiſt him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
my ſelf?</p>
               <p>Thus 'twas the War of Righteous <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
to reduce thoſe Conquerors that
carried away his Brother <hi>Lot.</hi> And yet,
if the War for my Brother be too deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
I am not bound to fling away my
Life for his ſake.</p>
               <p>But are only my Merchants Injur'd, and
by private Perſons? I have no cauſe of
War, if either ſatisfaction be tender'd, or
the Offenders deliver'd up; but ſuch an
Injury, by a Commiſſion'd Subject, is a
compleat cauſe of War.</p>
               <p>So I may Naturalize a Subject of my
Neighbours without offence; but if I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to Naturalize a Town, or to encroach
but one foot on his Dominions, he has a juſt
Cauſe of War againſt me; and yet even then
he ought not only to demand a Reaſonable
Satisfaction, but ſolemnly to denounce it,
e're he begins with Acts of Hoſtility.</p>

               <p>ONe ordinary General is better than

And yet 'tis hard to truſt the

for Van, Main Body, and Reer;
and changing their Commands each Week;
and ſo you may not only be aſſur'd of a
General on all hazards, but as well ſecure
their Fidelity, as relieve their Courages.</p>
               <p>Nor were it amiſs alſo, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
once a Year for a General to make all

in his Army whatever.</p>
               <p>As for the Skill of a General, it has two
advantages, Duty and Stratagem; Duty,
to know the force and order of Military

be a Souldier; and Stratagem, to prevent
and ſecure future Accidents to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65770:125"/>
and, in this, 'tis his own ingenuity;
and a Council of War muſt aid him.</p>
               <p>Nor is any thing more worthy a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
care in this caſe, than the choice and
management of his Council of War: Does
he fear Treachery in it, and can't he talk
of what he will, though he never reſolves
on it then, and ſeem to doubt in what he

               <p>But above all, a General ought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem

he acts the greateſt publick good in

ſo nice, as to be always in temper, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffer himſelf to be harraſs'd out; he
is the head of the Army, and therefore
ought never to be without vigorous
Thoughts and Counſils for every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of Stratagem, or Service that may
offer.</p>
               <p>And, in this, a General ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
alſo, that in all extremities he has a
Commiſſion from the Law of Nature, as
well as his Prince; not, I mean, but that
in affronts and trifles, he ſhould chooſe to
let Time give him ſatisfaction; but, in
imminent dangers, his own diſcretion, as
well as his Princes words, ought to be his
Rule.</p>
               <p>Further, a General ought to be moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65770:126"/>
and yet moſt juſt alſo; ſevere, to awe
his Enemies, and preſerve his own Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline;
and yet juſt, that he provoke nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hatred: And, indeed, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nothing is better than that the General
be belov'd: and yet, for a Prince to permit
his Army to chooſe their own General for
their Loves-ſake, is to Dethrone himſelf.</p>
               <p>But, Does a Prince ſee the Army hate
their General? he will do well to chooſe
them a better: So, does a General ſee his
Army jealous of him? let his Friend head
the jealouſie, and expoſtulate ſatisfaction,
who, beſure, will be more tender than if
his Enemies were to Judge him.</p>
               <p>But, Does a General find his Prince jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of him? his only way to anticipate it,
is, by laying down his Commiſſion; and
when he is ſo ingenious, he need not fear
further miſchief. Princes know the evil
conſequence of ill-treating ſuch great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers:
if he puniſh one too eaſily, the
next he may expect to ſecure himſelf, by
going over to the Enemy.</p>

               <p>WAR is the deciſion of a Right too
high for Judicature; wherein,
Arms is the Trial, and Conqueſt the
Judgment. To begin a War after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
perfected, and Mercy ſhewn, is a
piece of perfidy, that deſerves no Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Are you a private Man, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Mercy, through yielding up your
Right? ſurely, you Merit a Thouſand
Racks if you ungratefully reaſſume it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
you might have died in the Field,
or now continue Neuter; but, Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to fight againſt that Benefactor, that
has given you your being, and ſo ſpill
innocent blood?</p>
               <p>So to allow Quarter, when ask'd, is both
a Chriſtian and a Humane duty; while
to execute Men by Law-Civil, forgiven
by Quarter Military, is moſt barbarous.</p>
               <p>But does ſome Hen-rooſt Garriſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a Royal Army? they deſerve no
Quarter, or at leaſt they ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimated;
'tis not Generoſity, but Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that makes Men prolong Wars, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65770:127"/>
deſtroy one another without proſpect of
Relief.</p>
               <p>So, Is mine Enemy perfidious? 'tis his
fault that our ſlaughters are endleſs, who,
by his Treachery, has put it out of our
power to believe or truſt him.</p>
               <p>Not that Stratagems are diſallowable, or
that Victory is the leſs honourable for them
neither; 'tis Jeſting, not Fighting, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
every blow we intend.</p>
               <p>'Twas a generous Cuſtom of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
indeed, to give notice of Battel by
the ſound of a Bell; the courſe of late is
more wary, but not leſs bloody, to ſecure
Frontiers by Garriſons, and ſpin out Wars
by the Tricking of Armies.</p>
               <p>Wars are uſually of two ſorts, either of
Conqueſt, or like <hi>Moſes's,</hi> to root out
the Inhabitants. In a common diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Deciſion of a <hi>Goliah,</hi> or <hi>Horatii,</hi> may
ſave blood; but, an extirpating War, and
ſuch as Papiſts and Proteſtants at this day
are, can ſafely admit of a Peace on no
Terms.</p>
               <p>Thus, Am <hi>I</hi> entred into a War, and am
<hi>I</hi> like to engage with a ſtronger State? by
Garriſons <hi>I</hi> will ſtop mine Enemy, till
either by Diverſion or Aſſiſtance <hi>I</hi> can
withſtand him; but if neither my ſelf,
nor Allies, can probably reſiſt him, <hi>I</hi> will
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65770:127"/>
rather generouſly fling my ſelf under ſome
agreeable Protection, than ſtand with a
ſilly Sullenneſs to be deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>But are your Forces equal? and are you
well fortified? Admit the War in your own
Country, where you may command both
Men and Proviſions upon a loſs, and which
abroad may be fatal to your Army. Thus

home, ſtrain hard to maintain but 40000
men when abroad; and yet without Forts,
your whole Country's deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>So, is your War with a Trade-State? pen
them but in, and ſtop their Courſe, and
you make them ruine themſelves: But is
ſuch a State too powerful for you? Either
buy your Peace, make in with its Enemies,
or diſtract him by ſome inteſtine Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
perhaps ſome of the Royal Family
have a Claim to be aſſiſted.</p>
               <p>Would you delay a War? Send an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
with Propoſals of Peace; but with
ſuch perplex'd Terms, as may judicially
require ſome time to deliberate them.</p>
               <p>But are you reſolv'd on a War, and in
the mean time would blind your Enemy
while you are preparing? Amuſe your
Enemy by Secret Counſels and cloſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors;
nor need you be wanting in
Congratulatory Complements and Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65770:128"/>
Muſt I preſume, my honeſt Demands
will create a War, and may not I wait
till I am duly enabled to make them?</p>
               <p>So, Is a War begun? Invite your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
by mercy, and fright him through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.
Have you two Armies? By the
one block up Forts, while the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on the Enemy.</p>
               <p>So alſo, are you forc'd to proceed by
Sieges? Blood will ſave Blood, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
every Man in the Garriſon, where
there is not a Surrender on Summons, you
will make a quick diſpatch of the War.</p>
               <p>So alſo, to manage Secrets well, is a
great point in War; and ſo for Precepts
and Orations, to bear up mens Courages.
One General on his Death, for this very
cauſe, <hi>order'd a Drum to be made of his skin,
only to hearten his Souldiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, as for puniſhing Warlike Offences,
nothing deſerves a greater care: Cowards

rather live to expiate their Diſgrace: but

great Robberies?</hi> So ſurely, one might as
juſtly be guilty of a Robbery as a Conqueſt,
unleſs one had the juſteſt cauſe of War
to move one to it.</p>
               <p>For my part, had I the Empire of the
World through Conqueſt, yet like <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
with <hi>Sparta,</hi> it ſhould be but to ſettle
their States the better by it: Did I root
out a Tyrant, yet like the Old <hi>Romans,</hi>
would I not rob his Heirs; or ſhould I
ſubdue a Common-Wealth, t'ſhould be
but to reinſtate them in their Ancient Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Surely, I but pretend to War for my
Neighbours Relief, while I make a Prey
of him. Indeed, if a State be ſo corrupt,
as not to be able to bear to be reform'd, I
will rather take the Conqueſt into my own
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65770:129"/>
protection, than leave it weltring in Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
and Blood.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; Robbers and Murderers
of thouſands in Corruption and Flattery,
we admire without regret, while the more
innocent Rogues from neceſſity we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
in this World, and damn in the next;
but ſurely, God will be more juſt to them.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, Would you ſecure a
Conqueſt? you muſt root out the antient
Governours, or the Mobile in Faction will
reinſtate the worſt of Tyrannies: ſo, would
you transform a corrupt Common-wealth?
you muſt either raiſe their chief Cities, or
tranſplant their principal Heads, or elſe the
firſt advantage that offers them will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
your Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo, a Conqueſt where there are
NOBLES, is eaſier than where all are
SLAVES; the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Vaſſals will be
forc'd unanimouſly to withſtand you, tho
when ſubdued, your Conqueſt is entire
and ſecure; while <hi>Engliſh</hi> NOBLES, that
may aſſiſt your Victory, will withall by
the ſame Hereditary Power, render your
Conqueſt as tickliſh.</p>
               <p>To preſerve a Conqueſt therefore: <hi>Firſt,</hi>
Reſide perſonally ſometime upon it, the
better to prevent all Plots: And, <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
On pretence of kindneſs, take ſome of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65770:129"/>
the NOBLES Sons as Hoſtages with you
when you depart: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Continue
Titles of Honour to the Natives, but keep
all Offices to your own Servants: <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Let your Miniſters be only ſeen in harſh
things: And Laſtly, take particular care
of all popular Meetings, on any pretence
whatever.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort; All alterations naturally
leave a toothing for new Changes; and
therefore the beſt way to ſecure what
you have got, is like the generous <hi>Romans</hi>
alſo, to make one law of Nations: And
ſo, if you let Humanity Crown your Peace,
as Valour has adorn'd your War, you
need not fear but to govern without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>When your Conqueſts find themſelves
united to you by Marriages, their Taxes
eas'd and remitted, and their whole States
chang'd for the better; when you change
not the cuſtoms of their Provinces, and
your impartial Juſtice gives them not the
leaſt jealouſly of their Rights, you will find
men are not mad to embroyle themſelves.</p>
               <p>And yet, Are your Conqueſts in different
Languages? your vigorous beginnings
muſt not end in too ſupine a negligence;
you muſt have a jealous Eye on Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
leaſt they joyn the diſcontented Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65770:130"/>
and in this Caſe, if you cut off Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Heads, yet withall you muſt pardon
and reward as generouſly, but eſpecially
your NOBLES.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, Are you ſo neceſſitated, and
would you ſecure your Conqueſts by force?
Do it rather by Colonies, than firing them
againſt you through ſtanding Forces; he
that by right of Conqueſt is Maſter of all,
ſurely may command any little particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

               <p>Are a few diſpoſſeſt, do you obiect? 'tis
for the good of the whole, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
too poor to be formidable; and as
they are, you may make them ſatisfaction
in another place, if you pleaſe, and which is

juſtly, will never aſſiſt them.</p>

               <p>THere are many advantages of Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems;
but above all, that they breed
confidence in your own Army, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may
your Enemy: He'll dread to take
the advantage of your Miſcarriages, while
he fears the Reputation of your Deſigns.</p>
               <p>Nor is it the leaſt Excellency of Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
to alter at every turn your methods.
Thus, if ſometimes a Cap on a Staff be
made the Signal of Battel, as well as the
Sound of the Trumpet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how can your
Enemy meaſure your intentions?</p>
               <p>So, to encourage your Army, print
ſometimes a hearty Speech to your Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
with the promiſe of Rewards; ſo
do they dread your Enemy? Skirmiſh
him with ſome of your beſt men, to make
him familiar to them.</p>
               <p>So, Would you make your Souldiers
unanimous? let them do but the Enemy
ſome conſiderable miſchief before they Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
and fear will do the work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding his Souldiers deſert, in
a Speech told the reſt that ſtaid, <hi>That thoſe
that had left him had leave, and went as Spies
to the</hi> Romans; the <hi>Romans</hi> hearing of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65770:131"/>
this, cut off the Deſerters right hands, and
ſent them back to <hi>Hannibal</hi> again.</p>
               <p>So by Letters or chance words in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies,
to inſinuate that the Eenemies Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
or Officers are falſe, will give juſt the
ſame jealouſly and diſtruſt as if they were ſo.</p>
               <p>Above all, Spyes are greatly to be feared;
are they run-aways? command but every
Man to his Tent, and they are diſcovered
immediately; but Spyes near your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
are moſt pernicious; if an inconſiderable
Enemy can ſo far undermine you, you
may juſtly dread at laſt, leaſt he deſtroy
you by Stratagems alſo.</p>
               <p>Some to feel an Enemies Pulſe, ſend
Ambaſſadours often with good Souldiers in
diſguiſe; while others to blind ſuch diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
continue their number of Tents, and
draw their parties out of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>To obtain your deſire on your Enemy,
counterfeit but that you fear or deſire the
contrary, and you need not doubt his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to croſs or diſappoint you: But
would you avoid fighting him? beſure
keep at leaſt 50 Miles from him.</p>
               <p>So, does he ſtreighten you? amuſe him
by ſome Truce or Stratagem; Thus ſome
have driven Oxen with combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fir'd on their horns before them, and
ſo eſcap'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:65770:131"/>
Nor, is it inconſiderable, the skill and
Command of Poſts and Paſſes in this caſe,
and yet not but that to repoſe your whole
truſt on them is as ruinous.</p>
               <p>But has your Enemy diſtreſſed you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in Stratagems? uſe the following or
like Remedies.</p>
               <p>Thus, does your Enemy encompaſs you
gather your ſelf cloſe and break through
his weaker ſides; does he preſs you between
two Hills? make but a Trench behind you,
and you may fight which half of him you
pleaſe: does the other half come round up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you? a wooden-Bridge made, and laid
croſs the Trench, frees you of all.</p>
               <p>So, does he ſtop you at a River? either
privately ſend out a Detachment to make a
Bridge croſs to ſecure your paſſage at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, or divert the Channel, and ſo
make it fordable; ſome have laid combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter in their Trenches, while others
have turn'd the River and drown'd their
Enemies with it.</p>
               <p>Some have counterfeited preys and fears
to draw an Ambuſh, while others have ſet
up Sayles on ſticks, and ſhewn their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
retinue on an Hill, to terrifie their
Enemy with the approach of Succours.</p>
               <p>Some by favours to Captives, have divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65770:132"/>
their Enemies, and by little Meſſages,
ſooth'd them in their diviſions; but then
remember, that to attack them too ſoon
upon it, is to unite them; and here a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's
diſpoſitions and paſſions are to be
regarded.</p>
               <p>Some alſo have let their Enemies enter,
and take Towns, and aſſaulted them when
weakned by garriſoning; others have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
only for ſome advantage over him, as
his paſſing a River, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in all caſes, a
General had better fight than baulk his men
by too much caution.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; Is your Army at leiſure?
ravaging is the beſt employ: Seiges are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
Conſpiracies loſs of time, ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Towns is dangerous, and Battels more
hazardous; but the beſt Plundering is under
the Enemies Colours.</p>
               <p>But above all, the Reputation of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
juſtice, his clemency and ſeverity to
perfection are moſt uſeful; he that is gentle
to all but the ſtubborn, and implacable to
the obſtinate, has a double force to beat his
Enemies with.</p>
               <p>And yet, after all, a poſſibility of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and a Back-door to Cowardize,
ought to be left to the moſt Obſtinate;
'twill influence your own Souldiers with
Fear, to deal with an Enemy, deſperate,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65770:132"/>
and beyond all power of eſcape: And thus
<hi>Caeſar</hi> would not let his Souldiers ſee, that
a Town they beſieg'd was reduc'd to
a Bread of Herbs.</p>
               <p>To reduce your own Men to a neceſſity
therefore, were much the rather to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.
Thus, I would Burn my Ships, if <hi>I</hi>
Invaded an <hi>Iſland</hi> to make my Men deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
But, if <hi>I</hi> ſtorm'd a Town, I would
Proclaim, not to kill a Man that laid down
his Sword, rather than to ſuggeſt I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no Mercy.</p>
               <p>So alſo, 'tis dangerous after a Battel, to
fall upon the Conqueror, unleſs he has had
a very hard Victory of it. Slaughters are
generally in the flight, and not in the field;
and 'tis therefore no little diſadvantage to
attack a fluſh'd Victor, and one juſt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd
in ready fighting.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Hiſtories</hi> may teach us
more and better Stratagems than theſe;
But where ſhall we find them? Has a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
leiſure to conſult Volumes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult

               <p>NOthing more Embroyls a State, than
a Standing Army; if they have not
Work, you'll quickly find they will make it,
tho' even as in <hi>Turky,</hi> by Domineering over
their very Princes: Beſides, Is there any
truer Method to Barbariſme? Could Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ever ſhew us, that Souldiery
did not deſtroy Property, and corrupt all
Vertue?</p>
               <p>And yet, nothing is more unſafe than
to Disband a great Army all at a time; it
oftentimes creates a New Diſeaſe in a
State; the better way therefore to move, is
by degrees, and to Caſheer thoſe that can
live without pay firſt, and the other after.</p>
               <p>But, Are you to Raiſe an Army?
chooſe your Officers of the Gentry, and, if
poſſible, Volunteers; yet ſtill, provided
they be not profligate, or diſſolute; for
ſuch Men are no fitter to be Officers, than
of any other Employment.</p>
               <p>So, let your Souldiers be hardy, your
Horſe from the City, and your Foot from
the Countrey; their Age between 17 and
40. As for their Strength and Activity,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65770:134"/>
you would do well to Exerciſe them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you Liſt them.</p>
               <p>To chooſe an Army of your common
Volunteers, and Miſcreant Fugitives, is the
moſt imprudent; an Army ought rather
to be a Body of Martyrs: Debauch'd Men
are fitter for an Houſe of Correction, than
to be of an orderly and deſigning Body,
tho' in an Army.</p>
               <p>So a mean Militia and Army of your
own, is much better than a great Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Force: By good and conſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
you may inſpire the worſt of Men
by degrees, while Forreigners damp the
Courage and Eſtimate of your own.</p>
               <p>Beſides, How many States have felt the
Ruine of Auxiliary Forces? if you truſt
them, they either give up your Cauſe, or
Prey upon you; at leaſt they are intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but to Fight in Jeſt for you; as in <hi>Italy,</hi>
they ſhall not ſuffer your ſawcy Bombs to
diſturb their reſt at night in their Sieges.</p>
               <p>Further, Forces of your own you may
Command at your pleaſure; while For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
will be only deſperate for their
own ends. Are you neceſſitated to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
therfore? front them in your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
or mix them ſo as to force them
to Fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:65770:135"/>
As for the breeding Souldiers, liberty
only can give us good hearts: The old
<hi>Roman</hi> Peaſants durſt face Kings, and make
Generals in the Field: their Country was
as worthy their Love, as their Courage;
while Men cow'd, can ſlave to all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
alike. <hi>Hen.</hi> the Seventh therefore, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litickly
ſettled Farms of ſuch a Size, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to
breed good Boors by.</p>
               <p>As for the ſorts of Souldiers, your Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers
are a Body of Men deſign'd for any
extraordinary occaſion; they wait at the
Flank of your Army, as the Dragoons do;
and they are often as well Horſe as Foot;
and on ſudden and deſperate Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
very needful.</p>
               <p>As for Horſe and Foot in a well-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd
Army, experience has ſhewn, Foot
doubly to excel Horſe; indeed, Foot with
Pikes have often beat double their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Horſe. Horſe, 'tis true, at a Rout,
or, as Scouts, or to raiſe Contribution, or to
confound a weak Enemy, are excellent;
but, to think a Spur can force an Horſe
upon a Pike, is as abſurd as dangerous.</p>
               <p>So, What are Pikes, or Muskets ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without defenſive Arms, for Head,
Breaſt, Arms, Thighs and Legs, with a
Buckler? Men thus Arm'd, put by your
Pikes, and come in with eaſe upon your
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65770:135"/>
Men with naked Swords; nay, if ſuch
Men Ride but as Dragoons, they attack
you more ſpeedily, and even juſt where
they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Nor is this a Fiction neither; the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
who by uſe, made ſuch Defenſive
Arms tolerable, withall Conquer'd the
World with them: And if either the beſt
Politicians, or the beſt Hiſtorians be to be
credited, this ſort of Men, for all our
Fire-arms, are not even yet to be deſpis'd.</p>

               <p>THat Souldiers are Voluptuous is not

as that Perils ask to be paid by Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
To dye a Souldier, ſurely is a kind

                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:65770:136"/>
Souldiers in War, are Sinews to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Politick,
in Peace its Feaver: Not
that it is ſafe neither; quite to lay aſide
your Warlike Diſcipline in Peace; But
think you there is any Juſtice for one Man
to live ſluggiſhly on the Labour of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>The juſteſt Mean therefore muſt be, a
well-manag'd Militia; and if we are for
Teaching Warlike-diſcipline in Peace, Why
do we not alſo turn our Univerſity Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<hi>Mathematicks</hi> to the more uſeful
Improvements of Fortification and Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery?</p>
               <p>But, in a Militia the Diſciplining a few
Men, and they every time ſtrangers, and
drawn, with Charge, from remote parts,
to meet in a Body; ſurely, ſuch a Martial-diſcipline
can avail little or nothing.</p>
               <p>Let it rather be, that every Man of ſuch
an Age, and Stature, be a Souldier; that
every Pariſh be a diſtinct Body of them,
having its proper Officers in it's ſelf; and,
that no one, capable on any account, be
exempt from Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>This would force our Gentry, as their
Officers, into eſteem; and, if by any means,
make a Nation Invincible: And ſurely,
'twould rather be a delight, and a diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than a Charge, for ſuch a Militia,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65770:136"/>
(like as at our Ancient Wakes) to meet
and Exerciſe an hour or two in a Week.</p>
               <p>And, do you fear in ſuch caſe ſuch Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines
being ſuperficial? How eaſie is the
Cure, by the Examination of Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for Hundreds and Counties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And,
Do you want an Army? How quick does
every Pariſh proportion you a Supply?</p>
               <p>Nay, and ſuch an Army you may eaſily
Disband with a Donative; and, every Man
knowing his home, is welcomely receiv'd;
while you are out of danger of being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd
by Vagabonds, indeed if any ſuch
ſhould happen to be diſabled, 'twould be
a Generous Charity in the State to provide
Hoſpitals for them, or elſe they are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, with a kind welcome to your
hand.</p>
               <p>Donatives to Standing Armies are moſt
pernicious, even to make them at laſt,
State-robbers; but Donatives here would be
the juſteſt reward of our Brethrens Blood.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſuch an Army would have Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
and Chriſtianity; nor need we
doubt but that their conſtant Exerciſe
would make them brave, as Souldiers by

rais'd, would know truly how to value

               <p>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:65770:137"/>
To conclude; The conſtant and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Exerciſe could not but whet their
Spirits and Courages in Emulation, and
make them familiar to Force and Arms,
while every Souldier imploy'd, would,
like the <hi>Romans</hi> of old, know how to
Fight heartily for that Peace he knew what

               <p>ARe you ſuddenly to give Battel?
Publiſh a Speech againſt Cowardize:
Alaſs! Are not all our great ſlaughters
made, when Men run away? And can
you want Topicks?</p>
               <p>So, if poſſible, before you fight alſo,
give your Men, from ſome Hill, the proſpect
of your Enemy; by that you may deride
their Diſcipline, and expoſe them to the
Contempt of your Army: Fear is ſeldom
ſo conſiderable, as when of ſomething
unknown.</p>
               <p>So, when you Fight, make their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
carry their Pay, and that will make
your Souldiers vigorouſly defend them:
Nor be without Rewards or Puniſhments;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65770:137"/>
Thus, to kill a Captain, ſo much; a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
ſo much; and, to Mount a Breach,
ſo much, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Does a Regiment offend? Decimate
them. Are they Cowards? Mark them
with a <hi>C.</hi> and let them live to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace:
Are they Treacherous? give them
the death they deſerve. And yet, to avoid
Sedition, let the General but give them a
little blow with a Wand; for when you
make a Souldier paſs the Pikes, the Army
are their own <hi>Executioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to Figures, Armies are generally
drawn into Three Lines; and the <hi>Turkes</hi>
uſe the Creſcent; but ſurely, the Ground
and Circumſtance ought, in this Caſe, to
be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Thus, Is your Army biggeſt? fight in
open field, and try to compaſs your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?
Is it little? flank your ſelf with Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and fight cloſe. Have you no Horſe?
ſeek to encloſures; but, above all, beware
of the Wind, or Sun, in your Faces.</p>
               <p>So, Are you aſſaulted in a Wedge, to
diſtract you? become a pair of Sheers, to
cut off your enemy. Are you enclin'd to
compaſs him? equal his breadth, advance
gradually your Wings, and retreat your
Front; but this is a dangerous Work.</p>
               <p>When the Battel begins, Generals, by
Drums and Trumpets, Order their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65770:138"/>
to the field, and Great Guns attempt
the firſt Execution, while the Dragoons
Attack them; and e're a ſecond diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
the fight begins, and they become
uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Thus, Are the Guns in the middle of
their Battalions? divide your Army, and
you avoid them; the firſt ſhot is diſtant,
and goes over, or under; or your Infantry,
by their wide ranks avoid them, while
your Horſe are ſecure in their Reer.</p>
               <p>After this, Shouts joyn both your Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons;
who, bearing the firſt ſhock, make
room, by retiring to your Flanck and
Reer, and while more ſilent Orders join
the Battel.</p>
               <p>And now the Pikes advance to keep off
the Horſe; while the Armies once join'd, the
Pikes withdraw within the Bucklers, and
your Bucklers worſted within your Pikes.</p>
               <p>Muſquets ſerve a ſhot or two, till the
Fight is clos'd, but then your Man at
Arms, with Sword, Buckler and Armour,
does all; who, if the firſt Rank but kneel,
their very Bucklers keep off the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets;
But, What can fence your Rapier
with Armour?</p>
               <p>The wiſe <hi>Romans</hi> had their Ranks wide,
their <hi>Haſtati,</hi> or Young Men, bore the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Battel; if worſted, they retired
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65770:138"/>
among their <hi>Principes,</hi> or ſtrong Men, and
they again among their <hi>Triarii,</hi> or Old
Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Your Horſe, in the mean time, engage
at the ſide of your Army, while your
Dragoons retire to take care of your
Camp: the proportion of your Foot is;
Have you Ten Battalions? Five <hi>Haſtati,</hi>
Three <hi>Principes,</hi> and Two <hi>Triarii;</hi> the
benefit of ſuch Orders is, your Men are
refreſhed by the new ſupport of your
beſt Men at laſt; while a ſquare Army
runs, and is defeated, before half can
fight.</p>
               <p>But now, Why do I ſtay? the fight's
begun, Stratagems follow, Pits, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcades,
Falſe Allarums, Surprizes of
Novel Words, Engines, Shouts, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of Succours.</p>
               <p>Officers fling their Colours among the
Enemy, to reward the Souldiers that
fetch them again; while the General
minds Intelligence, and Orders Succours
to the ſide that is oppreſs'd, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
refreſh'd; return to try to flank
the enemy.</p>
               <p>After all, Have you worſted an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
enemy? either perfect the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or ſnap at his diſheartned Terms of
Peace: The only time of ſlaughter is,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65770:139"/>
when Men are diſorder'd, and loſe their
Confidence in one another; to let them
Rally, ſpoils all.</p>
               <p>So, Was your flight doubtful, and
parted by Night? carry off ſome Dead,
to diſmay your enemy, through their few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
next morning; ſuch a Night can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be a Night of Dread, and the
leaſt puſh will be likely to give the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's
advantage.</p>
               <p>But are you beat? to hinder purſuit, fight
where you may retreat; at worſt, retreat
part of your Army orderly firſt; and ſo
your Enemy not daring to divide, appoint
a common place for the reſt to meet at:
but are your Souldiers forc'd to fly? yet
at worſt, let them detard their Purſuers,
and ſave their Lives by ſcattering their
Treaſures.</p>
               <p>On the whole, in a pitch'd Battel to be
firſt in the Field, is of great uſe; you chooſe
your Ground, and you hearten your Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
by it; but even on this, nay on Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
beware of a too careleſs Succeſs; for
that almoſt ever ruines the day, and too
often ſacrifice all, (while the Souldiers are
careleſs, merry, or plundering) to ſome
trifling Reinforcement.</p>
               <p>To conclude, As for Engines, ſurely
<hi>Archimedes</hi>'s Arrow-Engine muſt needs,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65770:139"/>
even at this day, gall Horſe worſe than
any Guns whatever. Arrows not only
are of equal execution, but fret Horſe

leſt you cramp your Motion; ſo your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and Drums between your Muskets

and your Lieutenant with the Muskets.</p>
               <p>So, the general order of Martialling Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
is to every Squadron, or Ten, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant

command; to every 100. a Captain; to
every 1000. a Collonel; and to the whole

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65770:140"/>
450 in a Company; and which making
4500. the remaining 1500. are to be 1000
Pikes, and 500. <hi>Velites</hi> extraordinary.</p>
               <p>So the proportion of a good Army,
ſhould be in 6000 men, 3000 with Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
2000 with Pikes, and 1000 with
Muſquets; as for your Ranks, the cloſer
the better, as not ſo eaſily broken; yet ſtill
provided, that they leave convenient ſpace
for motion, and that their Files be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
that their Souldiers never want to
find out their Poſt again.</p>
               <p>If your Company contain 400 men, you
may draw them up 5 in a File, and 80 in a
Rank; or, if you'd reduce them to a ſquare
for fighting, 'tis but caſting your firſt File
into your ſecond, your third into your
fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then there will be 40 Files
of 10. and ſo you may bring them to 20.
of 20. if you pleaſe, to be ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
which way ſoever attack'd.</p>
               <p>And, as inferiour Officers ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Souldiers to a readineſs in ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
to be able to anſwer their Generals
Commands upon occaſion; ſo ought they
to enure their Souldiers to hardſhip alſo,
that they be not diſmay'd in extremity.</p>
               <p>Thus, to let them carry their own Corn,
will not only help, but ſtrengthen them;
ſo for them to learn to ſwim, may ſave
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65770:140"/>
them on occaſion; while to drown them
in luxury and eaſe, What is it but to ſoften
and effeminate their very Courages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
to their Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>As for your diſciplining Dragoons, there
needs not ſo much care; they being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
rather upon extraordinary occaſions
than in any thing like a regular fight.
Your Horſe indeed ſhould be more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
thus, ſuppoſe 300 in a Battalion, of
which 150 to be men at Arms, and 150
to be <hi>Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Pikes are to front the ſquare of
your Army, and as 5 Ranks of them is as
many as can well charge at once; and
as the Fight begun, and the Army ſecur'd
from the Horſe, they fall to make room
for the Men at Arms; ſo 7 Files of Pikes,
that is, 1 or 2 to be ready to ſupply fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
men, is as many as you can have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to front with.</p>
               <p>The manner of Commanding an Army,
is, the Souldiers follow the Colours, and
they the Drums; the inferiour Officers
command the Centinels, and the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
them, while the General governs
all. A bad General, or a bad Army there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65770:141"/>
and after all your Cavalry.</p>
               <p>And, thus withdrawing a little your
Carriages, you are ready for the Enemy
any way, and he cannot well attack you
in your march if you are circumſpect,
but that he will be at as much diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
as your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Your Dragoons who ſcower the Road,
guard your Pioneers alſo, who are to plain
your ways, and make Entrenchments for
your Camp; and in this, not to multiply
Men needleſly, your own Souldiers may
ſerve as Pioneers, and who, when an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
approaches, may retreat to their Arms;
your Spades and Pick-axes being carried by
for them in Carts.</p>
               <p>If you march where you may be
ſtreightned in Proviſions, have at leaſt a
Months neceſſaries before hand, and take
continual care for Supplies; and to this end
you may have a Market with Sutlers in
the middle of your Camp, while your Cattel
laden with Corn, are driven by your Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Butchers, and Cooks, after them.</p>
               <p>Above all, take care to march in exact
order; and if a few Men aſſault you, and
flye, or a Prize of Cattle appear, do not
let them decoy you into an Ambuſhment;
a General muſt anticipate Stratagems as
he marches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:65770:142"/>
So, Do you fear ſurprizes or ambuſhes?
beware of Hills, of Woods and Hedges, and
you need not fear but that either Scouts,
Duſt, or Birds, will give you notice, that
you may at leaſt provide your ſelf of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
againſt their attack.</p>
               <p>Further, when you march, never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Army with the enterprize,
leſt it periſh through the diſcovery; but
rather getting a Chart, pick up ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Guides, and make them yours through
threats and rewards to conduct you.</p>
               <p>As for the ſize of your Army, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
by their Conqueſts ſeem'd beſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of fighting, and they thought 24000,
or at moſt 50000 Men a double Army
enough; indeed, more not only confounds
and devour one another, but are not well
manageable, nor can they conveniently
march in the Field.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IS an Enemy Treacherous or extream
Bloody in his Wars? Does he break
his Word, or lay Countries waſte cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly?
He has flung up his Right ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65770:142"/>
to Treaty or mercy from thee, and
the mildeſt Quarter that he can expect
upon it, is, that he be decimated.</p>
               <p>Now the Treacherous are not only ſuch
as are faithleſs, and obſerve no Treaties,
but thoſe that War like Robbers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt apparency of cauſe to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
it, or thoſe that abuſe our Embaſſadors,
or any other way violate the ſacred Laws
of Nations.</p>
               <p>Not, but that the juſt right of War
leaves me all the liberty of Stratagems to
bribe or divide mine Enemy whatever;
nay, I may ſend Spyes to Aſſaſſinate him,
as well as Parties to Plunder him; but
if I am once either falſe or perfidious, my
Enemy has no tye of mercy to me till I
am naked in his Power.</p>
               <p>So I may uſe all the honeſt means of
ſimulation; thus I may juſtly ſeem to fly,
to draw mine Enemy to an Ambuſh, and ſo
I may plunder under mine enemies Colours,
and make falſ Alarms; alas 'tis not fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if I am not allowed by falſe Paſſes to
draw mine enemy from his Guard, the
better to make a real one.</p>
               <p>The true Rule therefore is, all known
ſigns of Treaty, whether by Flag, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
I am bound in veracity to ſtand
to; but in other matters, even Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:65770:143"/>
gave us another Example, after he
was riſen from the dead; and ſet his Face
as if he were going where he was not.</p>
               <p>Nay, Does even a Neſt of Pirates reform
to a Government, and our Treacherouſeſt
Enemy begin to leave his Perfidy? I will
not too far hazard the Wiles of the Fox,
but after a moderate ſelf-juſtice and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
for my injuſtice, I am bound to treat
both and either as my Brethren.</p>
               <p>But, above all Treachery, beware of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Exiles too far, in leading your Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
conſider how dearly ſuch Men may
value their own Countrey, and how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
they may be apt to purchaſe their
liberty at thy expence.</p>

               <head>Of Fortification and Sieges.</head>
               <p>FOr a Fortification, take ſome Rocky
Nap in a Plain, that is neither blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Hills nor Woods; the Walls if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
are better natural than rais'd; for if
cut out of a Rock, neither Batteries nor
Mines can deſtroy the Hill.</p>
               <p>As for the thickneſs or height of Walls,
or the number of Redoubts, they are Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
wholly at diſcretion. Can you make
a Caſtle like a City? Surely, your works
ought to be ſuited to your own ſize and
proportion of Ground, and to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
approach, and not a Figure.</p>
               <p>A Fort of two or three Angles only, is
of no value; but after that, the more the
better, provided if not like <hi>Babylon,</hi> too
big for Intelligence: But the ſilly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
that the ſtrength of a place depends
on every Mathematical Figure, is trifling.</p>
               <p>A Fort not ſtrong by Nature, cannot
receive much by Art; Now by Art the
Walls ought to be three yards thick at
leaſt, and Towers built at every 200
Yards.</p>
               <p>For Ditches, two are beſt, without and
within; if you have one only, 'tis beſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:65770:144"/>
and that of 30 Yards broad at leaſt, and
12 deep, with Artillery to ſcour them at
every 200 Yards; and ſo 'tis better with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Water than with; if your Water
freeze, the Town is gone at an inſtant;
and if not, a Bridge of Boats is eaſier made
than another.</p>
               <p>Is your Ditch to Water, or Rock? there
is no poſſibility of mining your Wall. Is
it in the inſide? there is no way to come
to fill it up; your Wall in Battery will fall
the other way: and ſo that your Ditch will
be good when your Wall is flat.</p>
               <p>Further, in Forts, let your Houſes be
low, ſo as not to hinder your proſpect;
let your Gates be ſecured by Ravelin and
and Portcullis, and let your free paſſage
be ſecur'd by Draw-Bridge, or at worſt by
a Timber-ſtand from the bottom of the
Bridge, and which you may command by
Cannon of your Inner Redoubt.</p>
               <p>Little Entrenchments without the Walls
are moſt miſchievous, the loſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
from ſuch little Baſtions, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Baits of Cowardize to your Souldiers;
and ſurely, 'tis no good Leſſon to teach
them to give ground.</p>
               <p>Further, in founding a Fort, the Air and
Water are greatly to be regarded, as alſo
an agreeable Country, and Roads near it;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65770:144"/>
if built in too fertile a Land, it may luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it; if in too barren, not be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
againſt a Siege.</p>
               <p>The beauty of Forts in Buildings, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
is not much to be regarded; but Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
that are like to be diſturbed by War,
will require all the encouragements imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
Now ſuch are, 1. Free-trade, 2. Eaſy
Juſtice, 3. Aſylum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fort thus ſetled, the Inhabitants by
the Law of Nations, owe the Government
a Right to defend her; and in which
caſe, tho' a ſingle perſon may deſert it, a
Prince may juſtly withſtand a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
provided he fear not their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
               <p>But is a Siege begun? Due order is to be
obſerv'd: Let Women and Children keep
their Houſes to avoid diſturbance; and the
men be diſtributed into three parts, 1. to
be on the Guard, 2. ready as a reſerve, and
a 3d. taking their reſt. Some add, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiff
Dog to their Centinel, full as ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as a Man.</p>
               <p>Nor let your Diſcipline be neglected on
any Account; Towns have been ſtorm'd
even at Dinner time; and yet not but that
in ſuch caſe, when they have, the Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſometimes by Showers out at their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and ſometimes by firing the Town,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:65770:145"/>
have made their Walls good again againſt
the Beſiegers.</p>
               <p>Some on the other hand, have ſeem'd
to leave the Walls, as if the Town were
fired by ſome Bomb, only by a falſe Fire, the
better to draw the enemy to a diſadvantag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Attack; and while at the ſame time, the
Walls have unſeen, been doubly guarded.</p>
               <p>But does the Siege proceed? and would
you avoid mining? Digg holes every 10
Yards, like Wells by your Walls, and they
will give vent; or ſound the Mine, and
countermine it. So, is your Ditch in the
out-ſide, and your Wall flat? make but
a Ditch within of 30 Yards broad, and
the Breach is as eaſily kept as the Wall.</p>
               <p>Some, when a Siege has been drove hard,
have ſhot in empty Bombs thoſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the Officers would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
their Souldiers with, while others
ſeeming only to march near a Town, have
fallen upon it at unawares, and ſo ſurpriz'd
it in Diſorder.</p>
               <p>Some have ſeem'd to fly, and leave their
Camp, and ſo drilling out the Enemy, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
the Town; while others poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Camp-Victuals, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
the Enemy that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:65770:145"/>
So, Where a Town has ſtood doubtful,
t'has been ſecur'd by begging to receive
ſome ſick Men, while the ſtouteſt men
have been ſent in diſguiſe into it.</p>
               <p>So ſome have poyſoned Waters, others
drove in the Beſieged's Friends, to conſume
their Victuals, while ſome have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by Nutts floating down a River.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a Bread of Herbs for his
Souldiers; and <hi>Londonderry</hi> fed on Starch
for Bread, and Leather boyl'd ſoft for
Meat.</p>
               <p>But are the Beſieg'd come to a Treaty?
'Tis neither honourable nor ſafe for a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
to parly in a Siege, nor to accept
other Terms, than at leaſt to go out Arm'd,
and in order. Surely, He's mad that can
truſt himſelf naked with a Triumphant
and Revengeful Army.</p>
               <p>Nor is't a little imprudence for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to divide himſelf to deſtruction in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging
little Henrooſts before a Royal
Army; and if there be no ſuch Army, Forts
alone cannot hinder your Army from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaging
your Enemies Country.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Forts are only of uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Enemies &amp; on Frontiers; 'tis a Self-deſtructive
Policy to think to retain Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in Obedience by them: the wiſe
<hi>Romans</hi> choſe rather to demolliſh them;
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65770:146"/>
but while you have Forts, Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is as neceſſary; for your Garriſoners
in their Sallies, as your Field Souldiers in
their March.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the CAMP.</head>
               <p>THE Order of your Camp ought to
be, as if you were ready to charge
your Enemy; only you may ſtand a little
wider, for the conveniency of Streets and
Air, and for the benefits of reintrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but always in the ſame manner,
that the Souldiers may naturally know their
home, and the whole ſeem a moving City,
conſtantly with the ſame Gates and
Lodgings.</p>
               <p>Nor ought your Camp, if near an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
to want either Water or Proviſions;
nor if your ſtay be long, a good Air; above
all, ſtreighten not your march by want of
ſecuring Paſſes; nor lye too near to Hills,
leſt your Enemy incommode you.</p>
               <p>Your Ditch ought at leaſt to be 6 Yards
wide, and 3 deep, together with Half-Moons
for your Artillery, to flanck your
Enemy as he approaches; and ſo your
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65770:146"/>
Camp may be better for conveniences,
than either as on a Hill or by a River.</p>
               <p>Further, While you are encampt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of Surprize; and while your enemy
is near, beſure watch all comers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
nay, a third part of your Souldiers
ought to be continually Arm'd; and a
fourth of thoſe, perpetually on the Watch,
ſome at the corners, and ſome on the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll
or Search, leſt your enemy either
Stratagem or Beſiege you in your Camp.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In decamping, the uſual order
is, the General Sounds his Trumpet thrice
the firſt time, to give notice to take down
Tents, and pack them up; the ſecond, to
