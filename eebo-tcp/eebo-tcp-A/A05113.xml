            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

you think erroneously. And if these be the pillars or propps of any Church, it must needs be the church of Antichrist. For wee finde no warrant in all the scriptures, that their offices, callings or administrations, haue any place, power or right in the Church of Christ, as shal plainly appeare hereafter. But where you seem to let your judgment rely upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the multitude, and to approve of that which wiser then your self doe justify; you are taught not to follow a multitude to doe evill, <hi>Exod. 23.</hi> And the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine proverbe sheweth, that it is as great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to justify the wicked as to condemne the innocent. But, as woe is pronounced to him that calls good evil; so likewise to him that cal leth evil good. <hi>Esa. 5.29.</hi> For your judgeing of matters in case of religion, you ought to look to the lawe and word of God, and not to the wisdome of man. For the wisdome of the wise men of this world is foolishnes with God, and the wisdome of God is foolishnes with them. The Philosophers and other wise men, could never by their worldly wisdome atteyne to the right knowledge of God &amp; heavenly things. This apperteyneth to the foolish things of the world, which God hath chosen to confound the wise. As sayth the Apostle, <hi>1 Cor. 1.</hi> Read the whole chapter at your leasure, for your bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter information. But I pray you how sayd you that it was with the Puritans?</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:23325:11"/>The foresayd Christians called <hi>Brownists,</hi> whom I finde very sound in these things, have in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie pag. 50. prooved by 8. good Reasons, That the Hierarchy &amp; Ministerie of Popes, Archbishops, Lordbishops, Suffragans, Deanes, Archdeacons are Antichristian. And then by 12. sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons moe, doe proove that the Hierarchy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie aforesayd, may not be set over the Church of Christ; nor reteyned therein. For which I refer you to the said Apology, which you may procure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people of that profession at London, or else where. It were tedious to tell the names of all the writers against the foresayd Hierarchy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of Archbishops and the rest of that rable: but endlesse to set downe all that is written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them and their princelynes. I will here onely insert a few moe testimonies of the ministers them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves, who being of one church with the chiefe ministers their own masters, may better be credited against them, then mere opposites which are not of them, but separated from them. And first for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch Clapham</hi> who in ans. to the Bishops Arguments sayth, in the 2. section of the 2. part of his <hi>Survey</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>Their cock sure Argument (as they take it) is this; <hi>Christ promised to be with his Apostles vnto the end of the world at the giving of the commission, Mat. 28.</hi> 19.20. <hi>And Timothee is charged to keepe the commandement pure vnto the coming of Christ: But none of those persons should live unto the end. Therefore he spake to some other in
<pb facs="tcp:23325:12"/>
their persons, who must be as were the Apostles and E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists Lords over Pastors &amp; Churches.</hi> And who should these be but such Lord Bishops as themselves who haue and occupy jurisdiction &amp; power over all the Churches and ministers of England.</p>
               <p>If this be true that our Bishops be Apostles (for if the successors should have had an other name the scripture would haue registred it) If I say they be Apostles, then England hath not dignified them truely, in saying, <hi>The Lord Bishop of such a place,</hi> who rather should haue sayd, <hi>My Lord Apostle of London, My Lord Apostle of Lincolne</hi>: Even as it was sayd, <hi>Peter the Apostle of the circumcision,</hi> and <hi>Paul the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of the gentiles.</hi> Then likewise England should for that great blessing haue been more bound to praise God, she having more Lord Apostles of her owne, then was in the whole world unto Christ, who sent forth so fewe as twelve, &amp; Paul with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas. They being for the most part men of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, but these being men of state and stately Lords. But before we admit them for Apostles let us compare them with Christs. The first were elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordeyned to their office, eyther by Christ the head, or togither by some particular Church: But these eyther by A Prince or by the Cannons of that sea confirmed by an Archbishop.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they were appointed to office to the end they might <hi>feede feede feed</hi> the Lords sheepe. But our English ones, are appointed to their roomes in their old age to the end they may nowe (togither
<pb facs="tcp:23325:12"/>
with the Levites of 50. yeres of age) rest their bones and feed their owne bellies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the first were tyed to no one sea, but were sent to teach all nations: These keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within a stinted compasse, teaching fewe or none once in a long time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the Apostles of Christ could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their work but by comming through many wants; These of our land may discharge their work by leaning on their elbowes in the middst of their Lordly platters.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the first were appointed to gather chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and establish all holy order. As for these, not one of them ever gathered a church, but haue kept many in disorder.</p>
               <p>Sixtly the first had attending on them (for the furtherance of their Apostolical work) blessed Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelists and preaching Disciples. These latter haue first a company of ruffling Chaplaines that can handle cardes and dice well, secondly a company of swash-rutting serviters that can teach all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish to sweare and weare all foolish fashioned appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the first were plain simple harted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. These are Lords in name, Lords in living, Lords in pompe, Lords checkmate with the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Peere of our Realme.</p>
               <p>Eightly the first were brought before lordly ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Ninthly the first established wise godly Elders in every co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>: These establish dumb dogs &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hogges in their parishes &amp; confused assemblies.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> upbraided the Church of Corinthe for not exercising the power of our Lord Iesus committed unto her in delivering up the incestuous to <hi>Satan.</hi> These Bishops are not so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, but haue got all the power into their own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds, sending that latin burbolte our of their unholy court.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, the first sought no kingdome here, because they lookt elswhere to sit on a throne with Iesus: But these so seek kingdome &amp; establish their houses here, as if they were of minde with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the feast in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> that sweet wine is best at the first.</p>
               <p>Twelvethly, the Apostles of Christ were the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen penmen of the holy Ghost, and therefore their writings are of sufficient credite in themselves and canonicall: As for our English-ones, God never chose them for such purpose, and therefore their writings which are almost none, and their sermons which are almost as fewe, are to be suspected, and to come under examination.</p>
               <p>Lastly to give 13. to the dozen, the Apostle Paul did think, they were set forth the last Apostles, <hi>1 Cor. 4.9.</hi> These men come more then XV. hundred

               <p>I see in that small difference, for Israel was then a false church though it had been of the true.

And for that I haue not alwayes been of this minde, it is sufficient that I came vnto it when God gaue me meanes to see that
<pb facs="tcp:23325:20"/>
it was the minde of his High Majestie, wherunto &amp; all men ought to conforme our selves. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Paul was not alwayes of the minde that Iesus o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for your desire or hope of help from abroade; I could wish you rather to turne your eyes another way, and look nearer home. For I am perswaded that there are not greater meanes of helpe to be found in the world for this service, then God hath raised up, in and unto our owne land, of the true borne subjects and naturall children thereof. And that both of the forwarder sort of Ministers, and learned men in our Church of England, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and more specially of the people called <hi>Brownists</hi>; who by their diligence in the scriptures and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their cause, are most strongly furnished a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prelates, against their Antichristian juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and Lordly livings <hi>&amp;c.</hi> At whose handes if helpe were sought, espetially of the learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, great helpe might be had.</p>

               <p>They are so. And to give them their due, many of them are very honest men with all; but yet they disadvantage themselves sundry wayes. First, by their hereticall opinions. 2. Because they haue, approve and allow, of generall Bishops, for bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all their assemblies; at least, in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as hold one societie, and are of one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And so what they condemne and cast downe in others, they (after a sort) doe justifie and hold up in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selves, by their owne practise. But the practise &amp; professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the other (mistermed ones) accordeth in one, and strengtheneth one another.</p>

               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad you conceipt the wayes of the Anabaptists no better. For I had you in some jealousie concerning them. But it is sorow enough that you preferre the Brownists before our forward Ministers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miles.</speaker>
               <p>I haue good reason in this case so to doe. For as they hold it unlawfull for our Ministers of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, to haue those idolarrous livings aforesaid, so they hold it unlawfull for their owne, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ministeries to haue them; but would that they were returned againe to the Common-wealth from whence they were taken. But our forward Ministers, that with the Prelates downe, and their livings to be taken from them, would gladly haue them for their owne use, as you likewise pleaded for them. And I feare they hold it no better then sacrilege if they be otherwise imployed. Whereof your owne
<pb facs="tcp:23325:21"/>
selfe also made question a litle before. But to speak the trueth without respect of persons and to flatter with none, these things in thern are meere trifling, if not also hypocrisie, arising of covetousnes. For if they be lawfull for themselves, they are lawfull for the superior Ministers also, by vvhom these inferior ones were made. If they say nay; For their inferior Ministerie is a true Ministerie; but the Lordly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie is not so: therfore these livings belong unto them and not to their Lords. Herein they deceive themselves, but let them not deceive you nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For seing the inferiour Ministerie is derived from and made by the superiour; eyther then the superiour ministerie must be true, or these of their making cannot be true. But the other being false that maketh, these must needs bee false that are made by them. For every creature bringeth forth according to his owne kinde, whether it be man, or byrds or beasts, whether cleane or uncleane. And if the roote be holy, so are the branches: But if the roote be corrupt and impure, the branches must needs be so likewise. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> corrupted, brought forth a man in their owne likenes, that is<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> one corrupted like themselves. But I can shewe you divers wayes whereby you may discerne, that the Brownists (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the question is, whether it is for evil doing, or for weldoing? If for well doing, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But did it therefore follow that they were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the report &amp; esteem that was amongst men concerning them? Or should men therefore haue rejected them, or any good thing among them? Let it be farre from you so to think, and further off in that sort to speake, eyther of those former, or yet of these later Christians. Christ himself was the chiefe corner stone, vvhom the builders refused, yet he became the head of the corner. And surely these me vvhich you and others are ready enough to refuse for helpe in this service, are the most sound &amp; sufficient of any that I knowe for convicting of our common adversaries and terrible opposites the Prelates and loftie Clergy of the land. Wherfore I would advise you and all, never to shunne, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to seeke, &amp; thankfully to receive their helpe when it may be had. And if we see them to erre in any other thing (as all men are subject to errour) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is that such they hold) I praye you how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is it with the Brownists? They condemn (as the report goes) not onely the best people of the land: but also condemne and forsake the faith professed and mainteyned there, counting it the faith of the Divils, and professing another faith for themselves. Now for my owne part, I am not onely perswaded, but fully assured through the mercie of God, that the faith professed in England is the true saving faith of Gods elect, and if ever they be saved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, it must be through the same faith in Christ. Therefore if they be guilty of that report, my soule shall haue no pleasure in them, till they returne by repentance. For, to erre in that pointe is a matter of no small importance.</p>

And this which you object, carries no fairer a show with it, then did Saul his sparing the fat cattel of <hi>Ameleck</hi> under the same pretence of offering them in sacrifice to the Lord: but not being according to the minde of God manifested by his word, but contrary to the same<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it was imputed unto him for rebellion and transgression, which are matched by the Prophet with witchcraft, wickednes, and idolatrie. 1 <hi>Sam. 15.</hi> For the Lord hath no such pleasure in sacrifice, as when his voice is obeyed. (<hi>ibidem.</hi>) And thus may you see that Sauls good intent had as faire a colour as can be set upon the imployments of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish livings to true Church uses; yet was this a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial cause of his ruyne, and cutting off from his kingdome. God requires not that to be done, which is right in the eyes of man, but all that hee commandeth, and is according to his will revealed, that is to be observed with all strictnes, care, love, readynes and good conscience.

And seing he hath no where co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>manded nor given such livings for his Church and Ministerie, how may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man appoint or appropriate them thereunto? If God had commanded all such livings to have been destroyed utterly, and made voide from all use of man, (as he commanded <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> not to eat

               <p>And as it is plaine that men haue no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God to bring in such livings for church uses; so neyther may they doe it voluntarilie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commmandement.

And now to the other part of their question, <hi>How these Bishops &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:23325:58"/>
Priests should live, if their livings bee taken from them</hi>? We answer as above. They may for no worldly cause bee suffered to continue in so unlawfull &amp; ungodly, yea so pernicious a course to themselves and to the whole land, but must be compelled to walk order<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in some lawfull calling or other.<note place="margin">

            <p>RIght Honourable, we haue as our fraile memories and small measure of knowledge would suffer in the middst of many encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances in this our miserable impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, drawne an unperfect dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of such weighty causes, as we were desirous when God should call us thereunto, to make knowne unto her Majestie or some of her Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:23325:59"/>
Councell. And now by your Honours desert and gratious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance occasioned, we most gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late &amp; present the same to your good Lordship onely, as to one whose rare wisdome we know most able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and whose care to preserve and defend the innocent according to right: Wherefore we most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put both this waighty cause &amp; our wofull lives in your hand, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to some equal triall from our enemies rage like to be increased here upon, in that it so nearely toucheth their estimation and worldly prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And howsoever these high cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God (which haue not been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto looked into since the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the sincere practise of the gospell in the primitive Church) may seem strange unto your Honour at the first view, especially if they be weighed with humane reason; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined by that <hi>Archtype</hi> and true patterne of Christs testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, we doubt not but your Honour shall see
<pb facs="tcp:23325:60"/>
with us how far the present State is swerved from the inviolable order prescribed; Espetially, if your honour vouchsafe but to look into the office, entrance, and administration of this ministery, you shal soon see it (as some of their own writers confesse &amp; none can deny) to be received by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Pope: who, though he were expelled with many of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities out of this Land by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties roiall progenitour, yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these offices and lawes, courtes, worship &amp;c. untaken away or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, notwithstanding that the Lord of Hosts had sayd, they shall not take a stone of Babel for a corner,<note place="margin">

               </note> nor a stone for foundations, for it shal be desolate for ever: So that it is impossible antichrists ministry should build up or serve in the true Church of Christ, himself having instituted and ordeyned an other Ministerie in his testament, and forbidden and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed all such as haue not their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from thence. It is then our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:23325:60"/>
Right honourable to make plain in our Treatise that when the Pope was expelled, his ministery and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which came out of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pit, were still reserved and set up in sted of the Ministery and Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of Christ, and so still remaine. Which their Ministery being thus found an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian must by the Prince be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished and suppressed, that Gods wrath be not kindled against this whole Land, for the wilfull violating &amp; defacing of Gods ordinances, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down unto, endowing and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning of such bitter plants of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs grafting: Neyther will it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to say, The Martyrs in Queene Maries dayes stood in these offices in King Edwards dayes; seeing it were great impiety to justify any iniquity by the example of fraile man (no man living without errour.) For that were to set the Martyrs of Christ against Christ, &amp; either to build our faith wholy upon men, and cast aside the Testament; or else to rip up the

haue written and cried out for the utter abolishing of these offices: So that it is of al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fessed that the Prince ought to suppress &amp; abolish all such offices and orders as cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the word of God. Shall then this famous Land Right hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lie still in the knowne dreggs of Popery under Gods wrath for the same?

               <p>He was a coepartener with Mr Barrow in his testimony, imprisonment, and death it self. A learned man he was, as appeareth by an answer of his to Mr G. Gyfford touching read prayer. He had formerly been a Minister according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church of England, but degraded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by repentance, as he saith of himself in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And afterwards he was Teacher in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church separated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the publike assemblies of the land. A Gentleman of a good house tolde me that Queen Elizabeth asked the learned Doct. Raynolds what he thought of those two men? And he answered her Majestie, that it could not availe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to shew his judgement concerning them, seeing they were put to death: and being loath to speake his mind further, her Highnes charged him
<pb facs="tcp:23325:65"/>
upon his allegiance to speake. Whereupon he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he vvas perswaded, if they had lived, they would haue been two as worthy instruments for the Church of God, as hath been raised up in this age &amp;c: Her Maiestie sighed and sayd no more. But after that, riding to a Parke by the place where they were executed, called to mind their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring of death, (and being willing to take further information concerning them,) demanded of the Right Honourable E. of Cumb.

<pb facs="tcp:23325:65"/>
Christian uniformitie? This was their hope; who sought no praise to themselves; but desired that his Majestie should (as the instrumentall meanes) haue done it of himselfe, without any mans soliciting; that the whole praise should be primarily unto God the cause of all causes, and secundarily unto his Highnes, for preferring the will of the HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST, in so weightie a point, as the abolishing of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, &amp; converting of their livings unto charitable vses in the common wealth: But seeing things fall out contrary to expectation; It is (in my opinion) great pittie, that such a work should any longer lye unprinted. Wherefore through their neglect, I wil cause it to come forth; being perswaded it shall tend much to the honour of God and relief of many, which is both pietie and pittie. And if it prove any losse to proud Prelates the possessors of those over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large-livings, it is but their due demerite, and they may all learn therby (God giving them such grace) to make much spirituall profite for their soules health and comfort: wherof they haue farre more need, then of that abundance of bodily benefites. And in hope to effect the ends premised, I intreate all men who shall happen to have any of these cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, to make good use of them both for their own instruction and benefite, as also for the common good; and that especially against all succeeding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, till the mark aymed at be rightly hit, and the goale fully wonne.</p>

And so they patiently wayted to see what would be done. And wheras God so disposed that Arch Bishop Whitgift at the beginning of the first Parliament after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties coming suddenly died, the sayd Mr Iohnson thus spake unto me and others; <hi>That God had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the King what he would haue him to doe with the rest of the Bishops, in taking away the chiefest of them at such a tyme.</hi> And as it was wel observed of him; so I doe most earnestly desire that all whom it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth will well call it unto minde, and duely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, for such good use as the GOD of heaven would have to be made by men on earth. For se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he who is the God above all Gods, Angels, and men, did in his wisdome and providence, put downe at such a tyme, him that was Bishop above al Bishops in the Land: and at once turned him out

of the Councell, Court and Parliament; as also fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Church, Ministerie, and world it selfe, happily it may insinuate that Bishops are unfit for, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of, all and every of those places, till they be cast in an other moulde and made all new. And if there be no use of the highest and chiefest of them, and at the chiefest time, as God did seem to shewe unto his Majestie, and to the body of the land then assembled: Then may we think there is as little or lesse use of the inferiour Bishops at any time.</p>

For they were of the remnant of the Amorites, whom he might lawfully haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, yet when peace was made with them wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord gave them life; Saul greatly sinned in putting them to death. And for this, the Lord brought famine upon the land in the dayes of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. Wherupon that righteous King sayd unto them that remayned, <hi>What shall I doe for you, and wherwith shall I make the atonement, that ye may blesse the inheritance of the Lord?</hi> To whom they answered; <hi>We will have no silver nor golde of Saul nor of his house, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel.

Haman was not more enviously bent against the Iewes, for the rooting out of them, then our <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>-like Bishops have ben for the destoying of these whom they raile against as Puritans, Brownists, Sectaries, schismatiques, and what not?

But as I have put you in mind of the famine which God brought upon Israel in the dayes of David for that bloudy sin done against the Gibeonites in the dayes of Saul; so you may remember and should not forget, that in our land, God brought a great pestilence in the daies of King Iames, so as there died in one citie London, above 3300. in one week: besides those that died in other cities and townes of the same plague. And who knoweth not but that it might be for that bloudy sin against the foresayd Christians, thorow the instigation of the Prelates, who by their murders made these to be martyrs, in the dayes of Q. Eliz. who was of her selfe a most worthy Princesse. God give men wisedome and grace to consider rightly of all thinges, and so of these two thus compared togither.</p>

                              <head>A Memorandum Anno Domini 1604.</head>
                              <p>IN the Raigne of our now Soveraigne Lord King Iames, who is a defender of the Gospel, foure persons were inforced to abjure the Land for the Gospels sake, (who practised the Ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ces therof, in obedience to the King Christ, whom God set to Raigne in his Church, by the scepter of his word:) separating themselves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> our Church of England, refusing to communicate, joyne, or partake with the same, in the publike Ministerie, worship, and government ecclesiasticall, with many other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions derived from Poperie, and are still retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the body &amp; bosome of the English Church. This abjuration was urged upon the Statute of the 35. of Q. Eliz. after they had suffered 3. moneths imprisonment: And (at the publike Sessions in Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,) it was thus carried; That they should take their oathes to depart the Realme within one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and not to returne againe into any of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the late Queene, without leave from his Majestie, or his Highnes Successors. Their chiefe speaker pleaded, that they were true and faithfull subjects to his Majestie, and had not deserved so to be dealt with; and desired to be discharged without an oath, and they would both promise and be
<pb facs="tcp:23325:71"/>
bound to depart. But that not being granted; he desired that their oath might be with conditions and not so strictly against returning. For sayd hee, we may be occasioned to travel by sea to other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, &amp; by crosse winds be driven again into those dominions contrary to our purpose. Or, we may be taken at sea, and brought hither by force, and divers the like; and so be forsworne though against our wills. Then it was tolde him that all such things was to be borne with. But he replyed, it could not save their oath from being broken, without such things were expected. Moreover he told the bench that they held themselves so bound to Parents, Prince and Country, that if in an other land, they heard of any treason, it was their duetie to come &amp; disclose the same. And therefore sayd he, I wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take my oath without conditions: Which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed sundry times. And when he saw notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that the oath was strictly administred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them according to the Statute, he adjoyned this speach himselfe, <hi>But if the performance of any dutie to Prince, Countrey, Parents, or the like, doe move me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, I will then be free of the oath.</hi> And thus he would haue the Bench to understand he swore; but not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. And they all keping silence, the Towne-Clark answered; that in such case they should seeke for leave. And the party replyed, that, the case might require such hast as they could not stay for leave. Then were they commanded to pay their fees, and to be gone within a moneth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>

               <p>Were so! Yes upon the adventure of my best limme, or life it selfe, it was so. And for those things wherein they differ from the opinions and practises in our Church of England, I never savve any trueth more cleare in all my life. As you also may easily perceive, if you scan the difference from point to point by the scriptures. And there is no trueth in England but they hold the same: dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting onely from them wherein they dissent from the word of GOD ALMIGHTY, which ought to be followed in every jote &amp; tittle thereof.</p>
               <p>Now by the <hi>Memorandum</hi> that I shewed you, I remember a saying in the Preface of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith at their first publishing of it, which sayd, <hi>They hoped God would raise up another Iohn Fox to compile togither the latter Martyrs and Witnesses of our Lo: Iesus in these our dayes.</hi> And it seemes that the work goes foreward, in that God stirreth up some to keep records of such thinges, for further use in tyme to come.</p>
               <p>Now for the Statute above mentioned, I knowe it was intended against popish Recusants, and not against these. And (without all question) their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries haue been more then ynough, though Lawes were not wrested against them. And this wrong
<pb facs="tcp:23325:72"/>
was the greater, considering their love and loyalty to Prince &amp; Country: But their judges must come before the Iudge of all the world that wil doe right. In respect wherof I pray for them that their case may be found cleare, through repentance, which is the right way thereunto, if it be done in time. And for all the Saintes here combating under the banner of the great Captaine of the Lords Host, that is, Iesus Christ, it behoveth them in patience to possesse their soules, &amp; looke for their rest when the Lord commeth, who will wipe all teares from their eyes, &amp; give them an inheritance everlasting, immortal, which fadeth not away, reserved in the heavens for them. Which shalbe enjoyed, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on the left hand, shall both heare a contrary sentence, and receive a worse reward. But as <hi>Abigail</hi> the wife of <hi>Nabal</hi> is praised, in that she used such wise and good meanes to prevent and stay <hi>David</hi> from bringing that evill which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his house, for his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, reprochful, and evill answer; so much more shal it be a praise-worthy work, &amp; special part of good seruice &amp; durie, in any that shall perswade &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the Magistrates and people, from bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evill upon the servants of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cause. For as the Psalmist sayth, <hi>what hath the righteous done?</hi> To which every good Christian may answer, <hi>They haue surely done that which deserves praise, and not punishment; not imprisonment, reproches, confiscatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of goods, banishment, untimely death, or any the like evill intreaty.</hi>

               <p>They may so answer, and that truely: but the world vvill not receive it. And now I pray you tell me, What difference doe you put between those people called <hi>Brownists,</hi> and our sincerest and best professors of the Gospel called <hi>Puritans?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Mickelbound.</speaker>
               <p>The difference is layd downe in few words, The former doe both hold and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the truth, and separate themselves from the contrarie. The latter haue the trueth in speculation onely, and either dare not or at least doe not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it. Neither dare or doe they leave off all the unrighteous ordinances of Antichrist, but daily do bend and stoupe unto many of them. And for what cause, others may well conjencture: but their owne hearts can best tell it to themselves.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>But those Christians called <hi>Brownists,</hi> are at great difference among themselves. For some holdes private communion, others of them will at no hand allow it. And so there ariseth ill will, with decrease of love in one towards another. But I pray you which of those persons or opinions doe you like best?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Mickelb.</speaker>
               <p>For their opinion, I would haue my judgement spared at this time: Onely this I say, that their difference is not such as ought to make any division between them: or to breake off the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship which they had before. And if any doe, it is (doubtlesse) the fault of those that doe it. They haue need therefore to take heed of prejudice and preposterous zeale, which else will be
<pb facs="tcp:23325:73"/>
as a mother &amp; nourse to breed and bring up that wicked weed <hi>Envie,</hi> a capitall vice, in sted of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Love,</hi> a holy vertue. Be they then exhorted to shew forth the fruites of Christian moderation, bearing with, and supporting one another; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with and for one another; enterteyning holy peace between themselves, and with the Lord; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against the sinnes in themselves, rather then that difference in their brethren; so shall they the better carry forth their good cause against their envious Opposites. For while they combine togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among themselves, they shall be able to push, and at last to overthrowe the Antichristian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Hierarchy, against which they joyntly beare witnes. And thus shall they be truely zealous. As for their persons, there is neither of them doe lose one jote of my love, if they continue their love to the Lord, and his commandements, walking faithfully according to that which he giveth them to see and knowe by his word, both in holynes to himselfe, righteousnes towards men, and sobriety in themselves, with abstinence from worldly lusts. And if they alike thus walk, my love is alike unto them.</p>

               <p>Some doe object against them their manner of receiving the Lords supper, as being rude, unreverent, malepert, and too too presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous; sitting upon their seates, as if they were Christs Camerades: whereas for more reverence they ought to take it kneeling.</p>

               <speaker>Miles.</speaker>
               <p>This is no more against the former cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Brownists,</hi> then it is against the latter called <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> even the best and sincerest of them: For they likewise so hold, that it ought not to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but sitting: and eyther doe or faine would so practise, if they could in safetie, or durst indure the trouble following after it. But for the point it selfe, How doe those objecters prove, that such manner of receiving, is presumptuous &amp;c? But are not they presumptuous rather that shal make them selves wiser then Christ, and give lawes in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or Church, which himself (the onely Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) hath not given? Do they think that their good intents will carry out any thing in Gods worship, which hath not warrant in his word? If that were so, then had not <hi>Vzzah</hi> been slaine, for staying the Ark of God from shaking; <hi>2 Sam. 6.6.7.</hi> Neyther should King Saul haue been rejected for saving alive the fat cattel of <hi>Amalek,</hi> to offer in sacrifice to God. <hi>1. Sam. 15.</hi> But the point being sufficiently cleared by sundry writers, I referre you to them. And I, what should I need to say more but this, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ee must in all thinges looke unto the first institution, as our Lord Iesus himself also did, when men spake unto him of putting away their wives, who told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that Moses for the hardnes of their heartes suffered it; but from the beginning it was not so. And in like manner, to such as plead for kneeling at the receiving of the Lords supper, we may answer, that for want of love to the Lord and his trueth, it hath
<pb facs="tcp:23325:74"/>
pleased him to give them over to hardnes of heart &amp; strong delusions. And as the Papists those grosse idolaters, receiving the signes of Christs body and bloud, to wit, bread and wine, thinking it to be the very body and bloud it selfe, contrary to their own senses; they doe for more reverence to it, kneel before it, and worship it as their God and Maker: even so our formal Protestants at the celebration of the Lords supper do likewise kneele; imitating ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in those idolaters, and so nourishing that popish er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of errours. But from the beginning it was not so. For at the first institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, it was received as they sate at the Table; But we can no where finde in all the scriptures, that ever they received it kneeling; or that ever true Christians beleeved those holy signes were transubstantiated into the body and bloud of Christ as the Papists falsely teach<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Therefore as well that opinion, as their and the Protestants practise, is highly sinfull, and for ever ought to be shunned. Both because God never required such a beleefe, nor appointed such a gesture in the act of communion, as they haue taken up to themselves, from the brain of mans mere invention. Wee are therfore to take heed what examples we follow. <hi>Dinah</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iakob,</hi> going forth to see the daughters of the countrey where they came, was defiled bodily: but some of our Protestants looking forth to see after what fashion the Papists served God before them, haue been defiled spiritually. Wheras they should haue remembred and observed, that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:23325:74"/>
for our learning, (in <hi>Levit. 18.3.4.</hi>) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Israel of old, saying; <hi>After the doings of the Land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt shall ye not doe: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of the land of Canaan whither I will bring you, shall ye not doe, neyther walk in their ordinances, But doe after my iudgementes, and keep mine ordinances to walk therein: &amp;c.</hi>

               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>It is a good instruction: And being well followed, it will prevent infinite errours and other abominations. But how doe you manifest that the Papists doe worship the signes of Christs body and bloud, as the very body and bloud it self, and that contrarie to their own senses, as you sayd. For if that be true, they are most vile idolaters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Miles.</speaker>
               <p>So they are. For when they receive the bread, they see it, feele it, smell it and tast it to be bread, yet they beleeve in the heart &amp; say with the mouth, that it is body, even the same that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified on the crosse; quite contrary to their owne senses of seeing, feeling, smelling and tasting, as I sayd before. And that bread, which their own sense tells them, is no other creature but bread, doe they adore and worship as the Creator, as God, &amp; as Christ. And so in like maner beleive they the wine to be the very bloud of God Christ, which was shed for the redemption of the Church. Which horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idolatrie of theirs is as grosse, as to worship &amp; beleeve in a molten or carved image, in sted of the true God. And both these sorts of idolatrie, are not
<pb facs="tcp:23325:75"/>
onely against the second commandement, but also against the first. Thus may you perceive that the Papists are deluded with a lye extraordinary; bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the lying miracle of transubstantiation. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all true miracles wrought by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, never any were taught to beleeve any thing contrary to their owne sight, and their other senses; but these seduced soules are miserably misled that way. And why? even because their lying prophets doe so beleeve and teach. But is it not as strange that they will haue so many Christs at one and the same time? For after the words of consecration are used, those signes are transubstantiated into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body and bloud of Christ (by their opinion) &amp; becommeth the whole Christ: so that if they doe the like in an hundred thousand places at once, they haue then (if you will beleeve them) so many CHRISTS. And they being all eaten up in one day, yet they can make as many moe in another: and that as often as they consecrate their bread to such an end or use. And is not this a wonderfull miracle, and these marvelous men, thas can by the words of their mouthes effect such strange things? Or rather are not these monsters among men, to beleeve such strange and strong delusions? But so shall it fare with those that haue not the love of the trueth. 2. <hi>Thes</hi>

               <p>They haue the letter of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture in that point before spoken of. For Christ saith in <hi>Ioh. 6. This is my body:</hi> But they haue not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at all. Neyther doe they consider that all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall signes haue the name of the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. As for example: The tree of life, and the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therof, was a sacramentall signe to them that should live in obedience to God, that they should haue life. The tree of knowledge of good and evil, had the name of that which they should (by lamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table experience) finde, if they (contrarie to Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mandement) should eat thereof. The Altar, which Iakob builded unto God, he called by the name of the Mighty God of Israel. Not that it was so indeed: But that it was a signe &amp; remembrance, of that God who had appeared unto him, for his helpe; and had mightilie delivered him from the furious hands of his brother Esau. And other the like examples are in the scriptures. Even so Christ sayth of the elemental signes of bread and wine, in the Lords supper: <hi>Take eate, &amp;c. This is my body<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> this is my bloud, &amp;c.</hi> Not that they are so in deed, for when he spake those words his blessed body was at the table among his disciples, and not in the bread; as they plainely sawe with their eyes, and did know with understanding: But they were true signes of his body and bloud, and as verily as they received them; so certainly should every true beleever receive
<pb facs="tcp:23325:76"/>
Christ and all his merites, to be fully theirs by faith. And the papists that worship these signes as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body and blould of Christ, (because they were in mysterie so called;) If they had lived in the dayes of Iakob, they might as wel, and it is like they would, haue worshiped that Altar, as the Mighty God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was in mysterie (that is, in signe and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication) so called. But as therein they should haue been notable idolaters, so are they in worshiping a peece of bread which they eat, as God the Creator both of it &amp; them. And seing they think that to be their God, if now they would see their foolishnes by a fewe wordes. I wish them to consider what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of it in short space after they haue eaten it, &amp; so they shal see that if ever it was a God, it soon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth away and becommeth none, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of the true God, who is eternal, immortal, unchangeable, &amp;c. but the bread eaten, goeth into the belly, and is caried out into the draught, as Christ speaketh. So that this their God <hi>Bread,</hi> is more base then the God <hi>Bell,</hi> or any of the the Gods of the heathens. And are not these grosse idolaters? Yea, this their absurd foolishnes, was a stumbling block unto <hi>Averois,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> I haue read, that he sayd; <hi>Because the Christians eat that God which they worship, my soule shall be with the Philosophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherfore, I would they might learne, that as the outward signes of bread and wine, being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the belly, turneth unto the nourishment of the body, so Christ being received into the soule by
<pb facs="tcp:23325:76"/>
faith, is the true nourishment therof, and salvation of the whole man. For he hath redeemed us from death &amp; destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, iustified us in the sight of God, and procured us life with him. All which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thorow faith. But in this trueth I know you are already grounded, so as I need not speak further for your instruction; and as for them, should I speak, should I write, should I doe all I can, it will not profite them. For (without the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary work of God,) they must still beleeve as their church beleeves. For that cannot erre, as they fondly suppose. So that it may hold what it vvill and they must hold the same, vvithout all triall or mistrust. Thus by one error, they are fast fettered in many; &amp; must be left to their blind guides, till they fall togither into the ditch. For other guides they will not haue.

And you haue brought me to like better of them then ever I did; but espetial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that you so well cleared their doctrine of faith to be sound, and their separation to be but from sin, and such outward orders and ordinances, that are unsound and sinfull: which they therefore forsake, that they might doe the will of God according to his written word; the light of our feet and lanterne to all our pathes.</p>

               <p>You haue sayd ynough to cleare them both from heresie and schisme; for he is no heretique that is sound in the faith. And he is no schismatique that separates onely from disorder &amp; sin. For we ought not to communicate in sin either with men or Angels.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>And that is the ground whereupon I my selfe neyther doe nor dare communicate in the Church of England with that sinful ordinance of man the service book, or book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon prayer.</p>

               <p>If you professe so much in England by your practise, as you haue here confessed with your mouth, you may happen to be called a <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist,</hi> if not to tast of other hard intreaty.</p>

               <p>Yet the truth is the truth. Which as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth unto me, so stand I bound to obey unto it. But I pray you why doe the foresayd people solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize mariage in civil Assemblies or dwellings?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Mick.</speaker>
               <p>Because it is a civil action, and ought
<pb facs="tcp:23325:77"/>
civilly to be performed, according to the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>Why, it is the judgment almost of all men to haue it done in the Church by a Minister. And (in England) it is a common received custome to haue it so performed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Mick.</speaker>
               <p>I wish rather that for the proofe of it you could haue sayd, <hi>Thus saith the Lord.</hi> And then to haue shewed the chapter and verse where it is so sayd. But you haue done nothing lesse, neither in deed it is impossible to be done: there being no such thing once named or implied in all the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And consequently, the ground whereon you stand is not rocky and firme, but unsure and sandy, which shall wash away with the raine, &amp; every house built upon such a foundation, when the flouds come and the windes blowe, shall certainly fall, as we may learne both by Christs own doctrine in the Gospell, and reason it selfe doth shewe the same. And if an Argument drawen from a common cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome be good, then if it be a common custome to haue the Lords holy Sabbaths profaned with Beare and Bull baiting, with dicing and carding, with May games and morrice dance, with laciviousnes and luxurie, with rifling or revelling, &amp;c. then all is good, and all may be done, <hi>sane conscientia</hi>: But I hope that both you and every childe of God true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sanctified, doe defie and abhorre all such things, not onely on the Sabbath dayes, but every day of the week, and of their whole life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23325:78"/>And is it not a common received custome in England, to worship God by their book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon prayer in English, as the Papists by their Massebook in Latin, and by their Images, beades, crucifixes, and other the like; in stead of true invocation upon the Name of God by the work of his Spirite: But being all vvithout and against the vvarrant of the vvord of God, your self dare neyther practise nor approve them. And vvhy then doe you not minde the like in other things no less unvvarrantable. As is the solemnization of mariage ecclesiastically, and other such like. Many abominations might be pleaded for by common custome, and multitude of men in that minde. But lay aside these sandy grounds, and heare the vvords of the Lavve, <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to doe evill, neyther agree in a controversie to decline after many and overthrow the truth. Exod. 23.2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beleeve it for truth, That</p>
               <p>All Church actions, are layd dovvne in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vvhich is the rule of truth: But in them vve finde no mention of mariage to be a Church acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Therefore it ought not to be so made or used.</p>
               <p>And againe, All the dueties of the Ministerie are expressed in the scriptures: But in them there is no more mention or vvarrant for the ministers solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of mariages, to the living, then is for their burying of the dead, vvhich is just none at all. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> they are both unlavvfull, and ought not to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23325:78"/>And where you affirme the contrary, saying, it ought to be done by a Minister; doe you meane a minister indefinitely, without any respect, whether he be true or false?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>No, But I meane a true Minister one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For no true Christian ought to goe to false mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for any such end.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Mick.</speaker>
               <p>Your reason is right and good: But then the Ministers of England haue no right in that work, they being in respect of their offices, not true but false Ministers, and so proved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>But in respect of their guiftes they may be sayd to be the Ministers of Christ. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them haue excellent giftes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. M.</speaker>
               <p>So had <hi>Balaam</hi> likewise, who yet was but a false Minister and a Southsayer. And so haue many Lawyers &amp; others in our Land, if they would and might be suffred to exercise their gifts, who yet are no Ministers at all. Gifts then doe help to make men fit for a Ministerie, but doe not make them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, much lesse true Ministers. For every true Minister must not onely be qualified with gifts fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the same: But must also be lawfully called thereunto. Even as, every civil Magistrate &amp; Iudge, must not onely be qualified with guifts fitt for the Magistracie and Iudgeship which he exerciseth, but must also be lawfully called thereunto, and rightly put into the possession thereof. But where you say, many of the Ministers of England haue great gifts, and therupon conclude them to be true Ministers,
<pb facs="tcp:23325:79"/>
you therein condemne the dumbe ministerie that doe but read their stervice onely, and haue no gifts for praying nor preaching.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>It is no matter. Let them goe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. For I hold them false Ministers, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. Mick.</speaker>
               <p>Yet they haue the same Ministerie with those that haue the greatest guiftes. So that if the one be false, the other is so likewise. Again, if men haue neuer so good gifts, and be called unto a false ministerie, they are (notwithstanding their giftes) false ministers. But now to returne to our former point, and apply this to the purpose. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is the ordinance of God; but a false ministery is the ordinance of the Divil. And (sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>I would not that ye should haue fellowship with the Divils. 1. Cor. 10.20.</hi> These can haue no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion togither then <hi>Light</hi> with <hi>Darknes, Christ</hi> with <hi>Beleal,</hi> or the <hi>Beleever</hi> with the <hi>Infidel.</hi> All which is condemned, <hi>2 Cor. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, If you would haue no mariages right and lawfull, unlesse they be solemnized by a true Minister; then you must eyther make the popish mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>sterie in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> dayes to be true Ministers, or else all that were then so maried, to be unlawfull mariages, and the children that were begotten of such parents to be illigitimate, that is to say bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards. But were it not a fowle extremitie to affirme eyther of these? Doubtlesse a Mariner that should he so absurd in sayling, would soon run his ship up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:23325:79"/>
the sands, or break it asunder against the rocks.</p>
               <p>Againe, If mariages be onely lawful that are made up in a Church by a Minister; then whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is not a Church and Ministerie, there can be no lawful mariage. But the Apostle teacheth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise and saith, that mariage is honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all, <hi>Heb. 13.</hi> And therfore not onely where there is a Church and Ministerie, but also where there is none. So that mariage is Gods ordinance, &amp; lawful to be performed even among the Pagans.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, If mariage be onely right &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when and where it is done in a Church by the Minister<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> then are all mariages to be condemned that haue been made up in Christian Countreyes civilly before the Magistrates. But that they may not be. For the word of God gives approbation to such mariages, in the mariage of Boaz &amp; Ruth, wherof we read, <hi>Ruth 4.9.10.11.12.</hi> And on the contrary, shew you if you can, any one place in all the holy scripture, that approveth of mariage to be eyther a sacrament, as the blinde Papists would haue it; or a Church action, for the minister to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; as you and our Protestants doe plead. By which plea &amp; practise you notably nourish the old popish errour, that Mariage is a Sacrament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Desiderius.</speaker>
               <p>I will reason no further in this matter. For I perceive that both scripture and reason is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me. And when I finde it so, down goes the bucklers. For I love not to be a proctor in a bad cause.</p>

               <p>It goes wel where there is so good a conscence. (But it is not so in the Spirituall Courts, which are as worthy to goe downe as your bucklers.) And had you held out longer, you had heard more. But here is this briefe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting concerning the point, which in likelihood was written by some of that people of the right Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an prosession; though I neither know how, where, nor when I came by it. But a special end of it might be in the providence of God for your good.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto us to be good and lawfull, that ought all to reverence and obey: Yea though the lawes decrees &amp; customes of men were to the contrary: Much more where any thing is done which both the law of God, &amp; law of man doth allow to be lawfull, none can disallow or speak evill of it, except they be such as eyther in bad conscience or great ignorance doe open their mouthes both against heaven and earth. Which fearefull sin, the Lord keepe all his servants from.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this to a question objected concerning mariage, I holde and affirme as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That where a man and a woman (that may mary together by the word of God) doe take one an other for husband and wife, by words of the present tyme, before lawfull witnesses, using prayer to God to blesse them therein, that (I say) is lawful mariage, and allowed both by the word of God and law of man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word of God.</hi> By the word of God, as may be seene in these scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.22.23.24. <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.9.10.11.12. <hi>Math. Prov.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.21.22.23. compared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23325:80"/>Then also by the law of man, and that both by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of this land, and by the civil law also, and even the canon law it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">(2. <hi>The law of this land.</hi>) For the common law of this land, see the Statute of 32. <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 38. revived in the 1. of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> directly and of purpose alloweth and ratifieth all mariages done according to the word of God.

               <p>Wheras heretofore the Bishop of Rome hath alwayes intangled and troubled the mindes of people against the regal power of this Realm of England, and also much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted the subjects of the same, by his usurped power in them, as by making that unlawfull, which by Gods word is lawfull, both in mariages and other things, &amp;c. And wheras also other prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s then Gods law admitteth, much more debate and suite of law, with wrongfull vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the innocent party hath bene procured, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny just mariages brought in doubt, and danger of undoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and also many times undone, and lawfull heires dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited, wherof there had never else (but for that usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation) been moved any question, since freedome in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> was given us by the law, which ought to be most sure &amp; certaine, &amp;c.

               <p>Againe in <hi>Anno</hi> 25. <hi>Henr.</hi> 8. <hi>ch.</hi> 22. the Satute hath these words as followeth,</p>
               <p>The Parliaments, Convocations, and Vniversities agreed, that even in matters of mariage, no man of what estate degree or condition soever, hath any power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with Gods lawes.</p>

               <p n="4">(4. <hi>Civil law.</hi>) Next as touching the Civil Lavv, it defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that to be lavvful mariage, vvhen the parties that may mary togither and are of yeares doe both of them consent in taking each other for man and vvife, if they be at their ovvne government, or if they haue parents, vvith their consent.

And as any of these copies shall come into the hands of gratious persons, be they humbly intreated conscionably to consider of the matter, and accordingly labour to advance the glory of God, and to procure the good both of the King and Countrey, by effecting (through diligent suite, &amp; holy endeavors) reformation in the things before treated on. Which so farre as time, place, and purse wil permit, shall be put to the Presse. And so because of your hast I cease.</p>
