            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Goddesse of eloquence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion was the portresse of his mouth, or fat in all pomp vpon his lips as on her royall throne: he among all the rout of cunning Rhetoricians, did let the auditors blood in the right veine, his wordes did moue an after passion, saith he, in them. Many besides had these excellent surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing veines, of whom we may reade, if we peruse the histories, and other writings of famous men. This wit is euer a consort with iudgement; yet often I confesse the judgement is depraued in wit: for wee must know, though <hi>verum</hi> and <hi>falsum,</hi> bee the obiectes of vnderstanding, euery thing is not discerned or vnderstood according to these two, as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly either <hi>verum</hi> or <hi>falsum:</hi> for the agent vnderstanding, conueighing the species of any thing, (as imagine of any subtile stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageme) vnto the passiue, the passiue doth not alway judge of it accordingly: for if they seeme good and true at first view; yet after wee haue demurd vpon them any space of time, they are found neither true nor good, but altogether crude &amp; imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

yet not as it is a pure sanguine complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as there is mixed with the blood either the grosse sediments of melancholy or the <hi>lenta materies pituitae,</hi> tough phleume, when the blood is also ouerheated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of hot choler, or any other accidenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cause that generates a surplussage of blood, or endues the spirits with a grose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and too hot a qualitie more then their nature can well sustaine with keeping their perfection and puritie.</p>

There was one that tooke a conceit hee was a God, who was thus ridde of his malady: hee was pend vppe in an iron grate, and hadde no meate giuen him at all, onely they adored him and offered to his deity the fumes of frankincense, and odours of delicate dishes which alwaies past by him: whose deity grew at the length so hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry that he was fain to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse his huma nity vnles he had me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue been starued.

               <p>Many moe be rehearsed in that place which is worthy to bee read: wherein the poet shewes himselfe both a Diuine, an Historian, a Philosopher and Phisicion. In treating of dreames wee will not intet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with these, the ominous and fatall dreames wee read of in the sacred writ. One portentous dream I will recite which comes to my memory, and which I my selfe heard related of the party that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it. There was one that dreamed she was walking in a greenish meade, all fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant with beautifull flowers and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing plants, who whiles she wondred and stood as amaz'd at the glory of the spring: an auncient sire all withered aud lean-fac'd with eld, the very embleme of death, made toward her with a greene bow in his hand, sharpning it at the end, whoe, as shee fled away from his pursuit did dartit often at her, the branch three times comming very neare her yet did not touch her at all; who when hee see he could not preuaile with his aime, vanished eft away and left the bow behind, and shee as astounded and affright with the dreame presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wooke: now marke the sequel of it: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:20048:88"/>
three daies after shee was for recreation sake, walking in a greenish inclosure hard by a pond side, and on a suddaine her brain was so intoxicate &amp; distempered, whether with a spice of a <hi>vertigo,</hi> or what amazing disease soeuer I know not, but shee was hurried into a deepe pond with her head forward, being in great peril of drow ning, and if shee had not caught fast hold by chance on a branch that hung ouer the water, shee had beene drowned indeed. These also are fatall dreames, as when we dreame of Eagles flying ouer our heade, it portends infortunatenes: to dreame of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, dauncing and banquetting foretels some of our kinsfolkes are departed; to dreame of siluer, sorrow, if thou hast it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thy selfe: of gold, good fortune; to loose an axill tooth or an eye, the death of some speciall friend: to dreame of bloody teeth, the death of the dreamer: to weep in sleepe, ioy: to contemplate ones face in the water, and to see the dead, long life: to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle lead, some mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cholick disease: to see a Hare, death: to dream of chickins and birds, commonly ill lucke: all which, and a thousand more I will not auer to be true, yet because I haue found them or many of
