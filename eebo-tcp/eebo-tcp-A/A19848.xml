            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>¶ <hi>A pretie and ſhorte diſcourſe</hi> of the duetie of a Seruingman.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthoughe the Seruingman bée diſdained, and had in ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde amongeſt a number: yet doth he deſerue to be had in high eſtimation for his worthineſſe &amp; calling. Who in all our countrie maketh a brauer ſhewe at a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph then the Seruingman? Who ſooner trained to battaile and becomes a Souldier? Who better delighteth the mind with pleaſant exerciſe, as haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, hunting, and ſuch like, then the Scruingman? Not euery one hauing a blade by his ſide, or liuerie cote on his backe, may be termed a Seruingman: for ſome there are which will crowd them ſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their companie, whoſe brutiſh liues neuer ſawe one point of ſeruice: ſuch may be properly called Hindes. <note place="margin">Hindes.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For foure eſpeciall pointes there are, whereby to knowe a Seruingman: Godlineſſe, Clenlineſſe, <note place="margin">Foure points to knowe a ſeruingman, to be godly, cleanly, bold, and diligent.</note> Audacitie, and Diligence, which are the chiefeſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes that garniſhe his perſon, without the which he may not be imbraced amongeſt that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie companie. For this worde Seruingman, hath great relation to his kind: for a Seruingman may be applied to diuerſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: as ſeruing God, ſeruing his Prince, ſeruing his Countrie, which way he may profite his Common weale, and not to beare the name of a Seruingman only for outward ſhewe, who in liuing are viler then ſenſleſſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, wanting ciuil gouernement, who may be well compared vnto Drones, which lurke in the hiues of
<pb facs="tcp:5465:4"/>
Bées, &amp; liue by their labours. But him I accompt worthy that calling, which for one ſingular qualitie <note place="margin">VVho deſerue to be rightly and properly called Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingmen</note> deſerueth the ſame: as ſome for the gift of the mind, ſome for the exploites in defence of his countrie, ſome for actiuitie, ſome for cunning in weapons, ſome for riding of horſes, ſome for ſeruice at a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with diuers other things apt for a ſeruingman, which are euident tokens that he hath imployed his youth to that end and purpoſe, whereby to attaine to ſome preferment and winne credit, whereby hée may be receiued into the number of Seruingmen.</p>
            <p>What maketh the Citizens, yea and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen haue in ſuch diſdaine the ſeruingman? On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Cauſes of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempt &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine concei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued againſt Seruingmen.</note> his lewd gouernment, as riott in apparell, dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, quarelling in the ſtréetes, playing vnthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily at dice and cardes their ſubſtance, ſwearing moſt deteſtable and horrible other: whereby we daily ſée, by that meanes they hazarde their health, &amp; diſcredit themſelues by ſuch diſorder: who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly conſuming the ſame, are forced through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame want and neceſſitie, to robb and ſteale, that oftimes hardly they eſcape without perill of death. By this meanes they much hinder the preferment of Seruingme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Such haue I thought good to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med reprobates: for there cannot be more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Reprobates.</note> in a Seruingman, then to ſée his life cléerely lead by vertue, alwayes applying his minde to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt exerciſe: for otherwiſe his eſtate and calling of due order and gouernement is depriued: for happie dayes excéede the heaped ſummes. And of this be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, ſuch company as thou frequenteſt, of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation art thou iudged. Therefore the more thou indeuoureſt thy ſelf in vertuous exerciſes, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is thy glorie and renowne.</p>
            <p>Percaſe to ſome in this worlde, to liue in ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:5465:4"/>
ſorte, thou ſhalt be accompted ridiculous. It may be of thoſe which wante gouernement: but ſuche as are lead by wiſedomes rule, and policie, ſhall haue thée in no ſmall price and highe eſtimation: the more vertue thou embraceſt, the greater is thy credit. And further, there is annexed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duetie of a Seruingma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, theſe thrée ſpeciall points, to be <hi>Gentle, Truſtie and Carefull;</hi> for wanting <hi>Gentlenes,</hi> he is contemned: hauing no <hi>Credit,</hi> alwayes miſtruſted: <note place="margin">Gentle, Truſtie, Carefull.</note> voide of <hi>Care,</hi> litle regarded.</p>
            <p>We ſée daily by experience, howe circumſpecte eache Gentleman is, in receiuing a ſeruaunt, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take him without greate warrantize: and this is, by reaſon that youth hauing their libertie, &amp; nouzeled ſo long in idleneſſe, are prone and apt to vice and wickedneſſe, vtterly vndoing them ſelues thorough their owne wilfulneſſe, that impoſſible it is, to bring them to any perfection, as the olde ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſtly affirmeth.
<q>
                  <l>Naturam expellas furca licet, vſque recurret.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That which is ingraffed by nature, neither threatenings, or any perſuaſion may alter: And if it happen ſuch one, who hauing their libertie, bée enterteined into ſeruice: what offence ſo euer he commit to his maiſter, he thinkes it greate ſcorne to be reformed, be is of ſo vile &amp; dogged a nature: and this is the cauſe, ſo many are maiſterleſſe: wherby it commeth to paſſe, that ſeruices are purchaſed by money. For a number, hauing good qualities, &amp; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of honeſt parentage: by their meanes are greatly hindered. For what is the common ſaying amongſt moſt men? If a Seruingman repaire to a maide or widowe, by way of marriage, whereby to winne himſelfe preferment, but ſtraightway they murmur amongeſt themſelues, backebiting him
<pb facs="tcp:5465:5"/>
ſhamefully with flaunderous ſpeaches, calling him ſpend thriſt. A lamentable hearing, that all Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for ſome lewde perfome ſakes, ſhoulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: for this is moſt certeine, that the leaſt faulte a Seruingman comitteth, is greatly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: therefore it ſtandeth them vppon, to haue ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall regard to avoyde ſuſpicion, conſidering their credit is their chiefeſt riches, which once being loſt, of the world they are forſaken.</p>
            <p>An other kind of Seruingmen there is, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that life but vpon extremitie, and that is the <note place="margin">Seruingmen vpon extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</note> riche Farmours ſonne, who hearing the drumme ſounde preparing to muſter, is meruellous feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to become a ſouldier, lamenting heauily to his cockering mother, to he a meanes for him he may not be preſſed: for (ſaith he) I am your onely dearling, and to ſée me miſcarrie it would ſhorten your days: for of this I am aſſured, that if I goe on warfare, I am neuer like to returne home againe to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe: for my fortune was reade me, when I was a little one, that I ſhoulde be ſhotte quite tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough with a gunne: therefore, (honnie mother) as you tender my ſafetie, procure me a ſeruice, that I may farrie at home. Then the mother, (to ſaue the prettie ſoule) ſéeketh out ſome preſent, and in haſt repaireth to ſome Gentleman of credit, &amp; vppon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made, forthwith is receiued, &amp; thus for feare of his coſterd becomes a Seruingman. Then Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men perceiuing they may haue ſeruantes <hi>Gratis,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Seruice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wages.</note> without wages, which will play the Seruingmen, &amp; drudge in their buſineſſe, turne out olde ſeruitors to go pick daſies, who farre from friends &amp; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, béeing vnexperte of trade and occupation, fall into deſperation, by meanes of pouertie.</p>
            <p>So that hereby the Farmour maketh a rodde for
<pb facs="tcp:5465:5"/>
his owne taile: for it ſtandeth by good reaſon, that being once in aduerſitie, if they haue any ſparke of manhood in them, rather then they will want reliefe they will ſéeke to come by it by vnlawfull meanes. And who will they lie in weight to robbe, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of, but on ſuch rich churles, as were cauſes of their vndooing. And thus they, by their double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, labour &amp; take ſuche paines, that they créepe in ſuch fauour with their maiſter, who with their profitable ſeruice is ſo infected with couetouſneſſe, that he hath no conſideration of his olde ſeruants true and faithfull diligence, who for their long ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, haue well deſerued a iuſt recompenſe. So that the Gentleman and the Yeoman, aſwell the one as <note place="margin">Gentlemen &amp; yeomen do cauſe ſeruice to decay.</note> the other, haue brought ſeruices to a verie weake ſtay, that a number at this day haue ſeruantes and giue them no wages: and if they haue any one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, which wanteth liuing, if he hath not ſome good qualitie, in good faith of his maiſter he ſhalbe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded.</p>
            <p>Therefore the eſtate of a ſeruingman is brought to this point, that if he practiſe not ſome trade in his youth, let him be aſſured to begge in his age, as the prouerb manifeſtly affirmeth: <hi>Qui antè non cauet poſt dolebit.</hi> He that hath no care afore what miſchiefes may afterward inſue, ſhall greately repent him.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which vppon ſuch extremitie profeſſe the life of Seruingmen, may be properly called <hi>Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges,</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>Caterpillers:</hi> for they hinder <note place="margin">Sucklings or Caterpillers.</note> thoſe which longe time haue ſerued, not profiting them ſelues, but waſting their ſubſtance: So that hereby they thinke to eſchewe one miſchiefe, but vndoubtedly they fall into a worſer. For they vſe a kinde of diligence, but to ſerue their owne turnes: But as ſoone as the brunt is paſt, they beginne to
<pb facs="tcp:5465:6"/>
waxe lazie, and take heart at graſſe, thinking with them ſelues, What dizards are we hauing rich pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, <note place="margin">A ſuppoſed ſpeache.</note> and wealth enough to mainteine our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to moyle &amp; toyle in ſuch ſort, &amp; other of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, hauing litle or nothing to take to, carrie the countenance of Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; we to liue thus like ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues? Then labour is turned to loytering, the noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay in the hatt to an Oſtrich fether, his ruſſet ſlapp to a french hoſe, his buckled ſhooe to a Spaniſhe pumpe, his ſparing life to prodigalitie, vntill of <note place="margin">All vpon bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

Thus they, not content with their owne eſtates, aſpire to be Gentlemen, by meanes of their fine array, that they growe ſo luſtie, that they think ſcorne of their owne parents: but it is commonly ſéene, The forward trée beareth leſſe fruite.</p>
            <p>What auaileth the mariner to ſaile without his compaſſe? What good doth a faire houſe wanting implementes of houſhold? What profiteth braue clothes in any perſon wanting witt and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? They may be aptly compared vnto a corrupt Carion in a golden cup: let them decke themſelues neuer ſo gaie, &amp; want the chiefeſt ornament, that is Wiſedome, in good faith, they ſhalbe but imbraced amongſt the moſt ſort of men for lucre or gaine, and <note place="margin">Wiſedome a principall ornament.</note> foothed for that they haue. Therefore, in my ſimple opinion, I think it more credit for them, to go in the fore ward amongſt the number of yeomen, then to come laſt in the number of Gentlemen, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes fearefull to challenge that title: ſo that, when all is gone, from the countrie cart they came, and to the London cart they muſt, that they ring ſuche a
<pb facs="tcp:5465:6"/>
peale that they drawe a yearde of cleane hempe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the knott.</p>
            <p>But nowe, to come to the chiefe point and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe which beautifieth a ſeruingman, which is, To <note place="margin">To be godly is the chiefeſt thing that beautifleth a Seruingman.</note> be godly. Nothing can proſper which we take in hand, or goe about, vnleſſe we applie our minde to the ſeruice of God: for him muſt we honour aboue all things, eyther in heauen or earth, beléeue in him onely to be our Sauiour, aſke for all good things of him alone: We muſt be content, not onely for the glorie of God, to beſtowe our goods, but alſo our life, if God ſo requireth: to cleaue vnto him as the foundation of all goodneſſe, to looke for health at his handes, to ſerue him in all kinde of fortune, to ſéeke his glorie aboue all thinges, and to ſerue him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his worde, to walke in ſuch ſorte as ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to his glorie, not in banqueting and dronken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not in chambering and wantonneſſe, not in ſtrife and enuying: but alwayes haue God before our eyes. Remember we liue not to eate, but eate to liue: for nature is content with a little: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is ſuperfluous, is ſinnefull and damnable. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that Adam &amp; Eue did fall thorough gluttonie. Remember that Noe, when he was dronke, was <note place="margin">Particular ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amples tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the in conueniences ſpringing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exceſsiue ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting &amp; drin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king.</note> vncouered in his tent, &amp; lay with his priuities bare. Remember that Loth, when he was dronke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted inceſt with his daughters. Remember when the children of Iſrael ſate downe to eate and drink, they did ſtraight way fall into idolatrie and worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the golden Calfe. Remember that Amon, the brother of Abſolon, was ſlaine at a banquet, when he was dronke. Remember that Holofernes being dronke, was ſlaine of a woman. Remember that at a banquet, it was graunted that Saint Iohn the Baptiſt ſhoulde loſe his head, and yet no cauſe why:
<pb facs="tcp:5465:7"/>
but for informing the king with trueth, which the flatterers miſliked of, and could not abide. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the riche glutton, that fared deintily euerie day, was buried and throwne downe into hell. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the wickednes of Sodome was pride, fulneſſe of meate, and abundance of idleneſſe. Howe many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes come thereof? Solomon ſaith, <hi>Where is woe? where is ſorrowe? where is ſtrife? where is bralling? where are othes: but amongſt thoſe whiche vſe ſuche vices?</hi> Theſe are terrible hiſtories to admoniſhe a ſeruingman: therfore it is the duetie of a Chriſtian, to eſchewe ſuch company: for ſuch as are dronkards and riottous perſons ſhal come to pouertie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt frame our liues in ſuch ſort, that wée may liue ſoberly, diſcréetely, &amp; ſagely: to inſtitute our liues in ſuch ſort, that our owne conſcience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accuſe vs of any euill, but teſtifie with vs, that <note place="margin">VVho may rightly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the name of a Seruing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man.</note> we liue to doe all thinges godlie, and he that liueth thus, may rightly challenge the name of a Seruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>There is a certeine dronkenneſſe aſwell in the mind, as in the bodie: for like as the bodie is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſober and ſafe eſtate, ſo long as it is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered with ſuperfluitie of meates and drinkes: ſo in like manner, ſo long as the minde is not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with vicious affectes, but remaineth in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue puritie, it is recounted ſober. For a man muſt haue aſpeciall reſpect to the minde, which being dronken with vices, what doth the ſobrietie of the bodie profit? If I kéepe my bodie ſober, &amp; in neuer ſo good temperance, and my minde be dronken with ire, deſire of vengeaunce, whoredome, vncleane thoughts, and ſuch other carnall affects, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſtes, what doth the ſobrietie of the bodie profit? Therefore, as the bodie is to be kept from droncken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:5465:7"/>
ſo muſt the minde be kept from vices: ſo ſhall we honour God highly, ſerue our Prince truely, &amp; profit our ſelues greatly, and béecome right Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men.</p>
            <p>And nowe touching the ſeconde pointe, called <note place="margin">The ſecond point requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uingman.</note> Cleanlineſſe, which is meant, that we ſhould weare our garments in comely order, according to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and calling, and according to ſuch lawes as by our Prince are ſet forth and eſtabliſhed: and not alwayes in exceſſe, and delighting in newe faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which declareth that our mindes are vnſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and alwayes wauering: wherein we woorke our vtter vndoing. For we are ſo pufte vp in ſuch pride and prodigalitie, that if we may not weare ſilkes and veluets, we thincke it a great diſgrace to our perſonages, wherein we hinder our Countrie, &amp; inriche forreigne nations. For if we would weare cloth made in our owne Countrie, according to our predeceſſours, we ſhould finde it a great deale more commodious, and miniſter much reléefe to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poore people, in ſetting them aworke: where nowe, they remaine in extreme pouertie, and all by meanes of prodigalitie, being not content with the benefites of our Countrie. The Frocke maketh not the Frier more deuout, but is rather a ſigne of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then a proofe of holineſſe. The fethers make not the birde, nor the garmentes the man. So, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie reſteth not in the outward ſhewe, be it neuer ſo ſumptuous, but in the perſon garniſhed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt qualities. For the minde delighting in pride &amp; prodigalitie, luſteth after much wickedneſſe. It is not the rich ornament that carrieth commendation, but a modeſt minde and honeſt conuerſation. If a man, hauing ſmall portion, ſpendeth riotouſly farre beyond his abilitie, men ſtreight way will coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:5465:8"/>
that he commeth by it by fraudulent meanes, and is reputed amongeſt them as a wicked liuer. And if any vnlawfull attempt be committed, be he aſſured, he ſhalbe ſuſpected. And although he be neither priuie or conſenting to the fact, yet by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſuſpicion his name is brought in queſtion. Therefore, in any wiſe haue reſpect to thy calling.</p>
            <p>I knowe a number within theſe fewe yeares, if I ſaide an hundred I went within my compaſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing large poſſeſſions left them, haue prodigally conſumed the ſame: wherein, if they had obſerued a ciuil order, they might haue had ſufficient enough to haue kept their eſtates, and beſides mainteyned good hoſpitalitie: But where wiſedome wanteth, there followeth decay. A ſhippe not guided, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to daunger: the braines being diſtempered, the pate wilbe idle: the rootes being rotten, the trée wil periſh. And ſo thirdly concerning audacitie, whiche may be properly called boldneſſe, which being tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with modeſtie, ſetteth foorth a Seruingman <note place="margin">Audacitie &amp; boldneſſe ſetteth out a Seruingman in comely or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der.</note> in comely order: for this worde Boldneſſe, hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good vertues in it comprehended. Be bolde to honour God. Be bolde to defend thy Countrie. Be bolde to followe ſuch lawes as thy Prince hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined. Be bolde to ſpeake trueth. By boldneſſe in battaile, great honours haue béene wonne. By boldneſſe, meane perſons haue inioyed faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. By boldneſſe the valiant capteine hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered many ſtraunge countries. And, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe affirmeth:
<q>
                  <l>Audaces Fortuna iuuat timidoſqué repellit.</l>
               </q>
Fortune much fauoureth the ſtout and the valiant: but the faint heart, and the coward ſhée vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh. And if it chaunce, thou art ſent of any meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, be bolde to doe thy duetie: with humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:5465:8"/>
let thy talke be tempered, in ſuch modeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that each worde be couched in due order. Haue reſpect to thy talke, that thou vſe comely geſture: thy legges not crooked, but ſtreight as may be: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy hands playing with any of thy garmentes: thy eyes not ſtaring, but alwayes kéeping a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt countenance. And if vppon courteſie thou art called to any worſhipfull table, let not thy tongue be lauiſh, or runne at libertie: ſo ſhalt thou diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite thy ſelfe, and be accounted ſimple. Uſe not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten quaffing at thy meale, but thrée or foure times let be ſufficient. Reache not thy handes ouer the table, nor put thy fingers often in the diſhe: for it excéedeth good manner. For being a ſtraunger, each one will carue thée. Kéepe not thy knife alwayes in thy hande, but at ſuch time conuenient, as thou haſt occaſion to cutt thy victuals, but lay it on the cloth along by the trencher. And if thou art aſked a queſtion, aunſwere him ſagely with humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>And ſo fourthly, concerning diligence, whiche <note place="margin">Diligence, what prefer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments it pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cureth to ſuch as vſe it.</note> may be aptly applyed to Painfulneſſe. We ſee no man can atteine to any riches, without greate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and diligence: as to watch, when other ſléepe: to trauell, when other reſt: to worke, when other play. Howe many haue we daily ſéene raiſed from meane eſtate, to rule and gouerne Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales, and onely by their diligence? Haue not diuerſe by their induſtrie béene called to Princes Counſell? Haue we not ſéene the Lawyers paſſe by degrées, and determine cauſes in ſeate of Iuſtice? The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſcholer hath thereby much profited. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilfull apprentice, in time hath béene verie cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his trade and occupation. By diligence, we may quite alter our wicked liues, and become
<pb facs="tcp:5465:9"/>
Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, haue not many men, ſeruing their lords and maiſters, béene rewarded with liuings, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough painefulneſſe, whereby they haue béen main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined during their liues? Therefore, <hi>Lillie</hi> herein moſte wiſely affirmeth, ſaying theſe wordes:
<q>
                  <l>Nil tam difficile eſt quod non ſolertia vincat:</l>
               </q>
Nothing is ſo harde to learne, but by diligence it is brought to paſſe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpent his youth verie <note place="margin">Ariſtotle. Plato. Cato.</note> riottouſly, and <hi>Plato</hi> was no leſſe addicted to delight in amorous verſe. <hi>Cato</hi> was olde before he learned Latine letters, and yet became one of the greateſt Oratours of his time. Theſe examples are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to proue, that by diligence any perfection may be atteined. Let no man ſtand ſo much in his owne conceipt, as to ſay, I will do no more then my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt requireth: Or, if thou art deſcended of a worſhipfull ſtocke, to growe in ſtomache by meanes of gentilitie. Neyther, if thou arte borne to any poſſeſſions, to thincke it a ſcorne by meanes of thy riches. For this hinders not ſo much thy ſelfe, but doth rather miniſter yll counſell to a number, and maketh them withdrawe their mindes from doing well, and to followe lewde example. For if thou be neuer ſo noble of birth, if thou once become a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, whatſoeuer thou do to thy maiſter aboue thy promiſe, if it tende to his profite and commoditie, is but thy bounden duetie. Againe, if ſuch a one which doth his duetie farre beyond his couenaunt, if for his labour he be not conſidered, in good faith he ſerues a ſimple maiſter. But be he aſſured, although he finde no rewarde on earth, his maiſter in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſhall largely yeld him double recompenſe.</p>
            <p>I neuer ſawe as yet, any in my life, for too much diligence employed to their maiſters, that did euer
<pb facs="tcp:5465:9"/>
want in their aged dayes: but many (the more is the pittie) I do knowe, for ſlacking their dueties, &amp; vntruſtie ſeruice, haue beggered their maiſters, who with a iuſt plague for their labour, haue béene rewarded according to their deſertes: whoſe eſtates at this preſent time are moſte miſerable to behold: wandering as outcaſtes amongeſt the froth and <note place="margin">Vntruſtie ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaunts, frothe and ſcomme of the people.</note> ſcomme of vnhappie people. What if thou diddeſt acquaint thy ſelfe to learne or practiſe all kinde of thinges touching the charge of houſekéeping, from the ſimple plowman vnto the ſuperior ſeruaunt? were this any diſgrace to thy calling? no certeinly, but rather a commoditie: for thou ſhalt gather ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by greate knowledge and vnderſtanding. For, what thing is more perfect then that, which we learne by experience? We may not thinke to liue alwayes in ſeruice, but at the laſt to haue houſe and familie of our owne: then the experience which we haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through our diligence, ſhall inſtruct vs the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what belongeth to the duetie of our owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes.</p>
            <p>And if ſo be thou art in credite with thy maiſter, that it pleaſeth him to make account of thée aboue <note place="margin">Pride &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine muſt be auoided.</note> the reſt of thy fellowes, be not therefore proude, &amp; diſdaine not thine inferiours, for ſo ſhalt thou haue manie enimies: but rather the more in credite, the more courteous. For, courteſie, is the only badge of a Gentleman and deſcendeth from nobilitie. Again, <note place="margin">Courteſie the cogniſance &amp; badge of a Gentleman.</note> gentle communication and friendly countenaunce, one to another, expelleth all rancour and malice, &amp; purchaſeth many friendes. Did not <hi>Antonius</hi> the luſtie gallant preferre <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the blacke Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian for her inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable courteſie before all the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtarres in the citie of <hi>Rome?</hi> It is the onely pathway to praiſe, and the brightneſſe thereof is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed
<pb facs="tcp:5465:10"/>
by pride and arrogancie. What is Honour, Wealth, Beautie, or braue Attire, without courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie? It is aſſuredly nothing elſe but a goodly gréene trée, which floriſheth with leaues and bloſſoms, and bringeth foorth no fruite.</p>
            <p>Some there are, which will ſtande highly vppon their reputation, for that they haue a reaſonable portion to leane vnto, and holdes it great ſcorne to aſſociate them ſelues with their fellowes of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our calling, being not of like abilitie: ſome againe, for their ſtocke and kindred. Such perſons as will growe hautie by meanes of their wealth (being the giftes of Fortune, which is vncerteine) abuſe the <note place="margin">Vanitie and follie to brag of kindred or of riches.</note> ſame. And ſuch which glorie in them ſelues by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their greate aliaunce, declare to be in them but méere fooliſhneſſe. Aſſure thy ſelfe of this, that if thou arte alied to manie, and yet haſt but fews friendes, what profiteth thée to boaſt of thy high birth? For, if thou haſt neuer ſo many kinſmen, and if thou doeſt not indeuour thy ſelfe ſome kinde of way to pleaſure them, their friendſhip towards thée in time of néede will become weake and verie ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and thou thy ſelfe little accompted of. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if thou viſiteſt them as a ſtraunger, muche welcome: but if thou accompt it as thy home, they will compare thée to a freſhe water fiſhe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept long, will ſauour and become lothfome: Euen ſo, if thou burden thy friendes otherwiſe then a gueſt ought to do, they will repine at thée. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neyther for birth or riches, be not diſdainfull, but the more courteous, if thou wilt be well thought of. For, haue we not read of Kings gouerning whole kingdomes, and other Nobles, with large reuenues liuing in all felicitie, haue abandoned their countries, and liued in moſte miſerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage?
<pb facs="tcp:5465:10"/>
Suche is the rewarde of thoſe that growe proude, and are vnthankful for that they haue. For <note place="margin">Fortune frau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dulent and faithleſſe.</note> it is commonly ſéene, that when Fortune ſmileth moſte on any mortall wight, then workes ſhée grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt deceipt. As ſhée hath pleaſure to raiſe meane perſons to credite and dignitie, ſo likewiſe taketh ſhée as great delight to throwe them downe into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</p>
            <p>Delight not to complaine of any of thy fellowes, <note place="margin">Complaints muſt be eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chewed.</note> to currie fauour and diſquiet thy maiſter: but after a friendly manner vſe gentle perſuaſions, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy fellowes haue neglected his duetie, tell him ſecreatly that it may be reformed. At thy mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters table haue great care and diligence, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners and beha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiour.</note> at ſuch time as there are many ſtraungers. Liſten not to euery tale that at the boord is recited: and if ſo be it miniſter occaſion of laughter, yet in any wiſe do thou refraine and kéepe ſilence.

For, what is better eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then that which is geaſon? And it is worthie double thankes, then if thou were required.</p>
            <p>When thou rideſt any iorney with thy maiſter, do not vſe to loyter farre behinde, and chiefly when he paſſeth through any towne or village: but while
<pb facs="tcp:5465:11"/>

            <p>When thou comeſt at night to thy Inne, haue care of thy maiſter, that his lodging may in any wiſe be ſwéete and cleanly, his ſhéetes white waſhed, and verie well ayred, his bootes ſée foorthwith made cleane and ſtuffed with ſtrawe in time of foule we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bring them vp to his chamber: ſée nothing be wanting when he riſeth next morning.

For this ſtandes in common regarde with all, rather to ſéeke to prolong our life, then increaſe our wealth. And the Souereigne delight, and the pleaſure of oure dayes, is the ſolace of life. This being vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly found moſt true and euident, that there is in vs ingraffed an earneſt and ardent affection of life,
<pb facs="tcp:5465:13"/>
and that life to them is founde moſte deare &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, who haue béene in perill of death: How ſhould I be addreſſed, or in what manner may I yelde all obſeruaunce to her, by whoſe petition and earneſt ſuite, I haue auoided the terrour of death? Uerily, it is not in my ſlender capacitie to diſcloſe the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that aunſwers your deſert, the inſufficiencie and baſeneſſe of the one, is ſo much inferior to the other, <note place="margin">Deſert excee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding duetie.</note> in the excéeding greatneſſe and goodneſſe.

For this, by peruſing wittie and profound diſcourſes of Philoſophers, I learne: that albeit aduerſitie hath power to vexe and trouble the condition of mortall men: yet it hath no power to chaunge the conſtancie and courage of a valiant and puiſſant minde, which in all reſolutions and chaunges of times, reteines one firme and vnmoueable vertue: Euen as a trée which being well rooted, although it be ſhaken with many violent windes, yet in his firme there is no power to ſupplant him. We through aduerſitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come humble, wiſe, and perfect: and the offender is better reformed by the proofe of afflictions, then by any other meanes: for, knowing them to be the meſſengers of God, he debateth not the griefes he féeleth, but calleth his owne conſcience to a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <note place="margin">Afflictions are the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers of God.</note> he glorifieth him ſelfe in tribulation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that tribulation brings patience, patience brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des experience, experience raiſeth hope, hope thus wrought and couched, cannot be confounded.

And ſuch as neuer haue felt perplexitie, can little iudge of the worthines of patience. Wherefore (deare father) miſlike not of that which in the ende brings true and perfect felicitie.

vntaught, and vncourteous fellowe.

And it is not only a fault to dooe ſuch things, but againſt good maner, by any act or ſigne to put a man in minde of them.</hi> And therefore, it is an ilfauoured faſhion, that ſome men vſe, openly to thruſt their hands in what parte of their bodye they lyſt.</p>
            <p>Lykwiſe, I like it as yll to ſee a Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fettle him ſelfe, to do the needes of Nature, in preſence of men: And after he hath doone, to truſſe him ſelfe againe before them. Neither

And by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is no good maner, when a man chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to ſee, as he paſſeth the waye (as many times it happeneth) a lotheſome thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to caſt his ſtomacke, to tourne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the company, &amp; ſhewe it them. And much worſe I like it, to reache ſome ſtynking thing vnto a man to ſmell vnto it: as it is many a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> importunate meanes, yea, thruſting it vnto their noſe, ſaying: <hi>Foh, feele I pray you, hovv this doth ſtink. vvhere they ſhould rather ſay, ſmell not vnto it: for it hath an yll ſent.</hi> And as theſe and lyke faſhions offend the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to which they appertaine: ſo to grynde the teethe, to whiſtle, to make pityfull cryes, to rubb ſharpe ſtones together, and to fyle vppon Iron, do muche offend the Eares and would be lefte in any caſe. Neither muſt wee refraine thoſe things alone, but we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beware we do not ſyng, and ſpecialy alone, if we haue an vntuneable voyce, which is a common fault with moſte men: And yet, hee that is of nature leaſt apt vnto it, doth vſe it

And yet ſuch, with open mouth wil euer ſay and do what they liſt, and make ſuch noyſe, or rather ſuchroaring, as the dumme man doth, when he ſtriueth with him ſelfe to ſpeake.

ouer much pompe and coſt, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient entertainement and meaſure, ſuch as beſemed well a man of the Clergie.

And bycauſe they found him a Noble gentleman, courteous and well beſeene in all good behauiour, they prayſed him muche, and made muche of him, ſaue that one vnmanerly faſhion they muche miſliked in him. When the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was aduertiſed of it, conſulting with ſome of his familiars about it (as he was a wiſe man in all his doings) ſtraite they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Now what ſhal we thinke this Biſhop, his modeſt and honeſt company about him would ſay, if they ſawe theſe whome wee <note place="margin">Greedy feeding.</note> ſee other while, (like ſwyne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their ſnouts in the waſhe, all begroined) neuer lyft vp their heads nor looke vp, and muche leſſe keepe their hands from the meate, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

both their cheeks blowne (as if they ſhould ſound a trumpet, or blowe the fyer) not eate but rauon: whoe, beſmearing their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, almoſt vp to their elbowes, ſo bedawbe <note place="margin">Fyling the napkyns.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> napkyns, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cloathes in the places of eaſement, be other while cleaner. And to mend theſe ſlouenly maners, be not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, many tymes with theſe filthy nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns, to wype awaye the ſweat that trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and falleth downe their browes, their face and their necke (they be ſuch greedy <note place="margin">Sweating with feeding.</note> guts in their feeding) and otherwhile to, (when it comes vppon them) ſpare not to ſnot their ſniueld noſe vppon them. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe beaſtly behauiours and faſhions, deſerue not alone, to be thruſt out of this noble biſhops houſe, that was ſo pure and cleane: but to be throughly baniſhed all places, where any honeſt men ſhould com. Let a man then take hede, hee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe his fyngers ſo deepe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he befyle the napkins to much: for it is an yll ſight to ſee it: neither is it good maner, to rubbe your greſie fingers vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread you muſt eate.</p>
            <p>The ſeruaunts that bee appointed to waite vppon the table, muſt not (in any wiſe) ſcratche and rubbe their heades, nor <note place="margin">Precepts for ſeruaunts.</note> any parte els in the ſight of their Lorde &amp; Maſter: nor thruſt their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in any thoſe

partes of their body that be couered, no not ſo muche as make any proffer: as ſome careles fellowes doo, holding their hands in their boſome, or caſt vnder the flappes of their coates behind them. But they muſt beare them abroade without any ſuſpicion and keepe them (in any caſe) waſht &amp; cleane without any ſpot of durt vppon them. And they that cary the dyſhes, or reache the cup, muſt beware at that time, they doe not ſpit, coughe or neeſe: for in ſuch doings, <hi>Suſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as greate, and offendeth aſmuche, as the very deede it ſelfe:</hi> and therefore, ſeruants muſt forſee, they geue no cauſe to Maiſters to ſuſpect: For that which might chaunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyeth aſmuche, as if it had chaunced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</p>
            <p>And if thou do roaſte any fruite, or make a toaſte at the fyer, thou muſt not blowe of the aſhes, (if there be any) for it is an old ſaying, that, <hi>vvinde vvas neuer vvithout wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> But y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> muſt lyghtly ſtryke it vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the the plate, or after ſome ſuche ſorte or other beate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſhes. Thou ſhalt not offer thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dkerchiefe to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe it, albeit, it be very cleane waſhed: for he to whome thou doeſt offer it, can not (perhaps) awaye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it, and may be to curious to take it.</p>
            <p>When a man talketh with one, it is no <note place="margin">Breithing in a mans face.</note>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:5465:32"/>
good maner to come ſo neere, that he muſt needes breathe in his face: for there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that can not abyde to feele the ayer of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans breathe, albeit there come no yll fauour from him. Theſe and lyke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, be very vnſemely, and would be eſchewed, becauſe their ſenſes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whome we acquaint our ſelues, cannot brooke nor beare them.</p>
            <p>Now, let vs ſpeake of thoſe things which (without any hurt or anoyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) offende the minds of moſt men, before whome they be doone. You ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>The appetites of men, (throughe a naturall inſtinct and inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) be verie ſtrange and diuers:</hi> Some be cholerike &amp; haſty, &amp; may not be ſatifſied with out reuenge: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe giue them ſelues cleane ouer, to pamper the belly: this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſets his delighte in luſt and ſenſualitie: that man is carried away with his couetous deſires: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuche appetites more there are, to which mans mynde is too ſubiect: but you ſhall not in any company, eaſily iudge or diſcerne betweene them, where and in what, they bee moſte affected. For, theſe matters doe not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in the maners, the faſhions and ſpeache of men: but reſt in ſome other point. They ſeeke to purchaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:5465:33"/>
which the benefit of mutuall conferrence may yeald them, &amp; that doe (as I weene) good will, honour, comforte and pleaſure, or ſome other thing lyke vnto theſe: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt neither ſay or doe the thing, that may giue any ſigne of litle louing or eſteming them, we liue withall.</p>
            <p>So that, it is a rude faſhion, (in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſom men vſe, to lye lolling a ſleepe in that place, where honeſt men be met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of purpoſe to talke. For his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhewes that he doth not eſteeme the company, and little rekoneth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or their talke. And more then that, he that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth (and ſpecially lying at litle eaſe, as he muſt) wonts (for the moſte parte) to doe ſome fowle thing, to beholde, or heare: and many tymes they awake ſweating and driueling at the mouth. And in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to riſe vp where other men doe ſit and talke, and to walke vp and downe the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is no poynt of good maner. Alſo there be ſome that ſo buſkell them ſelues, reache, ſtreatch and yawne, writhing now one ſyde, and then another, that a man would weene, they had ſome feuer vppon them: A manifeſt ſigne, that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they keepe, doth weary them.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe doe they very yll, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:5465:33"/>
pull out a letter out of theyr pocket, to reade it: as if they had greate matters of charge, and affaires of the common weale committed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But they are much more to bee blamed, that pull out theyr knyues or their ſciſers, and doe nothing els but pare their nayles, as if they made no account at all of the company, and would ſeeke ſome other ſolace to paſſe the time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. Theis faſhions to, muſt be left, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome men vſe, to ſing betwene the teeth, or playe the dromme with their fingers, or ſho ofle their feete: For theſe demeanours ſhewe that a body is careleſſe of any man ells.</p>
            <p>Beſides, let not a man ſo ſit that he turne his tayle to him that ſitteth next to him: nor lye fottering with one legg ſo hygh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the other, that a man may ſee all bare that his cloathes would couer. For ſuch parts be neuer playde, but amongſt thoſe to whome a man needs vſe no reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. It is very true, that if a gentleman ſhould vſe theſe faſhions before his ſeruants, or in the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſome friende of meaner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then him ſelfe: it would betoken no pride, but a loue and familiaritie.</p>
            <p>Let a man ſtand vppright of him ſelfé, and not leane or loll vppon another mans
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5465:34"/>
ſhoulder: and when he talketh, let him not pounche his fellow with his elbowe, (as many be wont to doe) at euery worde they ſpeake, ſaying: <hi>Did not I ſay true Sirra. Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. N. It is Maſter. H.</hi> And ſtill they be iot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with their elbowe.</p>
            <p>I would haue euery man well appare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <note place="margin">Apparell.</note> meete for his age and calling: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they ſeeme to haue men in contempt that be better attyred then themſelues.</p>
            <p>And therfore the Citizens of <hi>Padua,</hi> were woont to take it done of ſpighte vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when any gentleman of <hi>Venice</hi> walked vp &amp; downe their citie in his coate, as though he thought him ſelfe in the countrey. And a mans apparell, would not be made of fine cloathe alone: but he muſt frame it, all that he may, to the faſhions that other men weare, and ſuffer him ſelfe to bee lead by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe: although (perchaunce) it be, and ſeeme to be leſſe commodious, leſſe gallant, and leſſe faire in ſhewe, then his oulde.</p>
            <p>And if all men els, doe weare their heads powled: it ſhalbe an yll ſight for thee alone, to weare a longe buſhe of haire. And where other men, make muche of their beardes and weare them longe: thou ſhalt not doe well to cut thine of, or ſhaue

it. For that weare to be ouerthwarte in euery thing: which thou muſt (in any caſe) beware of, except neceſſitie require it, as thou ſhalt heare hereafter. For this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie, beyond all other yll cuſtomes, makes vs generally ſpyted of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thou muſt not then go againſt common cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome in theſe things, but vſe them meaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably: that thou maiſt not bee an odd man a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone in a countrey: that ſhall weare a long Gowne downe to the foote, where other men weare them very ſhorte, litle beneath the waſte. For as it hapens to him, that hath a very crabbed ylfauoured face, (I meane ſuche, as is more harde and ſower the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt mennes be, for nature doth moſtly ſhape them well in moſte men) that men will wonder and (with a kinde of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) gape moſt vppon him: So fares it with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that attire them ſelues, not as moſt men doe: but as they are egged by their owne fantaſticall heads, with lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g heare ſpred downe to their ſhoulders, their beardes ſhort and ſhauen, and weare quaiues or greate cappes after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Flaundres</hi> faſhion: that all men doe gaze vppon them, as wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering at ſuche, whome they weene haue taken vppon them, to conquer all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5465:35"/>
countries whereſoeuer they come. Let your apparell then, be very well made, and fit for your body: for they that weare rich and coaſtly garments, but ſo illfauouredly ſhaped, that a man would weene the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure had byn taken by another: geue vs to iudge one of theſe twaine, that eyther they haue no regarde or conſideration how to pleaſe or diſpleaſe: or els haue no ſkill to iudge of meaſure or grace, or what doth become them.</p>
            <p>Such maner of people, with their rude behauiours and faſhions, make men with whome they liue, ſuſpect, they doe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme them but light. And that cauſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe welcome wherſoeuer they com and yll beloued amongeſt men.</p>
            <p>But there be ſome beſides theſe, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue more then bare ſuſpicion: their deeds and their doings be ſo intollerable, that a man cannot abide to liue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them by any meanes. For they be euer a let, a hurt and a trouble to all the companie, they be neuer redie: euer a trimming: neuer well dreſſed to their mindes. But when men be readie to ſit downe to the table, the meate at the boorde, and their handes waſhed: then they muſt write or make <note place="margin">Table.</note>

water, or haue their exerciſe to doe: ſaying, <hi>It is too early: vve myght haue taryed a vvhile: vvhat haſte is this, this morning?</hi> And thus they diſquiet all the company, as men, caring for them ſelues alone &amp; theyr owne matters, without conſideration in the worlde of other men. Beſides this, they will in all things be preferred aboue others: they muſt haue the beſt bed, and beſt chamber: they muſt take vppon them the higheſt place at the table, and be firſt ſet and ſerued of all men. And they be ſo deintie and nice, that nothing pleaſeth them, but what they them ſelues deuiſe: they make a ſower face at any thing ells. And they be ſo proude minded, that they looke that men ſhould waite vppon them when they dyne, ryde, ſporte, or ſolace them ſelues.</p>
            <p>There be other ſo furious, teſtie &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, that nothing you doe can pleaſe them: and what ſoeuer is ſaid they aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in choler, and neuer leaue brauling w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their ſeruants, and rayling at them, and continually diſturbe the company with their vnquietnes: vſing ſuch ſpeeches: <hi>Thou cauledſt me vvell vp this morning.

For, albeit a mans minde were full fraught with all humilitie, and would vſe theſe maners, not vppon pride or diſdaine, but vppon a reche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe care, not heeding his doings, or elles by meanes of yll cuſtome: yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>It is not long, ſynce there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a worthy gentleman, of ſingular good witt and profound learning, whoſe name was <hi>Vbaldino Bandinelli.</hi> This gentleman was <note place="margin">Vbaldino Bandinelli.</note> woont to ſay, that as ofte as hee went or came from the Courte, although the ſtretes weare euer full of gallant Courtiers, of Prelates and Noble men, and likewiſe of poore men, and people of meane and baſe condition: yet he thought he neuer encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred any, that was eyther better or worſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5465:36"/>
then himſelfe. And without doubte hee could meete with fewe, that might bee compared in goodnes to him: reſpecting his vertues, that did excel beyond meaſure. But we muſt not alwayes in theſe things meaſure men by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Elne: We muſt rather waye them in the millers ſcoles, then in the goldſmythes balaunce. And it is a courtious parte, redily to receaue them in to fauour: not bycauſe they bee woorthe it: but as men doe with coynes, bycauſe they be currant,</p>
            <p>To go further, wee muſt doe nothing in their ſyght whome wee deſire to pleaſe, that may ſhewe wee couet, rather to rule and to reigne, then to liue in a familiar equalitie amongeſt them. For hautines of harte and ambitious diſpoſition, as it kindleth an yll opinion: ſo it miniſtreth muche cauſe of contempte, which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will ſo woorke againſt thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhalt bee cleane caſt out of honeſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But our dooings muſt rather beare a <note place="margin">A lowly minde.</note> ſigne and ſhewe of reuerence, meekenes, &amp; reſpect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> company, in which wee fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip our ſelues. So that, what ſo euer is doone in meete and conuenient time, may hapely deſerue no blame: but yet in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the place and the perſone, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5465:37"/>
may be reproued well: althoughe for it ſelf, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter deſerue no rebuke. As to brawle and to raile at your ſeruaunts (which we haue talked of before) but muche more to beate them. Becauſe theſe partes, are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as to reigne and to rule: which no honeſt and ciuil gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyll vſe, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of them he doth reſpect with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence or courteſie. Beſydes this, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is muche offended with it, and their meetinges are broken, and eſpecially, if it be done at the table, which is a place of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and myrthe, and not of brawle and ſcolding. So that I muſt nedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend <hi>Currado Gianfigliazzi</hi> for his ciuil behauiour in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he multiplied no words with <hi>Chichibio</hi>

            <p>But to returne to our matter: it is not good for a man to chide at the table for any cauſe. And if thou be angrie, ſhew it not, <note place="margin">Chiding at the Table.</note> nor make no ſigne of thy greefe, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I haue tolde thee, and ſpecially yf thou
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5465:37"/>
haue ſtraungers with thee: becauſe thou haſte called them to be merry, and this wil make them ſad. For, as the ſharpe and tarte things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other men doe feede vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thy ſight, doe ſet thy teeth likewiſe on edge: ſo to ſee other men vexed and out of quiet, it maketh vs vnquiet too. I call them <hi>FROMVVARD</hi> people, which will in all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things <note place="margin">Fromewarde.</note> be ouertwhart to other men: as the very worde it ſelfe doth ſhewe. For, <hi>Fromewarde,</hi> ſignifieth aſmuche, as <hi>Shorne againſt the wooll.</hi> Now, how fit a thinge this frowardnes is, to wyn the good will <note place="margin">Frowardenes.</note> of men, and cauſe men to wyſhe well vnto them: that you your ſelf may eaſily Iudge, in that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in ouertwharting other mens deſiers: which qualitie neuer mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth friendſhip, but maketh friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come foes. And therfor let them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be well thought of and welcome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, endeuour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to ſhunne this fault: For it breedes no good lyking nor loue, but hatred and hurt. I would councell you rather to meaſure your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by other mens willes: where there ſhal come no hurt nor ſhame of it: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alwayes to doe &amp; to ſaye, more to pleaſe other mens myndes and fauſies, then your owne.</p>

Agayne, you muſt be neither clowniſhe <note place="margin">Clowniſhe and Lampiſhe</note> nor lumpiſhe: but pleaſaunt and familiar. For there ſhould bee no oddes, betweene the <hi>Myſtell</hi> and the <hi>Pungitopo:</hi> but that the one is wilde: the other growes in gardens. And you muſt vnderſtand, that he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt and courteous: whoſe manners bee ſuche in his common behauiour, as practiſe to keepe, and maintaine him friendeſhip amongſt them: where hee that is ſolleyne and waywarde, makes him ſelfe a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherſoeuer hee comes: a ſtraunger, I meane, aſmuch as a forreigne or alie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne: where contrariwiſe, he that is familiar &amp; gentle, in what place ſo euer he comes: is taken for a familiar and friend with all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that it ſhalbe neceſſarie for a man, to vſe him ſelfe to ſalute, to ſpeake, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer after a gentle ſorte, and to behaue him ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all men ſo: as if hee were their countryman borne, &amp; of their olde acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Which ſome can yll ſkill to doe, that neither giue a man a good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce: eaſily ſay, No, to all things: neuer take in good worthe, the honour and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie that men doe vnto them (like to the people I ſpake of before, rude and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) neuer take delight in any pleaſaunt conceites or other pleaſures: but euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5465:38"/>
it all, what ſoeuer is preſented or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them. If a man ſay: <hi>Sir, ſuche a one willed me to commend him vnto you:</hi> They aunſwere ſtraite: <hi>vvhat haue I too doe vvith his greetings?</hi> And if a man ſay: <hi>Sir, ſuche a one your friend, aſked me hovv you did:</hi> They au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer againe in choler: <hi>Let him come feele my pulſe.</hi> Theſe carterlyke and clowniſhe aunſwers and maners, and the men them ſelues that doe vſe them: would bee chaſed and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted away, out of all good and honeſt company.</p>
            <p>It yll becomes a man when hee is in <note place="margin">Muſcing.</note> company, to bee ſad, muſing, and full of contemplation. And albeit, it may bee ſuffered perchaunce in them that haue long beaten their braines in theſe <hi>Mathematicall</hi> ſtudies: which are called (as I take it) the <hi>Liberall Artes:</hi> yet without doubte it may not be borne in other men.

            <p>Againe, to bee to nyce or to deyntie: it <note place="margin">Nycenes and Deyntines.</note> may not be abiden, and ſpecially in men. For, to liue with ſuche kinde of people: is rather a ſlauerie then pleaſure. And ſure there bee ſom ſuch, ſo ſofte &amp; tender: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to liue

and deale with ſuch people, it is as daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: as to medle with the fyneſt and brytteleſt glaſſe that may be: So muche they are affrayde of euery light touche. And they wilbe as teſty and frowarde, if you doe not quickly and readily ſalute them, viſite them, worſhip them, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwer: as ſome other body would be, for the greateſt iniurie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be donne vnto them. And if you doe not giue them all the due reuerence that may be: they will preſently take a thouſand occaſions to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and fall out with you. Yf you chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to <hi>Maſter</hi> him, and leaue out his title of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or worſhip:</hi> he takes that in dougeon, and thinkes you doe mock him. And if you ſet him beneath as good a man as him ſelf at the table: that is againſt his honour. If you doe not viſite him at home at his houſe: then you knowe not your dutie. Theis maner of faſhions and behauiours, bring men to ſuch ſcorne and diſdayne of their doings: that there is no man, almoſt, can abyde to beholde them: for they loue them ſelues to farre beyonde meaſure, and buſie them ſelues ſo much in that, that they fynde litle leyſure to bethinke them ſelues to loue any other: which (as I haue ſaide from the beginning) men ſeeke to fynde in

the conditions and maners of thoſe with whome they muſt liue: I meane, that they ſhould apply them ſelues to the fanſies &amp; mindes of their friendes. But to liue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuche people, ſo hard to pleaſe: whoſe loue and friendſhip once wonne, is as eaſie loſt, as a fyne ſcarfe is lightly caryed away with the winde: that is no lyfe but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: and, beſydes that it yealdeth no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it geues a man greate diſdayne and horror.

foolyſhe things, as moſt tymes men haue. Albeit I haue heard ſay many times, that wiſemen in times paſt, haue leaft in their bookes many ſortes of dreames, conteining matters of deepe knowledge and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But amongeſt them all ther vvas one verye ſmall glaſſe, full to the

toppe of verie cleare vvater, vvhich many did ſmell to, but no man vvould taſte. He ſtoode not there long, but there came in a tall man, an aged and very graue man, to looke vnto. This Aged father beholding this vnfortunate Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries boxes and pottes, and finding ſome emptyed, ſome ouerthrowne, and the better parte broken: at lenght caſting his eye aſyde, he chaunced to ſee the ſmal glaſſe I ſpake of before, and ſetting the ſame to his mouthe, hee dranke it vp ſo cleane: that he leaft not one droppe. And this doone, he went from thence as the reſt did before. Maſter Flaminio vvas abashed and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled muche at this matter. And therefore turning to the Apothecarie he ſayed vnto him: Syr, whoe is this that came laſte? and why did he drinke vp ſo ſauourly, all the vvater in that litle glaſſe, vvhich all the reaſt refuſed. To vvhome the Apothecarie ſeemed to make this aunſvver. My ſonne, this is the Lord God.

            <p>Such kind of dreames, I hould well a man may rehearſe, and heare with much pleaſure and profit. Bycauſe they doe more reſemble, the Cogitations &amp; thoughts of an awakened minde: or better, I

            <p>And albeit a man would weene, there can bee nothing in the worlde more vaine then <hi>Dreames:</hi> yet there is one thing more light then they, and that are <hi>Lyes. For there</hi>

minding any yll purpoſe in it, or to make their owne peculiar proffit by it, to hurt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men or ſhame their neighbour: onely they doe it, for a pleaſure they take to tell a lye: as men that drinke not, all for thirſt: but for a pleaſure they take, to taſte of the wine. Other ſome doe tell lyes, to make a vaine glorious boaſting of them ſelues: vaunting and telling in a brauery, what wonderfull exploits they haue doone, or bearing men in hand, they be greate doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and learned men.</p>
            <p>In Silence too, after a ſorte, without ſpeache, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may tell a leſynge: I meane <note place="margin">Lefinges and Countreſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges.</note> with his geſtures and grace: as ſome you ſhall ſee, that being of meane, or rather baſe condition and calling, vſe ſuche a ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in all their doings, and marche ſo ſtately, and ſpeake with ſuche a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, or rather diſcourſe lyke Parleament men, ſetteling them ſelues, as it were, in a place of Iudgement, proudly prying about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like Peacockes: that it is a very death to behold them.</p>
            <p>And ſome ſuche you ſhall fynde, that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee combered with no more wealthe then eaſily ſerues their turne: yet will they neuer appeare vnles their neckes be laden with chaines, their fingers full of

For in ſuche caſe, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would weene, they ſeeke, either to contend with the Company, (if they be, or will take vppon them to bee, as good Gentlemen, &amp; of as muche wealthe and worthines, as they bee:) or elles to ouercrowe them, (if they liue in meaner condition and calling,

then they doe) And as it were to vpbraide them, their poore and baſe condition of life.</p>
            <p>A man muſt neither embaſe, nor exalte him ſelfe to muche out of meaſure: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Exalting and embaſing.</note> bury in ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſome parte of his merits, then arrogate to muche vnto him.

And, to contemne the honour &amp; renowne, which other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gape for ſo much, is but to glorie and magnifie him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other.

hee be ſuche, as hathe plenty and ſtore of thoſe deare and deintye things.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt not boaſt of thoſe good things that be in vs, nor ſet them to lyght: for in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one, wee doe vpbraide men their faults: In the other, wee ſcorne to muche their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. But it behoueth euery man to ſpeake his owne praiſe, as litle as hee may. And if occaſion driue him vnto it: it ſhalbe good, modeſtly to ſpeake the truethe, as I haue told you before.</p>
            <p>And therefore, they that deſire to doe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a pleaſure: muſt needes leaue one faulte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to common with all men: they muſt not ſhewe them ſelues ſo afraide and fearefull to ſpeake their mindes, when a man dothe aſke their aduiſe.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5465:45"/>
bycauſe they cannot get out of theſe proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, when they bee in.</p>
            <p>They bee alſo very tedious to men, and their conuerſation &amp; maners are very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome: whoe ſhewe too baſe and abiect a minde in their doings. And where the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and higheſt place, is apparantly due <note place="margin">Abiecte Minde.</note> vnto them: they will euer creepe downe to the loweſt. And it is a ſpitefull buiſynes to thruſt them vp: For they will ſtraite iogge backe againe, like a reſty Iade, or a Nagge that ſtartleth a ſide at his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe. So that, there is muche a dooe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, when wee meete at a doore. For they will not (for all you can dooe) in any caſe enter before you, but ſo trauerſe their ground, go backe, and ſo fray and defend with their armes and their handes: that at euery thirde ſteppe, a man muſt be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to wage battell with them: and thus they breake of, all ſolace and pleaſure, and otherwhile, the buiſynes they meete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute.</p>
            <p>And therfore, <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which wee name, as you heare, by a ſtraunge terme, as <note place="margin">Ceremonies.</note> lacking a worde of our owne, bycauſe our elders, hauing no knowledge of thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious faſhions, coulde not well giue them a proper name. <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> I ſaye,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5465:45"/>
(in my Iudgement,) differ not much from lyes &amp; dreames, for their own very vaineſſe it ſelfe. So that wee may couple and ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together in this our treatiſe, ſithe occaſion ſerues ſo fytt to ſpeake of them here, As a good man hath often ſhewed me: thoſe ſolemnities that church men doe vſe at their Altars, and in their diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice bothe to God and his holy things, are properly called <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> but after, men did begyn, to reuerence eche other with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious entertaynements, more then were conuenient, and would be called maſters and Lords, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them ſelues, yealding bending, and bowing their bodyes, in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reuerence one to another, vncouering their heads, vſing highe titles and Styles of honour, and kyſſing their hands as if they were hollye things: ſome body, by like conſidering all theſe things well, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe newe founde curious follyes without any name: thought good to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and call them <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but ſure in a ieſt as I take it: as to be mery and make good cheare, we terme it in ſport, a triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph: which cuſtome, no doubt, tooke not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at vs, but elles where, as barbarous &amp; ſtraunge: and not long ſince, from whence I knowe not, tranſported into <hi>Italie:</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:5465:46"/>
whoſe deedes being wretched, and effects baſe and vile, hath gotten encreaſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, in vayne woords alone, and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous titles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ceremonies</hi> then, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider well theie inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that vſe them: are but vaine ſhewes of honour and reuerence, towardes him to whome they be doone: framed of ſemblance and wordes touching their titles and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious offers. I ſay vaine: In that we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their face, whome we reuerence not in deede, but otherwhile co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne. And neuertheles, becauſe we may not go agaiſt cuſtome, wee giue them theſe titles: <hi>The moſt honorable Lord ſuche a one: the Noble Lord ſuche a one.</hi> And ſo otherwhile wee offer them our humble ſeruice: whome wee could better vnſerue then ſerue, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund then doe them any duety.</p>
            <p>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not <hi>Leſinges</hi> alone, but alſo <hi>Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Treaſons,</hi> ſhalbe called <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> But becauſe theſe wordes and theſe titles aboue reherſed, haue loſt their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth: and waſte, (as a man may ſay of Iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch continuall occupying of it as we doe vſe: we muſt not ſo preciſely way them as other wordes, nor ſo ſtrictly conſtrue the meaning of them. And, that this is true, that which allwayes happens to all men,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5465:46"/>
dothe ſhewe it playne inoughe. For if wee meete with a man, we neuer ſawe before: with whome, vppon ſome occaſion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houes vs to talke: without examining wel his worthines, moſt commonly, that wee may not offend in to litle, we giue him to much, and call him <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while <hi>Sir,</hi> althoughe he be but ſome <hi>Souter</hi> or <hi>Barbar,</hi> or other ſuche ſtuffe: and all by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is appareled neate, ſomewhat gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman lyke.</p>
            <p>And as men in tymes paſt, were wont to <note place="margin">Titles by Priuilege.</note> haue vnder the <hi>Priuilege</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> peculiar &amp; diſtinct titles of honour, which might not be vntouched, without doing wrong to the priuileged men: nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine attributed &amp; geuen without a ſcorne, to them that were no ſuch priuileged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones: So at this daie, wee muſt more freely vſe thoſe titles, and the other ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of honour, like to thoſe titles: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Cuſtome the mightieſt Lorde</hi> hathe largely therewith, priuileged men of our time.</p>
            <p>This vſe and cuſtome, though ſo fayre and gallant without, is altogether vaine within, and conſiſteth in ſemblance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, &amp; in wordes without meaning.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:5465:47"/>
But this notwithſtanding, it is not lawful <note place="margin">Cuſtom muſt not be altered</note> for vs to chaunge it: but rather, bycauſe it is not our fault, but the fault of our tyme, wee are bounde to followe it: but yet wee muſt diſcretely doe it.</p>
            <p>So that wee are to noate, that <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The end why ceremonies be vſed.

            </p>
            <p>And this is a common fault with flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that counterfet them ſelues to be our friendes, and apply them ſelues euer to our deſiers, what ſoeuer they be: not bycauſe wee would haue it ſo, but to the ende wee ſhould doe them ſome pleaſure, for it. And this is not to pleaſe vs, but to deceiue vs. And albeit this kind of fault be, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reaſon of cuſtome ſufferable: yet notwithſtanding bycauſe of it ſelfe, it is fowle and hurtefull, it yll becomes a gentle man to doe it. <hi>For it is no honeſtie to ſeeke a pleaſure by the hurt of another.</hi> And if lyes and falſe flatteries, may bee termed <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> (as I haue ſayde before:) ſo oft, as we vſe them for reſpect of our gain &amp; profit: ſo oft wee doe hazard our good name and credite: ſo that this conſideration alone,

            <p>It reſteth now that I ſpeake of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <note place="margin">Cuſtome is a lawe.</note> (as I ſaid) <hi>and would be taken for a lawe,</hi> in theſe caſes.

            <p>And although the tymes paſt, and other countryes, haue vſed other maners: let vs yet, keepe our ſelues to our owne: And let not vs diſpute the matter, which is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oftwaine. For wee muſt obſerue, not

            <p>So that <hi>It behoues vs, hedefully to marke the doings and ſpeache, wherewith daily prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe and cuſtome, wonteth to receaue, ſalute, &amp; name in our owne country, all ſortes and kinds</hi>

            <p>Neyther be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſelf ſame <hi>Ceremonies</hi> ſeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reſpecting their Age: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ould me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe vſe together. Nor yet can it becom men of meane and baſe condition, to vſe the very ſame, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; greate men may vſe one to another. And if wee marke it well, we ſhall find, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the greateſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt men, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of moſt valour, doe not alwayes vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt <hi>Ceremonies</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, nor yet loue nor looke a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould make many goodly curtſies vnto them, as men that can ill ſpend their thoughts one matters ſo vaine.</p>
            <p>Neither muſt handy crafts men, nor me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of baſe condition, buiſie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to much, in ouer ſolemne <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to greate men, and Lordes: it is not lookt for in ſuche. For they diſdaine them, more then allowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe it ſeemes that in ſuch, they ſeeke &amp; looke, rather for obedience and duetie, then honour. And therefore it is a foule faulte in a ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to offer his maſter his ſeruice: for he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts it his ſhame, &amp; he thinks the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doth make a doubt, whether he is maſter or no: as if it were not in him to imploy him, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him too. Theſe kinde of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> would be vſed frankely. For, <hi>VVhat a man dothe of duetie, is taken for a debte,</hi> and hee finds him ſelfe litle beholding to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5465:51"/>
him that doth it. But he that dothe more, then he is bound to: it ſeemes he parteth with ſomewhat, and that makes men to loue him, and to commende him for a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man. And I remember mee well, I haue hearde it ſayde, that a worthy <hi>Graecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> a greate verſifier, was euer wont to ſaye: that <hi>He that could ſkill to entertaine men with a ſmall aduenture, made a greate gayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſhall then vſe youre <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as the tailer ſhapes his garments, rather to large then to litle: but yet not ſo, that hee cutteth one hoſe large inough to make a cloke. And if thou doe vſe in this point, ſome litle gentle behauiour, to ſuche as be meaner then thy ſelfe: thou ſhalt be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lowly. And if thou doe aſmuche to thy betters: thou ſhalt bee ſayde a Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well taught, and courtious. But hee that dothe her in to muche, and is ouer lauiſhe, <note place="margin">Vanitie.</note> ſhalbe blamed as vaine and light: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps worſe thought of too: counted a buſie body, a fidging fellowe, and in wiſe mens ſight, a flatterer: which vice, our elders haue called, (if I doe not forget me) dowble diligence. And there is no faulte in the worlde, more to bee abhorred, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worſſe beſeemes a gentleman, then this. And this is the thirde maner of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5465:51"/>
ſimply procedeth of our owne will, and not of cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> (as I haue alwayes ſayd) were not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by nature, but a man might doe well inough without them: As for example, our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie liued (it is not long ſince) in maner cleane without any. But other mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes haue infected vs, with theſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and many mo. So that, cuſtome and vſe obſerued: the reſt that is more, is but waſte: and ſuch a ſufferable leeſing, as if it be more in deede then is in vſe, it is not only vnſufferable, but forbidden: and ſo vppon, the matter, a cold and vnſauourie thing to noble mindes, that cannot brouſe vppon ſhrubbes and ſhewes.</p>
            <p>And you ſhall vnderſtand, that truſting my owne ſkill but little, in wryting this preſent treatiſe: I thought good to conſult with many, and to take the Iudgement of better learned men then my ſelfe. And this in my reading I finde. There was a King, they call him <hi>Oedipus:</hi> being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <note place="margin">Oedipus.</note> and driuen out of his countrie (vppon what occaſion I know not) he fled to King <hi>Theſeus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> the better to ſaue him ſelfe and his life, from his enemies, that <note place="margin">Theſeus.</note> mainely purſued him. This <hi>Oedipus</hi> now
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5465:52"/>
comming before the preſence of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> by good chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hearing his daughter ſpeake, (whome he knew by her voice, for he was blind and could not beholde her with his eyes) he was ſo preſently ſtriken with ioy, that, not tarying to doe his allegeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and duetie to the King, he did preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly embrace, &amp; make much of his daughter before him: his fatherly affection ſo led him, and rulde him ſo. But in the end finding his fault, and better aduiſing him ſelfe of his doings: he would needs excuſe it to <hi>Theſeus,</hi> &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prayd his grace to pardon his folly. The good and wiſe King, cut of his talke, and bad him leaue his excuſes, and thus ſaide vnto him: <hi>Comfort thy ſelfe Oedipus, and bee not diſmayd at that thou haſt done. For I will not haue my life honoured with other mens woordes, but with my owne deedes.</hi> Which ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a man ſhould haue alwaies in mind.</p>
            <p>And albeit men be well pleaſed, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe giue them worſhip &amp; honour: yet when they find them ſelues cuningly courted, they be ſoone weary of it, and alſo diſdaine it. For theſe glauerings, or flatteries I ſhould ſay, to amend their knaueries &amp; falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoodes, haue this fault withall: that theſe glauering fellowes doe plainly ſhewe, they count him, whome they court in this ſorte,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5465:52"/>
but a vaine, and arrogant bodie, an aſſe of groſe capacitie, and ſo ſimple, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould be an eaſie matter to bayte him and take him too. And theſe <hi>Vaine and Curious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, beſides that they be ſuperfluous: ſo they beare with all a shape of flattery,</hi> ſo ſlenderly co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered, that euery man doth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſee them, and know them plaine: in ſuche ſorte, that they that doe them, to the end to make a gaine, beſides that ill that is in them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake before: ſhewe them ſelues alſo, gentlemen ill taught, without good maner or any honeſt faſhion.</p>
            <p>But there is another ſorte of <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> people, who make it an arte and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and keepe a booke and a reconing of it. One theſe men (they ſay) they muſt ſmile, on ſuch men they muſt laughe: and, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better man ſhall ſit in the chayr, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppon a lowe ſtoole: which ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> I beleue, were tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Italie.</hi> But our country, hath geuen them but colde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, and as yet they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but ſlender roote here: for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe difference of worſhip, and gentry, is not liked of, with vs. And therefore it is but ill maner, for a man to make him ſelfe Iudge, which is the better man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:5465:53"/>
But it is much worſe for a man to make a ſale of his <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, (after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of harlots) as I haue ſeene many gentlemen doe in the court, geuing good wordes and faire countenaunces for a rewarde and recompence, of the goods and the tyme, their ſeruaunts haue ſpent in their ſeruice.</p>
            <p>And ſure they that take a pleaſure to vſe ouer many <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> more then neede: ſhewe they doe it vppon a luſtines and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, as men that haue nothing elles in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any valour.</p>
            <p>And bycauſe theſe follies are learned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eaſe inough, and carry withall a litle fayre gloſe in ſhewe: they beſtowe all their whole mindes none other waye. But graue matters they can not abide to weelde, as things to farre aboue their reache: and coulde finde in their harts to dwell in theſe toyes and tryfles, as men whoſe capacitie conceiueth nought of Importaunce: like tender mylkeſops that can beare no bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: or that, beſide a glorious outſide, haue not mettall inough in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to abide a flea byting. And therfore, they could wiſhe it worſe: that theſe entertainments and acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould go no further then the firſt ſight. And of theſe there bee an infinite
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:5465:53"/>
number.</p>
            <p>And ſome againe be to full of words, and abound to muche in curtious geſtures to couer and hyde the defects and faults of their treacheries, and their vile &amp; baſe na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures: For they ſee, if they ſhould be as bare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; rude in their woords, as they be in their deeds &amp; their doings, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would in no caſe abide them. And to ſaye a trueth, yow ſhall finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of theſe two cauſes, drawe moſt men one, to vſe theſe waſt and needles Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and nothing els: which lightly moſt men cannot away withall, bycauſe they be hindered by them, &amp; their meanes, to liue as they would, and loſe their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: whiche a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dothe preferre aboue any thing ells.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt not ſpeake yll of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor of their doings: althoughe it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, that men do willingly be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d good eare to heare it, as eaſily moued therto, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of malice and enuy, that pynes at our Neighbours proſperity and riſing to worſhip &amp; honour: for at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe the acquayntau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous <note place="margin">Slaundering.</note> people, as much as they ſhunne the Oxe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goreth with his horns, or ſtrikes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his feete: making their reconing, that what they tell them of vs, aſmuche they will tell

            <p>And ſome ther be, that ſo quarel at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Quareling. Wrangling.

I wil lay a vvager vvith you:</hi> But he muſt rather take payns, to apply himſelf to other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning ſuch things, as haue matter of ſmall importaunce: Bycauſe the victorye, in ſuch caſes, is daungerous: for, the gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the cauſe, in tryfling queſtions, doth often looſe the Loue of a faithfull friend. And men are ſo farre out of loue &amp; liking, of ſuch hot fellowes: that they will by no meanes growe acquaynted with ſuche, leaſt they be dryuen euery hower to bralle, to chide, and to fighte with them for it. And ſuche kinde of people doe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:5465:54"/>
purchaſe theſe names: Maiſter <hi>Vniciguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Conquerour. Ouerthwaiter. Know all. The ſubtile Doctour.</note> Or, <hi>Sir Contraponi:</hi> Or, <hi>Sir Tutteſſalle:</hi> And ſometime: <hi>il Dottor ſuttile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you chaunce otherwhile, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany to ſpeake your mind: I would haue you doe it after a gentle ſort, without ſhewing your ſelfe ſo greedie to carry the bucklers away, as if you would eate them vp for haſte. But thou muſt <hi>Leaue to euery man his parte: And bee it right or vvronge, conſent to the minds of the moſt, or the moſt importunate:</hi> and ſo leaue the fielde vnto them: that ſome other, and not your ſelfe, may beate and ſweat, and chace in the winning of the cauſe. For theſe quarelous conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bee foule and ill fauoured faſhions for gentlemen to vſe: and they get them ill will and diſpleaſure of all men for it: and they bee vncomely for their owne vnſeemelines, which of it ſelfe offendeth euery good honeſt minde, as it may chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you ſhall heare hereafter.</p>
            <p>But the common fault of men is ſuch, <note place="margin">Counceling and reprouing</note> and eche man is ſo infected with this ſelfe loue and liking of him ſelfe: that he hath no reſpect or care to pleaſe any man ells.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5465:55"/>
And to ſhewe them ſelues fine headed, of muche vnderſtanding, and wiſe: they counſell, reproue, diſpute, and bralle, to daggers drawing, and allowe nothing els but that they ſay them ſelues.</p>
            <p>To offer aduyſe vnrequeſted: what is it els but to vaunt youre ſelfe wiſer then he is, whom you do counſell: nay rather, it is a playne checke to him, for his Ignoraunce and folly. And therfore, you muſt not do ſo, with all your acquaintance generally: but only with your very friendes, or ſuche who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are to gouerne &amp; rule: or els, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man hapely ſtandes in daunger &amp; perill, how muche a ſtraunger ſo euer he be. But in our common Acquaintance and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, <hi>Let vs not buſy our ſelues, and medle to muche vvith other mens doings.</hi> In which fault many doe fall: but moſt of all, the men of leaſt vnderſtanding. For, <hi>Men of groſe apacities, conſider but litle:</hi> And they take no longe time to debate with them ſelues, as men that haue litle buſines to doe.</p>
            <p>But how ſo euer it be, hee that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth <note place="margin">He that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth hath euer a good conceite of him ſelfe.</note> and geueth his counſell: geues vs to thinke, hee hathe this conceite of him ſelfe: that all the witt is in him,

and other poore men haue none at all.</p>
            <p>And ſure there bee ſome, that ſtand ſo muche in conceite of their wit: that they will be in maner, at warres, with him, tha: wil not follow the counſell they giue them. And thus they will ſay. <hi>Very vvell: a poore mans counſell vvill not be taken: ſuche a one vvill doe as he liſt: ſuche a one geues no heede to my vvordes.</hi> As though there were not more Arrogancie in thee, that ſekeſt to bring a man to followe thy Counſell: then there is in him, that followes his owne aduiſe.</p>
            <p>And they doe alſo make the like fault, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> take vppon them to reproue and correct <note place="margin">Reprouing and correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of faul.</note> mens faults, and to geue a definite ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in all things, and lay the lawe to all men. <hi>Suche a thing would not be done: You ſpake ſuche woordes: Doe not ſo: ſay not ſo: The wine that you drinke is not good for you: but would bered vvine.

For it is a meruailous payne vnto them, to heare one that ſyde.</p>

And yet that notwithſtanding, experience doth ſhewe, the childeren and <hi>ſcholers</hi> both, do often hide them ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, you ſee.</p>
            <p>Doe not allow, that a man ſhould ſcorne <note place="margin">Scornes and Scoffes.</note> or ſcoffe at any man, what ſo euer he be: no not his very enimy, what diſpleaſure ſo euer he beare him: for, <hi>it is a greater ſigne of contempt and diſdaine, to ſcorne a man, then to do him an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: foraſmuch as vvrongs may be done, eyther of choler, or of ſom couet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mynde or other.</hi> And ther is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will take a diſpleaſure with that, or for that, he doth not ſet by: nor yet couet that thing, he doth altogether contemne.</p>

               <hi>no difference betvveene a ſcorne and a mocke: but the purpoſe alone and intent a man hath, in the meaning the one the other.</hi> For a man mockes and laughes otherwhile, in a ſport and a paſtime: but his ſcorne is euer in a rage and diſdaine.

            <p>And althoughe I profited litle, in my <hi>Grammar</hi> in my youthe: yet I remember that <hi>Mitio,</hi> who loued <hi>Aeſchines</hi> ſo muche, that he him ſelfe had wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at it: yet other while, toke a ſporte &amp; a pleaſure to mocke him: as when he ſaid to him ſelfe: <hi>I vvill go to giue him a mocke:</hi> ſo that, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that the ſelfe ſame thing, done to the very ſelfe ſame body: according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5465:57"/>
of him that doth it, may be eyther a mocke or ſcorne.</p>
            <p>And bycauſe our purpoſe, cannot be plainely knowne vnto other men: it ſhall not be good for vs to vſe ſuch parts, as bring men in doubt and ſuſpicion, what our intent and meaning is in them: but rather let vs eſchewe them, then ſeeke to be counted Ieſters. For, <hi>It many times chaunceth, in boording and Ieſting, one tackes in ſporte, the other ſtrykes againe in earneſt:</hi> &amp; thus from playing, they come to fraying. So, he that is familiarly mockte in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, recons it, otherwhile, to be done to his ſhame &amp; diſhonour, and therat he takes a diſdaine.

            </p>
            <p>It is very true, we are not able, in no wiſe, to leade this paineful lyfe, altogether without ſome pleaſure and ſolace: And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Ieſtes do geue vs ſome ſporte, and make vs merry, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly refreaſh our ſpirits: we loue them that be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt, merry conceited, and full of ſolace.

So that a body would thinke, I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſuade the contrarie: I meane, I ſhoulde ſay: <hi>It is conuenient and meete in company, to vſe prety mockes, and otherwhile ſome Ieſtes and taunts.</hi> And without doubt, they that can ſlint after a friendly and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And foraſmuche as it is the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him that doth Ieſt: to make a ſport and paſtime at his faulte, whome he doth loue and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme, and of whom he doth make more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> account: it muſt be well lookte to, that the fault, wherin his friend hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, be ſuche, as he may ſuſtaine no ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or ſhame, or any harme by any talke or Ieſte he makes vppon it: otherwiſe, his ſkil doth ill ſerue him, to make a good diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a pleaſaunt Ieſt, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plaine wronge.</p>
            <p>And there be ſome men, ſo ſhort &amp; ſo teſty, that you muſt, in no wiſe, be merry, nor vſe <note place="margin">Bocc. Nouel. 8 Gior. 9. fo. 430</note> any ieſting with them.

            </p>
            <p>And further, you ſhall vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, there be ſome Ieſtes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bite, &amp; ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bite not at all.

            <p>And beſides all this, you muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that a ieſt, whether it bite, or bite not, if it be not fine &amp; full of wit, men take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at al to heare it, but rather are wearied with it: or at leaſt wiſe, if they doe laughe, they laughe not at the ieſt, but at the ieſter him ſelfe, that brings it forthe ſo colde.</p>
            <p>And bycauſe, <hi>Ieſtes be no other thing but deceites: and deceite</hi> (as a thing that is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſubtilenes &amp; craft) <hi>cannot be wrought but of men, that haue fine and redy wittes, and very preſent:</hi> therefore they haue no grace in men that be rude, and of groſe vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And if you haue ſkill to chooſe amongeſt the woords of your owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie ſpeache, the pureſt and moſt proper, ſuche as haue the beſt ſounde, and beſt ſenſe, touching nor remembring, in no caſe, no matter that is foule, vile and baſe: &amp; if you can place your woords in good order, and not ſhoofle them together at randon, nor yet, with ouer muche Curious ſtudie, file them (as it were) one your beades. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, if you do diſpoſe ſuch things as you haue to ſay with diſcretion. And take good hede that you couple not vnfit &amp; vnlikely matters together: as for Example.

ſpell. Neyther muſt you mumble them nor ſupp them vp, as if they were glued &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together one to another. If you remember theſe and ſuch other rules and precepts: youre talke will be liked, and heard with pleaſure enoughe: and you ſhall well maintaine the ſtate and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, that well beſemeth a gentleman well taught and honeſt.</p>
            <p>Beſids theſe, there be ſome, that neuer <note place="margin">Talkatiue Fellovves.</note> hould their tounge. And as the ſhippe that ſayles, doth not preſently ſtand, ſtill, by taking downe the ſayles: So doe they runne forward, as caried away with a certaine brayde: and looſing the matter of their talke, yet leaue not to babble, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repeate that againe that is ſaid, or els ſpeake ſtill they cannot tell what.</p>
            <p>And there be other ſo full of babble, that they will not ſuffer another to ſpeake. And as wee doe ſee otherwhile, vppon the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the countrie where they threſh corne, one Pullet pull the corne out of the others beake: ſo doe they catche the tale out of his mouth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beganne it, and tell it themſelues. And ſure, ſuche maner of people, induce men to quarell and fight with them for it. For, if you doe marke it wel: <hi>Nothing moues
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5465:70"/>
a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſooner to anger: then when he is ſoudaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut short of his will and his pleaſure, be it of neuer ſo little and ſmall importaunce.</hi> As whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you gape wide with yawning: another ſhould thruſt his hand in your mouth: or when you doe lift your arme redy to hurle a ſtone: it is ſoudainly ſtayde by one that ſtands behinde you. Euen then, as theſe doings, and many moe like vnto theſe, which tend to hinder the will and deſire of another (albeit but in way of ſporte &amp; of play) are vnſeemely, and would be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed: So in talke and communication with men, wee ſhould rather pull one, and further their deſiers, by what meanes we can, then ſtop them and hinder them in it.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>If any man be in a redines to tell his tale: it is no good maner to interrupte him: nor to ſay that you doe knowe it vvell.</hi> Or, if hee beſprinckle his tale here and there, with ſome prety lye: you muſt not reproue him for it, neither in wordes nor in geſture, as ſhaking your hed, or ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vppon him, as many be wont: gloriouſly vaunting them ſelues, that they can, by no meanes, abide the taſte of a Lye. But, this is not the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5465:71"/>
reaſon of this, it is the ſharpenes and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernes of their owne ruſticall &amp; eager Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which makes them ſo venemous &amp; bitter in all companies they come: that no man cares for their acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, <hi>It is an illfauoured condition to ſtop another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tale in his mouth: and it ſpites him aſmuche, as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should take him by the ſleeue &amp; hould him backe, euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is redie to runne his courſe.</hi> And when another man is in a tale, it is no good maner for you, by telling the company ſome newes, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their mindes to other matters, to make them forſake him cleane, and leaue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For, it is an vncourtious parte for you to leade and carry away the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: which the other (not you) hath brought together.</p>
            <p>And, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tells his tale, you muſt geue good eare vnto him: that you may not ſay otherwhile, <hi>O what?</hi> Or, <hi>how?</hi> which is many a mans faſhion to doe. And this is aſmuch trouble and paine to him that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: as to ſhoofle againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtones, to him that goeth. All theſe faſhions, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that which may ſtoppe, and that which may trauerſe the courſe of another mans talke, muſt be ſhunned.</p>
            <p>And, if a man tell his tale ſlowe like a drawe latche: you muſt not yet haſten him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5465:71"/>
forwarde, nor lende him woordes, although you be quicker in ſpeache then hee. For, many doe take that ill, and ſpecially ſuche, as perſuade themſelues they haue a Ioly grace in telling a tale. For, they doe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine you thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke not ſo well of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues doe: And that you would geue them inſtructions in their owne Art: as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts</hi> that liue in greate wealth &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, would count it a greate reproche vnto them, that a man ſhould proffer them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as if they liued in lacke, &amp; were poore and ſtoode in neede of releéfe. And you muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that, <hi>Euery man in his owne conceite, thinkes he can tell his tale well: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe for modeſtie ſake he deny it.</hi> And I cannot geſſe how it cometh to paſſe, that <hi>the verieſt foole doth babble moſt:</hi> which ouer muche prattle, I would not haue a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to vſe, and ſpecially, if his ſkill be but ſcant in the matter in talke: Not onely, bycauſe it is a hard matter: but, <hi>He muſt ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in many faults that talkes muche:</hi> but alſo, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man weenes, that, <hi>He that talkes all the talke to him ſelfe, woulde (after a ſorte) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him ſelf aboue them all that heare him, as a Mayſter would be aboue his ſcholers.</hi> And therfore, <hi>It is no good maner for a man to take vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a greater ſtate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth become him.</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:5465:72"/>
And in this fault, not men alone, but many countryes fall into, ſo cackling and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: that, woe be their eares that geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearing.</p>
            <p>But, as ouer muche babble makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weary: ſo doth ouer muche <hi>Silence</hi> procure <note place="margin">Silence</note> as greate diſliking. For, <hi>To vſe ſilence in place vvhere other men talke to and fro: is in maner, aſmuche a fault, as not to pay your share and ſcot as other men doe.</hi> And as ſpeache is a meane to ſhewe men your minde, to whome you ſpeake: ſo, doth <hi>Silence</hi> againe make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wene, you ſeke to be vnknowne. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, as thoſe people which vſe to drinke muche at feaſtes, and make them ſelues drunke, are wont to thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their companie, that will not take their drinke as they doe: So be theſe kinde of mute &amp; ſtill fellowes, coldly welcome to pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and mery companie, that meete to paſſe the time away in pleaſure and talke. So that, <hi>It is good maner for a man to ſpeake, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe to hold his peace, as it comes to his turne, and occaſion requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As an old <hi>Chronicle</hi> maketh mention. There was in the parts: of <hi>Morea,</hi> a very good workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone: Who for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gular good ſkill he had in his Art, was called (as <note place="margin">Maeſtro Chiariſsimo.</note> I take it) <hi>Maeſtro Chiariſſimo.</hi> This man
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5465:72"/>
(now well ſtrooken in yeares) made a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine treatiſe, &amp; therin gathered together al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> precepts &amp; rules of his arte: as the man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had very good ſkill to doe it: ſhewing in what ſorte the proportions and lineaments of the body, ſhould be duely meaſured, as well euery one a parte by it ſelfe, as one reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting another: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might iuſtly &amp; due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be anſwerable y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one to the other: which treatiſe of his, he named <hi>Regolo.</hi> Meaning <note place="margin">Regolo.</note> to ſhewe, that according to that, all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and pictures, that from thenſforth any workema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould make, ſhould be ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; lined forth: as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beames, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtones, and the walles, are meaſured by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rules &amp; precepts of that booke. But, for that it is a muche eaſier matter to ſpeake it, then to worke it, or doe it: and beſides that, <hi>The greateſt number of men, eſpecially of vs that be prophane and not learned, haue our ſenſes much quicker then our vnderſtanding, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, better conceiue particular things and Examples, then the generall propoſitions and Syllogiſmes</hi> (which I might terme in plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpeache, <hi>Reaſons)</hi> for this cauſe this worthy man I ſpeake of, hauing regard to the Nature of workemen: whoſe capacities are vnfit and vnable to weeld the weighte of generall Precepts and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5465:73"/>
rules: and to declare more plainely, with all his cunning and ſkill: hauing found out for his purpoſe, a fine marble ſtone, with muche labour and paine, he faſhioned and ſhaped an Image of it, as perfectly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in euery parte and member: as the precepts and rules of his treatiſe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deuiſed. And as he named the booke, ſo did he name that Image, and called it by name of <hi>Regolo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, (and it pleaſed god) I would I could but one parte of thoſe twoe points, which that noble <hi>Ingrauer &amp; worckeman</hi> I ſpeake of, had perfect ſkill and knowledge to doe: I meane, that I could gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this treatiſe, after a ſorte, the due meaſures of this Art I take vppon me to treate of. For, to perfourme the other, to make the ſecond <hi>Regolo:</hi> I meane, to vſe and obſerue in my maners, the meaſures I ſpeake of, framig and forming, as it were, <hi>A Viſible Example, and a materiall Image of them:</hi> it were now, to muche for me to doe. For aſmuch as, <hi>It is not inough to haue know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge and Art, in matters concerning maners &amp; fashions of men: But it is needefull withall, to worke them to a perfect effect, to practiſe and vſe them muche: whiche cannot be had vppon the ſoudaine, nor learned by &amp; by: but it is number</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:5465:73"/>
of yeares that muſt winne it: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt parte of mine be runne fourth alredy, you ſee.</p>
            <p>But for all this, you muſt not make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe reconing of theſe precepts. For, <hi>A man may well teache another the way: although he haue gone out of the way himſelf. And peraduenture, they that haue loſt their wayes, do better remember the hard wayes to fynd: then they that neuer went a miſſe.</hi> And, if in mine infancie, when minds be tender and pliable, like a young twigge, they that had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge &amp; gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of me, had had the ſkill to ſmoothe my manners, (perhaps of Nature ſomwhat hard and rude) and would haue poliſhed and wrought them fine: peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture I ſhould haue beene ſuch A one, as I trauaile to make thee Nowe, whome I loue no leſſe then if thou were my ſonne. <hi>For albeit, the power of Nature be greate. yet is ſhe many tymes Maiſtered and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nature muſt be mayſtered by Reaſon.</note> 
               <hi>corrected by cuſtome:</hi> But, we muſt in tyme begin to encounter and beate her downe, before ſhe get to muche ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But moſt men will not doe ſo: but rather yealding to their appetite without any ſtriuing, following it where ſo euer it leades the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thinke they muſt ſubmitte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to Nature: As though <hi>Reaſon</hi> were not a naturall thing in man. But, <hi>Reaſon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5465:74"/>
hath (as a Lady and Miſtris) povver to chaunge</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Reaſon dothe chaunge olde Cuſtomes &amp; helpeth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
               <hi>olde cuſtomes, and to helpe &amp; hold vp Nature, when she doth at any time decay and fall.</hi> But very ſeldome we harken vnto her. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte parte, maketh vs like vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whome god hath not endued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Reaſon: I meane brute beaſtes, in whome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſomething yet worketh: not their owne Reaſons (for they haue none of them ſelues) but ours: as in horſes you ſee it: which by nature would be euer wilde, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their ryder makes them tame, and withal, after a ſorte, redy &amp; very well paced. For many of them would haue a hard trot, but that the rider makes them haue an eaſier pace. And ſome he doth teache to ſtand ſtill, to galopp, to treade the ringe, and do the carreere: And they learne to doe it all well you ſee. Then, if the horſe, the dog, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauke, &amp; many other beaſtes beſides, more wylde then theſe, be guided and ruled by Reaſon, and learne that which their owne Nature cannot attaine, but rather repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: and become after a ſorte cunning and ſkilfull, ſo farre as their kinde doth beare it, not by Nature, but by cuſtome &amp; vſe: how muche then may we thinke wee ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell them, by the precepts and rules of our Reaſon, if wee tooke any heede vnto it.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5465:74"/>
But, <hi>The Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes deſire &amp; couet preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t delightes, what ſoeuer they be: and can abide no paines, but puts them of. And by this meanes, they alſo shake of Reaſon, and thinke her vnpleaſant, foraſmuche as she ſets before them, not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, many times, hurtfull: but goodnes and vertue, euer paynfull, ſower and vnſauoury in taſte. For, while we liue according to the Senſe, wee are like to the ſelly ſickma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom al cates neuer ſo deinty &amp; ſweete, ſeeme vntoothſome: and he chideth ſtill with his Cater and Cooke, in whome there is no fault at all for it. For, it is the Nature of his diſeaſe, and the Extremitie of his ſicknes, and not the fault of his meate, that he doth not ſauourly taſte what he eates. So Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, which of it ſelfe is ſvveete and ſauourie: ſeemes bitter in taſte vnto vs, though it haue no ill taſte in dede.</hi> And therfore as nice &amp; deitie felowes, we refuſe to make any taſte of her: &amp; couer our groſnes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaying that Nature hath no ſpurres nor raines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can pricke her forth, or hold her backe. Where ſure, if an Oxe or an Aſſe, or a Hogge, could ſpeake: I beleeue, they could not lightly tell a more fowle &amp; ſhamefull tale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. <hi>VVe should be childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtill all the time of our riper yeares, &amp; in our extreame age: and vvaxe as very fooles vvith gray hoary heads, as vvhen vve vvere very babes: if it vvere not that reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhich increaſeth in vs vvith our yeares, ſubdueth affections in vs,

and growen to perfection, tranſformeth vs from beaſtes in to men. So that it is well ſeene, shee ruleth our ſenſes and bridleth our wittes.</hi> And it is our owne Imperfection and not her faulte, if we doe ſwarue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertue, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and good order in life.</p>
            <p>It is not then true, that there is not a bridell and Maſter for Nature. Nay, ſhe is guided and ruled by twaine: <hi>Cuſtome</hi> I <note place="margin">Cuſtome &amp; Reaſon, tvvoe brydles of Nature.</note> meane, and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> But, as I haue tould you a litle before: <hi>Reaſon without Cuſtome and vſe, cannot make an vnciuile bodie, well taught and courtious:</hi> Which cuſtome and vſe, is as it were, bred and borne of tyme. And therefore they ſhall doe well, to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betime vnto her, not only for that, by this meanes, a man ſhall haue more time and leaſure to learne to be ſuch as ſhe teacheth, and to become as it were a houſhould ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of hers, and one of her traine: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bycauſe <hi>The tender age, as pure and cleane, doth eaſily receaue all Impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and reteineth more liuely, the colours vvherevvith she is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: then vvhen a man comes to ryper yeares:</hi> And alſo, bycauſe <hi>The things vvherein vvee haue byn nourished and trained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our youth, doe ordinarily pleaſe vs, aboue all other things.</hi> And for this cauſe, it is ſaid that <hi>Diodato,</hi> a man that had a ſingular good gift &amp; grace <note place="margin">Piodato.</note>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:5465:75"/>
of vtterance, would euermore bee the firſt that came fourth vppon the ſtage to ſhewe his Comedie: allthoughe they were all but cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfets vnto him, whoſoeuer they were that ſhould haue ſpoken before him. But he would not his voice ſhould occupie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens eares, after they heard another man ſpeake. Although, in reſpect of his doings, it were a greate deale Inferiour to his. Seing then, I cannot agree my workes and my wordes together, for thoſe cauſes I haue ſhewed you before, as <hi>Maeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro Chiariſſimo</hi> did: whoe had as good a ſkil to doe it, as he had knowledge to teache it: let it ſuffice that I haue tould in ſome part what muſt be done, bycauſe I am not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes able to doe it in dede. <hi>He that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in darkenes, may very vvell Iudge vvhat comfort it is to enioy the benefit of light.

            <p>To come againe then to this treatiſe, which growes now to ſome end: wee ſay that <hi>Thoſe be good maners and fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which bring a delight, or at leaſt, offend not their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, their mynds, and conceits, vvith vvhom vve
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:5465:76"/>
liue.</hi> And of theſe, wee haue hitherto ſpoken inoughe.</p>
            <p>But you muſt vnderſtand with all this, that, <hi>Men be very deſirous of bevvtifull things, vvell proportioned and comely. And of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet things fovvle and ill shapen, they be as ſquemish againe, on the other ſide.</hi> And this is a ſpeciall priuilege geuen to vs: that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures haue no capacitie, to ſkill what bewtie or meaſure meaneth. And therefore, as things not common w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beaſtes but proper to our ſelues: we muſt embrace them for them ſelues, and holde them dere: &amp; yet thoſe, much more, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drawe nereſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of man: as which are moſt apt and inclined to vnderſtand the perfection which Nature hath lefte in men.</p>
            <p>And albeit, it be a hard matter, to ſhewe preciſely, <hi>Bevvtie,</hi> what maner of thing it is: <note place="margin">Bevvtie.</note> yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you may haue ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e marke, to know her by: you muſt vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>VVhere iointly &amp; ſeuerally, euery parte &amp; the whole hath his due proportion and meaſure, there is Bevvtie. And that thing may iuſtly be called fayer, in vvhich the ſaide proportion and meaſure is found.</hi> And by that I did once learne of a wiſe &amp; a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man: <hi>Bevvtie</hi> he ſaid, would conſiſt but of one, at the moſte. And <hi>Deformitie</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, meaſured her ſelfe, by <hi>Many.</hi> As <note place="margin">Deformitie.</note> you may ſee by the faces of fayer &amp; goodly

women. For, the euen lineaments and due proportions of euery of them: ſeeme to haue byn created &amp; framed by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſight of one face alone. Which cannot be thought in them that be foule &amp; deformed. For, when you beholde a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hath, peraduenture, bigge and bowle eyes, a little noſe, blubbe cheekes, a fſat mouth, an out chinne, &amp; a browne ſkinne: you thinke ſtraite that that face is not one womans alone: but is moulded of many faces, and made of many peeces. And yet, you ſhall finde amongeſt them, ſome ſuch, whoſe partes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered alone by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, be very perfect to ſee to: but all ſet together, be foule and ill fauoured: not for any other cauſe, but that they be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lineaments of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fayer women, and not of one: So that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would weene, ſhee had borrowed her partes, of this and that woman. And it may be, that Painter that had all the fayer maides of <hi>Calabria,</hi> naked before him: had none other intent therein, then to iudge &amp; diſcerne in many, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue, as it were, borrowed heere one, &amp; there another, of one, alone: to whome reſtoring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eache y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was her right: imagining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Venus</hi> bewty ſhould be ſuch, and ſo proportioned: he ſet him ſelfe to paint her.</p>
            <p>And, you muſt not thik, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is to be ſeene
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5465:77"/>
the faces, the partes, and the bodies of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alone: but it happeneth more or leſſe, in ſpeache, in geſtures &amp; doings. For, if you ſhould chaunce to ſee a Noble woman gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius and gallant, waſhing of cloutes in a Riuer by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> highe waye ſide: Althoughe if this were not, you might hapely paſſe away by her, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> little heede to her perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſtate: yet this would not brook you nor like you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her ſeruile doings doe ſhewe her more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one. For her ſtate ſhould anſwer her honourable condition and calling. But her woorke is ſuche, as is meete for women of baſe and ſeruile life: &amp; although you ſhall feele, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yll ſauour nor ſent come from her, nor heare any noyſe that ſhould offend you, nor any thing els to trouble your minde: yet the foule and filthy maner of doing it, and the vnſeemely act it ſelfe: will make you muche to loathe it. You muſt then beware of theſe fowle and vncomely behauiours, aſmuche, nay, more then of thoſe other, I haue ſpoken all this while. For, it is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter a greate deale, to knowe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man faulteth in theſe, then when he faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in them. Bycauſe, <hi>It is eaſie much, vve ſee, to feele then to vnderſtande.</hi> But yet, it may chaunce otherwhile, that euen that which offendeth the ſenſes, may alſo offend
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5465:77"/>
the minde: thoughe not altogether af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one ſorte, as I haue told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <note place="margin">Apparelling according to the Time.</note> ſhewing you that <hi>A man muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell him ſelfe, according to the fashions that other men vſe:</hi> that it may not be thought he doth reproue and correct their doings: The which thing offendeth moſt men that ſeeke to be commended: And the wiſeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be, miſlike it too. For, the garments of the olde world, haue loſt their date, for men of this age and this ſeaſon to weare. And it is ſuche an ill ſhapen ſight, to ſee a man clad with other mens cloathes: that a man would weene there would be a fray betwene the doublet &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoſe: their cloathes doe ſit, vppon them ſo vnto wardly.</p>
            <p>So that, many of thoſe matters I haue ſpoken of allredy, or peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture all, might be aptly reherſed here again: foraſmuch as this meaſure I ſpeake of here, is not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in theſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs: nor the time, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, nor the worke, nor the worker, accorded &amp; fitted together, ſo well as it ſhould be. For mens minds and fanſies doe like it, &amp; take a pleaſure and delight in thoſe things. But I thought it good to apply &amp; ſpeake theſe matters, rather vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> badge, as it were, of the Senſes and deſires: then properly aſſigne them to the minde: that a man may
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5465:78"/>
the more eaſily perceiue them: bycauſe <hi>It is a naturall thinge, for euerie man to feele and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:</hi> but euery man cannot ſo generally vnderſtand, and eſpecially that, whiche we call bewtie, gallantnes or entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not inoughe for a man, to doe things that be good: but hee muſt alſo haue a care, hee doe them with a good grace. And a good grace is nothing els, but ſuche a maner of light (as I may</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A Grace, vvhat it is.</note> 
               <hi>call it) as shineth in the aptnes of things ſet in good order and wel diſpoſed, one with another: and perfectly knit and vnited together. VVith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which proportion and meaſure, euen that which is good is not faire: &amp; the fairenes it ſelf, is not pleſaunt.</hi> And as meates, though they be good &amp; ſauourie will giue men no minde to eate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they haue no pleaſaunt reliſh and taſte: So fares it with the maners of men other while (althoughe in them ſelues in no reſpect they be ill, but fooliſhe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and fond) if a man doe not ſeaſon them with a certaine ſweetenes, which you call (as I take it) <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Comlines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, euery vice of it ſelfe, without any further matter to helpe it (it cannot be choſen) muſt needes offend a man. For, <hi>Vices be things ſo foule and filthie: that honeſt and modeſt mindes, will greeue to ſee
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5465:78"/>
their shamefull effects.</hi> And therefore, <hi>it shall behoue them that ſeeke to be well thought of, with their familiar acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, aboue all things els to eſchewe vices, and eſpecially thoſe, that be fouleſt and worſt: as Leachery, Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Crueltie, and other.</hi> Of which, ſome be beaſtly, as <hi>Drunkennes, and Gluttonie: ſome vncleane, as Leacherie: other ſome horrible, as Murther, and ſuch other: all which for them ſelues, and for the very naughtines, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in them al, all men eſchewe more, or leſſe:</hi> But, as earſt I ſaid, generally al, as thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs of greate diſorder, make a man miſliked muche of all men.</p>
            <p>But, bycauſe I haue not taken vppon me to ſhew vnto you, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſinnes, but their Errors: it ſhalbe no parte of my charge at this time to entreate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nature of vices &amp; vertues: but onely of the ſeemely &amp; vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly faſhions and maners wee vſe one with another. One of the which vnſeemely <note place="margin">Counte Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde.</note> faſhions was, that <hi>Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Richard</hi> did vſe: of which I tould you before. Which, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely and vnfitting with thoſe other his good and faire maners hee had beſides: that ſame worthie Biſhop (as a ſkilfull and cunning Mayſter in muſicke will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſily

            <p>
               <hi>It shalbe then, neceſſarie for gentlemen and men of good behauiour, to haue a regard to this meaſure I ſpeake of: in going, in ſtanding, in ſitting, in geſture, in porte, in apparell, in talke, in ſilence, in reſt and in action.</hi> For, a man muſt not apparell him ſelfe like a woman: that the Attire may not be of one ſorte, and the perſon of another: as I doe ſee it in ſome that weare their heads &amp; their beards curled with bodkins, and haue their face, <note place="margin">Beardes and Heades cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with bodkins.</note> and their necks, &amp; their hands, ſo ſtarchte and painted, that it were to muche for a girle, nay harlot, that makes a mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of it, and ſets her ſelfe to the ſale.</p>
            <p>Hou muſt ſmell, neither of ſweete nor of ſower: for a gentleman would not ſauour <note place="margin">Sweete ſmeles</note> naſtily like a begger: nor yet ſhould a man carry a ſauour and ſent about him, like a harlot or whoore. I doe not by this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but you may very well vſe ſome ſweete ſmelles of ſweete waters.</p>
            <p>Your apparell muſt be ſhaped according <note place="margin">Apparell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faſhion &amp; calling.</note> to the faſhion of the time, and your calling, for the cauſes I haue ſhewed you before. For, <hi>VVe muſt not take vppon vs to alter cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes at our will. For time doth beget them, and time doth alſo weare them out.</hi>

Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may applie thoſe faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that be in common vſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſte to his owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, that he can. For, if perchaunce your legges be very long, and men vſe but ſhort garments: you may vſe a meane, not to long, nor to ſhort. And if your legges be to ſmall, to greate, or crooked: make not your hoſen of to light and gariſhe a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that it may not call men to looke and to gawre vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your deformitie. Thou muſt weare no garment that ſhall be to light, or ouermuche daubde with garding: that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not ſay, thou haſt <hi>Ganymedes</hi> hoſen, or weareſt <hi>Cupides</hi> doublet. But, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be thou weareſt, let it be fit and well made for thy bodie: leaſt thou ſeme to braue it, in another mans cloathes.</p>
            <p>But with all, thou muſt in any caſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thy condition or eſtate. For, <hi>A man of the Clergie, muſt not be attired like a Souldier: nor a Souldier goe like a Player.</hi> When <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truccio</hi> was in <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Lodouico Bauero</hi> at a greate Pompe, and triumphe: who was both Duke of <hi>Lucca</hi> and <hi>Piſtoia,</hi> and <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Palazzo,</hi> and Senatour of <hi>Rome:</hi> this <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> being Lorde greate Mayſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſaide <hi>Lodouico Bauero</hi> his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlde: for his brauery, made him a coate of crimſin, vppon the breſt wherof, there

            </p>
            <p>I beleeue, you thinke this garment, would haue become <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> his Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter better, then it could become him.</p>
            <p>And although Kings be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> checke, and may doe what they liſt: Yet, I could neuer commend King <hi>Manfrede,</hi> Whoe euer more vſed, to ſuite him ſelfe in greene. Wee muſt then haue a care, that our appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell be not onely wel made for the bodie: but that it be meete for our calling. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, it be ſuche, as the countrie doth vſe, <note place="margin">Apparel acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Countrey</note> where wee liue. For, <hi>As in diuers places be diuers meaſures, and yet bying and ſelling eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvhere vſed.

            <p>Theſe ſame feathers, which the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> and <hi>Spaniardes</hi> be wont to weare, and braueries and Embroderies: haue but ill place amongeſt graue gowned men, &amp; the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attires that Citizens doe weare.

a greate deale worſe.

            <p>I would not haue a gentleman to runne <note place="margin">Running and going in the ſtreat and other ſuch geſtures.</note> in the ſtreate, nor go to faſt: for that is for lackies, and not for gentlemen to doe.

I would not yet haue a man go ſo ſofte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely, as a maide or a wife. And when a man walkes, it is no good ſight to ſee a man ſhake his bodie to muche, nor to hold his hands bare and emptie: nor yet caſt &amp; fling his armes vp &amp; downe, in ſuch ſort as a man would weene, hee were ſoweing of Corne in the field: nor Stare in a mans face, as if he had ſpied a mares neſt.</p>

And ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e ſet their handes to their ſides, and iet vp &amp; downe like a Pecocke: which faſhions doe muche offend men: not as well, but as ill beſeeming a man to vſe them.</q> For, if your horſe, perchaunce, doe champe and play on the bit, and gape or lill out his tounge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this geue little proofe of his goodnes: yet it commends him well to the ſale: and you ſhoulde finde a miſſe of it, if it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: not bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe ſhould be ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the worſe: but bycauſe he ſhould ſhew the leſſe courage and pleaſure. Now, if it ſtand ſo, that <hi>Comelines</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> be ſo much made of in beaſts, and alſo in things without life or ſenſe, as experience doth ſhewe, that, <hi>Two things of equall goodnes &amp; comodities, beare not for all that, a like price,</hi> if a man doe beholde a finer proportion &amp; bewtie, more in the one then he ſees in the other: How muche then more, ſhould it be eſtemed and commended in men, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Reaſon.</p>

more, the goodnes of his ſtrong braine: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the continencie of a ſober man.
