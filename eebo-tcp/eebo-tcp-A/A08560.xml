            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4465:4"/>
chaunce ſo in all other deathes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Therfore wyll I now at this tyme let all ſuche thynges continue in theyr worthy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and fre, lyke as all other naturall thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges, whiche be ſubiecte and commytted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oure reaſon to rule. But as for the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, whiche (by reaſon of offyce, or for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte ſake, or for other reaſonable cauſes) can not, or be not mynded to flye, I wyll here withall ſhewe them theyr beſt and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt comforte that they haue.</p>
            <p>In lyke maner, I wyll not entre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt them, that ſpeake naturally therof, and ſaye: Suche plage commeth out of the influence of the ſtarres, out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> workynge of the Cometes, out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnſeaſonable we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and alterynge of the ayre, out of the Southe wyndes, out of ſtynkynge wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or out of foule myſtes of the grounde: For ſuch wyſedome of theyrs wyl we leaue vnto them vndeſpyſed, and not fyght there agaynſt: But (as Chriſten men) we wyll holde vs vnto the worde of God, the ſame wyll we ſuffre to be oure mooſt hye wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and geue credence vnto it, and follow it: and ſo ſhall we fynde muche better and ſurer inſtruccion: Namely, that this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plage of the peſtilence commeth out of
<pb facs="tcp:4465:4"/>
Gods wrath, becauſe of the deſpyſynge and tranſgreſſynge of his godly commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes. For thus ſayeth the holy prophet Moſes in the fyft boke, the .xxviii. Chapter:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yf thou wylt not herken vnto the voyce of the <hi>LORDE</hi> thy God, to obſerue and kepe all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes and ordynaunces which I commaunde the, then ſhal all theſe curſes come vpon the. &amp;c. And it followeth: The <hi>LORDE</hi> ſhall cauſe the peſtilence to endure longe wyth the: the <hi>LORDE</hi> ſhall ſmyte the wyth ſwellyng, feuer, heate, bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, blaſtynge, drouth. &amp;c. and ſhall perſecute the tyll he vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroye the, and brynge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> to naught.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certaynly this is the playne truth and the very originall of theſe plages. No man ought to doute theron. For thoughe the forſayd naturall cauſes do ſomwhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thereto, yet is it ſure and vndouted, that the ſame cauſes be ſent and ſtered vp oute of Gods wrath for our ſynne and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:4465:5"/>
And truely that it is euen ſo, the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſcripture declareth, not wyth bare wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des onely, but ſheweth it alſo wyth notable enſamples. For in the fourth boke of Moſes the fourtenth Chapter, whan all the ſpyes (excepte Ioſua and Caleb) ſpake euell of the lande of promes, and made the people vnpa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyent and vprouryſh, ſo that they choſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a captayne, and thought to go agayne in to Egipte, and to ſtone Moſes and Aaron, (which commaunded them the contrarye) we reade thus: Then appeared the glorye of the Lorde, and ſpake vnto Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howe longe doth thys people blaſpheme me? And howe longe wyll they not beleue me, for all the tokens that I haue done vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them? ther fore wyl I ſmyte and deſtroye them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> peſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; make of the a grater nacion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this.</p>
            <p>Lykewyſe alſo whan Dauid cauſed the people to be nombred agaynſte Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, he diſpleaſed the Lorde God horribly therwith. Therfore layed he the pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyſhment vpon hym, ſo that he was fayne to choſe hymſelfe whether he hadde rather haue ſeuen yeares derth, or thre monethes myſchaunce in battayll, or thre dayes peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the lande. And whan he choſe the peſtilence, ther dyed in thre dayes ſeuentye
<pb facs="tcp:4465:5"/>
thouſande men, as it is wrytten in the laſte Chapter of the .ii. boke of Samuel.</p>
            <p>Seynge then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of the word of God we knowe the very cauſe of thys horrible plage: Namely, that it is the defaute of our ſynnes, as vnbelefe, diſobedience &amp; vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Therfore before all thynges it ſhal be neceſſary, that we refrayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame, repent, and amende our lyues. Yf we wyll els be preſerued and delyuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible plage. For yf God punyſh vs becauſe of ſynne, it is good to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre that we muſt fyrſt knowlege &amp; eſchue our ſynnes, in caſe that he ſhall withdrawe and take away hys wrath &amp; punyſhment from vs. For yf we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in our euell ſynfull and culpable lyfe, certaynly he ſhall not ceaſſe wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> punyſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, but go forth more &amp; more, tyl he geue and recompence accordynge to our workes. But yf we knowlege our ſynne, refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, repent and axe grace, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal he alſo take awaye hys wrath. And this horrible wrath (with other heuy burthens as warre &amp; derth that lye vpon oure neck) ſhall he mercyfully take awaye from vs agayne. As holy Paull ſayeth .i. Cor. xi. Yf we iudged our ſelues, we ſhulde not be iudged: But whan we are iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, we be chaſtened of the Lorde, that we
<pb facs="tcp:4465:6"/>
ſhulde not be damned wyth the worlde.</p>
            <p>And out of all thys maye youre charyte well perceaue, howe vnwyſely and vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenly they do, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of inordinate feare, of thys plage leaue theyr callynge and office, maliciouſly wythdrawyng the loue, helpe, &amp; faythfulneſſe, which they (out of gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement) are bounde to ſhewe vnto theyr neghbours, and ſo do ſynne greuouſly agaynſte the commaundement of God. For certaynly they do but ſtere vp the wrath of God more earneſtly agaynſte themſelues, that he may the ſooner take hold vpon them and pluck them awaye with thys plage. For men maye heare on euery ſyde, that ſome do ſhone and flye not onely the ſyck, but alſo the whole: Yee (that yet more foolyſhe is) euen the platters and candelſtyckes which come out of ſtraunge houſes, as though death dyd ſurely ſtyck therin. And (out of ſuche fonde chyldyſhe feare) it commeth, that not onely ſome ſyck folkes be ſuffred to dye away wyth out all kepynge, helpe and comforte, but the wemen alſo greate wyth chylde be forſaken in theyr nede, or els commeth there vtterly no man vnto them: Yee a man maye heare alſo, that the chyldren forſake theyr fathers and mothers, and one houſhold body kepeth
<pb facs="tcp:4465:6"/>
hymſelfe awaye from another, and ſheweth no loue vnto hym: Whiche neuertheles he wold be glad to ſe ſhewed vnto hymſelfe, yf he laye in lyke neceſſite.</p>
            <p>Howbeyt I ſuppoſe ther come not manye ſuch chaunches to paſſe, neuertheles I muſt ſpeake therof that it be done nomore from henceforth. For certaynly it is vnwyſely &amp; vnchriſtenly handled: &amp; we nede not thynke that the ſame is the waye to eſcape thys plage, but rather an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it raygneth the more myghtely ouer vs. For ſeynge it is ſure (as ye haue herde afore) that ſuch plage is ſent for puniſhment of oure ſynnes, and Chriſte hath geuen vs a new commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we ſhulde loue one another (as he hath loued vs) it followeth, that the farther we departe from the loue of our neghboure, the mor we lade ſynne vpon vs, and deſerue thys plage but the more. Agayne the more diligentlye that we take hede vnto the loue of oure neghboure, the ſurer ſhall we be from thys plage: No man nedeth to doute therof.</p>
            <p>But here withall wyll I alſo counſell or compell no man, to ony vnnedeful daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (that he is not bounde vnto by his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge nor by loue) but onely warne thoſe,
<pb facs="tcp:4465:7"/>
whiche for feare leaue that whiche they are bounde to do before God: To the intent that for ſuch naked feares ſake, they do not tranſgreſſe nor omytte the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, and hope by ſynne to eſcape thys plage, which neuertheles commeth becauſe of ſynne. For that were a foolyſh vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed counſell, yf one wolde go aboute to eſcape the wrath of God by tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by ſynne to auoyde the puniſhment of ſynne.</p>
            <p>Beſydes thys, doth experience ſhewe alſo that they which be ſo ſore afrayed, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly miſcary. Agayne, they that wayte vpon theyr offices and ſerue theyr neghbours, be delyuered: As it is well ſene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters of the churche and other mo, that ſhone not the ſyck, but muſte vyſet and comforte them wyth Gods worde, and prouyde for them wyth the holy ſacrament: For we ſe no where, that they therfore muſt alſo be ſoone ſyck &amp; muſt dye. Yee how muſt the hygher powers of the worlde do, which (by reaſon of theyr callynge, and for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune profyt &amp; regimentes ſake) abyde alſo in the ioperdy, and muſt myniſtre becauſe of loue? Specy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the chefeſt, on one wherof ther lyeth more, then on a thouſand of other? And yet
<pb facs="tcp:4465:7"/>
doth God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munly preſerue them alſo that they be delyuered, left ſtyll on lyue, and dye in a good quyete age.</p>
            <p>Therfore certaynly ſuch inordinate feare and flyenge agaynſt Gods commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is nothynge els, but a declaryng of a greate and ſore vnbelefe, that men do not beleue &amp; truſt in God, that he can and wyll delyuer. And thus is verified the ſayenge: <hi>The vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>godly haue no peace.</hi> Eſa. lvii. For yf we wyll feare and flye where no parell is, whan wyll we then beſtowe oure lyues for oure neghbours, as Chriſt hath done for vs? &amp; we alſo be bounde to do lykewyſe .i. Io. iii.</p>
            <p>Who ſo now deſyreth to eſcape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God &amp; thys horrible plage, let hym not axe his own reaſon how he ſhal do, but beleue &amp; folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God: which teacheth hym, not to flye euel ayre &amp; infecte places (which he maye well do: neuertheles he remayneth yet vncertayn whether it helpeth or no) but it teacheth hym to leaue of from ſynne, as from the very originall cauſe of this plage and puniſhment, and (by true repentaunce and amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of lyuyng) to walke agayn in the right waye. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the onely ſure &amp; wholſome flyenge in thys dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous tyme, wherby a man may eſcape thys plage.
<pb facs="tcp:4465:8"/>
alſo and defence of God, is ſet forth vnto vs euery where in the ſcripture, as an ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowynge &amp; coueryng with wynges. For lyke as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Cherubins ſpred out theyr wynges ouer the Arke Exodi. xxxvii. Euen ſo doth God ſprede out the wynges of his protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer hys electe. Therfore ſayeth Moſes Deutero. xxxii. Lyke as an Aegle ſtereth vp hys neſt, and flyeth ouer hys yonge ones: ſo ſpredde he out hys fethers, and bare hys people vpon hys wynges. After this maner ſpake the holy angell Gabriell alſo vnto the moſte bleſſed and pure virgyn Mary, whan ſhe ſhulde be the mother of God: The holy gooſt ſhall come vpon the, and the power of the hygheſt ſhall ouerſhadowe the.

in vs, yet flyeth he wyde, hye &amp; lowe, not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly on the outſyde of vs, but alſo on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyde and ouer all creatures. And ſo in all theſe wordes ther is nothynge els ſayde, but: who ſo euer is a ryght beleuynge Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten.</p>
            <p>Marke now then that he ſayeth not: Who ſo is wyſe, ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, ryche, whole, or wel frended. Nether ſayeth he alſo: who ſo kepeth hymſelfe thence, or flyeth thether, holdeth hymſelfe well, or vſeth good phiſycke, but who ſo putteth hys truſt in God. Not that the foreſayd good thynges be euell, or maye not be had or vſed wyth profyte: But that they (where fayth is not) may euen aſſoone do harme as good, are in no wyſe able to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyuer from the wrath of God. But what doth the beleuer: He ſayeth vnto the Lorde: <hi>my hope.</hi> But this do not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vngodly and vnbeleuers, but ſet theyr hope in the forſaid poyntes, put theyr truſt in them, and boaſt theron, and ſo commyt ſpirituall whoredom therwith, and make ydols therof. But to God do not they lyfte vp theyr eyes, nother thynke they vpon hym, nor feare hym. And whan he commeth then with hys wrath, and ouertaketh them with a plage, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite they muſt nedes thynke vpon hym, then
<pb facs="tcp:4465:9"/>
feare they, and be afrayed of him, flye away and knowe not where to abyde: Then va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyſheth awaye theyr hope and boaſtynge, whych they (in tyme of proſperite) had vnto the creatures. And ſo commeth it to paſſe, that theyr wyſedome hath ben playne foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhneſſe: theyr ſtrength, theyr owne myſfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tune: theyr ryches, theyr owne deſtruccion: theyr health theyr own harme: theyr fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des theyr owne ypocrytes &amp; traytours. And al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whych they truſted vnto, can not helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whan they wolde hyde themſelues on the backſyde therof, it is euen as much as whan one hydeth hym behynde a ladder. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wolde ſeke helpe therby, it is euen lyke as yf a wolfe ſhuld defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a ſhepe or a gooſe</p>
            <p>But thus goeth it not wyth the bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: for who ſo putteth hys truſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde, ſhall not be confounded. Therfore ſayeth he not only that the Lorde is hys hope, but alſo hys ſtronge holde, whych he maye flye vnto, in the whych he may ſhutte hymſelfe cloſe, and be delyuered therin. As Salomon ſayeth in the .xviii. Chapter of the prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes: The name of the Lorde is a ſtronge caſtel, the ryghteous flyeth vnto it, and ſhal be defended. For the vnbeleuers haue theyr hope euen in theyr goodes, but in neceſſyte
<pb facs="tcp:4465:9"/>
they fynde no refuge, as the faythfull hath a ſtronge holde and hye caſtell in God the Lorde.</p>
            <p>And though the vnbeleuers haue theyr whole wyll all theyr lyfe longe, yet hath it an euell ende, as it had wyth the rych man, whych was buryed in the hell. Luce. xvi. For who ſo beleueth not, ſhalbe damned. Agayn, though the faythfull be plaged and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all hys lyfe longe, ſo that he can not ſe how he maye be delyuered, yet hath he thys comforte, that the Lorde is hys God: that is that he can helpe and delyuer hym as an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty Lorde, yee after ſuche a faſhion and waye, as nother he hymſelfe nor ony mans reaſon can thynke or deuyſe. And thoughe he do it not, yet doth not the faythfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre, but letteth the Lorde be hys God, on whom he hopeth: that is, at whoſe hande he loketh for all good in the lyfe for to come &amp; euerlaſtynge. For hope ſeyth and loketh on that whych is to come, whych as yet is hyd. As Paule ſayeth Roma. the .viii. Chapter. Hope that is ſene, is no hope: for how can a man hope that whyche is ſene. But yf we hope that whych we ſe not, we loke for it by pacience.</p>
            <p>And ſo is this meanyng: The vnbeleuers
<pb facs="tcp:4465:10"/>
haue theyr hope in the creatures, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed of God. The faythfull hath his hope to God, and is lorde ouer the creatures. The vnbeleuers myſcary, and by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fynde they no helpe in nede. The faythfull myſcary not, but God is vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſtronge holde. The vnbeleuers may well haue theyr wylles aſlonge as they lyue, but at the laſt (thorow theyr diſpayre) ther follo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth euerlaſtynge damnacyon. The fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full maye theyr lyfe longe haue diſquyetnes and temtacion, but at the laſt (thorow theyr hope) ther followeth euerlaſtynge lyfe.</p>
            <p>Suche hope ſhulde they haue, and they haue it in dede, that though they muſt lye vnder aſlonge as they lyue, yet after death they ſhall enherete euerlaſtynge lyfe. But certaynly it commeth not to paſſe, that they muſt alwaye lye vnder: For God is fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſuffreth not his to be temted aboue theyr ſtrength, but maketh the temtacion ſo to haue an ende, that we may bear it .i. Cor. x. Therfore ſayeth the prophete moreouer: <hi>For he delyuereth me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſnare of the hunter, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noyſome peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> And in theſe wordes doth he ſhortly ſhewe vnto vs, that almyghty God can and wyll
<pb facs="tcp:4465:10"/>
delyuer hys owne from all myſfortune yee euen in thys lyfe. For all the myſchaunces that we be troubled wythall in thys tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lyfe, are of two ſortes: Some come out of the wycked deuyce of the deuell and of men, as ſhame and perſecucion: Some playnly of nature and out of the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, as tempeſt and peſtilence. The faythfull nowe beleueth and maketh hys boaſt, that theſe myſchaunces can not be ſo greate and myghtye, but God ſhall delyuer hym ther from.</p>
            <p>And it is a goodly naturall ſimilitude, that he lykeneth the euell wycked deuyce of the vngodly agaynſt the faythfull, to a nette or ſnare of the hunter. For lyke as an hunter proueth the kynde and nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery wylde beaſt, commeth priuely after hym, ſeketh out the courſe and habitacion therof, and afterwarde ſetteth the nette, that he maye dryue it therein: Euen ſo do the vngodly alſo vnto the ryghteous: Fyrſt, they loke how they be mynded. Yf ony one be fre of langage, then ſet they hym on fyre, that he maye ſpeake ſomwhat ſharpely, as ſaynt Steuen dyd. Actu. the .vii. Chapter. Yf he be gentle and frendly, then ymagen they ſome foolyſhe thynge vpon hym, and
<pb facs="tcp:4465:11"/>
flatter awaye hys harte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym as Dalila dyd vnto Samſon. Yf he ſeke the ſaluacion of the people, then ſklaunder they hym, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes blaſphemed Chriſt to be a wyneſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and a companyon of publicans. Yf he be ſimple, then lye they vpon hym behynde hys backe, or euer he be ware therof: Then followe they vpon hym, crye, lye, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne, that the vertuous Chriſten man woteth not what poynte to be at, or how he hath deſerued it. Neuertheleſſe they thynke the bell is ſo caſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the laſt it muſt rynge as they wyll, but it fayleth them.</p>
            <p>For the Lorde on whom we beleue, whych is our hope, refuge and God, can not only preſerue vs from theyr ſnares that we fall not therin, but alſo whan we fall in to them, and they thynke we be theyr captiues he can and wyll delyuer vs yet therout. In lyke maner doth God the Lorde preſerue hys faythfull, not onely from the noyſome ſyckneſſe of the peſtilence, but alſo whan they be taken therwyth and infecte already he delyuereth them from it and maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whole agayne. But how that commeth to paſſe, and howe we ſhall vnderſtande it, it ſhall followe here after more clerely.</p>
            <p>This is now well to be marked alſo,
<pb facs="tcp:4465:11"/>
that the peſtilence is a noyſome ſyckneſſe, not becauſe it bryngeth death (for that do al other mortal ſyckneſſes lykewyſe, and death is no loſſe vnto the faythfull, but auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, as Paule ſayeth, Philip. the fyrſt Chapter) but becauſe that it taketh awaye the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very ſodenly vnloked for and vnwares: Wherout the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther followeth, ſtryfe, lawyng or buſynes amonge ſynners and of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune welth, as euery man by hymſelfe can lyghtly perceaue and vnderſtande. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it alſo an horrible punyſhment ouer the ſynne of the worlde, whyche concerneth both them that dye, and them that are lefte alyue, as hereafter it ſhall followe.</p>
            <p>Where as is nowe ſuche a fayth as ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth credence vnto God, he ſhall preſerue hym from all wycked ymaginacions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, lykewyſe from all noyſome ſyckeneſſes. And at the laſt ſhal he ſaue hym, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not wythout frute, but breaketh out wyth ryght loue and faythfulneſſe towarde hys neghboure, and deſyreth alſo to brynge hym vnto that poynte, that he maye beleue and be partaker of all ſuche goodes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of God. Therfore doth the prophete turne hys wordes now alſo vnto hys negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, and ſayeth farthermore:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4465:12"/>
               <hi>He ſhall couer the wyth hys fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thyne hope ſhalbe vnder hys wynges.</hi> That is: Yf thou alſo wylt put thy truſt in hym, thou ſhalte fynde it ſo lykewyſe. For he ſheweth ſuch his benefites vnto all and euery one that put theyr truſte in hym. As for the couerynge of hys fethers and hope vnder his wynges, youre charite hath herde ynough afore what it is.</p>
            <p>Now though all faythfull loke for ſuche helpe at God, and it happeneth vnto them, yet is it not done without a ſpecyal battayl of fayth. For ſuch helpe doth he promyſe vs in hys holy worde, that we ſhulde beleue it. And yf we beleue it, it happeneth vnto vs accordynge to oure fayth. Therfore ſayeth the prophete moreouer: <hi>hys truth is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re and ſhylde.</hi> That is, hys godly promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whych are ſure and true, and nother lye nor deceaue: Thoſe be oure wapens wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth we fyght, and ouercome al aduerſyte. But lyke as ſpere and ſhylde are not profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto hym that can not vſe them, nor wyll: Euen ſo alſo do not the promyſes of God profyte hym, that can not fyghte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and wyll not beleue theron. For that is the ryght ſcyence in this battayll whan
<pb facs="tcp:4465:12"/>
myſfortune, aduerſite or tentacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commeth, that we loke aboute vs accordynge vnto Gods worde: Namely what comforte and promes he hath made vnto vs in ſuch a caſe, and wyth a ryghte belefe to take holde of the ſame as of a ſhylde, and to comforte and defende oure ſelues therwyth, ſo can ther no miſchaunce do vs harme, as the holye Saynte Paule in the laſte chapter of hys Epiſtle to the Epheſians teacheth &amp; ſayeth: Before all thynges take the ſhylde of fayth wherwyth ye maye quench all the fyrie dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the wycked.</p>
            <p>Agaynſte the ſame (namelye agaynſte Sathan oure head enemye) is ſuche worde of God, euen the ryghte ſpere, wherwith we wounde and ouercome hym. For no bodely wapen hurteth and hyndreth men ſo ſore, as the worde of God ſtoppeth and hyndreth Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>than. Yf it be thruſt vnder hys noſe agaynſt hys venymous dealynge and temtation. For yf a ſeruaunt (that dealeth wrongeouſly and vnthriftely in hys maſters goodes and buſineſſes) be afrayed, vexed, and perſed tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rowe the hart, whan a ſymple man ſayethe vnto hym: Thou vnthrift why dooſt thou ſo. That is not thy maſters wyll and mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, he dyd not ſo commaunde me. Howe
<pb facs="tcp:4465:13"/>
much more goeth it thorowe Satans harte, whan a vertuous Chriſten man holdeth the worde of God vnder hys eyes, and bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth witneſſe ouer hym, that he as a wicked creature handleth agaynſt hys maker, and agaynſt hys choſen chyldren? Therfore doth holye ſaynte Paule call Gods worde alſo the ſwearde of the ſprete: And the Lorde Chriſte defendeth hymſelfe onely wyth the ſame agaynſt all tentacions of Satan in the wylderneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now whan thou takeſt holde thus of Gods promyſes thorow fayth, and vſeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſpere and ſhylde to defende thy ſelfe, and to ſmyte Satan, then out of the ſame it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth as the prophet ſayeth farther:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thou nedeſt not to feare for the horribleneſſe of the nyght.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the arowes that flye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daye tyme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the peſtilence that commeth priuely in the darke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the ſickneſſe that deſtroyeth in the noone daye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe foure aduerſites ſet forwarde
<pb facs="tcp:4465:13"/>
and ſhorten the lyfe of the vnbeleuers: But the faythfull hath ſuch conſolacion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that he nedeth not to be afrayed. Fyrſt for the horribleneſſe of the nyght. That is, for all maner of tentacion and deceate, that happen vnto men by nyght in the dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe. For thys we all perceaue, that in the nyght and in the darkneſſe we are weaker mynded, of more deſpare, and more afrayed them in the lyght. The bloude runneth to our hartes, and the heeres ſtonde vpryght, &amp; all the body waxeth colde for feare. Out of thys commeth it then, that we thynke we ſe, heare and perceaue ſomwhat, which in very dede is not ſo. Then goeth ther one aſtray, another leſeth hys coloure, the thyroe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſyck, the fourthe is become crocked, the fyfthe goeth out of hys wyt. And ſo men thynke, that the deuell hath done it, where as it is yet a playne naturall workynge of the exceadynge grete feare, whyche wolde deſtroye a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen by daye tyme, yf it were ſo greate. Howbeyt true it is that the deuell cauſeth ſuch feare, and prynteth it in, that he maye begyle and deſtroye vs by feare as by a naturall workynge. Yet is it nothyng but a feare: for the prophet calleth it not an

euel or good ſprete, but planely the horrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nyght. Nother is it ony thynge els alſo but an horrour and feare, &amp; continueth an horrour and feare.</p>
            <p>Therfore where a ryght belefe is, there is no feare. Where no fearfulneſſe is, there is alſo no horrour, nor fantaſie of ſpretes, or deceatfulneſſe of the nyght, but playne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and boldneſſe. Yf onye thynge els be ſene (as fyre or lyghte) they be but naturall thynges, out of the heate of the ground, lyke as lyghtenynges, draggons, fallynge ſtarres and cometes be in the ayre &amp; in the heauen. But herewithall wyll not I ſpeake agaynſt the wonderfull viſions and tokens, whiche god ſendeth for a warnyng befor greate my ſchaunces to come.</p>
            <p>Secondarely, is the faythfull ſure for the arowes that flye in the daye tyme. That is all maner of miſchaunces which ouertake a man openly in the daye: and yet ſo ſodenly and vnwares, that he can not eſcape them. As whan a tyle falleth from the roofe of an houſe, whan a wycked beaſt doth euell, or whan an vngracious perſonne doth hurt in body, name or good. For ſuch miſfortunes come for the mooſt parte ſo ſodenly, that a man can not preuente them, but muſte let
<pb facs="tcp:4465:14"/>
them hyt as wyth an arowe, and afterward reſtore and heale the harme wyth greate trauayle and laboure. But nowe wyll God preſerue hys faythfull from ſuche miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, yf they haue hys promyſes before theyr eyes, beleue theron, and ordre theyr lyues therafter.</p>
            <p>Thyrdly, a faythfull perſon nedeth not alſo to be afrayed for the peſtilence, that ſlip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peth in preuely in the darke. Thys is verely a confortable promes in thys daungerous tyme, for the whiche we ſhulde by ryght put oure truſt in God, and thanke hym therfore for aſmuch as it is one of the mooſt perlous and horrible plages, wherwyth he viſyteth and punyſheth the ſynne of the worlde. For it taketh hold of lyfe vnwares, and plucketh a man awaye in two or thre dayes (or euer he can ordre his buſyneſſe and houſe, &amp; make hys teſtament) crepeth in preuely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darke ſo that no man knoweth what it is, or whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it commeth, or whyther it goeth, therfor can ran no man kepe hymſelfe ſurely from it: For yf it were in meate or drynk, it myghte be eſchued: Yf it were an euel taiſt, it myght be expelled with a ſwete ſauoure: Yf it were an euell wynde, the chambre myghte wyth diligence be made cloſe therfore: Yf it were
<pb facs="tcp:4465:15"/>
a cloude or myſt, it myght be ſene, &amp; auoyded Yf it were a rayne, a man myght couer hym ſelfe for it. But now is it a ſecret miſfortun that crepeth in preuely, ſo that it can nother be ſene nor herde, nother ſmelled nor taiſted tyll it haue done the harme.</p>
            <p>Therfore the more daungerous and noyſome that the plage is, the better &amp; more excellent is the promes, that no man ſhulde haue cauſe to deſpare. For how might God make vs a more excellent and fayrer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, then that he promyſeth to delyuer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the peſtilence, vs that be hys chyldren, and that we nede not to be afrayed therof, though a thouſande dye of the ſame at oure leftſyde, and ten thouſande at our ryght ſyde Yet ſhall it not reach vnto vs, yf we do but beleue thys promes, and let it be oure ſpere and ſhylde. For yf we ſo do, then ſhall ſuche poyſoned arowes eyther not hytte vs at all, or els not wounde vs to death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God wyll alſo preſerue hys chyldren from the ſickneſſe that deſtroyet<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now whether it be frare of the nyght or arowe of the daye, whether it be peſtilence or ſickneſſe, that commeth by the euell Southewynde, or what plage it wyll that lyeth vpon the worlde becauſe of theyr ſynnes, God the Lorde wyll preſerue hys faythfull therefrom, or delyuer them from it: and that ſhall come to paſſe ſo certaynly and ſo wonderfully, that (as the Prophete ſayeth) thoughe a thouſande fall at thy left ſyde, and ten thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de at thy ryghte ſyde yet ſhall it not touch the.

For we can do God no greater dyſhonoure, then to dyſpayre in hys holy worde. We oughte therfore to be

much more afrayed of that inordinate feare then of death it ſelfe: for death can not hurt vs, in aſmuch as we (thorowe baptyme) are grafted &amp; buried vnto lyke death with chriſt. But fearfulneſſe (which is nothyng els but an vnbelefe) maye harme vs, and bringe vs in to imprudence.

            <p>And that ye maye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more eaſely beleue it, I wyll declare it vnto youre charite by a ſimilitude how it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, &amp; whence it ſpryngeth, that a ryght faythfull Chriſten man can be ſo ſafe and fre from all theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges: For it is good to vnderſtande, and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fortable to knowe.</p>

            <p>That God is the true, euerlaſtynge and heauenly lyght, wytneſſeth Ihon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt in the fyrſt Chapter, and ſayeth: God was the worde, in hym was the lyfe, and the lyfe was the lyghte of men. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe alſo in hys Canonicall epiſtle in the fyrſt Chapter: God is lyght, and in hym is no darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>In lyke maner, That he is the onely inuincible ſprynge of all lyfe, wytneſſeth the prophete Ieremy in the ſeconde chapter For there ſayeth the Lorde: My people commytteth a dubble ſynne, they forſake me the lyuynge ſprynge of lyfe, and make themſelues fayre welles, whyche neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe geue no water. And Dauid ſayeth in the .xxxv. Pſalme: With the is the ſprynge of lyfe and in thy lyght ſe we lyght.</p>
            <p>Yf God the Lorde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the true lyght, it followeth, that all they whyche put theyr
<pb facs="tcp:4465:18"/>
truſt in hym, be as a brennynge candle: for by fayth doth God dwell in our hartes, and we are the lyuynge te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God, as Paul to the Corinthians doth wytneſſe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once. Therfore ſayeth Chriſt of hys diſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Math. v. Ye are the lyght of the worlde And of Ihon the baptyſte: He was a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge and ſhynynge lyght.

Who ſo beleueth on me as the ſcripture ſayeth, out of hys body ſhall flowe ſtreames of lyuyng water: But this he ſaid of the ſprete, which they that beleue on him ſhulde receaue.</p>
            <p>Lyke as the darkeneſſe of the nyght now can hurte no earthly or worldly lyght, but muſte geue place and flye from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyght: Euen ſo Sathan alſo whyche is a prynce of ſpirituall darkeneſſe, can do no harme to a true ryghte beleuynge Chriſten man; but muſt feare and flye from hym: For God, which is the euerlaſtynge lyghte, dwelleth and ſhyneth in hys hart, and dryueth and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelleth farre from hym all the workes of darkneſſe. And lyke as no heape of water ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dryue backe ony fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayne of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de,

and hynder the quycke ſprynge therof, and lyke as no vnclenneſſe can make it ſoule, euen ſo alſo can no aduerſite of this worlde take awaye or ſhorten ony chriſten mans lyfe. For God whyche is the fountayne of al lyfe, dwelleth and lyueth in hys harte, and dryueth all hurtfull poyſon and mortall ſyckneſſes farre awaye from thence, ſo that not only it can not harme hym, but he alſo helpeth other people, and delyuereth them by hys preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: euen as a lyght that ſhyneth farre aboute it, and as a ſprynge that alway floweth, runneth &amp; maketh the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, moyſt and frutefull.</p>
            <p>And thys is it that the Lorde ſayeth in the Goſpell, in the laſt of Marke: The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens that ſhall followe them whych beleue, are theſe: In my name ſhall they caſt out deuels, ſpeake wyth new tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, dryue away ſerpentes: and yf they drynke ony deadlye thynge, it ſhall not hurte them: They ſhall laye handes vpon the ſycke, and they ſhall recouer.

            <p>Let Sathan then preaſſe in here wyth all hys darkneſſe and wyth all hys hurtfull infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſhall ye ſe in belefe, that he can not take nor deſtroye ony Chriſten man therwyth yf he continue in fayth, and kept God in hys harte: But he ſhalbe ſmytten backe and dryuen awaye by force, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfull workes of Chriſte and of all ſayntes do manyfeſtly declare. Therfore is it a great ſhame for a Chriſten man to be ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed for the plage of the peſtilence, as to flye from them whom he is bounde to ſerue by Gods commaundement.

And no man nedeth to thynke nor iudge, that they whyche dye of thys plage, be all vnchriſten and faythleſſe: but we ought not to doute but that ther dye therof many vertuous men, and leaue many vngodly. Thys is done, becauſe that death maye happen to a man two maner of wayes.</p>
            <p>One waye, after the commune courſe of nature, accordynge as euery mans death is appoynted hym of God: and we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſented vnto it in baptyme. Of thys ſayeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophete Iob in the .xiiii. Chapter. A man hath hys appoynted tyme, the nombre of his monethes ſtandeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the: y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt appoynted him his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, which he ſhal not ouerpaſſe</p>
            <p>Another waye maye death happen to a man before the tyme, by reaſon of hys great &amp; greuous ſynnes: As the Lorde hath threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by Moſes, that yf hys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be not kept, he wyl cauſe peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to reigne. Wherout it is certayne, that whan they be kepte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plage abydeth out. Lykewyſe ſayeth he in the commaundements: Honour father and mother that thou mayeſt lyue longe &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:4465:20"/>
Out of the whiche it is certayne, that hys lyfe which doth them not, ſhalbe ſhortened. In lyke maner ſayeth Dauid in the .iv. Pſal The bloud thyrſty ſhall not bryng theyr lyfe to the halfe nombre. Wherout it is ſure that they ſhulde lyue muche longer, yf they ſhed not innocent bloud. Lykewyſe ſayeth Chriſt Luce. xii. Yf ye do not repent, ye ſhall all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe, as they that the tower in Siloa fell vpon. Where by it is certayne, that who ſo repenteth not, maye loke for al myſfortune.</p>
            <p>And of thys vntymely death only ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thys Pſalme, and promyſeth the fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full chriſten men, that they ſhalbe fre from it. For from the ryght appoynted death in to the whych we haue conſented in baptyme, we can nor ſhalbe delyuered. Wherfore yf a vertuous ryghte Chriſten man dye of thys plage, it is certaynly hys very houre appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vnto hym of God, whyche he can not preuente. But doutleſſe ther dye of it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſynners alſo beſyde, whych myghte wel lyue longer yf they repented. And though ſome be taken becauſe of theyr ſynnes, yet be they not therfor damned: but yf they axe forgeueneſſe of ſynnes and beleue, they ſhal be ſaued. As Paule ſayeth: Whan we be iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, we are chaſtened of the Lorde, that we
<pb facs="tcp:4465:20"/>
ſhulde not be condemned wyth the worlde.</p>
            <p>Thus goeth it then together, that iuſte men dye theyr owne ryght death, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked dye an vntymely death, and therwyth doth God punyſh the worlde ſoreſt of al be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe of theyr ſynnes, but ſpareth hys own for theyr faythes ſake. Therfore ſhulde they not be fearfull nor fayntharted, but (as the prophet ſayeth) they ſhulde loke and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, how the vngodly are reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penced: For whether the wycked dye before the tyme, or the iuſte in the ryghte ſeaſon, yet is it done both for the puniſhment and plage of the vngodly. Yf vertuous fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers dye from wycked diſobedient chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then be the chyldren plaged, for they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde euell nurtoured, hanged or ſlayn.

Yf tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes dye, then be they puniſhed, and the perſecuted Chriſten delyuered. Yf good rulers dye, which wyth theyr wyſdome haue maynteyned peace and good gouernaunce, then be they in peace: And ſo the vngodly which are lefte alyue, rayſe vp warre and

Wherfore whether good men dye or lyue, it is done for theyr welthe.

            <p>SEynge now that God hath called your huſbonde, father or other good frende out of thys myſery into euer laſtynge ioye, therfore ſhall ye receaue it wyllyngly: for it is hys worke. Repyne not therfor at hys worke, nother wepe agaynſte hys wyll, but committe the cauſe vnto hym: take it of hys hande as a fatherly prouynge, and ſaye wyth Iob: God hath geuen vs hym and hath taken hym agayn, the name of the Lord be bleſſed: as it was the Lordes wyll, ſo is it happened.</p>
            <p>God almyghty wyll proue you as he dyd Iob how ye wyll behaue youre ſelfe as he ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth out of youre ſyghte the thynge that ye loue. He wyll admytte well ynoughe that ye be ſorye. For it is ſeldome ſene but a man (be he neuer ſo vyle, or of ſo lytle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) hath euer a ſondery gyfte wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſerued and profyted other. And the ſame gyftes were not greatly regarded in a man
<pb facs="tcp:4465:22"/>
whyle he lyued: for we regarde lytle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munely ſuch thynges as are preſent, but as ſoone as the man is gone, ſo ſoone as the veſſel is ſpylte than begynne we to want the gyftes that where conteyned therin.</p>
            <p>Therfore is it no maruayle that we be ſory for ſuch a gyfte of God, yf it be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of oure ſyghte.</p>
            <p>As longe as we vſe men and the gyftes accordynge as they be ordyned of God for our neceſſite, than do we well, and that can God ſuffre well ynough: But that we my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſe them and make an ydoll of them, that can not God ſuffre. For whan we put oure truſt and confort in man, or ony other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do we wronge and myſuſe the ſame and the curſe commeth vpon vs wherof it is wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieremye. xvii. Curſed is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that putteth hys truſt in man.</p>
            <p>For all mans helpe is to be ſuffred only whan they be preſente &amp; that we haue nede of them: but as ſoone as they are gone, than muſt we loke for other helpe, namely: God lettynge go it that paſſeth awaye thynkyng it to be temporal, faydyng at the twynklyng of an eye, and vanyte that is in thys world. We haue here no abydynge thyng, but muſt loke aboute for the thynge to come that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
<pb facs="tcp:4465:22"/>
for euer.</p>
            <p>For thys cauſe doth God draw and pulle vs ſo from the creatures. And ſeynge he is oure true father, brydegrome and huſbonde he can not (for he is ſtronge &amp; gelous) abyde that we ſet oure hope, loue or truſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ony creatur. Thys is the cauſe then that he doth take vs from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and caryeth vs vpon hym, ſelfe. For loke on what creature we haue mooſte hope, loue and affection, that wyl he ſooneſt take out of our ſyght: yf he doth loue vs. And whan he hath ſuche gelouſy vpon vs than doth he mooſt chefely declare hys loue towarde vs.</p>
            <p>By thys alſo it commeth that Chriſte Mathe. xviii. forbyddeth vs to call ony man father vpon earth, for we haue only one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen, namely God, which wyl nor can ſuffre vs to call or to haue ony ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon earth father: &amp; that becauſe we ſhuld depend and hange only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, lokyng for al good of hym. For he wyll be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame that we maye hardely truſte vnto: ſeyenge he can not nor wyll fayle vs, &amp; that becauſe he is no earthly but an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father. For thys cauſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that man bleſſed and happy, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hys truſte, hope and confidence in the Lorde, as the prophete ſayeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4465:23"/>Fynally yf whan nature fulfylleth hyr courſe, man hath but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall trauayll and myſery, and after that thys courſe of nature is ended and at reſte, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is eaſed of ſo great trauayll: we ſeme to hate rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue them that be departed, yf we wold wyſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be in thys wretched worlde agayne. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer in makyng ſo muche of oure frendes departed, and ſettynge ſo greate affection vpon them, wyſhynge Gods worke not to be fulfylled vpon them, we blame God in hys wyll and workynge: as though he knew not better what were beſt both for them and vs than we.</p>
            <p>Let vs therfore ſet oure wyll in Gods wyll, and ſuffer hym to worke at hys pleaſur. For he knoweth beſt what is both oure frendes and oure ſoules health.</p>
