            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20507:10"/>
matter of this subiect; so farre (in opinion) diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from my ordinarie imployments: It may please you to conceiue, that it is not altogether contrarie to my publike profession, as being a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> though no professed <hi>Diuine:</hi> and therefore may stand with my ordinarie worldly trauailes. For I am not ignorant, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is bound, to inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, in his function of this present life, to seeke the meanes, to know, and to attayne vnto the life to come. And what I haue done in this, I may truly
<pb facs="tcp:20507:10"/>
say I haue done it only, (with earthly, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) to entermixe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease my spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation and comfort; by these priuate, (though weake) <hi>Meditations:</hi> Not purposing to haue expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to the variable censures of <hi>exquisite wits,</hi> whereunto I know they are now subiect: But that some of impartiall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as I hold them) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an accidentall view of them, thought it not vnfit (weake as they are) that they should be made publike: for the mouing of others, to a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:20507:11"/>
of their fraile estates, being all subiect to one and the same mortalitie; as also in the course of their liues, to the like cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their doings, and execution of their vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this present life; which reasons, I trust, may excuse both mine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking and the publishing of these my weake <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may also be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how I could presume, to make choice of your Honorable <hi>Patronages,</hi> of a worke so weake, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. It may please you also to conceiue, that they
<pb facs="tcp:20507:11"/>
more properly belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Honors (as being my labours) then to any other: especially for that I am subiect in accompt, vnto that <hi>Honorable Table,</hi> of mine imployments, principally vndertaken by your directions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: And for that your imployments require not the totall allowance of time, which (to my little profit) I find my selfe to haue; I can no better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the idle <hi>interims</hi> of the rest of my libertie (my dutie and care, to answere your expectations in my seruice, duly respected and
<pb facs="tcp:20507:12"/>
performed) then to seeke mine owne satisfaction, in that which immediately concerneth not your or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie imployments: But my future accompt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other seruice, enioyned me by another <hi>Master.</hi> And although it be true, that, <hi>a man cannot serue two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, God and Mammon:</hi> he may yet serue GOD and <hi>Man:</hi> But in seuerall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; <hi>God in Spirit and Truth:</hi> And <hi>Man</hi> in <hi>Loue,</hi> and <hi>faithfull execution of his vocation:</hi> And hee that so serues the one, as hee neglect not the other; He is that <hi>faithfull seruant</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:20507:12"/>
that one, that shall reward him here with an inuisible gratuitie, <hi>peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> and of that other, who shal recompence him with a competent <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall salarie.</hi> This is that <hi>gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meane,</hi> which whoso keepes (be he of highest or lowest function in the world) wades safely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the two <hi>extremes:</hi> for, he that so serues <hi>Man,</hi> as he neglects <hi>God:</hi> Or so serues <hi>God,</hi> as he is no way seruiceable to the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common-weale,</hi> serues rightly neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Man.</hi> For, as GOD crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man for himselfe, as
<pb facs="tcp:20507:13"/>
touching his <hi>spirituall:</hi> so hath hee enioyned labour for man, as touching his <hi>corporall</hi> part. And both these may bee performed (and ought) by euery man, without exception, according to his calling: Nay, one stands not with-out the other: But the one is performed the better for the other: for, without seruing of God, no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is obtayned, &amp; with-out Gods blessing, <hi>corporal labours</hi> neither prosper, nor profit man: and with-out an honest calling duly and truly executed, <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Man</hi> is rightly serued.
<pb facs="tcp:20507:13"/>
Therefore I, (though I come far short of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in either) do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour with vnfayned desire, so to walke and work, as I may perform my dutie to both: Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requiring your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> to shewe the like mind towards mee, as doth my <hi>heauenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> namely, to <hi>accept the Will for the Deede:</hi> So shall I thinke my selfe happy in my reputed vnhappinesse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to bestowe the residue of mine vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant pilgrimage, as neere as I can, to the discharge

<pb facs="tcp:20507:15"/>
long to punish sinners, I had perished through thy iust iudgement long agone, euen in my youth; for, as soone as I was able to speake, though vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little, I indeuoured to excuse my childly errors with vntruths, falshood, &amp; lying; growing to mans estate, and to the abilitie to act greater sinnes, I omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no one forbidden vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie offered to any of my sences, but greedily imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it; and as I increased in yeeres, and in strength to sinne, so did I increase in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting wickednesse; neither reuerencing thee,
<pb facs="tcp:20507:16"/>
nor seeking to know thee, or to obey thee according to my dutie, but rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee and thy Lawes, as if thy threats against sinne and sinners, had been only to terrifie and not to punish them: And thy promises of spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and future happines, had been only to withdraw mee from my carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights (wherein I reposed all my felicitie) perswading my selfe there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in sin, nor reward for well-doing.</p>
            <p>Thus foolish was I, and ignorant by nature, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I had no originall

            <p>This masse of miserie befell me by the fall of the first man <hi>ADAM,</hi> in whom I was first good, and pure, and righteous, and holy, like vnto thee, O God of heauen: And had not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> defaced that Image of sanctitie in himselfe, I should haue remained holy, as thou art holy for euer. But by his disobedience I lost in him all obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thee, and became a

Rebell like vnto him, euen in his loynes, for, in him I was conceiued in sinne, and through the corruption of that my conception, I only bring forth iniquitie.</p>
            <p>Beeing thus miserably cast downe from glorie to shame, from light to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, from sanctitie to sin, from Heauen to Hell; to whom shall I appeale for reliefe? whose aide shall I craue for the obtayning of thy fauour &amp; loue againe? for, being depriued of thee, I am dead, being aliue: if I die without thee, I die eternally: But, Lord, now I know thee, and whom

thou hast sent, <hi>IESVS CHRIST;</hi> and I know, that in thy seuere iustice through him, thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest mercie; and in thy fierce wrath, thou shewest compassion, which in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeareth so much, as in the performance of thy promise in sending thy Sonne, the Seede of the Woman, who according to thy Couenant hath conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Satan, and trodden downe the Serpent, by whome our first Parents were inuenomed and stung vnto death, and I in them: But now in and by that sacred Seede <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>

            <p>And for as much, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord God, as I must here continue, during thine appointed time, in this dangerous wildernesse of many vanities, subiect to many troubles, tryed with many temptations, and compassed with many
<pb facs="tcp:20507:20"/>
and infinite miseries and dangers: hauing of my selfe no succour, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, no safetie, but in thine alone fauour, power, and prouidence, I humbly pray and beseech thee, O mercifull Lord God, to looke downe from heauen vpon me, in mercy and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnesse: Shew mee thy wayes, teach mee thy pathes, leade mee euer in thy Truth, and instruct me in the things that I ought to learne, and learne mee how to practise, &amp; to leade my life according vnto the same, lest I follow vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and delight in sinne;
<pb facs="tcp:20507:20"/>
lest I fall into troubles, and there bee none to deliuer mee; lest Sathan preuaile against me, and I fall from thee; and lest I fall into dangers, and perish in my miseries.</p>
            <p>Turne thy face towards me, O Lord, and cheere me with the brightnesse of thine amiable countenance, for when thou turnest thy face from me, I faint; and when thou hidest thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, I fall fearefully. As long as thou art with me, I am safe; when thou leauest mee, then troubles afflict me, enemies insult me, and triumph ouer me;
<pb facs="tcp:20507:21"/>
I am then subiect to all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series: Satan with his temptations preuaileth, my corrupt affections misleade me, the world with vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties distract me, and I am not able to looke vp, my heart is cast downe, my mind is estranged from all goodnesse, and my will is carried into all forbidden things.

            <p>Hide not therefore thy face from me, O Lord, nor

            <p>In my necessitie furnish me, O Lord, with all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent meanes for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of my present life and estate here, in plen tie make me truly thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

paines to the bodie, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery death is not alike to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, nor euery humane creature of like resolution and patience, which may somthing extenuate or ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate the paine. And, no doubt, there is likewise great difference of the ioy or griefe of soules depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for according to the life and death of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so is the soule in hope or horror, at the instant of separation: for the <hi>Angels</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 22.</note> of God, or Satan, doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the instant of time, to receiue it, and to transport it to it place of diuine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and therefore is it sensible of present suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioy or paine; but in what degree of either,

And whether the soule be sensible of any earthly or materiall thing, in it passage from the bodie to it place (as some without warrant haue dreamed) is needlesse to dispute; yet thus farre I am bold to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, That the spirituall apprehension of the place whither it passeth, swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vp all sense, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and desire of visible creatures.</p>

                  <p>Death is certaine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, the time vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to all, yet all liue not as if their death were neer, or that they did think that death would come at all.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20507:54"/>
But let no man deceiue himselfe by his long life, that death is farre off, or that it hath forgotten him; it will come as a Thiefe <note place="margin">Death will come not looked for.</note> suddenly, to some sooner, to some later; to all when they least suspect it.</p>
                  <p>In the first Age of the World, men liued long, many hundred yeeres. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusalah</hi>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20507:55"/>
life in earth was found er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious.</p>
                  <p>As the World grew in <note place="margin">Decrease of mens ages.</note> age, so decreased the ages of men. In <hi>Dauids</hi> time the age of man was seldome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue threescore and ten; if hee liued to fourescore, it was reputed a great age &amp; rare, yet nothing pleasant to the partie; for weaknesse and infirmities of so many kinds, commonly possesse the bodies and mindes of that age, as these dayes are but a burden vnto them, yeelding only sorrow, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse, griefes and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And yet many of that decrepit age are loth to dye, which may argue no godly preceding life.</p>
                  <p>

time, liued one hundred &amp; twenty yeeres, and was then in that state of strength, and agilitie of bodie, and perfection of his sences, as in his best age, and strongest yeeres; yet he dyed. Mine own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall father liued one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and three yeeres, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and strong; much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for his agilitie, euen to that age: yet I doe not by these precedents, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any probabilitie or hope, that I shall liue much more then halfe his yeeres, though I presently feele no apparant tokens (but desire) of my dissolution. And therefore I account my life, but a meere watch for the time of death.</p>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:20507:56"/>
If I had seene the man that had liued many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres, and were yet in health and strength, I should bee farre from flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering my selfe, that I <note place="margin">Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on long life.</note> might liue the longer for his long life: yet I see that one man couets to attaine vnto the yeeres of the most aged. The man of sixtie, or seuentie yeeres desires to liue to eightie, he of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to one hundred, yet doe we scarcely see one man of ten thousand, to see one hundred, nor one of one hundred, seuentie yeeres, nor one of fiftie, fortie yeeres.</p>
                  <p>If I should liue one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres, when death comes, it is but as if I were

                  <p>I thinke it therefore wisedome, not to allow vnto my selfe the assurance of many yeeres, not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, nay, not of one houre: for I see some sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly stricken dead, yea, in a moment: a fearefull spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, <note place="margin">Sudden death in others, a fearefull spectacle.</note> yet little moouing some beholders.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:20507:164"/>
liues, &amp; how to entertaine death when it comes.</p>
               <p>As touching the first, <note place="margin">First point to liue godly.</note> we are inioyned, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound to liue godly; which comprehendeth all the dueties of a Christian life, which duties although <note place="margin">All duties performed by holy obedience</note> they be many, are all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by holy <hi>obedience</hi> to God, which consisteth in a perfect obseruing of his diuine Precepts, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 22, 23. Hos. 6. 6.</note> in doing that which is good, and auoyding that which is euill.</p>
               <p>The <hi>good</hi> commanded, <note place="margin">All good is of God, euill of ourselues.</note> cannot be done by <hi>nature,</hi> which is corrupt; but by <hi>grace,</hi> freely giuen: the <hi>euill,</hi> which is forbidden, comes, and is done by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> The effects of good
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:20507:164"/>
and ill affections, consist in action, by seuerall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the good which we doe, God worketh both in vs and by vs; the euill which wee doe, is of &amp; by our selues: The like in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; the good suffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with patience, not the euill of doing, but the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of euils and wrongs offerd, without grudging: The wicked suffer euen goodnesse, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wils, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit euils against the good wittingly, and with their wils: The good endeuour to leade their liues vnspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the world, not as did many <hi>Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,</hi> who had both the actiue and passiue parts of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20507:165"/>
doing good, and suffering euill, &amp; that in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>patience,</hi> wanting only diuine knowledge, &amp; consequently, <hi>faith:</hi> which are no more ours by <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> then they were theirs.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if I, or you <note place="margin">Outward vertues gaine but a bare name of holinesse.</note> should onely indeuour a kinde of <hi>Philosophical</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and morall goodnes, without the internal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>grace</hi> through faith; wee should by our such doing and suffering, gaine but that which they gayned, a <hi>bare name of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse;</hi> although wee (as some of them did) would voluntarily giue our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to death, wee should thereby gain but the more future miseries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:20507:165"/>
In all our doings and <note place="margin">We must haue God before our eyes, both in doing and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> sufferings, wee must set GOD alwayes before the eye of our mindes, <hi>taking hold of Christ by faith,</hi> by whome hee hath reueiled himselfe vnto vs (to be our louing Father) not vnto them: without <hi>Christ,</hi> wee are euen as the former <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were, <hi>vnder the curse;</hi> but, by and through him, made heires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glorie: whereof (although these <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> were endued with humane wisedome farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue vs, they had yet no vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of, nor were partakers of that true glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which is by Christ.</p>
               <p>Therefore must we, that liue in the light of <hi>Truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:20507:166"/>
striue to bee partakers of <note place="margin">We must striue to do better things, then the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did.</note> better things then they, that liued in the darknesse of <hi>ignorance:</hi> for vs to come short of their care (of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good they suppos'd good) in doing that wee know to bee good, were most palpable idlenesse, and seuerely punishable.</p>
               <p>We must therefore, <hi>while it is to day,</hi> studie, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to be holy in deede, not in shew, like the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises,</hi> whose seeming san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitic was all external, and internally were <hi>prophane hypocrites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the second point of Meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Second point, to prepare vs for death.</note> of the vncertayne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and to be prepared for death: cast your eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the fore-part of the former treatie, where you may peraduenture finde matter of Meditation tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point.

Lord, to ouercome my sinfull lusts, and what wanteth in my power, supply by thy grace, that I may at least still striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst euery sin, through the power of thy Spirit, that I may bée approoued a member of thy Militant Church here, where yet I am a stranger, and where I continually féele the wearisome warfare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the flesh and the Spirit, wherein I haue neuer the victorie, but by thine only power, but the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

holinesse thou requirest to be in me: let my outward integritie bee in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly simplicitie, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purenesse among men, as in thy sight. And the more that Satan by his meanes and ministers, endeuoureth to withdraw mine obedience from thée, so much the more let mée striue to maintaine that dutie and obedience which I owe vnto thée: And let thy loue towardes mée, draw mée to loue thée, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well when thou touchest mée with aduersttie, as when thou giuest me pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie: and fayle mée not in my greatest néed.</p>
               <p>Teach mée, O Father, to séeke and obtaine all

Accept it yet in him; he is thine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne in whom thou art euer well pleased, hée is my Redéemer, and hath paid the ransome for me, which for my sinnes was laid vpon me: and hee sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth now a Mediator, at thy right hand euen for me. Scatter therefore, O Lord, my sinnes as a mist, and mine iniquities, as a Cloud, and let my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse appeare as the Sunne, and mine Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie before men, as the noone day; that my heart
<pb facs="tcp:20507:235"/>
may alwayes behold thée. And let thy face of fauour and loue spread its beams so ouer mee, that I being inlightened by thée, may walke as in the cléere Light of sauing Truth, and be euer led by the hand of thy Grace, that neither sinne, Satan, the World, nor mine owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cause me to stumble and fall.</p>
               <p>Giue me, good Father, the Spirit of perfect Prayer: And although through the coldnesse of my Zeale, and weaknesse of Faith, I cannot cry vocally vnto thée alwayes alike; yet, accept the will, and the sighes and grones of my heart, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

wanteth to him that sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thée, but hee is filled with all ioy and spirituall consolation. In this ioy let all worldly ioyes bee swallowed vp in mee, and let mee preferre the peace of a good conscience, before all carnall peace and prosperitie.</p>
               <p>Teach mee, good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how to kéepe a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent account of all the benefits and blessings I here receiue of thée, and what vse I from time to time make of them; knowing that there will come a day, when I shall bee called to answere the same.</p>
               <p>Grant therefore that I may so gourrne my selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:20507:236"/>
that I may bee able with boldnesse and truth, to giue account of my time spent, and my talents, how I haue disposed them, that I may bee found faithfull in my little, and be made partaker of the greatnesse of thy Glorie in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens.</p>
               <p>Though I be a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger &amp; a Soiourner here in Earth, yet grant, Lord, that I may haue my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation in Heauen.
