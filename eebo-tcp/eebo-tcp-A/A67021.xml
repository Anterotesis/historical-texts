            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from our little Island of <hi>Nalacco</hi> with one of our Boats man'd with nine men, to discover what news, but coming amongst them I my self being one of them) we found it to be a small Vessel of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> strengthned but with seven men, and three of the chiefest of them the <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> had killed, and thrown away their bodies, but their heads they brought ashoar, the sight whereof made us firmly apprehensive of Gods immediate justice and Judgement shewed on them, that had bin so unjust to others; but for the 4. that were left alive, Captain <hi>Hayes</hi> bought them of the <hi>Bandaneeses,</hi> what Market he made I know not, but if he gave above pence a-piece, his Market was bad, in respect the last proved so ill; by these people we came to the knowledge of the agreement and peace concluded between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and us, for we found Letters to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the news of which made our Captain forthwith send away the 4. <hi>Dutchmen</hi> which he had bought, to <hi>Pullaway;</hi> we also proffered them the Vessell which our Captain had bought of the <hi>Bandaneeses,</hi> but their modesty was such, that they (to our admiration) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to accept of that which our purses paid for, so desired us to keep it and convert it to our own use, for by their Letters they were fully informed what strength both we and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63896:9"/>
themselves had comming, which made them civilly politick, or politickly civil.</p>
            <p>Now within a Month after our hearts were very much exhillerated by the approach of an <hi>English</hi> Ship, called the <hi>Lyons Claw,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of this Vessel banished our former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, and we that before were almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tristed to death, were now elevated into extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of joy.</p>
            <p>But the old Principle holds true, <hi>Nullum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olentum est perpetuum,</hi> no extream is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, neither were these extream new joyes to my self and some few others, which shall be forthwith knowingly and sadly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Ship which I formerly made mention of being arrived with commodities, caused our Captain to ruminate about the settlement of his Factory in the Island of <hi>Lantore,</hi> upon which it was demanded who would, or dared to venter the undertaking of the Factory in <hi>Lantore;</hi> and to speak according to truth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many were unfitting, and many were unwilling to go, because they fear'd an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Captain being in this dilemma, in respect of the unwillingnesse and disability of most of the Company to goe to the Factory, I with two more freely proffered our selves, and was as willingly and freely accepted, and

loaded with the retribution of many thanks from our new Captain, but our after experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence instructed us to believe that they were the wisest that staid upon <hi>Nalacca</hi> Island til the last, for although our thoughts were sowne with the seeds of profit, and expected to have reapt the double benefit in our Estates, we received more then trebble losses by the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Hollander,</hi> besides the great danger and hourly hazzard of our lives, and the extream punishment we received in our bodies, and all by the Jewish dealings of the too much insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate <hi>Hollander;</hi> as often as I think of their unparralelled and almost unimitable severity I cannot but admire, and praise with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that great God which strengthned and so much enabled me to undergo those heavie pressures which were loaded upon me by those Patrons of cruelty; God forgive them, and grant that I may be truly considerate and thankfull to him for sparing my life in such eminent dangers, and for preserving me he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ever since that time, it being from this time 31. years since those barbarous exactions were imposed upon me by the Turkish-like <hi>Hollander,</hi> whose baseness I want as much lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to express, as I crave patience to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; had our deserts importuned the lest of their Tyrannies, it would have put some gloss

upon the face of so foul dealings; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test (to my knowledge) we never treated them with the least incivility, but were alwayes willing to live quietly amongst them, but the turbulancy of their spirits alwayes put a false construction upon our true meaning, daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to subvert us, and those that were our Adherents, as shall forthwith be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p>Not long after our safe Arrivall and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Lantore,</hi> there arrived a Junck with a <hi>China man,</hi> laded with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, and hound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like after their scent came the full mouth'd <hi>Hollander,</hi> and with them a Vessel entituled, <hi>A Float,</hi> with great Guns in her purposely for Battery, this Vessell was towed most part of the way from <hi>Iackatray</hi> (which they now nick-name, and call <hi>Battavia)</hi> but these <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> lying about <hi>Lantore,</hi> began to parley with the <hi>Lantore man,</hi> and continued there parlying about two Months; but this benefit we had, that which the <hi>Dutch</hi> agitated by day we were informed by the <hi>Lantore</hi> men at night, by which we understood how impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate the <hi>Dutch</hi> was to have the Iland of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore</hi> into their hands and custody, sometimes they would fairly perswade and intreat the <hi>Lantore</hi> men to yield to their perswasions, and sometimes threaten them with Fire and

Sword, if they refused to condescend to their Proposalls; and sometimes telling them, that although they had given the Island to the King of <hi>England,</hi> they need not fear to disclaim what they had done, and make them Masters of it; for they could, nay and would interpose between all danger and them, and that they had sufficient strength to guard them from all the Nations in the world, if they would give them a pawn to enjoy the profits of their Fruits at those termes the <hi>English</hi> had conditioned with them: The <hi>Lantore</hi> men being in this perplexity, and doubting among themselvs what might happen to them by the refusal of what was proff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>red, addressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to us, desiring to be informed how we could secure them from these insatiate people whose perswasions were as plausible, as their threatning terrible; to whom we replyed that we conceived their fear was built upon bad grounds, in respect that we were confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent relief was not far distant from us, and that our Fleet would forthwith come to our assistance; therefore we encouraged them, and char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed them to be couragious, and not to yield to their unjust perswasions; These words so much animated them, that the next time the <hi>Dutch</hi> desired a pawn from them, they pleaded ignorance, telling them that they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63896:11"/>
knew not the signification of a Pawn, and made themselvs wonderfully inqusitive what that Pawn was which they made mention of; At this, the <hi>Dutch</hi> began to be something pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant, but with an advised consideration told them that they must bring a Brass Bason fill'd with Earth, and plant in the middle of it the branch of a Nutmeg Tree loaded with Fruit, and cause it to be presented to them by the hands of the chiefest men of their Islands; and this the <hi>Hollander</hi> told them was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Pawn.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lantore</hi> Men after a serious, but short pause, returned answer to this effect; Your Demands are our Impossibilities, for should we recede from what we have already done, both God and Man might justly brand us with Infidelity; and we could almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our selves into a confidence that your spirits are so Noble, that you scorn to unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest the <hi>English</hi> of what is their proper due, &amp; make our names for (complying with you) to be ingraved in every heart with the indela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Characters of base perfidiousnesse; But, rather then we wil do it, we will (as we are encouraged by the justness of our cause) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute our selves to the extremity of all mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s; and this is the sum of our intentions: To which the <hi>Hollander</hi> (whose malice boyl'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63896:12"/>
for utterance) reply'd, Since so it is, that no perswasions will allure you to your own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, you must expect to find the reward of your obstinancy, though we confess it is much against our inclinations to imbrew our hands in blood; yet rather then we will be frustrate of our intentions, we are resolved to make a Bonefire of your lland, think not that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> strenth can stand in competition with ours, for we own them but as a handfull in comparison of our selves, and when our suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse hath benighted your time, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess this truth, and acknowledge your owne follies; in the mean time, go, and be slaves to your own opinions; and know, that when you find repentance, we may chance to want eares.</p>
            <p>Thus this angry dispute being finished, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> much incensed and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the slender effects of their assiduous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, begin to plot how to obtain that by foul means, which their seeming fair meanes could not accomplish; to which purpose they begin to prepare their Vessell called the <hi>Float</hi> with her Battery Gunns, which being done, they forthwith assaulted the Town, and besides the <hi>Float,</hi> they brought some other Ships to lye in br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

serious consideration reflect upon their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannyes and our extremeties, think but how feelingly we were lash'd into miserie, and when we thought that our complaints would have induced them to be compassionate, their dispositions were so contaminated with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme, that their joyes were as exuberous as our sorrow; May not these enormeties well prove Arguments to invite us to beleeve, That if their Power were correspondent to their sanguine thoughts, wee should finde them worse Task-masters, then ever experience made the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> find from the hands of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> And for my own part, I seriously Protest, that if it pleased the Great <hi>Determiner</hi> of all things, to command me to yeeld my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be tormented, I had farr rather choose the <hi>Turks,</hi> then the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tortures, for the cruelty of their mercyes, I am confident, are far transcending the <hi>Turkish</hi> extremeties, and I know that their Viperous inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us would not be consumated, till com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated fury riotts it self into an unparaleld revenge; Yet, had the People (which are too much ebrietated with Mallice) but so much consideration, as to remember how many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent favours our Nation has formerly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated upon them, sure they could not but ingenuously confess, their dissabillity to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate

            <p>Being (as I have formerly told you) thus carbonadoed in our bodies, and sadly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our minds, we began to ruminate what course we might best take to procure some ease to our distressed and distempered selves; And after a short pause, we thought it convenient to perswade our enemies to furnish us with pen, inke and paper, that in a Petitionall way we might expresse our mindes to the chief in the ship, called <hi>Holland;</hi> the effect whereof was, That (in respect of our daily vexations and troubles, our bodies were very much impaired, and our hearts dejected) we desired so much favour from the chief of them, as to be a little free'd from our chains, and obtaine so great a priviledge, as to walk or sit between the Decks of the ship, that so our bodies and mindes might finde the comfort of a short relaxation; After some consideration, our hearts were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hillerated with the newes of our release, we (being forthwith taken from our Irksome Chains) began to conceit our selves into a strange kind of happines, but this happines, as it was soon obtained, so it as soon expired, for

we were forthwith (through their goodnesse and clemency) commanded to be put into a great bolt of Iron, about Eight foot long at the least, insomuch that we were forced to be idle because we could not stirr, but onely sit upon the Deck, and God knowes, wee had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of that before, if their pleasures would have given them leave to consider it; but they that felt no misery themselves, knew not how to commiserate ours, yet the extent of their favours was such, that every other day we were severally brought out of our bolts, but not for our ease, but for their pleasures, for we were compelled every one of us severally to answer to certain Interrogatories, insomuch that if they had found us in severall tales, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had never heard this sad truth from my mouth: but our constant sitting and lying grew so tedious to us, that we thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to Petition them againe for ease, yet we were something doubtfull in respect of our former Success, but the violence of our Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings strengthened our intentions, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to Petition, that we might finde so much favour from their hands, as to be rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained, and permitted to walke above, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Decks, as our Chains should permitt, and our occasions require; our Petition being granted, we were acquitted of our troublesom

Governour, being thus entertained, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to enter into a parley; the <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> being come from all the Islands of <hi>Banda,</hi> brought with them a pawn or a pledge to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to Captain <hi>Ball,</hi> relating to him the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme and severity of the <hi>Dutch</hi> towards them, and how they daily exacted upon them and murthered them at their pleasures, absing their wives, whilst they themselves lookt on, and dar'd not in the least resist them; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, their abominable drunkenness made them daily riot into all manner of misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, insomuch that at last they had made it such a customary thing, that it was (no lesse then wonderfull) to see them sober, and the truth is, they do so much bestiate themselves that they naturallize <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

no way prejudice himself, nor our <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: To which Captain <hi>Ball</hi> replyed, that in regard they had given (as he conceived) their Island already to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to reason, for him to take away that by force from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by favour; therefore he desired them to cease their importunity: To which the <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> generally replyed, That if that were all the obsticle, it might easily be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for they protested that they never gave the least consent to the <hi>Hollander</hi> to possesse their Islands, but that they voluntarily and violently came into their Island without their privety or consent, and had oftentimes desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but never received any Pawn, or Gage from them; and besides, the basenesse of their actions deterr'd th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> perceiving the intentions and resolutions of the King, rather then he would burthen his conscience with such a sin, re-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Castle into the hands of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> wishing them to make the best defence they could for themselves, withall, willing them to take notice that it was more his duty to God and his King, then their deserts, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed him to be so favourable; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to them, that as often as he ruminated upon their baseness and cruell exactions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>English,</hi> his thoughts were so much
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63896:32"/>
accuated with revenge, that had they not been un-edg'd by a diviner Power, they might well have expected a reward proportionable to their merits, hoping that this civility and elemency which he had used towards them, would hereafter perswade them into more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and moderation; so leaving them to their considerations, he departed, and from thence addressed himself to the King and his Councel to whom he most courteously, and to this effect exprest himself.</p>
            <p>I am very much grieved that ye should be so much your own oppressors, as to refuse a good so much conducing to your welfares, and out of an avaritious disposition become your own subverters; you complained of their oppression, informing me, that the most that you can present, they think too small for their acceptance, yet you cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which may restrain their lasciviousness, thus ye make your selves more slaves, and them more Tyrants; for be assured, that if ever they prevail so much as to come amongst you (as I am confident they will shortly endeavor) they will make you perpetually unhappy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that your lives will be greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to you, then ever they were before; so I leave you, future time may ripen your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs, though present perswasions can finde no harbour.</p>
            <p>Thus our renowned Commander having treated this Heathen King, and found all his labour and and paines to be ineffectuall, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the place, and repaired to his Fleet, where he was received vvith vvelcom and joy, or joyful vvelcomness, where for a time I left him, being desirous to give the Reader a a true and full relation of a piece of as most exact Tyranny as ever the Devil was owner of; I know the World is very much inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to censure, therefore some may wonder, and many may be very apt to say; Alas, how is it possible for me being aged, to retain all these things in my memory, so many years being expired since they were agitated; to which I shall in short reply, <hi>Scripta diu rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> things written, remain long, which if but observed, are subject to oblivion; the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63896:33"/>
truth is, that at opportune times, I alwayes committed my sufferings, losses, travels, and things memorable to paper, which is the best remembrancer, and although it hath been a long time buried in loose sheets, yet it retains as much truth as if it had been then printed; and if it shal be demanded why I had not then printed it, I shall (though bluntly) say, the reason is, because then was then, and now is now; for in those dayes our Nation was at peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and had I then printed it, I should rather have incurr'd the repute of an Incendiary, then a true Historian; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides my urged occasions, and daily imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beyond Sea, would not permit me to borrow so much time as to digest it according to my desires; if these Arguments will not prevail, I must submit to the censure of the World, but before I proceed. I shall onely make this short Protestation, That I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spoken, or will speak any thing out of malice or envy, although I must confess my losses and miserable sufferings might well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to thoughts of revenge, but that I will leave to the great Revenger of all wrongs, and proceed to my intentions.</p>
            <p>Now the season inviting us, we are sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the <hi>Banda Islands,</hi> whither I sailed with Captain <hi>Iackson,</hi> leaving Sir <hi>Thomas Dail</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:63896:33"/>
at <hi>Iackatray,</hi> upon which Islands I stayed the revolution of two whole years, so that my long abode there, and my daily observations both of the people and the Islands, will not permit me to bury the perfect knowledge of them in oblivion, neither dare I suffer my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to be so treacherous to me, as not to be mindfull, and sadly studious of those many and almost unutterable cruelties which were inflicted upon these poor <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> by those Monsters of men, the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for no other cause nor ground, but because their affections were so generally and fervently expressed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>English,</hi> I shall therefore neither add, nor diminish, but truly and punctually relate as sad a truth as ever Villains acted, or Innocents endured.</p>
            <p>It has been formerly related how the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the year, 1620. put those <hi>Lant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rians</hi> they could not take to flight, inforcing them to forsake their Towns and Houses, and flye into the highest hills in that Island of <hi>Lantore,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they submitted themselvs to their terrible mercy, the <hi>Dutch</hi> promising them that if they would speedily submit, they should find them mercifull; upon the hearing of this, these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed people submitted (though some of them) with much temerity, in respect they knew how customary it was for them to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63896:34"/>
their promises, nay their oathes, and how their pretended mercy was but the abstract or quintescence of all torments; the sense of this made them much mistrustfull of their mercy, which indeed (the preceding discourse will tell us) they had much reason to doubt thereof.</p>
            <p>These miserable people having tendered themselves into the hands of their enemies, were forthwith received with much joy and seeming allacrety, and immediately were transported to <hi>Neroe</hi> Island, where being come the <hi>Hollander</hi> caused 400. of the chiefest of them to be pickt out, this being accordingly done, they caused them to wash themselves; after which Ceremony they provided large store of the primest Provision they could get, and with much love and amity intreated them really perswaded of their free welcome, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that they hoped the future time should be spent in a more amicable way then the former; and as for their parts, they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wished, and desired their safety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and that they should alwayes finde them very willing to befriend them against all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, and were heartily sorry that they should so much distrust them, as to flye to the <hi>English</hi> for relief; but as they never much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued it, so they would now study to forget it,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63896:34"/>
desiring that all differences whatsoever might be absolutely composed, and all former inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and discourtesies might be perpetually oblitterated, to which intent and purpose they had transported them thither, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided necssaries for their refreshment.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Lantorians</hi> hearing with how much serenity, and (as they thought) candidnesse, they delated their affections, could not (as might well be imagined) but with much joy return them innumerable thanks for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of their bounty, and the bounty of their expressions; for indeed they having been much time distressed for want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, could not but conceive themselves to be very happy, finding so much plenty, where they might rather have expected the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of sufferings, then provisions, in respect of their former obst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thus the cheerfull <hi>Lantorians</hi> sate discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and feeding, being almost overjoyed for their happy and welcome entertainment, not knowing how sufficiently to retaliate such over-grown courtesies: Their Feast being ended, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> began to <hi>pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>After they had satisfied their appetites, and express'd their thankfulness to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> they prepared themselves for their departure, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> having (as it were) thus fatned them for the slaughter, told them, that they must be presented with another course before they parted, so leading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a Window, told them that they must walk to yonder Green place, and there receive their deaths from the hands of their Executioners, who were purposely provided to dispatch them; this unexpected Newes made such a sudden alteration in the countenances of the poor <hi>Lantorians,</hi> that they forthwith cryed out, <hi>O apetow!</hi> which is to say, <hi>Oh what is this!</hi> the Reader may judge what a terrour this unexpected Newes struck to their hearts, which but even now were as joyfull, as joy could make them, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

they carried them to the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where they were cruelly received by the <hi>Iaponeeses,</hi> and severally taken and cut in the middles alive, their Quarters being devided, they were sent some to <hi>Lantore,</hi> and some to other places, and set them up in the streets; was not this pure mercy, to dispatch those poor Creatures quickly, that no more cost nor char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might arise upon the maintenance of them? and after such fair and (seeming cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous) entertainment, to exact their lives for the payment of their Ordinaries; this Tragedy was acted in the Year 1621, since which time (and I beleeve hardly before) was the like cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty heard of, neither was this the conclusion of their revenge, as I shall to my best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour forthwith relate.</p>
            <p>In the same year 1621, these blood-thirsty men sent over to <hi>Pullaroone</hi> for the chiefest of the Inhabitants there, and after perticular examinations of them, executed them; the first that received his death was the chief Priest of <hi>Pullaroon,</hi> a man that I have often seen, and took more notice of him then of any other of the <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> that ever happened into my knowledge, he was a man of a very civil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, delighting to be courteous both in his speech and carriage; and as for his person he excelled all the <hi>Bandaneeses</hi> that ever I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63896:36"/>
for properness; this man they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded should be laid down, and then should have a hole cut in his side, into which hole they commanded Gunpowder should be put, so setting fire to it, deprived the poor Priest (in a most miserable manner) of his life, had <hi>Nero</hi> lived in those times, he might well have blusht to see how much he was outvied by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in Tyranny; I do verily beleeve that the like was never heard before; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these <hi>Pullarooneers</hi> were under our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, yet we dared not (in respect of our strength) to contradict them, but permit tem to murther these poor people before our faces, so that we perceiving how prevalent, Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, and incr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In those Islands I have constautly seen an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of <hi>Mackerell,</hi> which was the chief thing that supported those Islands, and if it happened that they came not in great showles, in two or three dayes we were sure to have them in greater abundance when they did come; for indeed the Island could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without them; but that which strikes the greatest admiration into my heart, is, That
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63896:36"/>
these great Showles of <hi>Mackerell</hi> (after the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> had left the Island) deserted it; which thing I look upon as the Justice of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty upon the <hi>Hollander,</hi> who were so cruell and tyrannicall over those Inhabitants, and also the <hi>English;</hi> and now having murdered the chief of the People, and apprehending the wholsomnesse of those Islands (which indeed were the wholsomest that ever I came into in all my travells) they by unjust means detain and keep them, not permitting the <hi>English</hi> (which have the propper right to it) to have any Commerce with them, which is very much to our dettriment; And truely, if the <hi>COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON-WEALTH</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> are pleased to let them enjoy that which is onely theirs by usurpation, and ours by the free gift of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, I must upon necessity rest satisfyed, but the knowledge that I have of those parts, and in the injustice of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> exacting them from us, must give me cause to think, that we rather incourage them to act the like thing againe, then desire them from it; but I leave it all to the grave judgement and Counsell of our Nation, whose discretions (the business being weighed in the Ballance of Reason) will induce them to desire, I hope, a proportionable satisfaction, and that the truth may be more fully and expresly known, I shall forthwith

            <p>Now Sir <hi>Thomas Daile</hi> having by this time come (with much difficulty) within the Straits Mouth of <hi>Sunday,</hi> and having dropt.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63896:40"/>
most of them again restored to their former healths, they having suckt, and rubb'd their aggrieved parts with <hi>Limes</hi> and <hi>Lemons,</hi> which is the best cure for the Scurvey that can be thought of, for it cureth (to my knowledge) the soreness of the mouth, fastens the teeth, and asswages the swelling of the flesh, and fastens it again to the bones.</p>
            <p>Suddenly after the well recovery of Sir <hi>Thomas Daile</hi> and his men, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> being a man of an active spirit, and hating dronish Idleness, betook himself again to Sea, and sayled to a Port called <hi>Meslapotaine,</hi> where being come, he was arrested by Death at the Suit of Nature, and gave an Acquittance to the World, and dyed; at which place a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument was erected, which I believe is to be seen to this day, in memory of so worthy and valiant a Knight, whose death was sadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored by all the Seamen, for their hearts were so much united to him, that their griefs for his loss swelled into great extreams: Thus leaving Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> in his Tomb, I will return to Captain <hi>Iourden,</hi> and give the Reader a short, yet true, Relation of what befell him by the Treachery of the perfidious <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> being a man more valiant, then prudent, sayling from <hi>Bantam</hi> (upon a design, not known, nor to this day
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63896:40"/>
can be imagined) with two Shipps, the one called the <hi>Sampson,</hi> and the other the <hi>Hound,</hi> to the great Islands of <hi>Burnew,</hi> and Anchored in a Port called <hi>Suckedany,</hi> and after a short, stay there he discovered 3. or 4. <hi>Dutch</hi> Shipps standing in for the same Port, the sight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made him confident that they intended no good to him, therefore he immediately gave order to prepare, and hasted aboard, fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to fight it out to the last man, rather then to yield himself, Ships, and men, to the unmerciful hands of his approaching enemies, in the mean time the <hi>Dutch</hi> approaching nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and neerer, at last summoned our Shipps to deliver upon fair Quarter, but Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> having like the Bee, <hi>Ingens spiculum, in angusto corpore,</hi> a great heart in a little body, absolutely refused to yield upon any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whatsoever; but the <hi>Dutch,</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing (as they pretended) to shed blood, called out to our men, and told them, that they knew little Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> was there, and withall desired them to perswade their Captain to parley with them, that so they might forthwith prevent those dangers that might accrew by the denyall of so civill a courtesie; Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> being informed of their desires (being much in fury) againe refused, which still made the <hi>Dutch</hi> more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63896:41"/>
to effect their own ends, to which purpose, they againe desired him that he would but show himselfe upon the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Deck, and speak with them, that so by a faire complyance they might salve up the difference, and stop the effusion of blood, which must needs happen, if not timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, at last Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> (his passion being something abated) thought that the speaking with them could not damnifie him, therefore went to the Quarter Deck, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himself to them, and after some words exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged between them, Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> told them, That he knew the justnesse of his Cause, and the injustice of theirs, and was resolved to fight it out with them to the last man, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> urging, That alas their strength was far greater then his, and it would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>f the blood of those men that should be slaine in the fight;</p>
            <p>All these words, and vain perswasions of the <hi>Dutch</hi> could no way alter the Resolution of Captain <hi>Iourden,</hi> he telling them, that he questioned not his strength, but was resolved to fight, and to leave the Success to God; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this; the <hi>Dutch,</hi> willing to bring their treacherous design to passe, protracted as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63896:41"/>
much time as they could, still keeping him in talke upon the Quarter Deck, till at length, a musket shott from one of the other ships killed Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> in the place while they were in Parley, and at that very instant of time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by trechery, or accedent, I know not, our ship called the <hi>Hound,</hi> was part of it blown up, and many of our men mortally hurt, which sudden businesse, caused such an amazement amongst our men, that they knew not for the present what to imagine; First, they saw their Captaine treacherously slaine; Secondly, They saw part of the <hi>Hound</hi> blown up; and thirdly, they saw that the <hi>Dutch</hi> on a sudden were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to come aboard, and being in this sad condition, they were enforced to yeeld to the mercy of their Enemies, who having made them their captives, caused them (according to their former use) to be put into Bolts, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us so much favour as they did to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> for they permitted them after they had taken them, to walk too and fro with a chaine, which is far more easy, then to lie in heavy <hi>Bolts</hi> of <hi>Iron;</hi> This is the favour we <hi>English</hi> have received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rom them, that we must either be troubled with a guard of <hi>Iron</hi> hearted men to attend us, or else lye in Bolts of Iron, or in the Stocks; but I must omitt to informe the Reader how the Ship called the <hi>Hound</hi> was conceived to be blown up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:63896:42"/>
During the time that Captain <hi>Iourden</hi> was in parley with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> our Boats, and theirs had free recourse to either of our Ships, at which time we had aboord the <hi>Hound,</hi> a <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall,</hi> who was in the <hi>Hollanders</hi> Ships severall times, and was known to some of them; we therefore supposed, that during the time of this <hi>Portugals</hi> stay with them, they inveagled him to set fire to some of our Cartrages which we had laid ready for the fight; but that which most of all confirmes our beliefe, is this, that this <hi>Portugall</hi> was seen severall times by these Cartrages with a Match in his hand, and it is verily thought, that he was hired to do it, in respect that it hapned so immediately after the death of Captain <hi>Iourden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may observe what injury and wrong we have sustained by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have been often desired to make satisfaction, and many of us that have been wronged and abused by them, did from time to time Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Lords and many other of the Kings Privy Councel, but found no redress, but our hopes are, that when our Honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State shall hear the sad cryes of the poor for Justice against that Nation of blood (the <hi>Hollander)</hi> who is not to be satisfied; for they will have the kernells, let who will take the shells.</p>

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63896:42"/>
Our Ship called the <hi>Charles,</hi> being about 1000. Tun in burthen came home, we forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with repairing to the <hi>East-Indie</hi> House, and informed the Company of our sufferings and losses, who told us they would do what might be done for us; not long after we were served with <hi>Subpoena's</hi> to attend the Lords of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Councel, where we onely heard the noise of satisfaction, but I for my part could never find the comfort of it; At that same time I <hi>Abraham Woof</hi> being examined, told the Privy Councel, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had taken and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed the Islands of <hi>Banda,</hi> which are of such concernment, as I then related, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> could never give the <hi>English</hi> satisfaction, how the business was smothered up, I know not; but I am sure if any was done, I will venter my life it was not to the value of a pin to a pound, and moreover I will make it appear, that they got those Islands onely by blood-shed, and murthering both the <hi>English</hi> and their friends, and possesses them by treachery and usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this day, and the people (if they have left any of them alive) are but slaves to the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and for the better satisfaction of all, I will here insert the Petition of one <hi>David Powell</hi> to the Lords of the Privy Councel, and the Account both of his, my own, and others now living, all of us being aged not under 60,

and if the Honorable Counsell of STATE shall think it convenient for us to set out <hi>Bills</hi> to summon in those that have been Sufferers, either them, their sons, or Grandchildren, I am confident we shall discover some hundreds which have been highly wronged by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and I am very sure, that many fatherlesse chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be relieved out of the Profits, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction they ought to make us; but I shall leave all to the Grave, and serious Judgements of the COUNSELL of this Nation, and the World to judge.</p>
