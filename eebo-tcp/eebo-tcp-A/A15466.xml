            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

greatest Captaines of <hi>Europe,</hi> can
witnesse, that I robbed neither superiour nor companion of his
right, much lesse hath been euer my thoughts to wrong any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
action: the which all or the most of you that knowe me
will beare witnesse, when my Netherlanders discourses with
others, comes out. I thinke <hi>Gonsalua</hi> was called the last
graund Captaine, but I perswade my selfe neither he nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before him had euer carried that name, without the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding
of a number of braue companions. The most worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Caesar</hi> although hee was highly ambitious, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in his <hi>Commentaries</hi> written by himselfe, hee imputed
part of his honour vnto his Lieftenants and Officers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should not others doo at the least the like, being not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be compared vnto the basest sort of his followers: no
honorable minds can bee free from honorable ambition, but
the ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be such (let the minde be neuer so great) if hee
robbs the honor of his companions, he wrongs himselfe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
his action. Few men of iudgement but knowes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for one man to conduct an Armie without Officers, &amp;
vnpossible for any state to knowe the worth of their Captaines
without being in action with great enemies: but for that triall
<pb facs="tcp:21333:4"/>
the <hi>Parisians, Gauntois, Antwerpians</hi> and such, would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
place squadrons in battailes, chuse grounds, march in what
order you would, arme men in good order, fortifie and discourse,
with other matters, to the shew, as though they had been great
masters of Campes: but when they were tried with the furie
of expert executioners, their warres prooued but May-games.
Although I perswade myselfe my Discourse bee Vnpleasant,
with small iudgement: notwithstanding, being perswaded
by honourable good friends, I tooke courage to print it: true
it is, no action ought to be printed without the consent of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
Actors, or at the least by one Principall, which ought to
signe his workes with his name, otherwise wee finde the most
Actors wronged and robbed of the most of their reputation:
some with enuie or malice, others with glorious ambition:
sometimes you haue most honorable quiet Estates wronged
with ambitious follies libells, the which are hardlie knowne
and found out: but being signed by the author, deserues hee
well, the honour is his; if ill, the shame shall be his. Men of
Warre ought to bee more open hearted, more liberall, and more
affable, than any other profession, although their secrets ought
to bee but vnto fewe, their hearts must be open vnto the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and liberall to confesse good deserts as well as with their
purses: although their resolutions be agreed on by two or three,
notwithstanding the more affable they shewe themselues vnto
the multitude, the greater will be their voges and loues. Some
tearme men wise for not speaking many words: true it is, idle
speaches are windes, and a disgrace vnto the speaker; but bee
they to good purpose, the more hee speakes, the greater is his
praise. You must thinke to repeate great actions, it requires
many words, to perswade the fewe expert companions to offend
or defend, a fewe words will serue: but to animate or disswade
the rude multitude, the more words and the oftner the better.
Wee doo finde the most Conquerours were greatlie aduanced
with the orations of their Orators, as well amongst the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
sort as the rude multitude: without speaches, the wise can
not be discerned from the foolish, nor without triall of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:21333:4"/>
against equall enemies, the perfects Captaine cannot bee
knowne from the most ignorant. Otherwise ignorance will
condemne Generalls, their followers and actions let them bee
euer so great, although themselues neuer carried places of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
either in field or towne, nor commanded more than ouer
their owne seruants, saying wee haue knowne great Potentates
Campes, and Courts. Let no man bee so simple to iudge them
worthie to condemne great actions or their actors, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imployed in their great affaires, it is hard for men to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
themselues well, harder to gouerne a few, more harder to
gouerne many, much more a great multitude; some can gouerne
a houshold, and cannot gouerne a towne; some can gouerne a
towne, and not a whole countrie. A man may be sufficient to
conduct a priuate companie, and not sufficient to command a
Regiment; likewise sufficient for a Coronell, and not for a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
But whether it be for policie or Armes, it is an error to
thinke men without triall worthie to bee compared vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tried, in what place soeuer great or small. Diuers play <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
on the stages, but fewe or none in the field. Our
pleasant <hi>Tarleton</hi> would counterfeite many artes, but hee
was no bodie out of his mirths. Many haue a vertue, few
hath many, none haue all: the most men lookes into their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

good Iustice; &amp; a braue Chiefe
cannot want a good Purse, if he
be second with his Prince or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
if their purse faile, a braue
Chiefe will force his Enemies
Countreyes to maintaine his
action, hauing a good quarrell: with the sufferance of
the great God.</p>
            <p>Is he resolute and valiant? Al the rest of his Officers
and Souldiers will resolue themselues, no coward shall
be aduanced; taking alwaies care vnto their words and
deeds: assuring themselues, this resolute valiant Man
will aduance vs, doo we deserue it; doo we ill, his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is such, he will not abide vs.</p>
            <p>Is he liberal and constant? Then are al that serue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him sure to receiue their due, rather more than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21333:6"/>
lesse, that come into his hands, &amp; assured to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
for their vigilant paines and trauell, and to bee
partakers aswel with his honorable acts, as with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
Purse: neither backbiter nor flarterer dares call
in question the name of a braue man, much lesse none
of his familiar acquaintance. If they should, then is the
other sure to come to his answere, and not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
without great faults, as noble Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> was
wont to say, <hi>Let vs loue him for his small vertues, for a
number haue none at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is he couetous and miserable? He careth not what
wrong he dooth to recouer wealth, cause men to ende
their dayes in euerie light skirmish, weary others with
wants and discurtesies, keep the Officers of his Armie
in pickes and quarrels, cause them to disgrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
lay al the fault on his felowes, spare neither friend
nor foe to recouer wealth; it is vnpossible for such a
Chiefe to end anie action honorablie: for he respects
the least of his bagges, more than his best Captaine;
and valures his crownes too good for his brauest soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
A multitude are not to bee contented, without
consuming great treasure; the sight of his gold, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
with his treasure will cause him to wish all his
troopes dead to recouer their dues. In short time hee
will discredit his Estate and action.</p>
            <p>Is he ambitious, in such sort that he thinks none to
be valued vnto himselfe, and that all seruices are done
by himselfe, resoluing none shal be aduanced, but such
as flatter his humors, enuying all other mens fortune,
and vertues? That man careth not what becomes of his
State and Action, longer than they maintaine his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
against all others, be it right or wrong.</p>
            <p>Is he proud and vaine glorious? All those that serue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21333:6"/>
vnder him, must flatter his fauorites to come vnto his
speech; when they come, there must bee nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traried;
if they doo, he will tearme them fooles, and his
fauorites deuise faults to condemne them, to please his
humors, and to maintaine his <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is almost vnpossible for anie one to haue all these
vertues; or for anie to be free from al these vices. To say
troth, Ambition is giuen to men of warre, more than to
any other profession: but let him be assured, whosoeuer
hath it as I speake off, ouerthroweth any action, vnles
the great God will haue the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Some thinke it hard to know these men, because euery
man thinketh himself valiant &amp; vertuous, or at the least
say honest &amp; iust. Their valure must be iudged by their
deeds, not by their words; the rest of their vertues are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
known, than theeues in a ciuil gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Theeues
are tried by God and their countrie, so ought these great
Captaines to be tried by the multitude that serues vnder
them; especiallie by their officers in general. Their feare
cannot stop the rumor of the multitude, nor their bribes
content few or none of the Officers, but such as respect
neither honour nor vertue, and care not how they come
by their fauor and wealth, so they haue it.</p>
            <p>Dutie, honor and wealth makes men follow the wars:
when Generalls rob their inferiors of all three, often it
makes honest minds quit their seruice, and the dishonest

               <head>One noble opinion of Mounsieur de La Nowe.</head>
               <p>THE famous <hi>Mounsieur de La Nowe</hi> was wont to
say, It was necessary for the greatest commanders,
to giue eare often vnto all their vnder Officers, I
meane their simplest Captaines, to heare their opinions,
concerning their Discipline in open audience. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was noble without ambition: for in all Armies,
there are a number of Captaines better Souldiers, than
many higher Officers; which can neuer bee knowne
without place to execute their art: which must bee in
action and audience before famous Superiours. These
liberties and curtesies make a number employ their wits
and valours daily to aduance their credites. It hinders no
great Officers, vnlesse they meane the warres should end
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21333:8"/>
with themselues; it aduaunceth the Warres, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
when they are gone, other experted knowne men
are placed in their roomes. This order must maintaine
good Discipline, otherwise ignorance happens often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the high places, vnknowne, vntill actions bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.
Those will say, wee are expert and as vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
as the others; let them say and bee what they list, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
they be knowne to be expert of action, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for a State to hazard their action in trying their
experience, and vnknowne fortunes. What corrupted
the discipline of the Netherlanders? chieflie placing
their ignorant cousins &amp; fauorites to command. Who
could haue won <hi>Gaunt, Antwerp, Bridges, Iper,</hi> with an
100 other townes, that wanted no necessaries for warres
if there had been expert Commaunders in them. These
strong places were lost shamefullie without blowes,
with twentie ouerthrowes in the field, with the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.
Therfore this noble <hi>La Nowe</hi> would say alwaies,
<hi>Checune a son mety;</hi> as much to say, Euerie man ought to
haue place according to his art. The martial <hi>Byron</hi> would
say also, These Coronells of three dayes, marres all the
Armies of the world. Notwithstanding, it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that some quick spirites proue to bee expert with
small actions: but so rarelie found, that it is dangerous
to giue them charge before they be well knowne.</p>
               <p>What makes the Spaniards discipline to be so famous
as it is? Their good order: otherwise it is wel knowne,
the Nation is the basest and cowardlie sort of people
of most others; so base, that I perswade my selfe, ten
thousand of our Nation, would beate thirtie of theirs
out of the field, let them bee chosen where they list; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some 3. thousand which is in the Lowe countries.
And those, for all they bee conducted by ancient expert
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21333:9"/>
Captaines accompanied with other Nations, nothing
inferiour to those Spaniards, both for valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
notwithstanding, the trained Troupes of our

the world dooth know fiue thousand of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

there were in the Town fiue thousand <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,

chiefest goods. Also by reason of our Armie staying in
<hi>Galitia,</hi> where 6000. of ours ouerthrewe 16000. of
theirs. Before we arriued at <hi>Lisborne,</hi> they had 20. daies
respit to arme and put themselues in order; but had our
Armie not touched at the <hi>Groine,</hi> and sailed strait to <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi>
as the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> did, neither Soldier nor Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

vnmanned, without any good order: &amp; when wee arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
had our Nauie entred, wee would haue entred the
Towne, or the world should haue witnessed, so manie
Englishmen had bin buried in that place. But let all the
Captaines of <hi>Europe</hi> iudge rightlie of our proceedings
from the first to the last, considering our small means &amp;
great crosses, they cannot denie, but both our valour and
gouernment, deserued 100. times more praise, than the
attempt of Duke <hi>Medina</hi> and his, on <hi>England:</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

we gaue them the law 30 daies in their Countries.
When sicknes with other wants forced vs to imbarke,
being followed with their Armie, we returned towards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21333:9"/>
them with lesse than 4000. Where the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi>
sent his Trumpet, to dare their Generall the Countie of

change the blows of the pikes, giuing him signall of his

perceiuing our resolution, before we could arriue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
3. miles of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al their footmen ran away to <hi>Lisborne,</hi>
being 3. for one. <hi>Fuentes</hi> with <hi>Don Gabriel de Ninis</hi> kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing

notwithstanding, the alrrme being giuen vs, the
Earle, and General <hi>Norris</hi> with the most of the Chiefes,
giuing order to our Squadrons to keep in that order we
marched, and to march with al speed to recouer the top
of a hil, a fine place to giue battell, assigned vnto them by
the trumpet, within halfe a league of their quarter. The
Earle, Generall, and Chiefs with the horsemen, aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with speed to the top of the hil, both to discouer the
Enemies order, and to choose a commodious place to
fight. At their sight, wee perswaded our selues by their
fashion to receiue battaile, our ensignes being displayed
on the top of the hill, and our squadrons possessing the
ground that we thought most fit: after resting a while, &amp;
perceiuing their cowardly resolution, adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced our bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
towards their quarter, vnknowne to vs but that all
their forces had bin in that village. At our approch, they
ran away in such sort, that our horsme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (being but 50. in
al, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst whom were diuers of our Chiefs, besides the

But to speake troth, no Armie that euer I saw, passes
that of <hi>Duke</hi> de Parma for discipline &amp; good order: the
which &amp; it pleased others to follow, it were not amisse.
And to that ende I thought good to show some parte of
the discipline and orders amongst them. None comes to
be high Officers, vnles they be knowne to be expert and
tried Souldiers of action, of long continuance; or for
courtesie to grace their Armies with young Princes, or
Nobilitie, or at the least Gentlemen of good qualitie;
neither must these contemne the basest Master of their
Campe. For all their birth, they must bee knowne vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
and of good discretion. These Noble men are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Generalls of horsmen, or commaund a Cornet; but
they will be sure to looke, that their vnder Officers shall
bee expert and knowne men; they shall not choose their
owne fauorites and followers: which maketh them to
maintaine the like discipline, when they come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
themselues: for without doubt, none can command
so well, as those which haue been commanded.</p>
               <p>Their State is gouerned with two sorts of people,
Captaine and Clergie. As the Captaines ambition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
the king to encrease his Warres, to maintaine
their estate in wealth and greatnes, so dooth the Clergie
perswade him also to warres, to maintaine their State, against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Religion. By this means the State of <hi>Spaine</hi>
during this gouernement can neuer be without warres,
and continuall warres must make expert Souldiers.</p>

               <head>The long continuance of their Armie.</head>
               <p>THis Armie of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> hath been in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vnbroken, since <hi>Charles</hi> the fift his troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Germaines.</hi> They haue continued in the Low
Countreyes three and twentie yeares. When the Duke
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21333:10"/>
                  <hi>D' alua,</hi> brought them thether, he found them readie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
in Regiments, vnder Ensignes and Cornets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Gouernors, Captaines and Souldiers, were
changed with casualties of Warres: notwithstanding
the Armie was continuallie maintained with one purse
&amp; discipline from the first houre vnto this, which must
be about 50. yeres. For that time, we must confesse, none
had the schoole of warres continuallie, but themselues.
Their actions shewes their discipline, which were not
amisse for others to followe. Their order is, where the
warres are present, to supplie their Regiments being in
Action, with the Garrisons out of all his Dominions &amp;
Prouinces: before they dislodge, <hi>besonios</hi> supply their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
raw men, as wee tearme them. By these meanes hee
traines his <hi>besonios,</hi> &amp; furnisheth his Armie with trained
souldiers: yet though these Garrison men be wel trained
Souldiers, God knowes they are but raw men for a long
time, in respect of the men of Action: then iudge you,
what difference there is betwixt expert Soldiers &amp; raw.
In my poore iudgement, (as I shewed before) all their
discipline consists in the Spanish. They maintaine also
certaine companies of ordinances, chiefly to content the
Nobilitie, as I will shew hereafter; they keepe in good
order their <hi>Caualeri, Italians, Burgonians</hi> and <hi>Albanetes,</hi>
for their great numbers I meane, to supplie their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as occasion presents. They make most account of
the <hi>Wallons, Burgonians</hi> and <hi>Italians:</hi> for the <hi>Almaines</hi>
they care not, but will hire them onelie to serue their
turne, when their Enemies leauie <hi>Germaines</hi> against
them. They haue great reason; for as long as any Prince
or Estate keepes continuallie 7000. expert footemen, &amp;
3000. horsmen, though his leuied Armie be 50000. the
ten thousand will both discipline them, and keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21333:11"/>
order: for out of the 10000. he may draw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinualy 100
or two experimented Soldiers to make officers, to train
the others. Besides he places diuers great Officers out of
his assured 10000. amongst his mercenaries; in the
which he shews great discipline; for there can be no da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
muteny in any Army, vnles some of the Chiefes
be priuie vnto it; and easily preuented if it be discouered;
and can not be but discouered by reason of this good
order.</p>

               <p>THey diuide their Armies into Regiments. All the

there are but foure <hi>Tertias</hi> Spanish, which are called <hi>de

he doth nothing, without the aduise and

faile to appeale vnto the King, &amp; Estate of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which
redresseth prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly any disorders. For sodain dispatches,
the King hath his counsell of war seuerally for euery of
his kingdoms and prouinces, where he hath occasion to
vse Viceroyes or Captaine Generalls. All these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes

principall Captaines, sauing a few Diuines and Ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
ioyned with them, to aduise and redresse their
high mindes and ambition; the which is done easier and
better by wise perswasions, than by extreame iustice:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21333:13"/>
for if iustice were executed to the vttermost, fewe great
Captaines should liue. The most great captaines cannot
denie, but their profession ouer-reacheth themselues,
more than anie other; because all their speaches, deeds,
and minds consists in ambition for honour, seeking to
ouerthrow all estates, to aduance their owne, weighing
no perill in respect of fame.</p>
               <p>I speake this for Captaines in generall: but there are
honest, vertuous, and iust, yet so few that the number

rereward. None of these, nor of the Officers
appoynted with them, whatsoeuer occasion presenteth,
although their fellowes were in fight, dares breake out
of his place to offer to fight, without commaundement
from the Principall. If the Generall be in person, hee is
knowne by a signall, like vnto a Cornet, which is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hard by him. As hee sends often to know the State
of his Armie in all the quarters, so doo they send others
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21333:14"/>
vnto him, as occasion presents, both to acquaint him
of their Estate, &amp; to know his direction. To giue equall

seuerall march. He that had the vangard to day, to

the other the footmen; but one is obeyed chiefe, in
as ample authority, as the Captaine Generall himselfe,

               <head>The order of thier Sieges.</head>
               <p>VVHen they assiege any place, they incampe at
the first out of the danger of the enemies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie:
before they make any approches,
they do what they can to make sure either with Fortes
or Trenches all the passages, I meane the comming in
as well to their Campe, as to the Towne or place assie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
If there be any riuer or passage by water, they will
be sure to stop it with Forts, Artillery, Stockathos, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisathos.
If they can make a bridge to passe ouer horse
and foote, with all necessaries from one side vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
if they can they wil not faile to make ways round
about the place assieged to march with horse &amp; foote.
If there be any passages strong by nature, straits through
woods, hills, or with waters, although it be a dozen
miles from their Campe, they will build strong Forts,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21333:14"/>
sufficient with a small guard to abide the furie of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
without battery. At one of these places will they
giue battaile, rather than leaue their siege, if the party
be to their aduantage: by this meanes they will be sure
to haue fortie houres liberty to resolue, whether they
will fight or retire; as they did at <hi>Muncier,</hi> at <hi>Cambria,</hi>
and at other places. Count <hi>Lodowicke</hi> being in <hi>Mounce,</hi>
well accompanied, especially with good Chiefes; for he
had with him the famous Captains <hi>Monsieur de la Nowe,
Monsieur de Poiet, Monsieur de Roueres:</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Duke <hi>d' Alua</hi> intrenched his Army before it so
strongly, that he was able to send out halfe his men to
doo exploits where it pleased him. When the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> incamped hard by him with equall forces, he
neuer stirred his Army, by reason of his trained Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
vndid him with a Camisado, forced him to retire.
So did hee also send <hi>Chappine Vitelly</hi> out of his Armie,
with sufficient forces into the strait towardes <hi>Valentia,</hi>
who defeated <hi>Monsieur Iohn de Lise,</hi> which marched to
the succours of <hi>Mounce</hi> with seauen thousand French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Also at <hi>Cambria</hi> this Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> abode the
Army of <hi>Monsieur d' Alanson</hi> to come in sight, although
he resolued to retire, sending his Artillerie, munition
and baggage out of daunger: hee stayed to see the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his march, seeing the party vnequall who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in good order, he retired orderly without ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any fight. If they thinke the place assieged too wel
manned, or the seate such by nature, that batterie can
doo no good, they will blocke it vp with Fortes in
such sort, that halfe their Armie will be sufficient to
assiege it, they will be sure to place the rest in the best
quarters for victualls and forrage, although it be three
dayes iourney from the place assieged: as they did at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21333:15"/>
                  <hi>Antwerpe, Gaunt, Iper, Berke,</hi> and other places. By these
meanes they relieue their wearied troupes with fresh at
their pleasures. If there be troups making head to leauie
their siege, they will ioyne closer together, as occasions
present: if they batter, they approch carefully with tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
a farre off, spare neither Pioners nor cost to saue
their Souldiers. Before they place their Batterie, they
mount Culuerings, and other peeces to beate the flanks
and defences: if there be not high grounds aduantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to do it, they will be sure whatsoeuer it cost, to raise
mounts for the purpose. If the Bulwarkes be such that
the flanks cannot be taken away with their peeces, they
will lay batterie at once both to Bulwarke and Curten;
for the Soldiers may lawfully refuse to assault, vntill the
flankes be taken away; neither will the Chiefes offer it;
for some of them must leade them.</p>

               <head>The order of their assaults.</head>
               <p>BEing ready to assault, to giue equall honour vnto all
the troups, the Regiments hurle the Dice, who shal
haue the point, the first charge we call it: lightly the
Chiefe that commaunded that quarter will aske it as his
right, because his troupes are most spoyled by reason
of their neere guardes and approches. Most often hee
hath it: beeing giuen him, he diuides his troupes to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
one the other, according to the widenesse of the
breach, they respect the honour of the poynt, that the
Captaines will not giue place one vnto the other more
than their Colonells, but by fortune of the Dice. They
neede not be so earnest for the matter, because the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
warriours account the first troupe that entreth a
breach in more daunger, than the first troupe that must
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21333:15"/>
charge in their seuerall battailes. They haue reason; for
I knowe it by good experience, whether they enter or
retire the most of them are killed, if the defenders be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men, I meane any thing valiant. They may haue
two or three breaches, but at euerie one they keepe
one order. Before the armed men aduance to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
they place their Musketiers as nere to the breach
as they can, lightlie they make mounts higher than the
defendants: in those and in trenches before the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
they place all their small shot. Before they giue an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
they send sundrie Officers and Souldiers armed of
Musket proofe and good iudgement to discouer the
breaches: when they giue the assaults, if they bee not
pell mell with the defendants, their Canoniers, flankes
the breach ouer their heads, both from the batterie, and
with their flanking peeces: they line their armed men
that haue the first poynt with Musketiers armed of the
proofe. At these assaults both sides lightlie shoote all
the vilest shot they can inuent, both to pierce Armes and
to cut off Pikes, chained bullets, Dice of steele couered
withlead: lightlie they giue their assaults generall at
once, I meane at all their breaches and mines, if the
ground serue to mine. To discourage the defendants,
they haue messengers of credite one horseback, if they
can passe, which runne from breach to breach crying,
courage the <hi>Tertia de la Leige</hi> is entered: So at the other
breaches the like, that <hi>Tertias</hi> of <hi>Lumbardy</hi> or <hi>Naples,</hi> or
others are entred, when there is no such matter. When
those that giue the first charge begin to retire or waxe
colde, the great Officers command their seconds to
the assaults; finding fault with the rest, telling them, it
is you fellowes must doo it: with these stratagems and
words, they make the poore souldiers break their necks
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21333:16"/>
at their pleasure. But to speake troth, the <hi>Spanish</hi> disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is verie gratefull vnto the men of warre; for want
of present places to aduance their valiant men of vertue
according vnto their deserts, they giue them aduantages
of payes, with encouraging words and assured promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the first places that fall voide. If a Colonell, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
or any other officer vnder them, leeseth his whole
Regiment or Companie in Battaile, Assault, Skirmish,
or in any other seruice commanded vnto by their supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
although the troupe bee defeated, those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
are sure to remaine in pay, and the Colonell or
Captaine haue present Crownes to recomfort his
troupe. If the Regiment or Companie bee cashed, all
the Officers are surelie enrouled in their owne payes
they had before. A cashed Colonell, Captaine, or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
will neuer take baser charge than they had before,
but will serue priuatelie, vntill occasion presents to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
them vnto the places they had before. As they
are bound to followe the warres, where they receiue
their reliefes; so haue they libertie to followe whome
they list, vnles they be commanded to the contrarie: the
greatest part will followe the Cornet royall, some the
Generall of Horsemen, others the high Marshall, others
the Master of the Campe, as they bee affected and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Likewise the cashed Souldiers are placed in their
former payes, vnder other Colonells None of these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
Officers are bound vnto anie duetie, sauing fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I meane to guard or watch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the most part will
doo it orderlie, better than the bound men, to shewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
vnto others: perswading themselues hee that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
his fellows, is soonest aduanced. Their vsage hath
been such, that I meruaile all professions in <hi>Spaine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
not to bee Souldiers. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift being before
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21333:16"/>
                  <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>Loraine,</hi> his Armie beeing in miserie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
sicknesse, his Souldiers would openlie raile on
him, especiallie his Spanish would call him the sonne of
the mad woman, with all the vile words they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
yet he would not heare them, but threw Crownes
amongst them, saying to his nobilitie; hearken these
knaues, yet let me call the worst by his name, hee will
not refuse to doo any thing for mee, though it cost him
his life. Also the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> when the Burghma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of <hi>Holland</hi> presented a petition vnto him of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of the Spaniards; amongst other foolish articles,
they shewed him how they would haue their napkins
changed twice at a meale. He answered, you must think,
all those which came with mee were not brought vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Burghers. To say troth, God helpe that man of
warre, that hath al his deeds and words construed to the
worst, considering what casualties there are in warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other places. Often choler altreth honest
minds, to day rich, to morrowe poore; now happie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none
vnhappie. Although their discipline in martiall
actions be most famous, and worthy to bee followed of
al others; notwithstanding their gouernement is so vile
and tyrannous, that no people is able to abide it, vnles
they be too base minded. For example, the Castilian of
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> hauing occasion to execute 3. or 4. offenders: to
terrifie the multitude, hee did it openlie in the market
place; by chaunce a scaffold fel down, at the which there
grew a great noise and rumor: sodainlie without more
adoo, the Castilian drew his sworde, crying <hi>Alerto</hi> to
his souldiers; The souldiers most sauagely discharged a
salue of hargubusaides on the poore people; with shot
&amp; sword they killed and hurt aboue an 100. Complaint
being made vnto the Duke <hi>D' alua</hi> their Gouernour;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21333:17"/>
his answere was, he was sorie the fault was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
desert, notwistanding he punished no bodie: think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a good meanes to terrifie a mutinous popular (as
he termed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>). Another time, the Master of the campes
companie, <hi>Iulian Romero,</hi> being in garrison in the towne
of <hi>Macklen,</hi> his <hi>Alfere</hi> being in loue with a gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
could not obtaine her loue; on a May day, he and
his companie armed, came vnto her fathers house vnder
the coulour of Maying, tooke her away by force: her
friends and kinsmen making what stirre they could to
saue hir, with the disorder of the <hi>Alfere</hi> and Souldiers,
diuers were killed and hurt. Complaint being made, no
man was executed, but perswasions vnto the parties to
take patience, shewing them what an offence it was, to
stir against a flying Ensigne of the King their Lord. The
<hi>Alfere</hi> was banished for a few daies; notwithstanding
he inioyed his loue, &amp; his fauour with his Gouernor in
a short time. Another time, a Serieant of <hi>Sentia Dauilla</hi>
Castilian of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> rode vp and down <hi>Antwerp</hi> on
a footecloth of veluet, mandilion and hose imbrodered
with gold letters, the contents of the words in Spanish,
<hi>Gasador de los Flaminges;</hi> as much as to say in English, A
Scourge for the Flemings: a number co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained, but none
had redres. Such is their gouernment in al places where
they command with citadels, garrisons, fortresses or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
the least Serieant of a Band, being a natural Spaniard,
will seeme to command the greatest man of qualitie of
any other Nation, vnles hee command forces himselfe.
Let the forces bee euer so great, although it bee 40. or
50000. and of them, but two. or 1000. Spaniards, it must
be called the Spanish armie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come first out of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> either to <hi>Italie, Flanders,</hi> or anie other places, they
be the simplest <hi>besonios</hi> (as they terme them) that can bee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21333:17"/>
found of any other Nation; the most are apparelled by
the Gouernors, before they enter the Countries, to saue
the honor of the Nation. Let them continue any time
in pay, the simplest will compare in pride with any cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of other Nations, and diuers rascalls must be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Signor of such a place, meaning the next Towne or
Village that he was borne vnto, hauing neither lande
nor house of his owne. Besides the tyrannous Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is maintained by that Nation, principallie in <hi>Spaine</hi>
to bridle Princes and Nobilitie; which otherwise haue
so great libertie by their auncient customes, that diuers
of them owe but small subiection vnto their King: for
abroad as well as in <hi>Spaine,</hi> they make whome they

them, nor what is laid to their charge, more than it
is the will of the holy Inquisition. With their diuelish
Inquisition, they take mens goods at their pleasure.
With their Buls and other paltrie deuises, poysoning,
murther, breaking othes &amp; promises, may be pardoned
by the Pope. Their religion is such, where they subdue
kingdoms or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, either by right, policy, or armes,
if they finde any of great qualitie that carries a voge, to
command popular or men of war; let their seruice and

&amp; directions, be they neuer so basely or vilely directed,

               <p>For exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, the Marquis of <hi>Marin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>an,</hi> after they gaue

fearing his greatnes, <hi>Charles</hi> caused his Army to mutine

               <head>To proue Lantiers more seruiceable than men at arms,
considering the numbers that do duties.</head>
               <p>THe difference betwixt the men at Armes, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Ordinances, as they tearme them, and the
Launtiers, called by the strangers Light Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
by vs Demilances. I must confesse a companie of
men at Armes, to be the most honorablest priuat charge
that a man may haue in the warres, principally because
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21333:19"/>
these charges are giuen vnto Princes, Nobilitie, or men
of great qualities in the wars. To euery seuerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
belongeth one Ensigne, one Guydon, and one Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;
the Ensigne ouer the men at Armes, the Guydon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Archers, the Cornet ouer the light horsemen:
Considering the number of hands to come to fight, &amp; to
do duty, I persuade my selfe the greatest warriors think
the Lantiers more profitable and more seruiceable: my
reasons are these; a man at Armes ought to haue 5. hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for euery horse he receiues as much pay as a Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier:
commonly the men of Armes makes no conuoyes
that belongs vnto an Army, the most of them are men
of quality (as we tearme men of warre) eyther gentle or
cashed Officers, wherefore they are fauoured for their
skouts, guards and watches. If they be commaunded to
any of these duties, out of their fiue horses, it is much if
they send three, commonly one and two: halfe of
them keepes but foure horses, the most three, the rest is
loden with baggage, perhaps lame iades, sufficient with
curtesie to passe the Musters, being trimmed vp with
help of their witnesses, how they wer hurt in seruice, &amp;
deuises. Lightly they are not commanded to march, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
the Army dislodges: if they do, Cornets of Launtiers
and Hargulatiers are commanded with them. The men
of Armes neuer breake their soft paces, vnlesse they
charge or retire, the others often are commaunded to
great marches, to do exploits, Caualgade, (as the straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
terme it) beside they must skout, discouer, with all
duties that belongs vnto an Army, either in lodging or
march, and fights often, when the men of Armes see no
enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they doo fight, lightly, it is a battaile, then
the Launtiers receiue and giue the first blowes. The
first charge being well conducted, and directed, tryes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21333:19"/>
the most of the fortune of a daies seruice, 100. men at
Armes are as chargeable as 500. Launtiers, and doo not
the duetie, neither in fights nor guards as halfe so manie.
Touching the barbd, (I meane the arming of the horses)
I thinke it to little purpose, seeing all squadrons of pikes
be lined with Musketiers or Caliuers; the lesser of both
pearceth any arming that horses vse to carrie. In stead
of Maces, the Launtiers may carrie one Pistoll, the
which is lighter and farre more terrible, than thrice the
force we haue in these daies. True it is, it is necessarie,
for the shocke of a horse to weare a little Cuisset to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the knee, so ought al the Launtiers to be. We know
it by experience; let a horseman be armed, the forepart
of his curaces of a light pistoll proofe, his head peece the
like, two lames of his pouldrons the like, two or three
lames of his tasses of the like proofe, the rest I meane his
tasses, cuisses, pouldrons, vambraces, and gauntlets, bee
also so light as you can deuise. With one pistoll these
kinde of arming shal be found heauie for the most men,
to carrie all day long, and too heauie for the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to carie ten hours together, and to do any seruice: As
I said before, the Launtiers are as well mounted for one
horse a peece, if hee haue not two, vnles he be too base
minded, and the warres verie bare. Besides, all Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
receiue euerie man his own pay, and haue nothing
to doo with Master, nor anie bodie, sauing his Officers,
that commaunds him to doo his duetie in the warre.
Wherefore I perswade my selfe, they maintaine these
Ordinances, as they tearme them, chieflie (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
to keepe the ancient customes, fearing in breaking
that order, diuers of their great men would grudge: by
reason, all or the most part of these companies belong
vnto them. For example our Band of horsemen Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21333:20"/>
did account them the fairest Band of ordinance in
<hi>Europe</hi> for the number, because all the men at armes are
Gentlemen of qualitie: wherefore I doo value this Band
better, than twice as manie of any other, let them bee of
what Nation soeuer. I may speake it by good experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
out of this Band there may be pickt 15. or 20. suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to answere so many at all deedes of armes, let it be
chosen out of any Armie, be it neuer so great: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their charges in payes, expences in victuals muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and their liberties for dueties; I meane to conuoy,
guard, and to watch, so many priuate Launtiers, as this
faire Band musters in all of horses, vnder their Ensign, or
Guydon, would excell them; my reason is, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because euery Launtier is a master, and receiues his
owne pay.</p>

               <head>To prooue Hargulatiers more seruiceable than Speare men,
tearmed by vs, light Horsemen.</head>
               <p>THE difference betwixt our Northerne Speares,
Light Horsemen we tearme them; and the Light
Horsemen tearmed by the strangers Hargulatiers,
as much to say Hargabushes or Petronels on horseback.
Touching the mounting and arming of these hargula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
I shewed you before, the seruice of all Light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
consists chiefly in marching of great marches, (Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualgades
the strangers terme it) I meane, to surprise Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
a farre off in their lodgings, or marches; likewise
to defeat conuoyes, &amp; to conduct conuoyes, as much to
say, direct it to spoyle necessaries that come to furnish
their enemies, and to conduct necessaries to furnish
their own campe or seruice. Also to scout and discouer,
to spare the armed men, I meane the Launtiers, &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
horsemen; likewise both to conduct &amp; spoile forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21333:20"/>
with the like seruices. They be neuer commanded
to do any exploits on men of Warre, without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Launtiers, or armed Pistolers, I meane
Curaces on horseback. Diuers march with swords
without Pistoll or Launce, especiallie the Frenchmen.
For these seruices it is necessarie to haue in armies or
troupes, for euerie 500. Launtiers or armed Curaces,
100. of these kinde of light horse: from that rate to the
greatest numbers. If horsemen bee directed to assaile
troupes at their lodgings, either in villages, streights, or
fields, where it requires too great a march for footemen
to keepe companie with the horsemen, without doubt
these hargulatiers are farre better then the spearemen;
my reasons are these; when the horsemen approach the
enemie, if it bee in a village, lightly they must passe
through barriers and narow streights, bard with wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
both of victualls, &amp; of their men of warre, where
commonlie the Enemie keepes guardes &amp; watch. If the
passage bee such, either in entring a village or straight,
that horsmen cannot finde place to enter and to charge,
these hargulatiers light on foot, &amp; do no lesse dutie than
foote hargabushiers. If the enimie be lodged either too
strongly or to manie, for the assailants to doo any good
on their quarter, as ye must think, a 1000 stronglie lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a village or streight, with good guard and order,
are worth 2000. without, let them be of one valure and
conduct) then the assailant will addresse an ambush per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
in a passage or narrow streight short of the Enemies
quarter, where he will also cause all or the most of those
Hargulatiers to light, then place and hide them in such
sort, that 100. shot wil spoyle and defend ten times more
than themselues, vnles the enimies bring shot to displace
them; if they doo, the Ambush may dislodge, if hee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21333:21"/>
thinkes the partie vnequal; the which he could not, were
his Hargulatiers Hargabushers without horses, beeing
ingaged to fight. I confesse also the Hargulatiers farre
better than the spearemen for this seruice; if troupes of
armed curaces, launtiers, or others, chance to meete by
fortune with the like enemies in a champion, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulatiers
vnarmed march on both sides of their squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
like wings of shot about a squadron of pikes; vntil
the launtiers or curaces charge, diuers of their Hargula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
march skirmishing before the squadrons, like fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
men after the Almaine phrase; when the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
charge, they flye on both sides to their fellowes
They place their armed Hargulatiers behinde the squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
they execute more than the Launtiers, after the
Launtiers, break into the enemies squadrons: for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
hargulatiers ought to be as well mounted, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for curace and caske, sauing their beauers, as the
launtiers; the most of them, as I shewed you before car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
a pistoll, besides his caliuer or petronell. Let it bee
for what seruice Captaines can deuise, these hargulatiers
are better than our sort of speare men that wee tearme
Light Horsmen. I perswade my selfe, that all the warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in <hi>Europe,</hi> sauing our selues and the Scots will bee
found to be of my minde. I am sure the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi>
Generall <hi>Norris,</hi> the Lord <hi>Willoughbie,</hi> Sir <hi>William Russell,</hi>
Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> with the most of all that serued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the great Captaines, I meane the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>
and his followers, will say and confesse as I doo. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the famous <hi>Mounsier de la Nowe,</hi> commanding
chiefe of the warres vnder the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the
States in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> had 5. Cornets of these spearemen,
all Scotts: he finding little seruice with these kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
and mounting, changed them vnto Launtiers and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21333:21"/>
Hargulatiers; the which afterwards prooued to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable,
&amp; as braue ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds as any other vnder his charge:
especially the company of <hi>Seaton.</hi> True it is, braue men
wil shew themselues valiant with any kind of weapons,
al maner of ways: but the best sort of arming and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is the more profitable, &amp; the more seruiceable. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our two nations (I meane English and Scottish)
may compare, &amp; in my opinion do excell all the rest of
the world in value and strength: notwithstanding, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of both our Nations can compare with the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for the mounting and arming, vnlesse we resolue to
be Launtiers, Pistolers and Hargulatiers, as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Our discipline is to haue 1000. Spearmen, and some
200. Launtiers, from that rate to the greatest numbers,
which ought to be 1000. Lantiers and 200. Spearemen.
Likewise, from that rate to the greatest, and those 200.
ought to be Hargulatiers. I know no reason but 2000.
Lantiers, 2000. Pistolers, 1000. Hargulatiers, should not
Master 20000. Spearemen on horsebacke. Likewise
from that rate to the lesser numbers; you must think the
reason was that our kings of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Scotland</hi> fought
always or the most part on foote, because their whole
trust was on the footmen, and that all strangers mastred
them with horsemen: Assure our selues let vs keep their
discipline with horsmen, none shal master vs number to
number, although they were more.</p>
               <p>Let vs not erre in our ancient customes, although our
famous Kings <hi>Hen. 5. Edw.</hi> 3. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. were the most
worthiest warriers that our nation euer had: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
you may be assured, had they knowne the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of Muskets, Caliuers and Pistolls, they would haue
used the lesse Bowes, Speares and Bills; as the actions of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21333:22"/>
these famous kings shews their Captains to be the most
expert. Likewise, we must confesse <hi>Alexander, Caesar,
Scipio</hi> and <hi>Hanniball,</hi> to be the worthiest and famoust
warriers that euer were; notwithstanding, assure your
selfe, had they knowne Artillerie, they woulde neuer
haue battered Towns with Rammes, nor haue conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
countries so easily, had they bin fortified as <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
France</hi> and the Low countries, with others, haue bin
since their days. Although the ground of ancient Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
is the most worthiest and the most famous; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
by reason of fortifications, stratagems, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
arming, with Munition, the discipline is greatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered;
the which we must follow and be directed as it is
now: otherwise we shall repent it too late.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The difference betwixt Launtiers and Pistolers,</head>
               <p>TRue it is, as <hi>Monsieur de la Nowe</hi> saith, a squadron
of <hi>Rutters</hi> (meaning Pistolers) ought to beate a
squadron of Launtiers. It were a great follie of
me, either to deny his reasons or deeds; the little experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
I got was from him, and from such others as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Touching <hi>Monsieur de la Nowe,</hi> he is knowne to be
one of the worthiest and famous warriers, that <hi>Europe</hi>
bred in his days. I do perswade my selfe, a squadron of
Pistolers ought to encounter so many Launtiers; if they
should enter into the squadrons of Lantiers, as <hi>Monsieur
de la Nowe</hi> saieth. Without doubt the Pistol discharged
hard by, wel charged with iudgement, murthers more
than the Launce: out of a hundred Pistolers, 20. nor
scarce 10. at the most do neither charge pistoll, nor enter
a squadron as they shoulde, but commonly and lightly
always they discharge their Pistols eight and fiue score
off, and so wheele about; at which turnes the Launtiers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21333:22"/>
charge them in the sides, be they wel conducted, if they
should enter as <hi>Monsieur de la Nowe</hi> speaks, the Launti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
haue or ought to haue one Pistoll at the least: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their arming and mounting, they ought to be rather
better than worse. The captains or captaine that charges
either with troups or troupe, cares not much whether
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies breake their launces or not, but desires the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to enter resolutely, and to keep close together. If they be
wel conducted, their leaders command more than half
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to carie their swords or pistols in the bridle hand,
rather than faile to vse the sword &amp; pistoll, &amp; quit their
Lances; but they wil be sure to place the best of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
in the forefront. Lightly of euery hundred, 15. or
20. know how to breake: being wel broken, with care
of the goodnesse of the staffe and head, the blowe of the
Launce is little lesse in valor vnto the pistoll: the charge
of the Lantiers is terrible and resolute, being in carier to
breake, the enemies perceiues their resolution is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and not to wheele about like vnto the pistolers; sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or neuer at al shal you find pistolers charge or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a squadron, either horse or foot on the spurs like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Launtiers; but softlie on a trot or soft pace, persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
themselues, as it is true, their Pistolls giue as great
blowes, without the force of the horses. Considering
the resolute charge done with the might of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the Launtiers are more terrible and make a farre fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
shew, either in Muster of Battaile: for example, the
<hi>Almaines,</hi> during the time they carried Launces, caried
a farre greater reputation than they doo now being pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolers
named <hi>Rutters.</hi> The most Chiefes or Souldiers
of account are armed at the proofe of the Pistoll. If the
Leaders commaund their troupes to spoyle horses, the
Launces are more sure, for diuers Pistolls faile to goe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21333:23"/>
off, if they doo, they must be charged with discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
being ouercharged, it shakes in a mans hand, so,
that often it toucheth neyther man nor horse. If the
charge be too little, it pierceth nothing to speake of.
True it is, being pickt and chosen, the Pistolers murther
more, would they doo as <hi>Monsieur de la Nowe</hi> directes
them? But it hath beene seldome or neuer heard that
Launtiers gaue place vnto <hi>Rutters;</hi> but I was often in
their companie when they ranne away, three from one
Launtier both in great troupes and small. True it is, the
great Captaine the Admirall <hi>Chatillion,</hi> chose often to
fight, and would haue diuers or the most of his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to bee armed, wyth one Pistoll and a good Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilace:
hee had great reason, for the most of his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
on horsebacke were Gentlemen of qualitie, or
resolute Souldiours that fought for the Religion. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the Gentlemen were in quarrells for their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or for their particular reputation, but all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
were resolute valiant faithfull men of warre, that
fought either for religion or reputation, to maintaine
their wordes after the olde Romane fashion. Being
such men, no weapons comes amisse: for constancie
and true valor, ouerthrows al pollicie, being in Armes,
readie to fight without delayes. Besides, the nature of
the Frenchmen is such, that they will grudge to carrie
any Armes, but such as please themselues: vnto the
which their Leaders were faine to agree, partly against
their wills, fearing otherwise to offend their humours,
knowing it lay in them to followe whome they lifted,
especiallie their Realme beeing diuided into factions;
being al vnited, their kings were faine to hire <hi>Switzers</hi>
and <hi>Almaines</hi> for their battailes on foot, I meane armed
Pikes, which is the bodie of all battailes.</p>

               <p>THe difference betwixt the Muskets and any other
peeces that are vsed. If it be in a battaile, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the ground or place falles out in Trenches, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
assailing or defending Townes, Forts, or Fortresses,
or in defending or assailing streights, or passages, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be by night or day, in my iudgement fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Muskets are better than 1000. Caliuers, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such shot, and are to bee valued from that rate vnto
the greatest numbers. My reasons are thus, the Musket
spoyles horse or man thirtie score off, if the powder bee
anie thing good, and the bearer of any iudgement. If
armed men giue the charge, few or any carrie Armes of
the proofe of the Musket, being deliuered within ten
or twelue score. If any great troupes of horse or foote,
offers to force them with multitude of smaller shot, they
may discharge foure, fiue or sixe small bullets being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
in volley, the which pearceth al they strike, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the enimie bee heauely armed, the which are not
vnlesse it be some 100. of a 1000. at the most of either
horse or foote. By that reckoning 100. Muskets are to be
valued vnto 200. Caliuers or more: the Caliuers may
say they will discharge two shot for one, but cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;
but one Musket shot doth more hurt than two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers
shot, farre or nere and better cheape: although the
Musket spend a pound of powder in 8. or 12. shot, and
the other smaller shootes twentie and thirtie of a pound.
Considering the wages and expence of two to one, the
Musket is better cheape and far more seruiceable. Some
thinke the Musket cannot march far in a day, or night,
or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue long without rest, by reason of their weight
nor skirmish so nimblie nor so often, by reason of their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21333:24"/>
length, weight, and sore recoyling. Armed men are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier
loaden than the Musketiers, and more combersome
in carriage: lightlie no great troupe matches ten miles
without resting, although it be but a little at euerie stand
and nere the enemie: the Musketiers are suffered to quit
their weight, leauing their Muskets in their rests: the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men will not be suffered to disarme themselues in
their march, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stand neuer so often, if they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fiue houres march of an Enemie any thing equall of
either horse or foote: by that reason they haue a little
aduantage. Fewe Captaines will force any great troupe
of footemen to march aboue 15. miles, without resting:
if the Enemie be equall and in hazard to fight, although
it be 20. miles, both armed men and Musketiers wil not
stick to march, if their Leaders haue any credite with
them, and discretion to furnish their troupes with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
and necessaries that belongs vnto such a march.</p>
               <p>Touching their often discharging, nimblenes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
I answered before. For recoyling there is no hurt, if
they bee streight stocked after the <hi>Spanish</hi> manner. For
their weight and sure shooting, the Muskets haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
on all the other small shot, by reason they shoote
in their rests: true it is, were they stocked crooked after
the <hi>French</hi> manner to be discharged on the breast, fewe
or none could abide their recoyling, by reason of their
great charges of powder: but being discharged from the
shoulder after the <hi>Spanish</hi> manner, with the thumbe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the stocke and the face, there is neither danger nor
hurt, if the shooter haue any discretion; especiallie not to
ouerload their pecces, and take heede that the bullets
ioyne close to the powder. Few seruices of importance
are executed in the field without armed men; and where
armed men wil march, the Musketiers are il conducted,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21333:24"/>
vnlesse they doo the like, let it bee neuer so farre. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowes
of all Battailes and great fights are giuen
within two miles, the most in halfe a mile: for that

passages by water, or by straits, or to assaile townes,
forts, fortresses, or whatsoeuer seruice you can inuent if
it be done on great troupes, the musketiers are the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest

<hi>Spaniards</hi> do vse them most, &amp; findes their seruie &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
such, that I perswade my self shortlie, al or the most
of their small shot will be Musketiers. True it is, I doo
thinke it necessarie to haue of 1000. shot, 200. Caliuers
from that rate to the greater number, and such shot for
this purpose, when occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presents to make great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(Caualgades the strangers calls it) to giue Camisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
on troupes that are lodged a farre off, to surprise
Townes, Fortresses or passages that are simply mand, and
negligentlie guarded, or to lye in Ambush a farre off, to
cut off conuoyes, passengers, and such services. These
lighter shot are necessarie to march great marches with
horsemen for these purposes, the which are often taken
behind the horsemen for expedition of great marches,
to doo executions vnlooked for.</p>

I know no reason but two thousand Pikes, 1000.

diuers guards nere a place assieged are furnished onelie
with shot &amp; short weapons, as armed Holberts, Targets,
and such weapons, by reason their Trenches are narrow

which trenches the Pikes haue no conuenient place to

               <p>I Perswade my selfe there ought to bee amongst one
1000. Pikes, 200. short weapons, as Holberts or Bills;
but the Bills must be of good stuffe, not like our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
browne Bills, which are lightlie for the most part
all yron, with a little steele or none at all; but they ought
to be made of good yron and steele, with long strong
pikes at the least of 12. inches long, armed with yron to
the midds of the staffe, like the Holberts: for example.
like vnto those which the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Pelham</hi> had in the Low Countries for their guards:
being made thus, no doubt but it is a necessarie weapon
to guard Ensignes in the field, trenches or townes, and a
good weapon to execute, but no better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the halberd.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21333:25"/>
Because the Frenchmen make their halberds with long
neckt pikes, and of naughtie stuffe like our common
browne bills, diuers of our Nation condemnes the
Halberdes: but let the Halberds bee of good stuffe and
stronglie made after the Millaine fashion, with large
heads to cut, and broad strong pikes both to cut and to
thrust, then no doubt the Halberd is nothing behinde
the bill for all manner of seruice, and armes a souldier
fairer than the bill. Both Bills and Halberds ought to
haue corslets, with light Millain murrians; the foreparts
ought to be of reasonable proofe, I meane of the proofe
of the Caliuer, discharged ten or twelue score off: so
ought the pikes also to haue the foreparts of the corslets
of the like proofe, fifteene or twenty of euery hundred,
from that rate vnto the greatest numbers. I knowe no
reason, that a thousand armed men ought to aske aboue
two hundred targetters of the proof: those weapons are
very combersome, they are best to arme men to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
breaches; or for the defendants to discouer tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
or the enemies workes; and for to couer shot that

musketers are more seruiceable than fifteene

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21333:26"/>
among 5000. Bowmen, you shall not finde 1000 good
Archers, I meane to shoot strong shoots; let them be in
the field 3. or 4. months, hardly find of 5000. scarce 500.
able to make any strong shootes. In defending or assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any trenches, lightly they must discouer themselues
to make faire shoots; where the others shot spoile them,
by reason they discouer nothing of themselues vnlesse it
be a litle through small holes. Few or none do any great
hurt 12. or 14. score off; they are not to be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other shoots to line battels, or to march, either in
the wings of any battailes, or before, as we terme them
from the <hi>Almaine</hi> phrase forlorne hope. Diuers wil say,
they are good to spoile the horsmen; I do confesse it, if
the horsemen come within their shootes, and can not
charge them by reason of their trenches or guards of
pikes. Lightly when the horsemen approach within
twelue score, the trumpets sound the charge; if it be on
shot, that lies where they cannot charge, they are ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
that leade any great troup of horsmen to charge
trenches. Commonly the Cornets or Guydons charge
one an other if there be any of both sides: if not, few
horsemen well conducted, will charge either trenches,
or battailes of footmen, vnlesse they see a faire entrie, or
the footmen begin to shake, as good Captains wil soone
perceiue. If they do charge, they will be sure to be well
accompanied with small shot, which soone terrifieth
bowmen, especially the musketters: besides the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are all well armed, in such sort that Bowmen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hurt the men; let them say what they list, when the
men are sure the arrowes will not pierce them, they wil
be the valianter: although the horses be killed, and the
Masters seruice lost for that day, notwithstanding they
thinke it better to be taken prisoner sixe times, than kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21333:26"/>
once, beside the munition that belongs vnto Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
are not so commonly found in al places, especially
arrowes: as powder is vnto the other shot. Also time
and ill weather weakneth the bowes as well as the men.
In our ancient wars, our enemies vsed Crossebows, and
such shoots; few, or any at all had the vse of long bowes
as we had; wherefore none could compare with vs for
shot: but GOD forbid we should trie our bowes with
their Muskets and Caliuers, without the like shot to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
them. I do not doubt but al, honorable and others,
which haue serued in the Low Countries will say as I
doo: notwithstanding some will contrarie it, although
they neuer sawe the true triall of any of those weapons
belonging eyther to horse or foote, alledging antiquitie
without other reasons, saying, we carried armes before
they were borne. Little do they think how <hi>Caesar</hi> ended
all his great actions in lesse than twelue yeeres, by their
reckoning none could prooue great Captaines that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed

Duke <hi>D'alua</hi> said, the longer experted, the more perfect.
T'rue it is, long experience requires age, age without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

               <p>SOme will condemne me for my strange names of
Fortifications, they ought to pardon mee: for my
part, I know no other names than are giuen by the
strangers, because there are few or none at all in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
If a man shuld call a Casamate a slaughter house,
the multitude would thinke I speake of a place to kill
biefes, &amp; such matters; if I should call a Cauilere a mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
diuers would aske, what to do? to place windmills or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery;
if I should call a rampire a wall, they would think
I lied, vnlesse it were made of lime and stone: therefore
as the most languages calls <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bristow</hi> as we do,
so is it best for vs to call their inuentions as they do: tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Muskets, Caliuers and Hargubuziers, with other
things, wee agree with their names. The best dry ditch,
is to haue the ditch 100. paces broad, &amp; 50. foote deep, 4.
Casamats on euery side of the Bulwarkes, the lowest to
flanke the bottome of the ditch from the one side vnto
the other; the second like wise within ten foote, with
broad Casamats, that the Artillery may be raised hie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
to beat a long the ditches, as nigh to the botome as
can be deuised; the third and fourth Casamats likewise
within ten foot one of another, to flanke the ditch in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
part as lowe as may be deuised; also the fourth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samate
must flanke the Counterskarfe: in euery part
the Counterskarfe ought to bee three score broad, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the foote to the head; the head ought to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the ditch and rampire as high as the fourth Casa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate:
you can not bestow too much cost on the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terskarfe, Counterskarffe,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21333:27"/>
for before the enemie possesse the
Counterskarffe, hee cannot batter to take away any of
the flankes: wherefore it ought to bee made with all the
arte that can bee deuised with lime and stone, from the
foote to the head, especiallie for fortie paces nere vnto
the head. It were not amis, although it hath been neuer
seene before to haue mines like vautes, ouerthwart to
the midds of the Counterskarsse; which mines ought to
be flanked with two lowe Casamats out of the head of
the Bulwarks, likewise from Bulwarke to Bulwarke
in that sort: my reason is, when the assailant lodgeth in
the Counterskarffe, they must bee couered with Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the which will bee hardlie done by reason of these
mines. The mines cannot bee hurtfull; let the Enemie
finde them, they cannot lodge in them, we knowe it by
good experience: he that possesseth a mine, first hauing
an entrie that cannot bee cut off, hath treble aduantage,
though the mine were sodainely made, much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made artificially with time and care, hauing a Casa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat
to flanke it. The Counterskarffe ought to haue
parapets cut in them foure foote deepe, euerie trench to
flanke one another, from the head to the foote of the
Counterskarffe, I meane place to lodge what troupes
pleaseth the defendants to guard it, with diuerse places
to sallie both horse and foote at their pleasures. Euerie
Bulwarke ought to haue two sallies, one for Horse
and foote, the other a little secret sallie: the Bulwarkes
ought to flanke one another within tenne score; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Curten ought to haue two Caualeres to command
the field within their shootes, aswell as the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarffes:
let all this bee finished as Captaines and Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
can deuise. Notwithstanding, no drie ditch can
be compared for strength vnto a wet ditch: my reason
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21333:28"/>
is thus, where water may bee drawne vnto the ditch of
the Rampier, likelie it may be drawne vnto the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terskarffe
ditch: halfe or the best part of the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is lost, when the Counterscarffe is possest, being
possest, the assailants with their Trenches on wheeles,
pusht on with strong poales with the force of men, the
which may be made of the proofe of a field piece; with
those and with wooll sacks, gabions, sand bags, faggots,
and such deuises, as they had before <hi>Sluce,</hi> they will
soone place their batterie: after dismounting the Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leres
and highest Casamates. Also they will deface the
Counterscarfe, enter the ditch with mines in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
in time make all the Counterscaffe an easie entrie in
the ditch, and keepe their guards in the sides where the
flankes can not annoy them: that being done, they will
soone lay batterie to the other Casamates before they
batter: hauing an easie entrie into the ditch, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
dare not sally, by reason the Assailaunts Artillerie
beates all their high flankes &amp; parpets; in such sort, that
none dares shew themselues. Let the defendants enter
the ditch, the Assailants will enter also; beeing pell mell,
the Casamates kils their owne as well as their enemies.
Being thus, no doubt in short time the assaila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts wil lodge
in the rampier let it be neuer so thick, what tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches with
in the Captaines and Engioners can deuise, vnlesse they
haue newe fortifications, like vnto those I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
in time the Assailant will lodge his batterie on the
rampiers, as they did at <hi>Mastricht,</hi> and in short time fight
with equal hands with the defendants to their vndoing.
Therefore a drie ditch cannot be compared vnto a wet.
If there can be made a wet deepe broad ditch at the foot
of the counterscarfe, where the water may not be taken
away, I knowe no reason why the defendants should
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21333:28"/>
loose their Counterscarfe, being well manned. If the
water may be drawen out of both the ditches of Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
and counterscarfe, yet is the wet ditches better than
the drie. Few good Enginers giues counsaile to make
a wet ditch artificiallie, without Casamates vnder wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as lowe as reason perswades them the water may be
taken from them: being let out, there remaines in some
trenches, water that cannot be voided, beeing cleane ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, the Casamates flankes all one.</p>
               <p>As I said before, flankes cannot be taken away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
possessing the Counterscarfe, neither can a broade
ditch be fild, without great murders against reson, with
out dismounting the flanks. Some wil say, the dry ditch
is better, alledging that any armie may the better succor
the place asseiged, and that the defendants may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sally out. Touching the succouring of the Asseiged,
it is well knowen al Armies are victualled from hand to
mouth; he that leades an Armie to leauie a siege, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde a place to lodge his armie within three houres
march of the others, where hee shall be assured to force
his enemies to fight within ten daies, leauie his siege, or
famish, conducts his troupes verie ill. None besiegeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
place, but intrencheth himselfe and troupes in such
sort, that 5000. will defend trenches, against thrice their
number: wherefore the succours are ill conducted to
force trenches, and may fight better cheape. Touching
the sallies of the besieged, if the fortification be such, as
I named before, it ought to haue in it for euery bulwark
a ponton, I meane a bridge ioyned close together with
yron engins, like vnto those of the citadell of <hi>Antwerpe.</hi>
Those pontons are iust the bredth of the ditch, hatched
fast with yron hookes vnto the Counterscafe, made so
broad &amp; so strong, that Artillerie may passe beside horse
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21333:29"/>
and foote. These pontons serue a wet ditch for salying,
aswell as any salies that belongs vnto a drie ditch: both
wet and drie, when the Counterscarffe is possest, leeseth
their salying, if the Seigers be good Captaines. All Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
ought to be guarded with strong trenches, and all
quarters ought to bee stronglie entrenched, as I saide
before; especially, the assailants hauing intelligence of
succors, that being furnisht, the salying of the assieged is
their owne confusion. It is dangerous to haue Bastiles
from the rampier like vnto <hi>Mastricht, Vtricht,</hi> and other
places. Some counts these bastiles bulwarkes, I thinke al
Bulwarkes ought to bee gardall round about: others
counts them spurres or rauelins; whether they be spurs,
bastiles, rauelins or bulwarks, they be dangerous vnlesse
they ioyne vnto the rampier, or to bee furnisht during a
siedge with strong guards. Commonlie they are not
guarded, vnlesse the Enemie lodgeth against them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the defendants perswade themselues, the Enemie
dares not lodge in them, by reason they bee open vnto
the curteine &amp; cauileres like the Counterscarfes. These
Bastiles haue much earth. Let the Enemie enter one of
them, within two hours, he couers himself in the earth;
nothing made with hands that can bee battered, but will
be made assaultable. Is there a breadth in one of them, &amp;
the enimie can beate the entry, I meane the bridge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the curten and it, their succours is cut off. Besides
the defendants shall not finde much ground within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to retrench themselues against the cannon; &amp; where the
cannon plaies no defendant dare shew himself: some wil
say, these bastiles may haue counterscarfes as I named
before; I doo confesse it, but they are so farre from the
rampier, that neither the rampier, his counterscarfe, nor
scarce caualere can flanke; wherefore without doubt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21333:29"/>
these bastiles that are not ioined vnto the rampier, are very
dangerous, and not to bee compared vnto the others ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
True it is, men, victuals and munition ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Trenches against an Armie, I doo confesse it, a little
Armie against a great, I meane halfe so manie. But no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications
made with mens hands, can be kept continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
against a royall Armie, without succours, if it can bee
battered; nor against a small Armie, without men, victualls
&amp; munition: wanting one of the three, the best Fortresse
is lost, you must thinke the assailants hauing the field, and
meanes to reenforce their troupes as they list, the losse of
one hundred vnto the defendants is more, than two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
vnto the assailants. But let the defendants or assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
do their dueties to the vttermost in any kind of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
vnlesse it pleaseth their masters or superiours to
grace their deedes, their well dooing will bee turned to
nought; and their vertues, vices. Wherefore all men of
warre ought to pray to hazard their liues in the sight of
their Princes or Estates, then likelie they will confesse no
traffique so deare as liues, especiallie being in action with
equall enemies. It is hard to please the most masters, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to content the rude multitude: the least worme
will mooue, hauing anie life being troden vpon: for my
owne part I doo confesse to bee one of the least in respect
of thousands, not so base but euer I carried a mind rather
to be buried dead, than aliue.</p>
               <p>I speake this for the wrongs done vnto my selfe and
companions for the defence of the towne of <hi>Sluce:</hi> true it
is, those that serues many, serues no bodie; I meane, they
shall find none that will confesse to be their masters, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
when they should be rewarded for their seruice, but
the multitude will bee readie to disgrace their seruants,
thinking by such meanes to pay them their debts, or at
the least sufficient rewards to bee reconciled vnto them
and pardoned for their misconstred thoughts. Wherefore
I would wish all men of warre, and they can, to bee in all
strange Princes or estates debts, rather than they in yours:
if your masters bee giuen to any machiuell humours, the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21333:30"/>
debts that should pay you, will hire them diuers others:
are you in their debts, you are sure not to bee wronged,
thinking your seruice to come paied for. Although our
masters the States bee for the most part honest and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
personages, notwithstanding looke into their actions,
you shall finde a number of Captaines wronged besides
our selues: they are partlie to bee borne withall. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
great Captaines are so ambitions, that they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face their inferiours deedes: therefore there can been no great fault in the States, nor any such, when we wrong one
another: otherwise time and fortune might make infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
Competitors with the great ones. Sometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
frownes on the greatest Captaines, in such sort, that
they can not or will not performe that the world lookes
they should do, then likelie had they rather burie their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and inferiours, rather than bee touched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with the least disgrace. Therefore you cannot blame
the poore Souldier to desire the eye of his master, when he
hazardeth his life. Subiects are vassalls vnto Princes and
States, and not vnto the most Generals: although I neuer
knewe any, notwithstanding, it is well knowne ambitious
Generals wronged often their masters: being in those hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
they will bee sure to wrong their inferiours, vnlesse
they serue their turnes. Touching our wrongs, I impute it
to no bodie but vnto our owne fortunes, as the Spaniards
said vnto <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. <hi>Adeunda salta la diecha, non apreuie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha la
diligencia.</hi> Touching <hi>Sluce,</hi> I do protest by the faith of
a Souldier, what I write is troth. As nigh as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
we kept the Towne about 60. daies: diuers thinkes it
no time, because <hi>Harlam, Mastricht,</hi> and others, were kept
longer: little doo they thinke how those places were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
with all necessaries, especiallie, the lesser of both had
in them at the least 6000. hands to fight and to worke. Let
vs be rightlie iudged, I will prooue that <hi>Bouennene</hi> was the
furioust siege that was in the Lowe Countries, since Duke
<hi>D'aluas</hi> arriuall vntill this houre; the which began and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in lesse than twentie daies: notwithstanding, there
was more Captaines and Souldiers spoyled by sword and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21333:30"/>

Experimented Captaines will confesse, the furie of
all breaches are tried in fewe houres, and the furie of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie
preuented without sodaine attempts. Wee were

                     </gap>uce</hi> 1600. fighting, workmen, and all: wee had to
keepe (counting the two Forts) aboue two miles and a
halfe. It is well knowne, before we entred, the Towne lost
one Fort. If wee shewed anie valour in our entrie, let Sir
<hi>Henrie Palmer,</hi> &amp; his Seamen, with them of <hi>Zealand</hi> iudge;
the danger was not so little, but of the vessels that carried
vs in, fiue were taken the next tide in comming out. The
third tide, Sir <hi>Charles Blunt</hi> offered fiftie pounds (besides
the commandement his Masters and Mariners receiued
at his imbarking) to carrie vs our necessaries from Sir
<hi>William Russell,</hi> then Lord Gouernour of <hi>Vlishing,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was the occasion of our entrie, resolution, and quick
dispatch; who sent with vs a good quantitie of victuals and
munition: and to say troth, without his earnest dispatches
wee had not entred: then the world knowes the Towne
had been lost without blowes, as a number of others were
in those Countries farre better than <hi>Sluce:</hi> The best sort
doth knowe, had I and my companions marchanted our
liues, as traffickers doth their ware, wee had no neede to
haue entred <hi>Sluce,</hi> for our direction was but to <hi>Ostend:</hi> we
were battered with thirtie Cannons and eight Culuerings
on S. <hi>Iacobs</hi> eeue: from three of the clock in the morning
vntill fiue in the afternoone, they shot aboue foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Cannon shot. By the Dukes owne confession he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
sawe so furious a batterie in one day: wee were made
saultable aboue 200. &amp; 50. paces, betwixt fiue of the clock
and seauen: wee were aboue fiue times at the push of the
pike for our breach, where wee spoyled the enemies in
great numbers; who perceiuing our Trenches within O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart
the breach, quieted their furies: afterwards we
kept the Towne eighteene daies, the enemie being lodged
in our port, rampier, and breach, aboue three hundred
paces, in the which time the Enemie passed through the
port sixe paces to beate our Trenches within: wee kept
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21333:31"/>
our Fort vntill wee were made saultable more than our
Troupes could guard, vnles wee would quite the Towne:
being mined, wee countermined them, in the which wee
fought hourelie for the space of nine daies with Sword,
Target and Pistols: at our breach, port, and rampiet of the
Towne wee fought daylie with pikes, short weapons and
stones, besides our shot for the said space of eighteene
daies. Touching our sallies, let the Enemie testifie. The
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> being entred, asked me which was <hi>Busker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilde,</hi>
standing before him; I shewed him: who imbraced
him, turning towards his Nobilitie, he said: there serues
no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> a brauer man. Most true it is, at one
sallie he had the point with an hundred corslets of the best
sort, who charged and made to runne, eight Spanish En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of the <hi>Tertia Vecho,</hi> and hurt their master <hi>del Campo.</hi>
True it is, he was seconded with a number of others; but
himselfe principallie knowne by prisoners, and his great
plume of feathers. Also Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> marked for his red
Mandilion, who stood alwaies in the head of the armed
men at the assaults of the Fort and Towne, beeing twise
hurt, I and other his friends requested him to retire: he
answered, he had rather be kild ten times at a breach, than
once in a house.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Hart</hi> most valiantlie swamme in and out to
shewe our Generall and States our wants and daungers:
the world doth know what picks there was betwixt them
at that instant, such that none can denie but a full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was taken not to enter in by water. The world doth
knowe our Armie by land retired at midnight from <hi>Blanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenborough</hi>
to <hi>Ostend:</hi> let enuie and malice speake what
they list, troath may be blamed but neuer shamed: we were
lost men but for our owne wits and resolution: our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was all spent so farre, that wee had not to maintaine
halfe a daies fight: the Enemies had gotten into our ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
so farre, that their shot flanked vs into our trenches,
for eighteene nights we lay alwaies Officers and all at our
breach, where we eate our meate continuallie: we had not
left vnbroken of twentie field peeces with their Artillerie,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21333:31"/>
foure: wee endured in Towne and Fort, seuenteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
foure hundred and aboue of Cannon shot. Where
malicious tongues speake of our assaults, I protest we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
one assault in the Fort at breaches and mine, from
nine of the clocke in the morning, vntill two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
where the braue Marquis of <hi>Renti</hi> was hurt, the
great Captaine <hi>Mounsieur de la Mote</hi> lost his right arme,
<hi>Mounsieur de Strippeny,</hi> Colonell of the <hi>Burgonians</hi> slaine,
with diuers Captaines and Officers: besides, by their own
report at that assault they had slaine, aboue seuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and as many hurt: we had hurt and slaine at that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
aboue one hundred and fiftie; where Colonell <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
Sir <hi>Edmond Vdall,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> Captaine <hi>Ferdinando
Gorge,</hi> Master <hi>Selinger,</hi> Captaine <hi>Nicholas Baskeruilde,</hi> with
diuers other Gentlemen and Officers shewed themselues
most valiantlie, both at that assault and at all other serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
during the said Siedge. Captaine <hi>Francis Alene</hi> swam
in with Captaine <hi>Hart</hi> after the breach was made; during
his time, none shewed greater valour. Truelie, all the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi>
with their souldiers shewed themselues constant, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and valiant, especiallie the braue Captaines, <hi>Messures
de Medkerke</hi> and <hi>Erogier.</hi> We were but foure English bands
neere two hundred strong a peece, by reason wee diuided
amongst them some two hundred and fiftie Muskettiers,
who through the meanes of the Gouernour of <hi>Vlishing,</hi>
came with vs from his Garrison, from <hi>Berghen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ostend.</hi>
There were many Lieftenants, Ensignes and Sergeants,
aduenturers, beside those souldiers, the better halfe of our
men were slaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for of 1600. English, Wallons, and Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,
we carried not out 700.</p>
               <p>In respect of our losses, our Captaines asked pay for the
whole numbers; wherefore our masters the States and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
would not confesse our losses to bee so great, from
the first houre of our entrie, vntill our comming out, none
came to vs but those which swamme. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
himselfe asked me before a great number, what were our
losses? I answered him with the troth as neere as I could:
himselfe, and diuers other assured vs, that he lost before
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21333:32"/>
                  <hi>Sluce</hi> fiue and fortie Captaines besides other Chiefes, and
more Souldiers than he lost at <hi>Nuse, Berke, Graue,</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dello.</hi>
What words I spake vnto the Englishmen that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, my companions can witnesse. Some others
(besides the Duke and my selfe) knowes, if I listed, and
promise kept, I might haue had a farre greater number of
Pistolls, than euer I had of Angells. True it is, some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
loue treason, but neuer like the traitors: did they loue
them, they should neuer loue me, for the least thought of
such matters. Where it pleased some to speake of two Irish
Greyhounds, which the Duke requested me to send vnto
him; returning to <hi>Middleborow,</hi> where I found the Earle
our General, he gaue me two faire Greihounds, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me not to faile to send them vnto the Duke: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Master <hi>Steeuens,</hi> sometime seruant vnto the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> returning vnto the Duke, on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
he presented the doggs; for the which it pleased the
Duke to send me a faire Spanish horse with a rich saddle.
The saying is true: It is better for some to steale a horse
than others to looke on: notwithstanding, that I gaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
nor receiued nothing without the consent of my
Generall, it was enuied without more occasion. A faire
horse with rich furniture is easilie discouered by day light,
where bagges or rich bribes can hardlie bee seene, if the
parties hath wit to couer it, the which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
often to many, vnknown to their masters or estates,
els their credites had not troubled <hi>Europe</hi> as it doth, nor
the proceedings against them so slowlie as it is in some
places.</p>
               <p>Some said also; if they had bin in such dangers in <hi>Sluce,</hi>
wherefore gaue the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> such large composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto them? I know no reason but this, sixe daies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we gaue ouer the Towne, all the Captaines and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
met in counsell: Hauing seene our daungers, and
some perceiuing the heate of our succours, wee assigned
our Articles of composition, swore all to haue them gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto vs or to dye, and to burne the Towne and Castle,
so escape that could through the drowned land: The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21333:32"/>
of those Articles with other letters wee sent vnto the
Earle our Generall and Estates, the which came into the
Enemies hands, by reason the messenger was slaine in
swimming by their boates and pallisade on the riuer. This
is well knowne vnto all our companions, for the Marquis
of <hi>Renti</hi> out of his Trench tolde it me openlie before all
our guards at the breach, and that <hi>Owen</hi> a Welsh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
had much adoo to put my foule hand in Italian to
the Duke. Also wee made a sallie, where we lost two Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who shewed them our resolution, the which we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
being face to face with the Duke in our parlie, and
returned once from him into the Towne, thinking he
would not agree vnto some of the articles: but his prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
or his counsell perswaded him to send for vs againe, and
to signe them all. But I protest on the faith of a Christian,
I thinke so wil the rest of my companions protest the like,
for my part I knowe not how wee might haue kept the
Towne twelue houres with the losse of our liues, had wee
been al desperate, if it had pleased the Enemies to attempt
vs: but most true it is, rather than take any base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
some and many would haue ended our liues in that
place. I protest to all manner of qualities, I write not this
with a meaning to condemne any particular nor generall
that should haue succoured vs, nor to robbe the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
of his right; for I confesse my selfe the simplest
Captaine of halfe a dozen that was within the Towne,
three or foure of them, were they knowne and rightlie
iudged, are sufficient to conduct double that Garrison in
anie Armie in the world, and to conduct a greater troupe,
hauing authoritie.</p>
               <p>Some may blame me because I tooke no care in writing
this action of <hi>Sluce</hi> more larger, and in better order; I will
doo it at large in my discourse of the Netherlanders ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
perhaps both that and a number of other matters,
in better order, than some perswaded great Personages, I
could doo.</p>
               <p>True it is, some are to write, some to speake, others to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21333:33"/>
execute. What I want in anie of those vertues, my bloud
