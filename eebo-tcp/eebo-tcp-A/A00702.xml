            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>At these places before recited we stayed and refreshed our selues, sometime we were constrained to put into these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for want of victuals, sometime for to haue their certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats to testifie of our being there: sometimes we were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound, and sundrie accidents worth the noting happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs in many of these places, and our welcome in all places deserueth due commendations, the particulars wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hereafter followeth.</p>
            <p>After we had passed Grauesend as is aforesayd, we came to the lands end, then we bent our course to Margat, which place hauing passed, we woone the forelande with some high billowes.</p>
            <p>From thence to the south forelande, and soone after we put in at Douer, where we stayed about vi. houres, and where we were greatly entertayned.</p>
            <p>From thence we tooke to the Camber nestes, which is betw√©ene Rie and Douer, and so along the mayne Sea to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

fayre L√©e. Then we rowed and sayled along the Coast vntill we came to Beachie and passing by it we har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored at new Hauen in Sussex; where we had reasonable good weather fill we came betw√©ene the Ile of Wight and Portchmouth: there we had a great storme, and in such sort ouerpressed with weather, that wee were constrayned to make towardes a Castle called Hurst Castle, from whence at the fall of winde and tide, we put foorth againe to sea, and recouered to Sandwitch in Dorcetshire. From thence we passed through a race called S. Albons which is a hed land, where we were in a great frett by reason of the race and so continued hazarding our liues by meanes of that fret, to the great and daungerous race of Portland, where by the good direction of our Pilot and master, we sought and stroue by great labour to take the aduantage of the tide and weather, whereby we passed through it in one houre.</p>
            <p>Here did the billowes rise verie hie, so that we were in great daunger, yet God be thanked we escaped them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dammage. From thence we passed to Lime bay, where we staied but one night and from thence to Seaton, at which place we were compelled to carrie and lift vp our boate on shoare, by extremitie of foule weather, for wee were there in great danger, by reason of frets, sands, and fowle weather, which greatly troubled vs.</p>
            <p>From thence we went to Tingmoth, and so to Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, there we remained two daies, and had good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, and great courtesie offred vs by the inhabitants thereof. And vppon the next day morning being Sunday, w√©e put to Sea againe, there hauing a faire winde and tide w√©e came to the Start, where the winde rose and hemde vs in round about, into a verie dangerous race, (this was on the fifteenth of Iuly) where w√©e were in such an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, that we had like to haue b√©ene drowned, yet it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God so farre to worke for vs, that we escaped the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thereof, which done, w√©e went to the westward of Sawcombe, there w√©e were constrained to hale vppe our

               </gap>wer Mill, behind a rocke neare to Sir William Courtney, a verie bountiful knight, at whose house w√©e laie all that night, and would haue had vs to haue staide longer. But from thence hauing faire weather w√©e came to Plimmoth.</p>
            <p>Heere wee mette with her Maiesties shippes, where maister Captaine Fenner and maister Captaine Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, gaue vs great intertainement, especially for that they saw we had leaue giuen vs from the right Honourable of her Maiesties counsell, for our quiet and safe passage. And for that I was her Maiesties messenger, they gaue vs the greater intertainement, and staide there one night, from thence we went to Lowe, and there staide one night, from thence to Sainte Mawes, with verie calme and good wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntil wee came to the Lizard, being a place well knowen to be most dangerous and full of rockes and rases, where God be thanked we passed in the currant of the tide, with great swiftness, but with wonderfull danger, where had it not beene well looked vnto of the maister w√©e had all beene cast away.</p>
            <p>Then we did cutte ouer the Mouse bay to Mouthole which is foure myles beyond the mount, where we were constrained for want of necessarie victuals to come backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to Pensance, where we lodged all night.</p>
            <p>The next morning, we set out to goe for the landes end, where setting from Pensans with our halfe tyde, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the first of the tyde at the lands end, we being in our Boate a great way from the shore, our maister descryed a Pyrate, hauing a vessel of foure tunne, who made towards vs amaine, meaning doubtles to haue robbed vs, but doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such a matter, we rowed so neare the shoare as wee might: and by that time as he was almost come at vs, we were neare to a rocke standing in the sea, where this Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thought to haue taken vs at an aduantage: for being come close to the out side of the saide rocke, called Raynalde stones, he was becalmed &amp; could make no way, and so were
<pb facs="tcp:12834:5"/>
we. But God who neuer faileth those that put their trust in him, sent vs a comfort vnlooked for: for as we rowed to come about by this rocke, suddenly we espyed a plaine and verie easie way for vs to passe on the inner side of the saide rocke, where we went through very pleasantly, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof he could not follow vs: thus we escaped safely, but he was soone after taken and brought in at Bristow. Here we found great breaches, races and rocks, the winde then being Northerly and altogether against vs, which was wonderfull painefull, troublesome, and daungerous to vs, neuerthelesse (God be thanked) we escaped in safetie, and recouered to Saint Iues, where we were well enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The next day we put to sea againe, but being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fiue myles of Saint Iues, we were constrained to s√©eke for a Coue, which we found called Saint Dryuey in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wale.</p>
            <p>Here, for that we wanted victualles, our maister was constrained to goe climbe the great Cliffe at Goodryvey which is at the least fortie fatham hye, and wonderfull st√©epe, which none of vs durst venture to doe, and (God be blessed for it) he had no harme at all, but surely to all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhoodes, had his foote once slipped, there could haue b√©ene no recouery to haue saued him, but that he would haue b√©ene brused in p√©eces.</p>
            <p>At this place we stayed two dayes at maister Aro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles house, where we were greatly welcome, and from thence we went to Bottricks Castell, where dwelleth a gentleman called maister Hynder, there we were wether bound, and constrained to stay full seuent√©ene dayes, where we had great entertainement, he himselfe offering vs, if we would stay a whole yeare, wee should be welcome, and the rather for that I was one of her Maiesties seruants. But vpon the eight√©enth day, the foule wether seasing we did againe put to the sea through the race of Hartland, alias Hartipointe, which is as ill as the race of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, which wee escaped and recouered to Cleuelley,
<pb facs="tcp:12834:6"/>
where wee were entertained by a very courteous gentleman called maister Carey. And from thence wee came to Ilforde Coume, which was on Satterday at night the first of August last past, whereupon for that wee were so neare Bristow, I desired my company that wee might put to sea that night, which they were loth to doe, yet at my importunate sute they graunted thereto. But being at sea, the winde arose very sore from of the land, which put vs all in great feare, whereby I my selfe was constrained to row foure houres alone on the Larboorde side, and my fellowe Rower was compelled to lade forth water so fast as it came into the Boate, which did beate vpon me and ouer me, very sore, the winde then being East and by South. Thus I was constrained to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for life, and yet had almost killed my selfe through the heate I tooke in that time, rowing as is aforesaide, vntill we came to Mynette.</p>
            <p>This done, we went from Mynytte, and so betw√©ene the two homes came to Bristow in one tyde, and arriued at the backe of Bristow, about sixe of the clocke at night.</p>
            <p>But it was wonderfull to s√©e and heare what reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing there was on all sides at our coming: The Maior of Bristow, with his bretheren the Aldermen, came to the water side, and welcomed vs most louingly, and the people came in great multitudes to s√©e vs, in so much as by the consent of the Magistrates, they tooke our Boate from vs, not suffering vs once to meddle with it, in respect that we were all extreame wearie, and carried our saide Boate to the high Crosse, in the Citie, from thence it was conuaied to the towne house, there locked safe all night. And on the next morning the people of the Citie gathered them selues together, &amp; had prepared Trumpets, Drummes, Fyfes, &amp; Ensignes to go before the Boate, which was carried vpon mens shoulders round about the Citie, with the Wait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s of the saide Citie, playing orderly in honour of our rare and daungerous attempt atchiued. Afterwardes we were had
<pb facs="tcp:12834:6"/>
to maister Maiors, to the Aldermen and Sherifies houses, where we were feasted most royally and spared for no cost all the time that we remained there. Thus hauing a while refreshed our selues after our so tedious labours, we came to London on Saterday being the eight of August .1590. where to speake truth without dissembling, our entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at our coming was great and honourable, especially at the Court, and in the Cities of London and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, and generally I found that the people greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced to s√©e vs in all places?</p>
            <p>To conclude, I haue giuen order that the saide Boate shal be brought by land from Bristow to London, where the watermen &amp; sundry other haue promised to grace the saide Boate with great melodie, and sundry volleyes of shot, which very shortly is entended to be performed.</p>
            <p>Here is to be remembred, that betw√©ene Hartie-point and Cleuelly, the winde being verie strong, my companion and oare fellow Andrew Hill in taking downe our sayle, fell ouer boord into the sea, where by great good happe, and by meanes that he helde fast to a p√©ece of our sayle, we recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him and got him vp againe (although he were a verie waightie man) which if we had not done I could not haue gotten any man to haue supplyed his roome: but when we sawe that he was amended, we gaue God thankes for his recouerie.</p>
            <p>Thus to God I with my fellow mates, giue most har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prayers and thankes for our safe deliuerance from so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent daungers as we haue b√©ene in since our departure from the Court at Gr√©enewitch, being still defended by the mightie and handie worke of Almightie God, to whom we in all obedience and duetie dayly pray for the prosperous health of her Maiestie, and her honourable Councell, whose liues and welfare is the strength and maintenance of this land, and whom Almightie God, prosper and preserue now and euer. Amen.</p>
