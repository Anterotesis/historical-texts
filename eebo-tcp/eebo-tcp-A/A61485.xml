            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Vring the time <hi>(Dearest Cousin)</hi> I had the happinesse for some years, not long since, (through your more then generous goodnesse) to call your house, my Home; I could not but take notice how much you were addicted to History, out of a noble desire of acquaintance with former times: insomuch, that the vast bulk of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Fox</hi> his Martyrologie, a volume to be Chronicled for its unweildi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Walter Ralegh's</hi> History of the World; <hi>Purchas</hi> his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, a Book Treating of all the Religions, Lawes, and Customes of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation under Heaven; together with severall other large and tedious Authors, could not deterre your eager eyes, but into these they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though as into Groves and Labyrinths (without <hi>Ariadne's</hi> clew) inextricable; Books that like <hi>China</hi> dishes, or the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> are begun in one Century, and scarce gone through with, in the next; or as it is in curious and long-breath'd Romances, or S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously insinuating <hi>Meanders,</hi> the fancy Travels all day in the paths of expectation, and at night cannot rest on the bed of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>In consideration whereof (worthy Cousin) and at present not being able to serve you with other devoire, I thought good to offer something (though but a mite) in order to acknowledgment of your innumerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, (to wit) this Epitome of the Annalls of <hi>England,</hi> being as it were a glance upon the Reigns of all the Kings, with the two Queens of this Realme, from <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, to the twelfth year of the Reigne of his sacred Majesty <hi>Charls</hi> the Second (God be thanked) now flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; together with the exact and lively Portraicture of every King and Queene in Copper Plates: As also, their severall Elegies in twelve ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which indeed contein as it were a summary and Compendium of the Epitome; all which (not without much pains) I have drawn within the Circle of your eye, so that at once you may read both Lines and Lineaments, which cannot but be of great advantage to your memory, without which reading is but like a mans beholding his face in a glasse, and turning his back to forget what manner of person he was.</p>
            <p>To avoid therefore prolixity, both ingratefull to the Reader, and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb facs="tcp:66405:4"/>
to the Memory, I have perused and compared many vast and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Authours, such as were the most authentick and best approved, and out of them have presented you here Truth, as she ought to be, naked; and by leaving behind those various dresses, the Wardrobe of her needlesse ornaments, that her Authors had set her forth with, I shall render her to you, though not so glorious, yet more memorable. In a word, I have here presented you with much in a little, <hi>Homers</hi> Illiads in a nut-shell; or (if I may say so) the <hi>Pater Noster</hi> in a penny, Chronicle in Shorthand: you have the Marrow, the Graine, the Kernell, let who will take the bones, the husks, and the shells: There is nothing remarkable, but I touch it so farre as the narrow confine of half a sheet will permit, which is enough to enforme and satisfie concerning truth, and in vaine are many words, where one will suffice; for let the Proverb say what it will, The furthest way about is not the nearest way home: Moreover, this advantage accrues to our concisenesse, That before you can read the circumstantialls of one Kings Life in a volumne, you may here run over the atchievments of them all since the Conquest, and thereof give a landable account.</p>
            <p>But least whilst I thus complement with your patience in illustrating the advantages of brevity, I forget my self, and let my so much talkt of Epitome (like that little City) run out at the Gates of my Dedication, I will shut up all, and make this an Oblation to your memory, not your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is so vast and unfathomed it would swell it self into such a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne of obliges, that my whole work would scarce look big enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Epistle to it. To summe up all your particular goodnesses and my severall engagements, were to baffle Arithmetick with the Sands, and to lay the first stone of a work of eternity; for I know neither where to begin nor where to end: but as with many, acknowledgment of former favours is a tacit begging of future; so it is with me, while I stalk with one cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie for another, making my gratitude for what I have, a Preface to what I would have. In plain English, I thank you for your first kindnesse, and betray you to a second, which is, That you would pardon me, in that I have unknown to you presumed to make this Book publick under the honour of your name; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Dward</hi> the Confessor ere he dyed, promised the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> after his deceas, in regard he was his Kinsman, &amp; near of bloud to him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>William</hi> was a Bastard, begot of one <hi>Arlot</hi> a Country Maid, in respect of which, the abused English to this day call light Wenches Harlots, only adding an aspiration to <hi>Arlot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Harold</hi> the Son of <hi>Goodwin</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> a bold man, and a good Souldier, possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by force of the Kingdome, during the <hi>Inter Regnum,</hi> not waiting the consent of the Nobility, though his Brother <hi>Tosto</hi> strove against him all he could, and waged War with him; But at <hi>York Tosto</hi> lost his life in a pitcht battel; in the mean while <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> depending on his right, raised an Army, and came for <hi>England</hi> to the South <hi>Saxons: Harold</hi> hearing of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, though his Souldiers were tired in the late fight, sets up his Standard against his new Enemy <hi>William</hi>: Not far from <hi>Hastings</hi> they fought a sore Battel, but Fortune turning against the English; <hi>Harold</hi> driven forward with a warlike fury, riding into the midst of his Enemies, and fighting vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly was slaine, and a great number of his men fell with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour presently brings his conquering Banners to <hi>London,</hi> and is proclaimed King by the people that remained, having got a Kingdome by a lawfull Victory, which (as he said) was given him of God. This King (as commonly Conquerours doe) abolishing forthwith all the Customes of the English Nation, and most of their Laws; brought in immediately his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fashions, and commanded that all Causes should be pleaded in <hi>French</hi>: And excluding all the English that had boarn Armes against him out of their Patrimonies, he disposed of all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes and Fields, and the rest of their Goods among his Souldiers, for a Reward of their Victory; reserving to himself the direct principallity and homage, held to himself and his Heirs, as a Tenure from the Crowne; so that none but the King should be the right and true Lord of any thing.</p>
               <p>Also he caused a Seal to be made for himself, wherein was engraved, <hi>By this acknowledge William of Normandy to be your Patron</hi>; but on the other side was engraven, <hi>By this Seal you must know that the same is King of England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus subdued the Laity he turns himself to the Clergy, and made an Edict, that no English Monk should be capable of any secular dignity; disdaining the facilnesse of <hi>Canutus,</hi> who was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly King, who had continued the honours, entreating the people whom he had subdued; by which Lenity the Inhabitants growing bold, after his death easily expelled Forreigners, and redeemed their former Liberty.</p>
               <p>Then he appeased the approaching War of the <hi>Danes,</hi> by giving them money that he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it peaceably at any rate: And hence it was that the English were in no fear at all of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who formerly so infested them; yet they were not so free from troubles, but that here and there arose some tumults among the people, that were hardly suppressed and overcome; but the windy Faction was easily dispersed.</p>
               <p>The greatest matter was the Rebellion of his Son <hi>Robert</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> because it was most against Nature. This Son at the Instigation of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> demanded this Dukedome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as his proper Right; and without more words enters upon <hi>Normandy</hi> by force of Armes. It is true, his Father had promised him this Territory, but the Son was weary of delay, nor would he longer forbear from the Government he looked for: The King hearing of his Sons Enterprize, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly goes against him with a strong Army; they meet in Battel, the Son unhorses his Father, and wounds him in the arme; but when he knew his Fathers Voyce, alighting from his horse he raiseth his Father from the ground, and kneeling down before him, craved pardon for his boldnesse, which he obtained presently, his Father embracing him in his armes: however he seemed thus to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased his Fathers wrath, yet God never suffering such faults to escape unpunished, he had no good luck ever after.</p>
               <p>Having conquered the Rebels partly by Sweetnesse and partly by Sword, he endeavours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Kingdome, bringing <hi>Wales</hi> under his Command; and causing <hi>Malcom</hi> King of Scots to doe him homage, and so adding new Countryes, he (in some measure) rewarded <hi>England</hi> for the Crown they gave unto him: Yet least the frowardnesse of his newly conquered Subjects should grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, he laid upon them Taxes and Tributes, that differed them little from slaves; seeking by all means to weed out and keep under hatches the Nobility, and with continuall Battels to wast and wear out the Commonalty. Only the men of <hi>Kent</hi> held their old Customes: For the King upon a certaine time journeying toward <hi>Dover,</hi> was handsomly circumvented by the Inhabitants of <hi>Kent,</hi> carrying Boughes cut down from Trees, nor would they suffer him to depart untill he had granted them the enjoyment of their ancient Customes; also he was indulgent to the Londoners to let them enjoy the priviledges they had in the Time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor; but he forbad the Nobility <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Illiam</hi> the Conquerour being Deceased, the Crown of <hi>England</hi> by right of succession fell to <hi>Robert</hi> his Eldest Son; but he being in <hi>Germany, Lanfrank</hi> then Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who by reason of his great Learning and singular vertue, was in high and reverend esteeme with the people) so prevailed with the dying Conquerour <hi>William</hi> the first, that instead of <hi>Robert</hi> (the true Heir by Primogeniture) <hi>William</hi> surnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi> because of his Ruddy or Red Complexion (though the younger Brother) was Crowned King of <hi>England, Sept</hi>: 9. 1087. The Beginning of his Reigne was very troublesome and unquiet: For his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> took great offence at his attempt to take advantage of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, (honestly employed in his fathers service) to intercept his Crown and dignity, which in his Conscience belonged justly, and only to him. But not long after, enraged <hi>Robert</hi> entered with a very puissant Army of valiant <hi>Normans,</hi> and many <hi>French,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> their King had waged for his ayde, the Confines of <hi>England</hi> resolving with his Presence, to regaine what he had lost by his Absence; abhorring that his Right should be made a prey to any Usurper: But such, and so flexible was the Dukes disposition (though in boldness, and valour he were second to none) that he rather enclined himself to a tranquill and peaceable condition, which was gently craved by his Brother, then (by the effusion of much bloud, which of necessity must have followed) to possesse himself of this Crowne: So that in the end, being fairly promised, that in case he survived, he should succeed: He accepted the grant of three thousand Marks <hi>per Annum</hi> from his Brother, and took a friendly leave, and returned safely home into his own Dutchie of <hi>Normandy.</hi> Presently after this, <hi>Malcom</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> denyes homage, but <hi>William</hi> enters his Territories with an Army, and subduing him, takes Hostages for his future Obedience. The King by these Victories more strongly footed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Realme of <hi>England;</hi> and being better assured of his establishment than heretofore, began to tread in his Fathers steps, and with like severity and oppression to humble the haughty spirits of the English, and put a check to their courage: and finding by pollicy that plenty puffeth up, also, that penury prevents the danger of opposition, by bereaving them of those requisites that might promote his fear, and their hope: falls to imposing on them many intollerable taxes, which by his greedy Ministers, he levied with such despite, and cruelty, that they might well perceive that he meant nothing more then to cut the nerves and sinews of their strength, making it his grand design to dash the hopes of their Redemption. Now againe, <hi>Robert</hi> the Kings Brother once more proclaimes Warre against him, for lack of the Money he promised him in lieu of the forbearance of his Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>; and the King of <hi>France</hi> taking his part, he took some Towns by force from his Brother which of right belonged to him: But the King of <hi>France</hi> (bribed by <hi>William</hi>) forsook <hi>Robert,</hi> so that being deprived of assistance, he compelled him to crave pardon. In the sixt year of his Reign his prosperity was interrupted by the obstinate Rebellion of <hi>Rees</hi> the last King of the <hi>Welch</hi> men, who so infested him with broken Wars, that for many Months together, being urged to fight with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains (to which upon all enforcements they fled) instead of combating with men, he could find no rest: But such was his Resolution and undaunted Courage, to withstand the strongest push of all extremities, that in the end he slew their King, and obtained a glorious Victory, and thereby better secured the subjection of the <hi>Welch</hi> men, then any his predecessors heretofore. But <hi>Malcom</hi> finding <hi>William</hi> embroyled in new troubles, again invades <hi>England,</hi> and is slain by <hi>Mowbray</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Now came the King (after many covetous and ingratefull oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the English Nobles and Commons, to whom he owed his rescue from many perils of his Crowne and Life) to use the same hard measure to the Clergy; for such was his impiety, by all possible means to enrich himself, that he sold for money the greatest promotions in Church and Common-weal; and did prohibit the Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to assemble any Convocation or Synod, for the well ordering of the Clergy; by means whereof he secretly filled his Coffers with Treasure. The Bishop complains to Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi> who having newly excommunicated the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth (the first Christian Prince that ever was excommunicated) durst not have too many Irons in the fire at once, not knowing what would become of the first; forbears his Bull, and sends a Command to the King to redintegrate with the Bishops, which the King slights, nevertheless, at last a reconciliation is made. This <hi>William</hi> was as valiant a Prince as the World ever had; and a great opposer of the indirect courses of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Many fearfull things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Reigne, as Earthquakes, dreadfull Lightnings, and Apparitions, blazing Comets in strange Figures, great Inundations to the destruction of many of his people, and very much Land overwhelmed with the Sea, never to be recovered; amongst the which Earl <hi>Godwins</hi> Lands were drowned, and never to be recovered, and are now called <hi>Godwins Sands.</hi> At <hi>Finchamstead</hi> in <hi>Berkshire</hi> there was a Well that flowed blood fifteen dayes.

               <p>Now the Kingdome he had obtained by fraud, he means to confirm by gentleness, good deeds, and just punishments: He every where prefers learned men to places in the Church, and removed such as were unworthy and unlearned from Church preferment: He mitigates the more severe Laws, and abolishes hard Customes: He grants the Nobility free leave to hunt, and to enclose Parks for Deer, and free Warrens for their Conyes, and such like Game; and as Traytors to his vertues, state and Kingly government, he banished from his Court all Flatterers, and all nicenesse in behaviour, Luxuriousness and gorgeousness in apparel, and superfluity in dyet: He ordained punishments by death for such as rob by the high way; and with wonderfull travel and industry he reformed the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous pride, avarice, and secure sloth and negligence of the Clergy: He recalled from banishment <hi>Anselm</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> giving him full power to assemble Synods and Convocations at his pleasure, for the rectifying of such things that were amisse in the Church: He piously and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestowed on godly sober grave Divines, all such livings and Ecclesiasticall promotions, as his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unjustly detained, by the lewd advice of <hi>Reynulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> whom he sent prisoner to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> from whence not long after, the said wicked Bishop escaped and fled into <hi>Normandy</hi> to Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> whom he eagerly perswaded to claim his Crown with his Sword, who thereupon levies a great Army, which he intended with all expedition to transport into this Realme; but as King <hi>Henry</hi> by his former clemencies had rooted himself in the peoples love; so to assure himself the better of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he takes <hi>Maud</hi> the Sister of King <hi>Edgar</hi> to be his Wife, who was daughter to <hi>Malcom</hi> by his Wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was Sister to <hi>Edgar Adeling,</hi> who dyed without issue, and Daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> the victorious and valiant King of the <hi>Saxons. Robert</hi> was now arrived in <hi>England</hi> with a puissant Army, and the day for Battel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the Heraulds were sent up and down; but at last, as a thick lowring cloud is somtimes dispersed by a fair shining Sun; so by the discreet mediation of worthy friends, there was a friendly peace concluded between the two brothers, on the same terms agreed on in King <hi>Rufus</hi> days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Norman</hi> Lords were much discontented, and returned home with the Duke. This danger dispelled, <hi>Beliamy</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Mortain</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> rebell, but are soon sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. But now <hi>Henry</hi> (who was hitherto on the defensive part) takes up Armes of his own accord against his Brother (whether out of some distast for some scoffe his Brother gave him, or which is more like, stirred up with ambition and avarice to inlarge his Dominions) and joyning with the <hi>Norman</hi> male-contented Nobles, with little adoe chased the forsaken Duke from place to place, and won from him the Cities of <hi>Roan, Cane, Valoyes,</hi> &amp; indeed all <hi>Normandy,</hi> &amp; presently in great honour and triumph he returns for <hi>England. Robert</hi> having thus made tryall of his brothers severity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvs now to make tryall of his lenity; whereupon he follows after his Brother into <hi>England,</hi> and very submissively deprecates his error, and begs his pardon: But <hi>Henry</hi> either offended with the now fresh injury of his brother; Or affecting the Dukedome of <hi>Normandy,</hi> departs unkindly from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and distressed Duke his Brother; <hi>Coily</hi> refusing to accept of his submission, which in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility by him was prosfered. But <hi>Robert</hi> being impatient of that scorn his distress had begot him; returns in all speed into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and once more levies an Army, resolving rather to dye manfully fighting in the Field, then to follow the funeralls of his own Honour: but his brother was prevalent and prevents him with a greater force, suppressing the mischief in the Birth, but not without bloud, bringing his Brother Captive into <hi>England,</hi> where for that he (at Natures enticement) practised his escape, at his brothers Commandement both his eyes were pluckt out, after which he lived as a miserable and wretched Captive, the space of more then twenty years; at length he dyed and was buryed at <hi>Gloucester.</hi> This success made <hi>Henry</hi> magnificent, but envied, whence arose a foraigne War, which by power and pollicy he quieted, granting to <hi>William</hi> the Dukedome of <hi>Normandy</hi> upon condition of Homage. But <hi>Charls</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> being wickedly slain at <hi>Brussels,</hi> leaving no other Heir, <hi>William</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert,</hi> who was the next right Heir to it (for that he was of the Bloud of <hi>Maud</hi> Daughter to <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and Wife to <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour) was elevated to this Dignity; who growing insolent with this prosperity, endeavours to recover <hi>Normandy</hi> his Patrimony by his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,

Moreover, to win the good Will of strangers, he obtained for his Son <hi>Eustace, Constance</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France;</hi> yet did he not more by this marriage, than by treasures strengthen himself in the Kingdome, of which he spent not luxuriously, but to levy Soldiers with, and wage war, which he too soon had occasion for: Scarce was he Crowned before he was forced to fall to his Armes; for <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> striving to assert the interest of <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse, proclaimed War against him, and possessed himself of the Towns of <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>New-Castle</hi>; but <hi>Stephen</hi> presently marched against him with a great Army, and granting <hi>Cumberland</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> and the County of <hi>Huntington</hi> to his son, he put by a great storm, without any bloud-shed at all: Yet notwithstanding, not long after (in pursuance of <hi>Maud</hi> his Neeces Quarrell) he again enters and resists the Northern Parts of this Kingdome with fire and sword: but in the end he was encountered by <hi>Thurston</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> who compelled him, being pursued with unspeakable dangers, to fly into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and leave behind him dead upon the ground, more then ten thousand of his Army. Scarce had he composed domestick Commotions, but he is saluted with an Alarum from abroad, from <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse, who accompanied with <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> her base brother, landed with an Army in <hi>England,</hi> and was quickly strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and emboldened in her enterprise, by the wonderfull access of many of the English, and of <hi>Raynulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> with a lusty Crew of bold and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Tephen</hi> having now paid his debt to Nature, it remained that his Engagements also be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to his adopted Heir, which in like manner was in a short time performed, for <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Empress <hi>Mauds</hi> son, according to agreement succeeded him in the Throne, who with the great applause and generall liking of all men, was rightly Crowned at <hi>Westminster</hi> by the hands of <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>: He was also Crowned at <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and Thirdly at <hi>Worcester; Malcome</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> joyning with him confederate.</p>
               <p>He behaved himself wisely in the beginning of his Reigne, making election of the wisest men he could get for Counsellers: he expelled strangers, such as came in hope of rapine; especially those of <hi>Flanders</hi>; demolishing the Castles that the Nobility had built at the Connivance of King <hi>Stephen</hi> which they had often abused to sedition. The Laws also that were faulty during the War, he reduced to their former integrity. The Demeans bestowed by King <hi>Stephen</hi> on such as were unworthy, he took away to himself, and so spared his subjects from Tribute and Taxes, deeming it safer to offend a few then many. Singular was the zeal this King bare to the furtherance of Justice and equity; for he divided his Kingdom into six several Circuits; and for the better administration of Justice, together with the tryal of Causes between man and man, and for the greater ease and comfort of his subjects, he appoynted severall Judges twice in every year to ride those Circuits; which course and order is continually observed to this day. He also resumed into his own hands the Province of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> together with the Earldome which <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> his Son had received Giftwise of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> because they should not further intermeddle in the interest of his Mother <hi>Maud</hi> the Empress to the Crown. In the thirteenth year of his Reign he marryed <hi>Geofrie</hi> (one of his younger sons) to <hi>Constance</hi> the daughter, and heir apparent to <hi>Conaccus</hi> Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> who dyed not long after, and left to them that Dutchie. He also affied his younger son <hi>Richard</hi> unto <hi>Adela,</hi> one of the Daughters of <hi>Lewis</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi>; and marryed his Daughter <hi>Maud</hi> to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>: Much about this time dyed <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse, his Mother.</p>
               <p>In the Nineteenth year of his Reign, for that the Irish Nation attempted to deprive him of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Territories in that Island (left him by his Predecessors) he sailed thither with a mighty Army, and fought many victorious Battles against Five Kings, which at that time reigned there, all which he did subdue, and made subject to himself, and became sole Lord of all that Country, and annexed that Title unto his Crown; and returned loaden with honours into this Kingdome. If he managed all things wisely hitherto, now does he shew as much weakness and infirmity, making his Son <hi>Henry</hi> and his Wife <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter to the French King, to be twice solemnly crowned in the presence of his people (himself the second time for that day leaving the Title of a King, and serving as a sewer at his Sons Table) whereat his proud Son made no wonder, but publickly affirmed that his Father was thereby no whit dishonoured, for that he was only the son of an Empress, but he himself was the son both of a King, and also of a Queen. In the mean time <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, fell to upbraid his pusillanimity, that he being entered into the Government and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King, would permit his father to be equall with him in the Kingdome, contenting himself to be a Titular King only; he easily enflamed his youthfull mind too ready to be set on fire with unlawful desires. This secret Envy began now to break forth into open hate, and the son constantly cavilled at every thing the father did, or said; Nor was the sons horrible ingratitude unknown to the Father; wherefore Messengers were sent to <hi>Lewis</hi> to oppress and extinguish those so sad beginnings of discord. But <hi>Lewis</hi> instead of doing good offices of reconciliation, laught at the Embassadors, asking them scornfully, why they called him Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But these things ended not thus, for many jarrs and quarrels arose betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> the Father and <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King, which at length were decided by sharp and bloudy Wars: In all which most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally <hi>Henry, Geofry</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and most undutifully <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> together with <hi>William</hi> then King of <hi>Scots,</hi> took part with the French against the King; in all which (notwithstanding) King <hi>Henry</hi> by noble courage and princely prowesse did still prevaile; and upon submission granted pardon to his sons and all their Complices. Yet were his sons after grievously punished by God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Henry</hi> dyed before his Father, in the prime and flower of his youth; and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who after was King, was poysoned by a Monk in <hi>Swinstead</hi> Abbey in <hi>Lincolnshire</hi>: Yet these unnaturall Rebellions of his own Children (to whom he had been so indulgent a father) moved such a passion in his perplexed mind, as it suddenly struck him into a Feaver, extream dangerous; and hearing that his son <hi>Richard</hi> had raised a new broyl against him, he could no longer sustain the wounds of his spirit, but within a day or two breathed out his last, when he had reigned almost 25 years, and was buryed at <hi>Fontenward</hi> in <hi>Normandy.</hi> The History of this Kings reign approveth him to have been wise, learned, just, politick, and valiant, (save in that over-indulgence to his graceless children)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66405:9"/>
and what not a little addeth to the number and splendour of his commendations, was, that albeit he were often engaged in business, some of them concerning his Wars in <hi>France, Normandy, Anjou, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in other places, and some of them respecting his Politick Rule, and government at home; yet he never imposed upon his subjects any extraordinary Tax or payment whatsoever; yet left he unto his Successor more than 900000 pounds in silver and gold, besides Plate, Jewels, houshold-stuff, and plentifull provision for the War. And though in most things prosperity made him happy, yet in three things he was unfortunate: The 1. was the unnaturall disobedience and revolt of the fruit of his own Loyns: The 2. was his unquenchable lust to his inseperable Concubine the beautious <hi>Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who being admirably fair, and wantonly condition'd, too much estranged his affections from <hi>Eleanor</hi> his renowned Queen, and made his desires subject, nay slavish to the others wanton Will. The 3. was the irreconcileable dissention betwixt him and <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> the insolent Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The King is accused of his death by the Pope, which he denyes upon oath; yet the Pope enjoyns him for pennance 3. years War in person in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which he redeemed by ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting 3. houses of Religion; and to go from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Canterbury</hi> bare-footed to visit <hi>Beckets</hi> shrine, which he did, &amp; suffer'd himself to be scourg'd by every Monk. Thus this King ended all his troubles.</p>

Many were the honourable and profitable promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he heaped upon his brother <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom he created Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> giving to him moreover the Provinces of <hi>Nottingham, Devonshire,</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and marryed him to the sole and only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir of the Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> from whom he received the Lordship of that Country. Too great favours conferred on subjects make them aspire too high: Just so was it with the King and his Brother <hi>Iohn</hi>; for when the King had poured upon him plentifull showers of his bounty, and had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to honour and estate above all others, his thoughts mounted above the Moon, and made him unnaturally and unthankfully to affect the Crown. This King (for his invincible valour and haughty courage) was esteemed to be most matchless in the Christian World, so that he was surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cuer de Lion,</hi> or Lyons heart. His Fathers Coffers enriched him with great store of Gold and Silver; and such was his contempt of riches, and bounty to such as either deserved well, or were men of any noble worth, that he bestowed on them great gifts with such alacrity, that in short time he unbowelled all his bags, little foreseeing that future business might require the expence of more then the great plenty which was left unto him, and that when he wanted he should be driven to hard shifts to relieve himself. This King was Crown'd at <hi>Westminster, Sept.</hi> 3. 1189. by <hi>Baldwin</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> namely on that day so memorable for an accidentall slaughter of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose insolence he abundantly restrained, by giving License to Weed out that odious kind of men, which for their blasphemies he hated. No sooner was he crowned, but at the instigation of the Pope he was engaged with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Leopald</hi> Arch Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and many other Christian Princes, to win <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which he did.</p>
               <p>These things concluded (although the Kings profuse bounty and great expenses had made him bare and needy) yet would he not burthen his people with any tax to supply his wants; but rather chose to raise mony out of his own Estate, which he did by selling Priviledges, Demeans, Immunities and Cities, among which sales he sold <hi>Barwick</hi> Castle and <hi>Rokesborough</hi> to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> for ten thousand pounds: and the Lordship and Earldome of <hi>Durham</hi> to <hi>Hugh</hi> then Bishop of that See, for much money: and he did protest, that for the performing of so great and honourable a Service, he was not unwilling to sell his City of <hi>London</hi> it self (if any were able to purchase it) rather then he would be chargeable unto others.</p>
               <p>And thus the King having furnished himself with all provisions necessary for his Journey; he for the time of his absence entrusted the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Hugh Baldulph</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and to <hi>William Prunellus,</hi> and <hi>William Longo Scampius</hi> Chancellor of the Kingdome, dividing to each his part and Proportion; he set <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> a man of honesty and integrity, over <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> and <hi>Aquitane</hi>; yet to prevent the ambition of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he was minded to send him into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> but his Mother interceding for him, and becoming surety for his fidelity, he was left in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> Lastly, appoynting <hi>Arthur</hi> his brother <hi>Ieffery</hi> his Son to be his Successour in case he should dye in this Expedition. He enters upon his Voyage accompanied with many Gallant Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, whose Resolutions much increased his hopes of good successe.</p>
               <p>In the way contrary Winds drive him upon <hi>Cyprus,</hi> assails and wins it; of which <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> demands a share. <hi>Richard</hi> denies him, and thence arose a great feud between the two Kings, which put a great stop to the whole Enterprize. <hi>Richard</hi> got great renowne; but being forsaken by

But the Pope neglects the Kings Entreaty, and confirms him that was first Elected; at which the King fretted, and stormed much to see himself so slenderly regarded: The Monks also (to please the King) refuse to receive their own first election, because it was made in the night. At last the Pope would (whether the King would or no) make choyce of one <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> (one of his Creatures) to succeed in the Arch-Bishoprick: The King stoutly keeps him off, and confiscates all the Lands and Goods of such as partake in the election with <hi>Rome,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all appeals thither. The Pope after a proud letter or two, interdicts him and all his Kingdome, which he very frankly gives to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King; who coming to invade and possesse himself of the Popes gift, lost three hundred of his Ships, and returned home as he came.</p>

By these misfortunes he was forced to take Conditions of a hundred and five thousand Franks in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the charge he had been at; he renouncing all right to the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi>: And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising faithfully to prevaile with his father to restore all the Provinces in <hi>France</hi> belonging to the English. The King restored to the rebellious Nobility all the Lands belonging to them: And <hi>Lewis</hi> at <hi>Dover</hi> set Saile for <hi>France,</hi> having warred unhappily in anothers Land. Then a Parliament was summoned, and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ratified, also the Court of <hi>Wards</hi> was revived, and a Tax grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King to Levy an Army under the Conduct of his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> for the recovery of his Rights in <hi>France.</hi> The Parliament being ended, the said Tax with great celerity is collected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the lest grutch or contradiction; so that the Kings Coffers were replenished with Gold and Silver; and all requisites were carefully provided, and a gallant Army of couragious men of War were assembled, and safely transported. With which <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings Brother did (almost) wonders, subduing where he found resistance, and seizing upon Lordships, Forts, Towns, Castles, and other defenced places, quietly and without blowes, no Head being made against him; so that within few Months (such was his valour and good Fortune) he recovered both those Provinces wholly for the King, and returned with much honour into <hi>England.</hi> But the Kings absence from those Places gave opportunity to the <hi>French</hi> King to infest them, which he unfriendly laid hold on, and suddenly led a new Army into <hi>Poicters,</hi> and easily made himself Lord thereof. From thence marcht to <hi>Perigott,</hi> and <hi>Alverne,</hi> and other places in <hi>Guyan,</hi> where he did the like. But King <hi>Henry</hi> sent thither an other Army under the Conduct of his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> with which he encountered the <hi>French,</hi> and fought many sharp Battels, in which for the most part his Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued prosperous; and all things seemed to promise him the recovering of whatever (in his absence) had been lost: But in the height of all these broyles a friendly peace was concluded betwixt the two Kings, and <hi>Richard</hi> returned safe into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>And now began those mischievous broyls and turmoyls in this Realm, which (until the Kings death) daily vexed him more and more, and the whole Kingdome also; for the King lending too ready and pleasing an ear to lewd and evill Officers about him (whom above all Officers he loved and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by whose Counsell and advice both himself and his whole Kingdom was ruled and directed) made little account of his best Subjects Love: And took from them (in divers things) such Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as by the Lawes and Ordinances of this Kingdome they justly claimed, and ought to have enjoyed. He also pinched his people with many unnecessary and grievous Taxes, which by those lewd and bold Officers were levied with much rigour and sharpness, to their great distast. The King also took to Wife <hi>Eleoner</hi> Daughter of <hi>Raymond</hi> Earle of <hi>Province,</hi> whereby there grew no profit to his affairs, but rather suffered great detriment by reason of her thread-bare and beggarly Family; and her poor kindred flocking from all Parts as Crowes to the Prey, which, nevertheless, were highly entertained by the King, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen King <hi>Henry</hi> died, <hi>Edward</hi> his son and heir was in <hi>Palestine,</hi> very intent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the holy war, where he underwent a grievous danger, having received 3 desperate wounds from his adversary with a poysoned weapon: But he was cured by the wonderfull Piety of his Wife, who with her mouth in time suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the venome from his wounds. In his way, being made more certain of his fathers death, he made great journeyes and travelled in all hast into <hi>England,</hi> where (with the generall applause both of his Nobles, and Common-people) he was crowned King when he was of the age of 35 years. At the beginning of his Reigne he used the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility well; but to abate the insolence of the Clergy, he commanded their wealth to be brought into his Exchequer, and he afflicted them otherwise, and so drew upon himself their envy. The <hi>Welch</hi> rise against him, but he luckily intercepts <hi>Eleoner, Monfort</hi>'s daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, espoused to <hi>Lluellen</hi> their Prince, upon surrender of whom that storm blew over, and obedience was promised by the <hi>Welch</hi> to King <hi>Edward.</hi> But within few years, three or four at most, <hi>Lluellen</hi> puts an end to his Oath and obedience, for his wife <hi>Eleoner</hi> being dead he breaks forth into new Rebellions; also <hi>David</hi> forgetting the great love of King <hi>Edward</hi> to him, falls off to his brother, and so with joynt forces they enter <hi>England,</hi> and does some mischief to <hi>Edward</hi>; both of them wonderfully inflamed by a false prophesie of <hi>Merlin,</hi> whereby the Crowne of <hi>Brutus</hi> was promised to <hi>Lluellen</hi>; but the battle being set, <hi>Lluellen</hi> was killed by a private Soldier, and his Head brought to King <hi>Edward</hi>; his Brother <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> also was taken, and had his Head struck off, and with his Brothers it was set upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where it remained a long time after, but his four Quarters were sent to four Principall Cities in <hi>England,</hi> to be set up for a terrour to all Traitors hereafter: so <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> revenged the Rebellion of the <hi>Welch,</hi> and the death of <hi>Alphonsus</hi> his first Borne, who was slain in the same battle. In the eighteenth year of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reigne, <hi>Alexander</hi> the King of <hi>Scots</hi> (not having any Issue of his body) fell with his horse, and unfortunately brake his neck: He had three sisters; the eldest of which was married to <hi>Iohn Balioll,</hi> Lord of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi>; the second to <hi>Robert le Bruse,</hi> Lord of <hi>Valley-Andrew</hi>; and the third was married into <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Iohn Hastings,</hi> Lord of <hi>Abergavenny</hi>: amongst these three (each of them backed with his best friends) sharp bickerings and civill wars arose, to the destruction of many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy persons on all sides: Whilst the matter thus was handled, King <hi>Edward</hi> promises the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>Bruse</hi> for ever, so he would do him homage for it; but <hi>Bruse</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, preferring his Countries Liberty before his own honour. Yet <hi>Balioll</hi> yields to those conditions, and so got the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the ill will of all his Country-men.</p>
               <p>Envy against him increased for refusing Justice upon the death of the Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> who was slaine; for <hi>Baylioll</hi> exempted <hi>Alberme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h</hi> from punishment that slew him; whereupon <hi>Baylioll</hi> cited before <hi>Edward</hi>'s Tribunall is forced to plead his cause; he was angry at this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and denies Homage to <hi>Edward,</hi> and proclaims warre, (making a Covenant with the <hi>French</hi> King.) Hence arose the cause of a most bloudy warre between the two Nations, which lasted for three hundred years, only some feigned cessations passed between.</p>
               <p>No lesse than four times did this victorious King <hi>Edward</hi> subdue the false and fraudulent <hi>Scots,</hi> compelling them with extraordinary tokens of subjection and humility, to submit themselves to his mercy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time a new warre breaks forth between King <hi>Edward</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, by a controversie between the subjects of either King, for Kings that envy one another, easily break forth into open Hatred: but <hi>Edward</hi> had other grudges against the <hi>French,</hi> for conniving at the death of his Cousen <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperors Son. <hi>Edward</hi> therefore when a day was appointed him, hath a stipendary to plead his cause before King <hi>Philip,</hi> he refused to appeare; whereupon a great Army being raised, <hi>Philip</hi> enters upon the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of King <hi>Edward</hi> in <hi>France</hi> by force of Armes; the King of <hi>England</hi> by the assistance of neighbour Princes, the Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> with <hi>Adolphus</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi>; the Roman Emperour presently marches against the King of <hi>France,</hi> but finding the <hi>French</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in two parts and defrauded with the Emperours delayes, when he had held his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters quarters at <hi>Gaunt</hi> not without the murmuring of the Citizens, and great want of his souldiers; At the beginning of the spring, truce being made with the <hi>French</hi> for three years: the King tooke <hi>Margaret</hi> (the Dukes sister) to wife, (for <hi>Eleoner</hi> died in the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition against the <hi>Scots</hi>) And the daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> being betrothed to King <hi>Edwards</hi> sonne he retreated for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:66405:13"/>About the same time Doctor <hi>Langton,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> complained grievously to the King upon <hi>Edward</hi> the young Prince, who (by the lewd advice of <hi>Pierce Gaveston,</hi> his loose and gracelesse Companion) brake forcibly into his Park, and made havock of his Game; for which the Prince was committed to Prison, and <hi>Gaveston</hi> banished for ever.</p>
               <p>Lastly, making an incursion into <hi>Scotland</hi> he is taken with a Disentery and dies of it, and lies buried at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was very tall, of Countenance somwhat sorrowfull, of Chastitie like his Father, but in fortitude farre before him; Religious he was and wise.</p>

               <p>The Noble men (who perfectly knew how wickedly this <hi>Gaveston</hi> was enclined) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the King doted on him, and that his affections towards him were unlimited, being perplexed with inward grief, and foreseeing that his insolence would be the ruine of the Realme, emboldened themselves to put the King in mind of his Oath: But as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science nothing troubled him for the breach thereof, so their disliking encreased his desires towards <hi>Gaveston,</hi> and to make him great, which was the next thing he took in hand: and now none but <hi>Gaveston</hi> must rule all in all; frown who would the King cared not, <hi>Gaveston</hi> must and shall be great; and therefore first, he is Lorded with the Baronie of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and soon after he is created Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi>; and if this was not enough to make him rich, he is made sole Commander over the Kings Jewells and Treasures; in which O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He also took much pleasure to feed the Kings fancy with great variety of delights, and by his example he inured him to excessive banqueting and drunkennesse; and his vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast all urements, made him carelesse of the bed and society of his Religious and Vertuous Queen <hi>Isabel</hi> the Daughter of the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> the fair, &amp; Sister to <hi>Charls</hi> his successor, and trained him to the adulterous Consortship of wanton curtizans, and shameless Whores.

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ICHARD</hi> the Second (being the Son and Heir of the black Prince, and aged 11 years, and somwhat more) was crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> in the year of our Lord one thousand three hundred and seventy seven. The Kingdome was in an Eclipse the most part of this Kings Reigne: his youth with all the frailties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident thereunto, with bad Governours both of his kingdome and person, were the main ruines of the King, and almost the Realme: For in the whole course of his Government he neglected his Nobillity, and taxed his subjects to enable him to give prodigally to his Sycophants and ill deserving Favourites. He was too too resolute in his wayes, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be reformed, be they never so indirect. He also despised the sage advice and good directions of his best counsellers; and wholly plotted all his courses by the wicked &amp; grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse projects of his base and loose companions, whom he raised to more honourable estates than befitted the meannesse of their Conditions; so that they fell by their own weight: and he himself (in the end) was enforced to endure the extremity of his hard fortune. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first disgraced by his Cousin <hi>Henry Bullingbrook</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and Son and Heir to his Unkle <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>; he was at length by him (with the generall consent of a whole Parliament) deposed from his Crown, committed to prison, and afterwards wickedly murthered, as in this discourse of his disorderly government more amply shall appear.</p>
               <p>In the first year of King <hi>Richards</hi> Reigne, <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King (presuming much on his minority, and being aided by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> landed in the South-east, and South-west parts of this kingdome, and ransacked and burnt the Towns of <hi>Plymouth, Rye, Dartmouth, Portsmouth,</hi> and some other Towns and Villages coasting upon the Sea; and would have done more mischief, if by the Kings Unkle, <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>Langley,</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and by the Earls of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Salisbury</hi> they had not been fought with, and beaten to their Ships.</p>
               <p>At the same time one <hi>Ramsey</hi> a Scot cunningly surprised the Castle of <hi>Barwick,</hi> but was soon beaten out again, all the desperadoes being put to death but himself. Again the <hi>French</hi> infest the Coasts of <hi>England,</hi> even unto <hi>Graves-end</hi>; whereupon <hi>Richard</hi> with Poll-money levies an Army, and revenged himself, which caused after mischief.</p>
               <p>And now fell out a Rebellion in <hi>England,</hi> exceeding hazardous to the whole kingdome, occasioned by one <hi>Iohn Wall,</hi> a factious Priest; who perceiving the meaner and baser sort of people much murmuring &amp; repining at the last Tax, took an unhappy occasion to move them to sedition, telling them we are all by nature the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> born of one and the same condition, and equall worth; and that the Laws of this kingdome were unjust, to set so great difference between men, making some Peers and Potentates, and others poor and penurious. Thus they begun to grow mad and implacable against the Nobillity, for the basest dregs of men commonly being uncapable of honour themselves, are envious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that are. Hereupon (together with the hope of pilfering) arose a formidable tumult, who for their Leader took one <hi>Watt Tyler,</hi> and for other chief Officers had <hi>Iack Straw, Iack Shepheard,</hi> and the seditious Priest <hi>Iohn Wall,</hi> stiling themselves the Kings men, and the Servants of the Common-weal of <hi>England.</hi> They marched towards <hi>London,</hi> beating down and rifling of houses, and all before them. They make all Knights and Gentlemen forsake their houses, which they burn or rifle at lest; They send also to the King, who then lay in the Tower, requiring him to come and speak with them. Whereupon the King pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to prevent mischief, went to <hi>Graves-end,</hi> but seeing their rage and madnesse, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But so soon as he had ended his speech he was attached by the Earl Marshall, and committed to strait prisonment in the Abbey of St. <hi>Albans</hi>: and then (among many other things in the same Parliament done) the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was entailed to King <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs for ever.

               <p>The King with a strong Army fights the Conspirators near <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where the King wins the day; and the Prince marching against <hi>Glendor,</hi> is forsaken by his <hi>Welch,</hi> and dies of famine in the woods, where he hid himself.

In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> gain by fraud what the <hi>English</hi> regain by force. In <hi>England</hi> the Dutchesse of <hi>York</hi> is accused of witch-craft by the proud Cardinall her husbands Brother, and unjustly suffers for it. Now by the intercession of Christian Princes they began to treat of peace between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>English</hi>; peace was not rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but a cessation was granted for eighteen months: In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by his own authority contracted a marriage between King <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Angiers</hi>; boasting much of the Ladies beauty and dowry; at last he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King, though he had passed his word to the daughter of the Duke of <hi>Britaine.</hi> This Matrimony contracted gave but small help to the English affairs; when for commutation great part of <hi>Normandy</hi> was yielded to the <hi>French</hi>: and the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> in revenge of his wrong, drove all the English out of <hi>Aquitane.</hi> Now the hatred of <hi>Sommerset</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again to bud; he by fraud and injustice deposed <hi>York</hi> from the Authority of Vice-Roy, and made himself Vice-Roy in his place, <hi>York</hi> being not a little offended at it; for the King did nothing lesse then mind his Kingdome. All the authority was between <hi>Margaret</hi> and the Marquesse of <hi>Suffolk</hi>; also, by the contrivance of his enemies; the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the good Duke) was put out of his place; and unknown to the King, a Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing privily called, they question him for his Life; he was cast into prison, and the next day (how it is not known) miserably murthered. In the mean time all goes to wrack by the negligence of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> all <hi>Normandy</hi> in a manner lost and revolted, and all <hi>France</hi> made good to <hi>Charls,</hi> except <hi>Callice.</hi> Now the King wants his two good Uncles, the Dukes of <hi>Bedford</hi> and <hi>Gloucester</hi> to stand by him. But <hi>Sommerset</hi> is called to account, found guilty, and banished for 5 years; but being upon the Seas is beheaded, and his body left on the shore. The Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who now should help the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> is fain to goe to still the <hi>Irish</hi> that were up; he quickly pacified them, whereby he won the peoples hearts, and much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his own affairs: thus he began to end the difference between the White Rose and the Red; and for a beginning of his own right to the Crown, for he descended from <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> being wholly unfit for the Government, by whose foolish neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Normandy</hi> was lost; the men of <hi>Kent</hi> vote for <hi>Iohn Mortimer</hi> (by <hi>Yorks</hi> perswasion) and with a well appointed Army they march toward <hi>London, Mortimer</hi> being their Commander; between <hi>Eltham</hi> and <hi>Greenwich</hi> they stay, and send up their complaints to the King and Parliament: amongst the rest they Petition that <hi>York, Buckingham</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter</hi> may be restored to their places, and the Kings savour: The King sends Forces against

Then also <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> being at <hi>York,</hi> and hearing of the Kings Death came to <hi>London</hi> with a small Army, and being mindfull to usurp the Kingdome, he overtook the young King <hi>Edward</hi> on his way to <hi>London,</hi> and takes him into his own charge, sending his Tutors <hi>Rivers, Wagham</hi> and <hi>Grey</hi> to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Castle to be kept safe, all whom by the Practise of the Lord <hi>Hastings,</hi> he soon after caused to be put to death: which thing known at <hi>London,</hi> the Queen (who well knew the perverse mind of <hi>Richard</hi>) with her other son <hi>Richard</hi> and her daughters, took Sanctuary at <hi>Westminster</hi> to secure themselves from <hi>Richards</hi> violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean time came to <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Edward,</hi> and went to the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s house to reside; but he not content with <hi>Edwards</hi> being in his power, that he might the more safely look to his businesse, endeavors to get the other brother out of Sanctuary from his mother the Queen, under a colour of comforting the Kings sorrowfull mind; and drawing the Lords to his opinion, he sent thither amongst others <hi>Thomas</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who with fair speeches mingled with threats, brings the poor innocent Child from his Mothers arms. When the Arch-bishop had delivered the child into the Protectors hands (who with many other Lords attended the Queens answer in the Star-Chamber) he before the whole Assembly took him in his Armes, hugged him, and kissed him again and again, protesting upon his soul, that no worldly thing (his Majesty only excepted) was so dear unto him as that young child; when as indeed he meant nothing more than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them both: and having brought him to the King, who was infinitely joyed with his Company, he within few dayes after conveyed them with princely Pomp and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance through the City of <hi>London</hi> to the Tower, under the Pretence of an especiall care and Providence, that they should there remain in safety untill the troubles of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were appeased, and quieted, whereas in truth nothing was out of order but himself, and his confederacy. When he had thus cooped up the King and his brother, he draws <hi>Buckingham</hi> to his Treason, but <hi>Hastings</hi> could not be won, therefore he pretended he sought to take away his life, with which he charged him; to which after a long silence the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> as most familiar with him, made answer, They that so trangress the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what punishment the Law can inflict upon them, and all the Lords ascented thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; Then quoth the Protector, That Sorceress (meaning the Queen) and that Strumpet <hi>Shores</hi> wife, have conspired together to take away my life by witchcraft, and that you may be right well assured it is true, Behold I pray you, and see how their villany hath allready seized on my body, for by it my left arm is already wasted and consumed, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he struck up his sleeve, and shew them his arme naked; this did he impudently dare to do, albeit all there present were well assured it was never otherwise from his mothers womb. Moreover no man was so simple, to beleeve that if the Queen had intended such a mischief, she would have consorted with <hi>Shores</hi> wife above all other women, she having been her husbands Concubine, besides this they all knew that the Queen was religious temperate, mild, charitable and vertuous, and not given to revenge. The Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> (who after King <hi>Edwards</hi> death conversed with <hi>Shores</hi> Wife, using her as his concubine; and but the same morning left her in his own bed) being desirous if he could to appease the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors rage to her, and (in some sort) being willing to excuse her, replied thus, <hi>My Lord, If the Queen and she have so done?</hi> and therewithall the Protectors rage waxing intemperate interrupted him thus, <hi>Thou Traytor,</hi> quoth he, <hi>tellest thou me of Iff's and Ands? I tell thee they have done it</hi>; and as he spake those words, he clapt his hand rudely upon the Table, at the noise whereof the whole chamber was suddenly filled with armed men, and one of them struck down the Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> with a Holbert, and the Protector himself did arrest the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> and charg'd him of high Treason in generall tearms and forthwith without any proceeding or judgment, caused him to be carried out into the Green, and his head upon a Logg to be chopped off; and it is noted that this execution was done on him the same day, and in the same Lawlesse manner, that he had commanded to be done to <hi>Rivers, Grey</hi> and <hi>Wagham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when this impious Protector had murdered those Lords that stood in his way, he

caused Doctor <hi>Shaw</hi> (a man more learned than vertuous) publickly in a Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, to blaze on his honourable birth and Parentage, his valour, his vertues, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against the deceased King for his lasciviousnesse with <hi>Shores</hi> wife, to bastardize all his Children, as born in adultery; for that King <hi>Edward,</hi> as he affirmed, was solemnly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Lucie,</hi> whom he got with child. He also accused the Protectors own mother: but <hi>Shaw</hi> was afterward so ashamed of his flattery, that for very shame and grief he died soon after. Then he sets <hi>Buckingham</hi> to deal with the City, who with many Citizens come to <hi>Baynards</hi> Castle, where the Protector was, and chose him for their King, desiring him to take the burden upon him, which he oft-times refused, but was perswaded at last to take it.</p>

To say nothing of the Mother and her Daughters, certainly the immortal God, who will not suffer great sins to goe unpunished, revenged on the innocent children the perjury of their father committed at <hi>York,</hi> and the Death of the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whom he wickedly suffered to be murdered. But <hi>Buckingham (Richards</hi> former friend) now detesting his wickednesse, conspires with the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> how to restore <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> to whom of right the Crown belonged, as he was descended of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with these joyned the Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> with whom <hi>Henry</hi> then resided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean time, who had notice of the consultations of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> sent for him again and again to come to him, but when he flatly refuses to come to him, they fall to their Arms on both sides. The Duke presently mustering some <hi>Welch</hi> Forces came to <hi>Gloucester</hi> to meet <hi>Richard</hi> that had a mightier Army with him, but the Soldiers he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured voluntarily rather then for pay all forsook him, before he came in sight of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and having none left with him but his Lacky (who was forced to flie to shift for himself) he went to his servant <hi>Humfrey Banisters</hi> house, who unmindfull of all former favours delivered him afterward to <hi>Richard,</hi> who cut off his head, and all the Conspirators presently ran One one way, Another another way, some to places of refuge, and some into <hi>Britanny</hi> to the Earl. <hi>Richard</hi> in the mean time heard that the Duke did not only not hurt the Earl, but had resolved to assist him; wherefore he provides a great Fleet to intercept the Earles Landing here; <hi>Henry</hi> in the mean time with forty Ships and five thousand <hi>Britains</hi> Sails for <hi>England,</hi> but a Tempest arose and scattered his Ships; and he almost quit of all his Forces, was driven on <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where coming ashore, and seeing a great Army, he was forced to retire to his Ships; and being very pensive when he heard of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> death, void of all Counsell he return'd again to <hi>Britanny</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> but by the coming of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity he took heart once more, and promised before the Altar to marry <hi>Elizabeth</hi> King <hi>Edwards</hi> Daughter, if the businesse succeeded according to his mind, and so a fresh Oath of fidelity was taken by them all. In the mean time <hi>Richard</hi> did fiercely rage against all such as followed the Earl, wheresoever he could lay hold on them: <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> who fled to him, he banished both by Sea and Land; also he made a Covenant with the Scotch King, giving his Sister <hi>Anne</hi> in marriage to his Son. <hi>Richard</hi> layes new Traps for <hi>Henry</hi> by corrupting the Dukes Treasures with money; but he escapes them, the matter being detected by Bishop <hi>Morton</hi>: When the fraud was made known to the Duke, he was so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against the Treasurer, that he caused him for that &amp; other wicked deeds to be hanged.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Richard</hi> to hinder <hi>Henry</hi>'s Marriage with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> partly by flattery, partly by fear, and partly by promises, he prevailed so farre with the Queen, that she should entrust her daughters with him, and should write her Letters to her son the Marquess of <hi>Dorset,</hi> that was near the Earl, that without delay he should return home, and leave the society of the Earl <hi>Henry,</hi> that all things were now pacified, and their family in favour with the King. <hi>Richard</hi> all this while having gotten the Queens Daughters, that he might totally destroy the design of Marriage with <hi>Henry,</hi> resolved himself to marry her his own Brothers Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his own Wife being yet alive, whom to that end he privately packed away by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. In the mean while he tryes all wayes he can to make <hi>Elizabeth</hi> affect him; he was also resolved to joyne violence to his prayers, if he could not otherwise ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A fame was also spread abroad on purpose, that <hi>Henry</hi> had implored help of the <hi>French</hi> in vain, and that there was no fear of his coming, which made <hi>Richard</hi> deal somwhat carelesly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily discharging the Navy he had to Scour the English Coasts.</p>

The King himself after wonderfull tokens of his valour, is slain hand to hand by the Earl, to whom, by Gods blessing, that day and Crown fell: <hi>Richards</hi> body all naked and miery, is found among the dead, and trussed up like a Calf behind a Pursevant, is buried at <hi>Leicester</hi> with as much honour as his Nephews in the Tower under the Stairs.</p>

Then according to his Oath and Promise he married the fair and vertuous Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eldest daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, thereby joyning in one the two great Families of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York</hi>; betwixt whom for principallity and the Crown, infinite contentions and mortall wars had formerly consumed and destroyed many thousands of noble brave and valiant men.</p>
               <p>Now that the State of the Kingdome might be confirmed in its happinesse, by the safety of the Kings person, and by other requisites, King <hi>Henry</hi> (taking example by the Kings of <hi>France</hi>) selected a certain number of warlike men, in all places to attend him, whom he tearmed the Yeomen of his Crown. He elected the most Noble, Grave, and wise men of this Kingdome to be of his privy Counsell, by whose sage directions and advice the Government of this Kingdome was settled in peace and tranquillity. He bountifully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced the Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> for all his former love and kindnesse to him, and also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid unto him all such sums of mony, as at any time he had disbursed for him, for his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and relief. The like he did to the <hi>French</hi> King, and so redeemed his Hostages, the Lord Marquesse <hi>Dorset,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Bourchin,</hi> whom he left there.</p>
               <p>But while King <hi>Henry</hi> was thus carefull to please all men, and to preserve peace, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is raised in the north by <hi>Francis</hi> Lord <hi>Lovel, Humfrey Stafford,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the King with great celerity marches against them, and their Leaders hearts fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they steal from their Army by night: <hi>Lovell</hi> was shrouded by Sir <hi>Thomas Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the two <hi>Staffords</hi> took Sanctuary; but because no Sanctuary could protect malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in case of high Treason, they were pulled out by violence, and arraigned, condemned, and <hi>Humphrey</hi> the elder brother executed, but the other was pardoned by the Kings favour, it being supposed he did it not out of malice, but was drawn in by his unpeaceable brother.</p>
               <p>But this flame being quenched, a greater is kindled: For a certain Priest named <hi>Symond,</hi> erected a mock Prince called <hi>Lambert,</hi> who joyning with the Dutchesse of <hi>Burgoyne</hi> and the <hi>Irish,</hi> invaded <hi>England,</hi> but was routed, and being taken, <hi>Lambert</hi> was put into the Kings Scullery, who not long after was made chief Faulconer to the King.</p>
               <p>Then was the Kings wife with all honour and princely solemnity crowned Queen: and <hi>Thomas Bourchier</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> dying, he is succeeded by <hi>Iohn Morton,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> who was also made Lord Chancelour of this Kingdome: and not long after he was dignified with the Hat and Habit of a Cardinall by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth.</p>
               <p>A difference falls between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Britains</hi>; the King having been beholding to both, mediates a peace, but in vain; they fall to Arms, and the King aids the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> with eight thousand men, for maintenance whereof a Parliament gives the King the tenth penny of all moveable goods and chattels; but the Duke dyed, and those wars ended.</p>
               <p>But this Tax begot a Rebellion, for the rustick swads about <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Durham</hi> would not pay a penny of the Tax; but being numerous, they rifled severall places where they came, and barbarously murdered the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> imployed by the King to levy the tax but the King soon routed them, and executed the Ringleaders of them in severall places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King by his gifts corrupts the attendants of the Duke of <hi>Britains</hi> Daughter &amp; heir of the Dukedome, and though affianced to the Emperors Daughter before, yet he returns her to her father, and marries the Young Heir of <hi>Britain,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the Emperor scorning to be thus disgraced, sends to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and craves aid; whereupon the King, partly for love he bare to the Emperour, and partly because he saw the <hi>French</hi> King was become Lord of <hi>Britain,</hi> and endeavoured to subject the low Countries also under him, promised his assistance, for support of which he spared the poor, and got great sums from the Nobles and richer sort. The King sends a well appointed Army over, under the conduct and command of the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>; whom the King in person followed with a Royall Army; but the <hi>French</hi> King sues for peace and gave him for his charges in that expedition, almost two hundred thousand pounds Sterling; so <hi>Henry</hi> and his Army returned safe into <hi>England,</hi> having concluded an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and profitable Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:66405:23"/>But the Kings ancient enemy the Dutchesse of <hi>Burgoyne,</hi> with another upstart counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, named <hi>Perkin Warbeck,</hi> whom she pretends to be <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York, Edward</hi> the Fourth's Second son: The <hi>Burgoyns, Irish, French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> favour him, some out of mischief, others out of mistake, which begets great troubles to King <hi>Henry,</hi> but he is taken, imprison'd, and for endeavouring an escape is executed. The <hi>Scots</hi> invade <hi>England</hi> under pretence of aiding <hi>Perkin,</hi> he drives them out; and another Tax is levied, which begets a rebellion, which the King overthrows, and hangs up the Heads of it. Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> about this time married <hi>Katharine,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s eldest Daughter marries the King of <hi>Scots, Iames</hi> the Fourth; but Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> five months after his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage died, to his Fathers great grief: about his latter end he grew covetous, but repented of it. He died soon after, and was buried at <hi>Westminster</hi> in his own Chappel: he died at 52. years old, and reigned 23. years.</p>

               <p>About the same time the King of <hi>France</hi> invades <hi>Italy,</hi> making great havock; but <hi>Henry</hi> in favour of the Pope led an Army into <hi>France (Maximilian</hi> the Emperour fighting under the English Banner) and took many prisoners, and Towns. In the mean time the <hi>Scots</hi> upon the <hi>French</hi> account infest the North parts of <hi>England</hi> with sixty thousand men, but the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> encountered them with six and twenty thousand, and slew <hi>Iames</hi> their King with many Lords and Earls, totally routing all that vast Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> returning out of <hi>France, Surrey</hi> for his good service was created Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wolsey,</hi> a man of mean parentage, was made Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and at last was made a Cardinall. At this time the Pope sent to <hi>Henry</hi> a Cap of maintenance, a Sword, and the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi>; which Grace <hi>Henry</hi> received with Tiltings and great Pomp. Cardinall <hi>Wolsey</hi> is made Chancellour of <hi>England. Charls</hi> the Emperor comes to <hi>London</hi> and is received with great honour, and graced with the Order of the Garter. But Behold, <hi>Henry</hi> who had lived lovingly with his Wife <hi>Katharine</hi> 20 years, began now to find a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in his Conscience, whether he might without incest live with his brothers wife? Judges were chosen to end this question; but <hi>Wolsey</hi> not having dealt prudently for <hi>Henry,</hi> had all his authority taken away, and his estate was confiscate; but at last other new dignities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted him, his great losse was somwhat repaired. Then a Parliament was called, and he was charged with many faults; among the rest, that he was wont to write <hi>I and my King,</hi> and had stamped the Cardinalls Hat on the Kings Coyne; of which he was convicted, and again deprived of all honour and Estate: a wonderfull example of the inconstancy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs: he that but lately ruled all, and the King too as he pleased, made Laws, swayed Courts of Justice, taxed the people, oppressed both Clergy and Laity; he is now cast down from the high Pinnacle of honour, and which is worst, hated by all: afterwards sent for to make his personal answer at Court, he died by the way, 'tis thought with poyson.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Henry</hi> not abiding the Popes delayes, with the advice of Divines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorceth his Wife <hi>Katharine,</hi> and marries <hi>Anna Boloyne</hi>; and being angry with the Pope for this disoffice, he abollisheth forthwith all his authority over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and takes Oath of the thanks of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to acknowledge himself next under Christ, supreame Head of the Church; for refusall whereof Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> Lord Chancelour of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fisher</hi> of <hi>Rochester,</hi> lost their heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> now using his own Authority, invades the goods of the Church, and expels the Monks out of the Monasteries: Nor was he herewith content, but he cuts off the heads of his second Wife <hi>Annae Boloyne,</hi> together with her Brother the Lord <hi>Rochfort,</hi> on suspicion of incest between them. Then he married <hi>Iane Seymer,</hi> who died in child-birth of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth. Then he divorced from him <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> newly married; and for her sake he beheaded <hi>Thomas Cronewell,</hi> who made that match (this was a man fortunately risen from a mean to a vast estate:) also, <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> had his head chopt off for privily marrying <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter to the King of <hi>Scots, Henry</hi>'s Neece. <hi>Henry</hi> now mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Fifth Wife, the Lady <hi>Katharine Howard,</hi> whom he shortly afterward beheaded for

her lasciviousnesse. At that time <hi>Henry</hi> was stiled King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which before he was but Lord. About this time the Scotch King dies, leaving <hi>Mary Stewart</hi> (a child of eight dayes old) heir of his Kingdome, whom <hi>Henry</hi> endeavours to espouse to his Son <hi>Edward</hi>; but the Cardinall of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> so prevailed, that she was married to the Dolphin; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Henry</hi> enraged burns <hi>Leith</hi>: Then he married his sixth Wife, <hi>Katharine, Latimers</hi> widow, who was brought in danger of her Life, but by her prudence and humility escaped. <hi>Henry</hi> next makes an expedition into <hi>France,</hi> and wins <hi>Bononia,</hi> which was redeemed with eight hundred thousand Crowns. The Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> are accused of Treason, and the father lost his head. <hi>Henry</hi> died presently after, having reigned 38. years, he was buried at <hi>Winsor.</hi>

While these things thus fell out in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there happened great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Ecclesiasticall State at home, divers of the Kings Tutors being earnestly bent to a Reformation of Religion, and especially the Lord Protector himself; and it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Resolved by the Kings Tutors and Counsell, that whatsoever King <hi>Henry</hi> had enacted for the abrogating of the Popes authority, should stand in full force and authority whereby the English Church became purged of Popery: And what is very memorable, the same day that Images and Superstition were thrown out of the Church, news was brought of the great victory atchieved upon the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Musselburgh.</hi> The Popishly affected <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> and bloudy <hi>Bonner</hi> are committed to the Tower. About this time fell out an unlucky difference betwixt the Protector and his Brother, which proved the ruine of them both, for they both lost their heads. This Year Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> preached before the King, and in his Sermon took occasion to discourse of the necessity of Alms-deeds, which the King earnestly attending and laying to heart, sent for the Bishop after Sermon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into private communication with him (causing him to set down in a chair, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or not to put on his hat) about relief: The King to shew his wonderfull charity appointed severall Hospitalls, to which he gave Lands to the value of 600 pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> which had belonged to the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and 4000 Marks a year in mony beside.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the next year, the King fell into lingring sicknesse, then into a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Feaver, whereof, together with a consumption of the Lungs he died at length, not without suspicion of poyson.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:66405:25"/>And now <hi>Northumberland</hi> began to devise how he might gain the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to his posterity; he therefore imparts the businesse to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> requesting his eldest Daughter <hi>Iane</hi> to be given in marriage to his son <hi>Gilford Dudley</hi>; then he takes upon him to perswade the King, not only to disinherit his two sisters, but also by Will to constitute his Cousin the Lady <hi>Iane</hi> Queen after him, which accordingly, the good King yeilded, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the true worship of God before all naturall respects. A few dayes before things were thus ordered, King <hi>Edward</hi> not yet 16. years of age, sent forth his blessed soul at <hi>Greenwich</hi> (to wit) the sixt day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> when he had held the Kingdome under Governours six years, five months, and nineteen dayes; shewing forth even in that tender age, blossoms of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, together with singular piety towards God, constancy of mind, love of right, and an incredible study of Learning: Not above three hours before he expired, thinking no body had been by, he uttered this Prayer:</p>

The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> with a small Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marches against <hi>Mary;</hi> but as he proceeds but slowly, <hi>Maryes</hi> Forces increase mightily; also <hi>Edward Hastings,</hi> who was set with six Ships to prevent <hi>Maryes</hi> escape into <hi>France,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to her, by which losse the Lords and Londoners were not a little dismayed, and grew at odds one with the other; and the Londoners proclaimed <hi>Mary</hi> Queen; and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> when he was certain of his friends falling from him, that he might not run the hazard alone, calls a Counsell at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and himself for want of an Herauld proclaims <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> casting his Cap up in token of joy: But that did not at all help his Cause, for the Earl of <hi>Arundell,</hi> who a little before did not decline to venture his life for <hi>Iane,</hi> now coming to <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>Maryes</hi> name, takes the Duke and Casts him into Prison, he in vain intreating for his life. <hi>Iane</hi> at the Command of the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> her father, when the Case was thus altered, layes down the Ensigns of the Kingdome, with much more cheerfullnesse then ever she took them up. The Queen coming to <hi>London</hi> met her Sister <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with 1000 Horse, and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Norfolk, Edward Contener, Stephen Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Somersets</hi> Wife, which she received into Grace, giving them her hand to kisse. Then entering upon the Church affairs, she abollished those Bishops and Ceremonies that <hi>Edward</hi> had confirmed, setting up others in their roome, (the people not a little offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at it) and then she punished severely all those that were enemies to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>

The rest persisted, and did not renounce the Faith they had professed. <hi>Iane</hi> afterwards with her husband and his two brethren, <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> were all condemned to dye, but <hi>Iane</hi> was reprieved for a while. Then the Marriage was contracted between <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> whereat <hi>Wyat</hi> and others offended conspire, lead an Army to <hi>London,</hi> and are overthrown and executed. The Queen enraged with the boldnesse of the subjects, began seriously to consider how to punish the guilty. <hi>Gilford</hi> husband to <hi>Iane</hi> was first beheaded; then <hi>Iane</hi> her self within the Walls of the Tower, with a wonderfull cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, piety, and Constancy, had her head chopt off: She was a Princesse for her learning and wisdome worthy of immortall praise. It is reported that <hi>Morgan,</hi> who passed Sentence upon her, fell mad shortly after, and cried, <hi>Take away Lady Iane from me.</hi> Then <hi>Suffolk</hi> was beheaded, and the same day <hi>Wyat</hi> the cause of all these mischiefs; for <hi>Iane</hi> had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, had not he raised that furious tumult and enraged the Queen: those that followed him, some were punished and some pardoned. Also <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was cast into prison by the means of <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>; without doubt her Life was at Stake, had she not wisely answered to questions concerning her Faith. They did severely at that time punish all those that were averse to the Romish Religion, among whom was <hi>Cranmer</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury, Ridley</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Latimer</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> these refusing to abjure their Faith were burnt to ashes. The Queens Marriage with <hi>Philip</hi> was now so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized; and Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> being sent from the Pope, all the Errors of the English are purged, and they received under the Popes tuition. The Fame was at this time that the Queen was with Child, and for joy <hi>Te Deum</hi> was sung at <hi>Pauls,</hi> and she released out of the Tower many Prisoners, among whom were the Sons of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who were condemned to lose their heads: But all this hope vanisht, when the Queens Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved to be but a Timpany. The Queen restored to the Church all the Goods she possessed belonging to the Church; and when she was told that by so great a bounty the Crown Lands would be much wasted, she replied piously and prudently, <hi>She preferred her souls health, before all the worlds goods. Philip</hi> in the interim went to <hi>Brussels</hi> to his Father <hi>Charls,</hi> and obtained of him the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and his other Dominions before his death; then he returned to <hi>England</hi>; then again he went to <hi>Callice</hi> to wage war with the <hi>French,</hi> and staid upon that businesse above 18. months, the <hi>English</hi> murmuring, and the Queen la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Being she was of a flourishing age, and Queen of a flourishing Kingdome, it could not be but she must be sought to of many lovers: <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Sweeden,</hi> the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Angiers,</hi> sent to woe her, but all in vaine. First, because the Queen would not marry; for at her inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Condition was, <hi>That she should marry no Stranger;</hi> whereby there was hopes left to the Natives, for so great a match. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> they hoped to prevaile much by reason she was a woman, and of tender years, whereupon they invade and spoile the <hi>English</hi> Frontiers. The <hi>French</hi> King pretending Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in right of his Wife <hi>Mary Stewart,</hi> allyed to <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh; but at last peace is confirmed betwixt <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and all the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholicks are routed out of <hi>Scotland. Mary</hi> (when <hi>Francis</hi> was dead) return'd for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made a firme agreement with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but envy and ambition soon violated it and their sister-like concord, to the ruine of <hi>Mary</hi> at last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> takes to her husband <hi>Henry Darley,</hi> and after <hi>Bothwell,</hi> but discontents and warres arising, she flees to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who received her in her Arms: She was at first liberally entertained; but after moving dissention in <hi>England,</hi> being a most bitter enemy to those of the Reformed Religion, she was kept more narrowly: For eighteen years she was kept in prison; at last she began to riot in hope of the Kingdome, and to lay snares for the Queens Life; for which cause at the request of the severall Orders of <hi>England,</hi> she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. Also the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> who privily sought to marry her, suffered the same pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the mean time assisted those of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now fell out a warre between <hi>Philip</hi> the Second and the low Countreys, in which <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> assisted the united Provinces. The Queen for this assistance was hated by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had before privately laid snares for her life, but now he breaks forth into open warre; for he raised a mighty Fleet from <hi>Spaine</hi> and other places; it was the greatest Navy for Provision and Men that ever the Ocean bare, and carried the presumptuous Title of <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible</hi>: It consisted of one hundred and thirty tall ships of Warre, in which were nineteen thousand two hundred and ninety souldiers, eight thousand three and fifty Marriners, two thousand and eighty Gally-slaves, two thousand six hundred and thirty great Ordnance; and the 19. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1588. they came in sight of <hi>England,</hi> and were in hopes to devour it. But by the valour of the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the Fleet was partly worsted, partly hindered, but especially by a Tempest that rose against it, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was disappointed of his hopes. They often after fought by Sea in <hi>Portugall</hi> and the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> doing and receiving much harm. This great Tempest being blown over the Queen causeth a day of Thanksgiving to be proclaimed, and rid Triumphantly to <hi>London.</hi> Notwithstanding all this she had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles, but strangled all in the birth, and <hi>England</hi> was made the Receptacle of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and afflicted men, both from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> by reason of the Wars there.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> was sent into the West-Indies, and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> to the Coasts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> when after many Victories atchieved by each, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by the mediation of the <hi>French</hi> seek peace, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> hinder it. In the year 1598. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> died in the seventieth year of his age. He aimed at great matters, but was unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in most of them; whereupon it came to passe that the three Keyes of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Empire (which his Father so called, and willed him to keep diligently) to wit, <hi>Gulet</hi> in <hi>Africa, Flushing</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Cades</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> were neglected; The first taken in by the <hi>Turks,</hi> the second by the Confederates of the United Provinces, the third much impaired in its strength and impoverished by the <hi>English</hi>: which his father foreseeing in his Life time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to make peace with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch. Anno</hi> 1599. died that Reverend and famous Divine Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> a man moderate, temperate, meek and vertuous, even to the best imitation, and left behind him a living monument of his reall worth, his Book entituled <hi>Ecclesiastical Pollicy.</hi> Then peace was confirmed between the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> but the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> refused to be comprehended in it, because they held it disadvantageous to their bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

neglected an opportunity of conquering the enemy, and beyond his commission treats with the Rebells concerning peace: He was therefore called home and commanded to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for his fault; by his submission he found the Queens savour: afterward prompted on either by shame, or his ambition to the Kingdome, he raised an Army and entered <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and he purposed to have forced the Queen: His Forces ran away from him, and he was taken prisoner, accused of high Treason, and lost his head for it. <hi>Charls Blunt</hi> was sent in his Place, who in divers fights wonderfully subdued the enemy, though the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had sent many supplies to relieve them; in a set battel he overthrew <hi>Tyrone</hi> and the Auxiliary <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and then made conditions driving them out of <hi>Ireland. Tyrone</hi> afterwards when he had tried all wayes, submitted and humbly entreated the Queens pardon. In the mean time <hi>Richard Levison</hi> and <hi>William Monson</hi> with eight great Ships and some small ones, went and wasted the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coasts, and meeting the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet coming from <hi>America</hi> with abundance of wealth, set upon them, but was too weak, being disappointed. After that he master'd a great rich Ship riding at Anchor in <hi>Portugall,</hi> and burning some lesser Ships, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with her to <hi>England.</hi> At that time the Jesuits and Seminaries were banished. At last the Queen died <hi>Anno</hi> 1602, having reigned 44. years &amp; 4. months, &amp; was buried at <hi>Westminst.</hi>

But the <hi>French</hi> not being spared, a stop and Confiscation is made of <hi>English</hi> Vessels in <hi>France.</hi> The Ministers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and those that came over with the Queen privately, disturb the <hi>English</hi> affairs; they are commanded to depart the Land, not without gifts; the <hi>French</hi> King takes it ill, and some are recalled.

               <p>A new Parliament is summoned, they deny Tunnage and Poundage. The King reprints the Common-prayer-book, at which the <hi>Scots</hi> rebell; he goes against them with an Army, but returns without any good condition made.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Scots</hi> made a neerer agreement among themselves against the King, which they called their [<hi>Covenant.</hi>] The King therefore distressed for want, calls a Parliament, and asks Subsidies of them, all in vain. The Queen indeavours what she can with the Pope, but nothing is to be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the King would abjure the reformed Religion; but the King hates the motion, and had rather lose his Crowns, than accept such hard conditions. Nor was it long ere these Demagogues brought down a tumultuous rabble of Apprentices, and other base people, to the Parliament door, crying out <hi>Away with the Lieutenant of the Tower, down with Popish Bishops, out of the house with them.</hi> And to weaken his Majesty the more, or rather to satisfie the insolent tumult, they cast 12 Bishops into prison: the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> and his son were sore threatned; and the year before, that never enough honoured <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> lost his head to satisfie this unreasonable rout; a man he was of an approved judgement and understanding in State affairs, and of a singular fidelity to his King and Countrey. <hi>William Laud</hi> also, Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Primate of all <hi>England</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, a man admirably learned. But now they touched the Kings bowells, for they accuse the Queens Majesty as one that had caused the troubles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and caused that people (of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves inconstant enough) to rebell: the King hereupon accused five of the lower house, and one of the upper House, their names the Lord Viscount <hi>Mandevile, Pim, Hamden, Hasilrig, Hollis</hi> and <hi>Stroud,</hi> cleerly detecting these men of these tumults and dissensions; but the Parliament would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer them to come to tryal, but hid them in the City. The Parliament having brought the business to this, resolve not to give it over; but <hi>Ianuary</hi> 16. 1642. raised a vast multitude of Citizens and others, to the number of 20000. and more, under colour to defend the Laws and Liberties. The King hasts to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, commanding his Councellors to follow him, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who both refuse; wherefore the King with a small company, took his journey like one that sled, so that for hast, being he had no Purveyers to provide room for him sufficiently, he, his wife and children the first night were constrained to tumble all in one Bed. The King with some of his friends takes journey to <hi>York,</hi> and is honourably received by the Gentry, who proffer their best assistance; the Parliament takes advantage of his absence, and load him and his Queen with black and scandalous calumnies to render him odious to the City, and having his Militia out of his hands, together with the disposing of all places of trust, they raise a great masse of money upon publick faith, and I know not what State cheats, they fortifie all places of strength; they next send to the King humble Petitions, containing most unreasonable demands, calling them <hi>Priviledges of Parliament,</hi> giving the King plainly to understand, if he will not grant what they desire, they will have it by force, and forthwith raise a formidable Army, under the command of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>: the King is denyed entrance into his Town of <hi>Hull</hi> by the two <hi>Hothams,</hi> father and son, both which afterward their fellow Rebels beheaded on one and the same day, spightfully executing the son first,

least he should have the honour to dye a Knight. The King seeing his lenity hath been but their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and that they were now in the field ready to surprize him, sets up his Standard at <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> levies what forces he could, and betakes himself to the field, having fortified <hi>Oxford</hi> his chief Garrison, many Battels are fought with various success, till that fatal Battel at <hi>Naseby,</hi> in which the Kings forces were totally routed, and his very cabinet of private Letters, between himself and his wife, taken and most barbarously printed and divulged to his Majesties honour, and the infamy of the divulgers.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HARLS the second, By the Grace of God, of England, Scotland, France, &amp; Ireland King,</hi> was born the 29. of <hi>May,</hi> 1630. Never knew <hi>May</hi> a more hopefull flower than this that happily sprung from the Roses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> joyned to the Lillyes of <hi>France</hi>; a flower to whose composure nature it seems summoned her divided glories, as <hi>Zeuxis</hi> did his divided beauties to make up one <hi>Venus.</hi> Well was this <hi>May</hi> thought then most happy, untill now we have lived to see another <hi>May</hi>; as much more happy as it is to be brought to a Kingdome, than to be brought to the world; or to be Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than to be Cradled. His Royall Nativity was attended by a Starre, discovered over St. <hi>Iames's</hi> at mid-day, displaying its modest beams in spight of Sun-shine, in the middle of the aire (an Emblem of his future glory) it seems when Vulgar births are passed by every day unobserved, the whole frame of nature takes notice of Soveraign births, and Complements them with Stars, Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Thunders, Earth-quakes; such honour have Gods anointed: when he made his own Son King over his holy Hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> a starre came and waited upon him from the East.</p>
               <p>For his Education<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Father (of blessed memory) pitcht upon the Reverend Doctor <hi>Duppa,</hi> Dean of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Ozon,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and afterward of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who went to him as his other Genius; O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow the reverend Father insinuated himself with his sacred The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orems into his Princely soul, in short, he arrived at that proficiency was his own honour, and the worlds admiration, as forraign Tongues, as <hi>Italian, French, Spanish, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c. Adversity hath been his School-master, witnesse all Embassadors whom he Elegantly answers in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
               <p>This every way accomplisht Prince (whom this degenerous Land was unworthy of) was expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his Kingdomes by Traytors, whose names are blacker than my Ink, accursed Assassines, that murdered the Father (than whom a better King <hi>England</hi> was never happy under) and would have sent the thrice Noble Son the same way, but that God preserved him miraculously to be the joy and honour of these long bleeding Kingdomes once again.</p>
               <p>At last after many forreign troubles, the <hi>Scots</hi> invite the King upon tearms, almost as hard as Exile; which yet the King receives, and is Crowned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but tyred out with their Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he makes for <hi>England</hi> with his friends and <hi>Lashly,</hi> who at <hi>Worcester</hi> betrayes him, where his Majesty in his own person performing wonders, yet lost the day, and escaped, leaving all things behind him a prey to the enemies, who fell upon the Royal plunder so hastily, as if they thought to find <hi>Saul</hi> the King among the stuff; but blessed be that losse that saved our Soveraigne. But the King escapes their villany and violence, and purposely loosing his company, goes to <hi>White-Ladyes,</hi> near <hi>Boscobil,</hi> where cutting off his hair, &amp; disguising his face with Wallnuts, and his body with rustick Robes, under the conduct of the <hi>Penderells,</hi> he passed the dayes in obscure Coppices and Woods, where sleeping on the Loyal lap of Colonel <hi>Carelesse,</hi> he took up his Imperial Palace in an Oak, since worthily called, <hi>The Royal Oak,</hi> his Providores and Scout-Master general, were the <hi>Penderels,</hi> many a weary, dark, and dirty step took his Majesty, and many a course meal he made. But at last my Lord <hi>Wilmet</hi> that was designed for <hi>Bristow</hi> under protection of Mrs. <hi>Lanes</hi> Passe for her self and her man, preferred his Majesties safety before his own, and ordered it so, that his Majesty rode before her: Here Colonel <hi>Carelesse</hi> humbly took leave of his Majesty, fearing he might betray him, this being the Countrey where he was born, and generally known, who was so satisfied with this, and other his faithful services, that he was pleased by Letters Pattents under the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to give him by the name of <hi>Carlos,</hi> which in <hi>Spanish</hi> signifies <hi>Charls,</hi> an honourable Coat of Arms, bearing an Oak proper, in a Field, Or a Fesse Gules charged with 3 Regal Crowns of the Second, by the name of <hi>Carlos,</hi> and for his Crest, a Civit Crown, with a Sword and Scepter crossed through it Saitier wise, with this Motto, <hi>Subditus fidelis Regis, &amp; Regni salus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majesty rode forward on a dull Mill Horse, and said, <hi>It was the dullest Iade that ere he rode on</hi>; and a man may believe him. His Majesty came to Mr. <hi>Whitgraves</hi> Place appointed in the Wood, forgetting to take his leave of the brothers now discharged, called to them and said, <hi>My troubles make me forget my self, I thank you all,</hi> and gave them his hand to kiss; forthwith his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty is conveyed to Mrs. <hi>Lanes,</hi> and taking the opportunity of her Passe, rode before her to <hi>Bristow,</hi> but <hi>Bristow</hi> not serving their turn, he returned and so journed a while among Loyal Subjects in <hi>Sommerset-shire, Wilt-shire, Hamp-shire,</hi> untill he came at last to <hi>Breghemstone</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> where he took shipping, about the end of <hi>October,</hi> 51. and was safely wasted over in spight of <hi>Cromwell, Parliament, Lilly,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> to a Creek in <hi>Normandy,</hi> whence he went to <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Britain,</hi> from <hi>Brutus</hi> its originall;</l>

            <l>Or that at other times Kings did agree,</l>
            <l>To carve this Realm into an Heptarchie:</l>
            <l>All these I Pretermit, and many more,</l>
            <l>Beginning with the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour;</l>
            <l>Who setled here such Laws all men confesse</l>

            <l>'Tis true, he did the Church some injury,</l>
            <l>And suffered for't in his posterity.</l>

            <l>As too too well this Age knows, not long since</l>
            <l>We had a good, but an unhappy Prince;</l>
            <l>Who like our Saviour Christ did never cease</l>
            <l>To tell us of the things concern'd our Peace.</l>
            <l>But Heaven resolv'd to turn another Leaf,</l>

            <l>Having in mercy given us a King</l>
