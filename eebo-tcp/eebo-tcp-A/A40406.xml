         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

fat and a ſanguineous moyſture, analogous to blood, which nouriſheth the body, and is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle to the ſenſitive ſoul. Thus <hi>Fiſhes</hi> have no bones properly ſo called, but rather thorns. Thus crabs have griſles, in <hi>Inſects</hi> there ſeem eh to be ſomething between fleſh and nerves, inſtead of bones. So <hi>Birds</hi> have ſmall <hi>Meatus's</hi> which are for eares, inſtead of teeth they have a bony bill. And for their noſe ſmall paſſages into the head. Thus the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Calf</hi> hath his fore-feet for hands, the <hi>Elephant</hi> his ſnowt, <hi>Fiſhes</hi> and <hi>Serpents</hi> have no members of generation, but ſmal paſſages, through which the ſeed runneth; and the <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countrel,</hi> a fiſh ſo called, hath no head, but a great paunch, other <hi>creatures</hi> have no tongue that appeareth outwardly; as, the <hi>Piſmire;</hi> ſome <hi>creatures</hi> by a hollow ſpongie ſting doe taſte and take in the meat they eat: <hi>Fiſhes</hi> have no lungs living alwayes in the water, do not breathe, and ſo want not a neck, by which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is made; but they have a larger gall than other <hi>creatures</hi> to keep them warm; ſee Gods wiſdom in creating thoſe <hi>creatures</hi> that ſerve man with a ſmall gall, leſt by heat of choler they ſhould be inraged againſt thoſe that uſe them; leſſer <hi>creatures</hi> have a larger gall, becauſe we need not fear their hurting of us; nature hath alſo armed every <hi>creature,</hi> ſome have hornes, ſome teeth, others have ſpurrs, others are ſwift, as the <hi>Horſe,</hi> others have large bodyes as <hi>Camels.</hi> The <hi>Hedge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hog</hi> hath prickles; there is a <hi>creature</hi> called <hi>Benaſus,</hi> which purſued, voydeth ſo much

                  <hi>Crabs</hi> have two rowes of teeth, the one in their mouth, the other in their ventricle, and becauſe they have but few bowels, from their belly to their vent they have a ſmall pipe which ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly call their tail, for that is neceſſary for thoſe fiſh that ſwim, which a <hi>Crab</hi> doth not; thoſe <hi>creatures</hi> that have no teeth live in a moiſter Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſome <hi>creatures</hi> have two ventricles as birds, they that chew the Cud have four, they feeding upon crude food which requireth great dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, eſpecially milch kine.

Some creatures fly, Some ſwim, Some have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion, as Serpents and Worms, firſt by a contraction, and then by an extention of the body.</p>

            <head>The Diviſion of irrational <hi>Creatures.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SOme Creatures are ſanguineous, others are not. The former Kind are greater; ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have two, ſome four feet, which maketh them more able to work. Other Creatures are <hi>aquatile,</hi> and bigger than <hi>Sanguine</hi> Creatures. In all kind of living creatures there is one, which is as it were King over the reſt. Thoſe that have no blood are called <hi>Exſanguineous,</hi> ſuch are inſects, which though they have not ſo perfect a heart, yet have ſomething analogous to a heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some Creatures are <hi>viviparous,</hi> and ſome <hi>oviparous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Some Creatures are more in Number, as <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Camels;</hi> ſome go ſingly, as <hi>Birds,</hi> that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54366:12"/>
have crooked talons, beaſts that live upon prey, and <hi>Spiders,</hi> which feed upon <hi>Flies.</hi> Some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are domeſtique, as the <hi>Cow</hi> and <hi>Dog,</hi> and other creatures. It is the wonderful wiſdome of God, that ſome ſhun the company of man, others love it; concerning which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh, Cap. 39. <hi>Who hath ſet the wild Aſſe at liberty, or who hath looſed the bonds of the wild Aſſe; he derideth the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the City, he heareth not the cry of the driver, he ſeeketh out the Mountaines for his paſture, and ſearcheth after every green thing. Will the Unicorn ſerve thee?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some creatures have more parts, ſome havefew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But all creatures have various parts, becauſe the Soul reſideth not but in an organic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> body. All creatures conſiſt of thoſe parts that are neceſſary for their nutrition, or augmentation, thus they have that which is analogous to bones and nerves; the head is the ſeat of the Senſes, wings for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some Creatures have feet, and they either have 2. 4. 8. or 10 feet, as <hi>Spiders.</hi> Thoſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have wings, have either two wings, or four wings, as certain inſects: <hi>Eiſhes</hi> have neither feet nor wings, becauſe that they live in a thicker Medium than other Creatures do.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Other Creatures are made to labour, as <hi>Horſes,</hi> and <hi>Camels;</hi> other creatures God hath made only for food, as Hogs. Other creatures God hath made for both, as <hi>Oxen.</hi> Some for ſafety, as <hi>Dogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Some creatures are dumb, as moſt <hi>Fiſhes.</hi> Other creatures have a voice, or rather make a Noiſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54366:12"/>
and eſpecially at the time of their copulation, as appeareth by <hi>Frogs,</hi> which in the time of their coitus do croak and keep a great Noiſe in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; this may be ſeen plainly in <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> if you obſerve them in the Winter time, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Autumn. But this following table will comprehend in it all the Animals that have been mentioned before, or all that will be mentioned hereafter.</p>
            <p>All Animals whatſoever, are either perfect or imperfect. Perfect creatures are either rationall or irrationall; irrationall are either thoſe that live in the Air, or thoſe that live in the Water, or thoſe that live on the earth; or els there are ſome creatures which we call <hi>Amphibious,</hi> which are thoſe creatures that live upon the earth partly, and partly in the waters. Imperfect creatures we call thoſe which are partly Plants, and partly Animals, as Sponge. So is Sea-beares-breech, which is bred out of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are like to Herbs, yet if any one cometh but nigh it they have a kind of fear, and are preſently contracted.</p>
            <p>An Inſect is ſuch a creature whoſe head is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, but not continuous to his body, as we may ſee in a <hi>Fly.</hi> So thoſe that live both in the air, and in the Water, as are <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Beavers;</hi> the reſt are plain enough, from the very names of them.</p>
            <p>Now although the preceding table doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enough ſhew the order of our diſcourſe, yet notwithſtanding we will begin this Hiſtory of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and ſpeak of the biggeſt Animals firſt. The conſideration of which will make the other ſmaller
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54366:13"/>
kinds of Creatures more plain and eaſie. And thus I have ſhewed the uſe of this knowledge, and that not only in Philoſophy, which is very great, but alſo in Divinity. For from the nature of ſeveral beaſts and birds, we may draw ſeveral profitable inferences and inſtructions, which may be uſeful to Divines, in the opening of ſeveral places of Scriptures, wherein ſeveral ſorts of creatures, not only Birds, but beaſts and Fiſhes, which cannot be explained, unleſs we know the nature of thoſe creatures that are there mentioned.</p>
            <p>Now having finiſhed the general table of all Animals, and ſhewed the deſign and Scope of this Treatiſe, together with the uſefulneſs and benefit of it, we ſhall now proceed to ſpeak of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more particularly. And, as I ſaid before, I ſhall begin the Book with the biggeſt Creatures firſt, ſo that the firſt Animal we ſhall ſpeak to, ſhall be the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which is the buſineſs of the following Chapter; wherein we ſhall ſet down, not only the nature, bigneſs, food, &amp;c. of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, but alſo the ſeveral places of Scripture wherein it is mentioned; and laſt of all, deduce thoſe ſeveral Corrolaries, and inſtructions, that may be deduced from the nature of it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
            <head>Of the <hi>Elephant.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe <hi>Elephant</hi> is a vaſt creature, but very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; ſhe is alſo very prudent, ſtrong, gentle and docile; we ſhall treat of this Creature firſt of all, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> in his 40 th Chap: maketh this creature to be the beginning of the wayes of God, or the very firſt work of God: we may Judge of the greatneſs of this creature,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From his name; for <hi>Behema</hi> ſignifieth <hi>a</hi> Beaſt: the <hi>Elephant</hi> in the fore-cited place is called <hi>Behemoth</hi> in the plural number, which is as much as to ſay beaſts, becauſe he is in ſtead of many beaſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From his tayl, of which the Scripture ſaith, in the fore-cited place, that it is like a Cedar, and yet it is of no uſe to him, but only to keep him from the Flyes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the quantity of his drink, for the Scripture ſaith that he drinketh up Rivers, <hi>i. e.</hi> he drinketh very much; for <hi>Ariſt.</hi> lib. 8. c. 9. of his Hiſtory of <hi>Animals,</hi> ſaith that an <hi>Elephant</hi> at one feeding will drink up 9 <hi>Macedonian</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and in a dayes ſpace he will drink thirty eight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From his teeth, for he hath two teeth which weigh 325. pound; and <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54366:14"/>
his 204. Exercit: doth relate that he ſaw an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant's</hi> tooth longer then a man; his teeth are called ivory; of which in <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> are made poſts, pales, hedges, and ſtyes for <hi>Hoggs;</hi> as <hi>Virgill</hi> hath it in the 3. Book of his <hi>Georg.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>In foribus pugnam Ex auro ſolidoque Elephante.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. From his foot-ſteps, the diameter of which was ſeen to be 3. hands and a thumb.</p>
            <p n="6">6. From his noſe, for he hath a ſnowt which he maketh uſe of to take up his fodder, which he can extend 10. cubits in length: he loveth to be in wateriſh and fenny places; untill he is hindered from taking breath by ſome weeds, &amp;c. that hang over his ſnowt; for by reaſon of the vaſtneſs of his body he cannot eaſily come out of the water; his height is judged to be 16. foot; that it doth delight in fenny places, <hi>Job</hi> ſeemeth to intimate in his 40. Chap. and 21. v. where he ſayth, he lyeth under the ſhady trees, in the Covert of the reeds and fenns: although ſome would underſtand this of the vaſtneſs of his body, which is ſo great that it cannot be covered by many trees; yet withall it ſhews that it doth delight to be in fenny places.</p>
            <p>We may conſider the ſtrength of this Creature from theſe 6. particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Aristotle</hi> lib. 9th of the Hiſt. of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> affirmeth that it can overthrow a houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Xteſius</hi> himſelf ſaw an <hi>Elephant</hi> pluck up a palme-tree by the roots, and when he had done he ſpurn'd it away with his feet.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54366:14"/>
3. <hi>Aelian,</hi> lib. 18. ſayth that <hi>Elephants</hi> have tumbled down great walls; ſo that toward the <hi>Eaſt</hi> when the inhabitants go to warr they moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly get the victory by <hi>Elephants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 40. v. 18. ſayth that his bones are like barrs of iron.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Maccab.</hi> 6. and 37. it is ſayd that upon every <hi>Elephant</hi> were ſtrong towers of wood where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were 32. men beſides the governour.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That he never ſleepeth lying; for if he ſhould once lye down he could never get up again; but though this be ſo large and ſtrong a creature, yet it is ſo ordered by the wonderful goodneſs of God, that it is a moſt milde and gentle Creature, for otherwiſe neither man nor beaſt could live for him; he is not only milde and gentle, but of all Creatures he is the mildeſt; and this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Holy Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 10th, behold now <hi>Behemoth</hi> which eateth graſs like an <hi>Oxe, i. e.</hi> although it be ſo vaft a Creature, yet it is ſo gentle that a man may rule it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You may eaſily tame an. <hi>Elephant</hi> after it is taken; as to the taking of <hi>Elephants</hi> there be divers wayes, whether they take them alive or dead. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> when they have killed an <hi>Elephant</hi> they build a ſmal tent, and there they ſtay untill they have eaten it up. Thoſe who would take them alive mark the paths that they are ſeen moſt commonly to go in, and there they dig a pit ſo cunningly that the <hi>Elephant</hi> coming along her old path as ſhe uſed to do, being not aware
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54366:15"/>
of it falleth into it. As ſoon as ſhe is in, ſhe is by 3. or 4. men beaten upon her tendereſt parts very ſmartly untill ſhe is almoſt mad; when they have ſo done, cometh another Huntſman who deploreth her condition, and threatneth the former Hunts-men, and giveth her ſome of the juice of barley, as alſo ſome meat, and this he often doth, coming to the pit and asking him whether he will come out or no, untill by degrees the <hi>Elephant</hi> begins to know him, and to yield to him in any thing; another way they have to take them alive, and that is thus; they make a very large pit of about a mile in compaſs, in the place where they moſt uſe to haunt; the paſſage into it is very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſtraight, which is preſently ſtopped up as ſoon as the <hi>Elephant</hi> is got in. In <hi>Aethiopia</hi> they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently obſerve what trees they lean againſt when they ſleep (for they ſleep always leaning) then they go and cut that tree on the other ſide almoſt in two, and having ſo done they go away, but never leave any foot-ſteps behind them to be ſeen; at Evening the <hi>Elephant</hi> coming to lean againſt it with all his weight it breaketh in two and ſo ſhe falleth down; ſometimes whole troops of men go to hunt her, as <hi>Strab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> ſaith; ſometimes the tame <hi>Elephants</hi> carry armed men on their baeks; and ſo they take the wilde ones.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In a little time theſe creatures are made ſo gentle that they will take out of ones hand like a little Dog, and will as it were embrace one with his ſnout; ſo then he will ſuffer one to put ones head between his jawes, and will not ſhut his mouth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54366:15"/>
untill you pull it out again.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er layeth ſnares for any of his fellow creatures, but ſuffereth them to live quietly by him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When whole flocks of little creatures meet the <hi>Elephant</hi> he will gently move out of the way, leſt they ſhould bruiſe themſelves againſt him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> ſayth that he ſaw a boy of about 13. yeeres of age who ſate upon a great <hi>Elephant,</hi> and with a little ſtick guided it whither he wolud, to the admiration of the beholders.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He is not fed of fleſh, neither doth he live by prey, but is content with green herbs, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he eateth graſs like the Ox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. He is very much delighted with muſick and ſinging.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He very much dreadeth any ſnare that a man layeth for him, but moſt of all when ſhe hath young ones; many times if he ſee a man he will go aſide as if he fled from him, leſt ſeeing ſuch a huge crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſhould be frighted; but if he doth but give him a nod he will ſalute him; ſometimes he will go before, ſometimes behind him, and will if need be ſet him in the right way: But if once he knows that he intendeth to lay ſnares for him he deſtroyeth him; and when he hath ſo done he giveth the carcaſs to the next <hi>Elephant</hi> he meeteth that he may ſee his Enemy. Therefore they often meet together, and make a company, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayth, lib. 8. Chap. 4. of his <hi>Natural</hi> Hiſtory; the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſs, memory, and ſubtilty of this Creature is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54366:16"/>
ſo great, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, when he is firſt tamed he will learn to make all letters with his trunk, to dance, and to bend his knees; he will learn to do his reverence to the King, to caſt a ſtone at a mark, to handle arms; and ſo King <hi>Porus</hi> (whom <hi>Alexander</hi> overcame) had an <hi>Elephant</hi> whom if his guide did command to kneel down would preſently fall on his knees.</p>
            <p>He very well knoweth his name, and by dayly uſe he will underſtand the language of his country; and what ſoever he is commanded to do he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doth it, never deceiving his guide: if an <hi>Elephant</hi> be to go to Sea, he will not enter into the ſhip, unleſs the maſter of the ſhip will ſwear he ſhall return again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plinus Mutianus,</hi> who was three times Conſul at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaw at <hi>Puteolis,</hi> that when an <hi>Elephant</hi> at ſea was forced to be thrown over board, leſt he ſhould be frighted with the vaſtneſs of the Ocean, and the diſtance that he was from land, they uſed to make him go backwards, and ſo tumble him into the ſea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo maketh mention of another <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> whoſe governour allowed him a whole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fure of corn every day; but he who gave it him alwayes took away half of his allowance; the governour coming one day himſelf gave him a whole meaſure of corn; the <hi>Elephant</hi> with his trunk parted it in half, and ſo diſcovered the fraud of his feeder.</p>
            <p>He tells us alſo of another, who was in love with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> very beautiful woman of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who going
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54366:16"/>
by her brought her ſome apples, and with his trunk fawned upon her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athaneus</hi> tells us of an <hi>Elephant</hi> who did no hurt at all to a little childe that lay between his leggs.</p>
            <p>Many like Examples we have in ſeveral Hiſtories; in a certain <hi>Iſland</hi> in <hi>India</hi> called <hi>Zilana</hi> are found very large ones, and thoſe who will learn the languages of ſtrange countryes.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> was the 2d time Conſul at <hi>Rome</hi> he brought ſeverall <hi>Elephants</hi> into the publique Theater to fight with ſeveral Archers; but when the <hi>Elephants</hi> ſaw that they were hated by the people, they ſhewed themſelves to be very much troubled, which they ſignifyed to the people by ſeveral geſtures and lamentable cryes; at which the common people were ſo moved that they wept, and curſed <hi>Pompey</hi> for his cruelty. From what hath been ſayd it plainly appears that there are ſhadows of virtue in <hi>Elephants;</hi> but this will yet further appear by what followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Elephants</hi> are very milde and gentle not only towards other Creatures that are but ſmall, but alſo towards men which are wandring in holes, in caves, and alſo towards criminal perſons, who uſe to be caſt before them to be torn in pieces by them; which they will ſcarcely do unleſs they be drunk with wine; ſo King <hi>Bocchus</hi> being enraged againſt 30. men, commanded them to be bound to 30. <hi>Elephants;</hi> but the <hi>Elephants</hi> would not be bound to them, not being willing to be Executo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the Kings cruelty.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54366:17"/>
2. They never gorge themſelves by eating too much; and if at any time they do eat more then they ſhould do, they puniſh themſelves afterwards by abſtaining from meat for ſome dayes, that they may be ready to fight, or for any flight if occaſion ſhould be; which is a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Temperance and providence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They never couple with any ſtrange <hi>Elephants,</hi> nor with their own very often, but only for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration-ſake, and that not in the ſight of other <hi>Elephants,</hi> but in private by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he return to his fellowes before he be very well waſhed; and while the female is big the male doth not leave her, but is alwayes with her ready to defend her; ſhe is ſaid to carry her young two years, and to bring forth in the water, becauſe ſhe is very much afraid of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon. Others report of the <hi>Elephant,</hi> that ſhe brings forth but once in her life, and then but one neither; which <hi>Scaliger,</hi> Exercitat. 204. Sect. 1 ſeems to deny, becauſe (ſayth he) there are ſeen many young ones to go by the ſide of one <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They never leave their young ones but are alwayes with them, to defend them, and will lofe their life as ſoon as their young: when they go in companyes, the oldeſt goeth fore-moſt; when they are to go over the water, they carry their young ones in their ſnow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſome carry them in their teeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe that are bigger follow them: for the great ones can go over where the young ones cannot; all which are as it were ſhadowes of ove and gentleneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:54366:17"/>
5. They never paſs by a dead <hi>Elephant</hi> unleſs they can find a bough or a clod of Earth to cover them with, by which they ſhew a great deal of piety in burying them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They carefully cure thoſe who are ſick or wounded, they provide them meat and cheriſh and help them in all their dangers, and if they ſee the Huntſman they run upon him, and fright him away. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not make the <hi>Elephants</hi> go over the River, he uſed this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem. He commanded that one of them ſhould be wounded in his ear and to be thrown into the River, and as ſoon as the wounded <hi>Elephant</hi> was in, all the reſt followed her.</p>
            <p>The wounded <hi>Elephant</hi> when he is hunted ſeeks for <hi>Aloes,</hi> but before he uſeth it, he will lift up his head, and uſe certain other geſtures, which is (as their Governours ſay) an imploring Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and as it were an imitation of Religion.</p>
            <p>Others will ſalute the New-Moon, and at that time many of them will get together, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and reverence, as they can, do behold it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They have a deſire after praiſe, for it was obſerued that one of them, who was of a more dull capacity, was often corrected, and had but a bad eſteem amongſt them. When they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do homage, as it were to the Moon, and are not able to do it, they will ſtrive with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves untill they can do it. Hence we may learn good inſtructions, as to obedience, and to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our ſtudies.</p>
            <p>When they are overcome by any of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54366:18"/>
they are very much aſhamed of it, and cannot endure their preſence, nay, not ſo much as to hear them; hence we may learn honeſt ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: for it is commonly ſaid, that he who yields to any one, will be no body.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Camel</hi> is a deformed Creature, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſo formed her, as if ſhe were Created o n purpoſe to carry burthens. So the Miniſters of the Goſpel are deſpiſed and ſlighted; for Chriſt hath not choſen the wiſe and ſtrong, but the weak, who are compelled oftentimes to carry great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of affliction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there is a natural enmity between a <hi>Horſe</hi> and a <hi>Camel</hi> (yet ſo that the <hi>Horſes</hi> ſhun the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels)</hi> ſo it is very rare to ſee the great men of this World to agree one with another, who carry themſelves ſo high in their deportment, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters carrying themſelves humbly to them, yet at laſt thoſe great ones are forced to yield to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As <hi>Camels</hi> Milk is the beſt and ſweeteſt, ſo the Doctrine of the Goſpel concerning peace with God, and remiſſion of ſins, is moſt ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, bringing comfort to the diſconſolate, and relief in the greateſt miſery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As there is a mutual love between <hi>Camels,</hi> eſpecially towards the ſick, ſo there ought to be a great care taken by Miniſters to keep and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace and unity amongſt men.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As <hi>Camels</hi> are chaſte and continent, ſo ought all men, but more eſpecially the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54366:23"/>
not guilty of filthy lucre, for they ſhould know that in this life they muſt have the water of tears, and the bread of affliction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As <hi>Camels</hi> fall on their knees when they take their burthens, ſo the Miniſters ought patiently to take their burthens, and undergo the difficulties that may attend their Office.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As <hi>Camels</hi> will not go beyond their Stage, nor will they take more than they can, ſo Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould do the like, not to cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="9">9. As <hi>Camels</hi> have many ventricles for the better concoction of what they eat, ſo Miniſters ought to meditate again and again, and diligently to correct thoſe things which they intend to preach, and not to ſpeak what comes next.</p>
            <p n="10">10. As <hi>Camels</hi> have not all their gall in one place, but it runs through their veins, ſo Miniſters ought not eaſily to be provoked to anger.</p>

not for ever, therefore we ſee that all things are good with reſpect to the time and place; ſo that by theſe prohibited meats God would ſignifie unto us, that chewing the Cud is an Emblem of purity, and dividing the Hoof an Emblem of modeſty, for thoſe Creatures which chew the Cud are fed with purer meat than thoſe which do not; and thoſe Creatures which part the Hoof are not ſo fierce as thoſe which do not. That which the <hi>Jews</hi> were to learn from thoſe Creatures which chew'd the Cud, and divided the Hoof, was this, that they ought diligently to meditate and conſider of thoſe divine truths which at any time they heard, and from the gentleneſs of thoſe Creatures to learn mildneſs and courteouſneſs towards all: <hi>Luther</hi> in the beginning of his book of directions for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Fathers, uſeth this metaphor; that thoſe Fathers only are to be choſe which favour of the ſpirit. So <hi>Lactantius</hi> followeth the metaphor well, in his fourth Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. Concerning the prohibition of eating <hi>Hogs</hi> fleſh.</p>
            <p>So God had reſpect to this in all their ſacrifices, as <hi>Galatinus</hi> in his hiſtory of the <hi>Jews, lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. ſaith, that thoſe Creatures which were ſacrificed did figuratively ſignifie unto them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vices, and the mortification of thoſe Vices, and partly Vertues; ſo the firſtlings of the <hi>Sheep</hi> which <hi>Abel</hi> offered up to God, and the Paſchal Lamb ſignified the ſuffering of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So <hi>Kids</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> ſignified unto them the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſins of the fleſh by repentance, as alſo the impurity and the filthineſs of every ſinner.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54366:24"/>
By the <hi>Bull</hi> was ſignified pride, by the <hi>Calf</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, by the <hi>Goat</hi> and <hi>Sparrow</hi> unconſtancy. Contrarily, by the <hi>Sheep</hi> was ſignified gentleneſs, by the <hi>Lamb</hi> innocency, by the <hi>Ox</hi> fury, by the <hi>Turtle-Dove</hi> Chaſtity, by <hi>Pigeons</hi> which flye in Companies, and have no Gall, is ſignified Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; thus <hi>Galatinus.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. As to the Matter of it, we muſt know that the word which we tranſlate a <hi>Camel,</hi> ſignifies in <hi>Greek,</hi> a Cable-Rope, therefore</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some think that his Garment was made of <hi>Camels</hi> hair, as our hair Cloath is made of <hi>Goats</hi> hair; which Garment was formerly a ſign of Repentance, and did ſuit with him who was a preacher of Repentance. <hi>Philip</hi> was of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> Garments were made partly of <hi>Camels</hi> hair, and partly of <hi>Flax;</hi> as amongſt us, we have ſome ſtuffs which are half ſilk, which the <hi>Jews</hi> were not to wear, as appears, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 11.

            <p>Some think that it was woven with thick flax, like to our Cotton, therefore the Monks of the Order of St. <hi>John</hi> imitate him to this day, by

ſuch a Garment; but I am apt to believe that it was made only of <hi>Camels</hi> hair.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the faſhion of it, ſome do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what the reaſon is that <hi>Elias</hi> (whom <hi>John</hi> mentioneth) is ſaid to be a hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loyns, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 8. which was the better to defend him from the extremity of the weather, he being a man that was often in the open Air, and in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and therefore <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> would have his Garment like the Garment of <hi>Elias;</hi> and therefore Limners now adayes do not well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting <hi>John</hi> wrapt in a <hi>Camels</hi> skin, which makes him look more like a Satyr than a Man.

            <head>Of the <hi>Lyon.</hi>

            <p>THe <hi>Lyon</hi> is a fierce and intractable Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ture, but yet famous, becauſe it hath the ſhadows of many Vertues, which we may learn partly from the properryes of his body, and of his ſoul. Thoſe which belong to his body are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His bones are ſo firm and ſolid that they are ſcarcely perceived to have any cavity in them, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54366:25"/>
yet they are but very ſmall; and therefore it is that his Neck is ſo ſtiff and hard, that many have thought that it had no joynts, but was one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued bone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtrength of a <hi>Lyon</hi> is ſo great, that he can at once break all the bones of a mans body; therefore it is that we find in holy writ, <hi>What is stronger than a Lyon? Judg.</hi> 14. 18. And ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that a <hi>Lyon</hi> is the ſtrongeſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 30.

So <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 9. he concludes; <hi>he lay dew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As the <hi>Lyon</hi> is the King, ſo it is the hotte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt of all Creatures, and therefore he ſoon digeſteh his prey; he is alſo a greedy and devouring Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and oftentimes eats his prey without chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he vomiting up eats it again.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By reaſon of his great heat he breeds much choler, and therefore in the Summer time he is continually troubled with a quartane feaver.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sometimes having eaten too much, he is forced to abſtain from meat for two or three dayes, and afterwards for ſome time to eat but once eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other day; which afterwards makes him follow the prey with more greedineſs.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54366:25"/>
6. His dung is very dry and hard, ſo that he eaſeth nature with a great deal of difficulty. He makes his water as a Dog doth, with one leg lift up, which comes from him with a great deal of difficulty.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He hath ſhort eye-lids, but yet very great eyes; and that is the reaſon that he is ſo troubled with the Gnats which flye in his eyes, that he is forced ſometimes to plunge himſelf in the water when he ſleeps.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When he ſleeps, he ſleeps with his eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which is but very little; he is often ſeen to move his tayl when he is aſleep, that men may ſee that they are not faſt aſleep.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Some Lyons have Manes, and thoſe are the fierceſt; and therefore thoſe in <hi>America</hi> are very fearful and timerous, ſo that they cannot endure the ſight of man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We come now to ſpeak of the properties which are in the ſoul of a <hi>Lyon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Lyon</hi> is a generous, proud, cruel, haſty Creature; and as Horſes ſhew their anger by hair, ſo do Lyons by their tayl, which they ſtrike againſt the ground when at any time they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred; but when their paſſion is a little over, they ſtrike their own backs with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They hurt no man, and are ſeldom angry, except they are forced to it by great hunger, on have been hurt firſt; they ſeldom purſue or hurt man or child, unleſs it be in their old age, when they are not able to encounter with wilde beaſts for a prey; and therefore it is that when they are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54366:26"/>
old, they are ſeen to wander up and down in Cities for a prey; <hi>Julius Camillus,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, tells us this ſtory of himſelf; a certain <hi>Lyon</hi> did purſue him, but coming to him did him no miſchief at all; the reaſon whereof he makes to be this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Lyon</hi> is one of the twelve ſigns of the Zodiack; which I do not at all approve of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Lyon</hi> never makes a prey of thoſe who lye flat on their faces, and ſeem as if they were dead. I have read of one who putting his hand in a <hi>Lyons</hi> mouth, got hold of his tongue and killed him; it is ſtrange, that although he can break Iron, yet he never meddles with wood, it being the weaker of the two; and therefore it is, that they are alwayes kept up in wooden Dens.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are oftentimes ſeen to hide themſelves in the fields, leſt Paſſengers ſhould be frighted at them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When they are hunted, they do not make much haſte from the Hunſmen; and although they purſue him over hedge and ditch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he will not flye, but goes on ſlowly before, and oftentimes ſtands ſtill in the ſight of the Hunters, as it were preparing himſelf to encountet with them; and when he comes to a great hedge, he then runs ſwiftly away, that he may get ſight of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters again, that ſo they might not think he hid himſelf for fear; ſo that the <hi>Lyon</hi> is without any malicious craft or guile. Neither are they ever ſeen to look aſquint on any one; and as they will not flye from the hunter, ſo they will not willingly run themſelves into a ſnare; and therefore it is,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54366:26"/>
that when they go, they cover their foot-ſteps with their tayl, leſt huntſmen ſhould follow them by their foot-ſteps. 7. When at any time they are put to flight, they do ſtrive all they can to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and do provoke themſelves to vomit by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their claw into their throat, that thereby emptying themſelves they may be the lighter to run. This they do alſo, if they find at any time, that they have overcharged their ſtomacks. 8. The <hi>Lyoneſs,</hi> when ſhe hath young ones, will fight ſo fiercely to defend them, that ſhe will loſe her life before they ſhall be taken from her. <hi>Aelian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth a ſtory of a <hi>Bear</hi> in a Mountain of <hi>Thracia,</hi> who going into a <hi>Lyons</hi> Den, the Dam being gone out to look for a prey, found ſeveral young ones in the Den, no one being there, he deſtroyeth them all; the <hi>Lyon</hi> and <hi>Lyoneſs</hi> return'd and took him in the very act; he for fear climbeth up into a high Tree, thinking there he was ſafe; the <hi>Lyon</hi> he runneth out into the wood (the <hi>Lyoneſs</hi> in the mean time ſtanding at the Tree where the <hi>Bear</hi> was) and wandring up and down, found a man with a Hatchet in his armes, whom he forced to go along with him, taking hold of his cloaths, and led him to the Tree where the <hi>Bear</hi> was, and there he made ſome ſigns to him, that he ſhould cut it down; which when he had done, the <hi>Lyon</hi> ſoon deſtroyed the <hi>Bear;</hi> which being done, he carried the man into his way again. 9. In a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude the <hi>Lyon</hi> diligently obſerveth who it is that woundeth him, and taketh him alone from all the reſt of the company, and teareth him in pieces:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54366:27"/>
hoſe who have weapons and do not hurt him, he will do them no hurt, but only affright and terrify them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Although, by what hath been ſaid, we may gather the gratitude of the <hi>Lyon;</hi> yet it will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear by the example of a <hi>Lyon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who would not touch <hi>Androdus's</hi> ſervant, becauſe that not long before he had pulled a thorn out of his foot; neither do they alwayes exerciſe their power on every object.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ix wayes whereby to make theſe Creatures milde and gentle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt way is to hood-wink them; <hi>Pliny</hi> recites many examples to this purpoſe, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To give them meat, ſo as to fill their bellies; for <hi>Ariſt.</hi> (lib. 9. of the Hiſtory of Animals, cha. 44) ſaith that when they are full and ſatisfied, they are very tame, tractable, and gentle.</p>

When they are kept in a Houſe; whence <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> did make them ſo tame and gentle by this meaus, that his Chariot ſometimes was drawn by <hi>Lyons;</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> alſo, the <hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens like <hi>Aſſes;</hi> and which is more, <hi>Antonius Caracalla</hi> had ſome <hi>Lyons</hi> which he brought up in the houſe, which were ſo gentle that they would lick his mouth, and at dinner time uſed to ſit on a bench by him, and to lye in the bed with him like little dogs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When they are kindly uſed, or have received any benefit, as appears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the fore-cited ſtory of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54366:27"/>
               <hi>Androdus;</hi> alſo their Keeper may lead, nay, ſtrike them, and they will do them no harm.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If any one lyeth flat on his face, and doth feign as if he were dead.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If their mouths are miraculouſly ſhut, as in the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.</p>
            <p n="11">11. They will never injure a <hi>Camel,</hi> if they can have any other prey; hence <hi>Herodotus</hi> recites that <hi>Xerxes</hi> did look on it as a prodigy, and as a token of bad ſucceſs in his war, when a <hi>Lyon</hi> in his Army tore a <hi>Camel</hi> in pieces.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They alwayes hide themſelves in ſome Cave, or high Mountain, in which they moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to be, and there they will ſit in ſuch a poſture as may the better fit them with greater violence to ſet on the next prey. Hence <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 10. v. 8, 9. doth recite all the ſeveral poſtures of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and doth apply them to his Enemies. But if the prey be ſo far from him, that he thinks he will eſcape, he will roar and make ſuch a noiſe, that he will even amaze the wild beaſts, ſo that they are not able to ſtir any further, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey; hence it is that the Scripture, when at any time it ſpeaketh of an Enemy, to ſhew the terribleneſs of him, ſetteth it out by the roaring of a <hi>Lyon.</hi> 14. When he cometh to a wild beaſt, he encompaſſeth him with his tayl, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get out: after once he hath taken his prey, he teareth it to pieces with his teeth and claws; and after that he hath broken all the bones, and torn the fleſh in pieces, he then firſt licketh up the blood, before he eateth any of the fleſh. 16. If
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54366:28"/>
he eſpyeth an enemy approaching, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaveth his prey, and purſueth his Enemy; and if he ſeeth that he flyeth from him, he purſueth no further; but if he will not run away from him, and if he ſtandeth to him, he preſently deſtroyeth him, and then returneth to his prey again. 17. He alwayes leaveth ſome of his prey for other beaſts. 18. Whatever Creature the <hi>Lyon</hi> woundeth, the blood of it turneth black, yet the fat of a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is good againſt a bite of any other Creature. There is a kind of ſecret <hi>Antipathy</hi> in other Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures againſt the fat of a <hi>Lyon.</hi> 19. He can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his nails and hide them as it were in his fleſh, which he doth many times, leſt they ſhould grow dull in cold weather. 20, The <hi>Lyon</hi> never fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the <hi>Lyoneſs,</hi> nor with any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alwayes feedeth in ſolitary places, and deſarts. 21. As the <hi>Lyoneſs</hi> is very fierce, ſo ſhe is alſo very leacherous; ſhe will mingle her ſelf with other <hi>Lyons,</hi> alſo with the <hi>Libard</hi> and <hi>Civet.</hi> 22. In thoſe places where there are many <hi>Lyons,</hi> if any of them are taken, the reſt preſently run away. 23. They cannot be taken but in pit-falls, wherein a <hi>Lamb</hi> or two muſt be put, and then they eaſily run in for them. There are ſeveral things which the <hi>Lyon</hi> hateth, and cannot endure: 1. A <hi>Lyon</hi> cannot endure the noife of wheels. 2. He cannot endure a <hi>Cocks-comb,</hi> he is very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at the ſight of it. 3. A <hi>Lyon</hi> is very much afraid of fire. 4. He is as great an enemy to the crowing of a Cock. 5. They are eaſily afrighted with the ſight of any that looketh like a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54366:28"/>
               <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> or any wayes terrible to look upon; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all creatures they hate an <hi>Ape</hi> moſt, which is a crafty cunning Creature, which a <hi>Lyon</hi> hath very little of; yet when a <hi>Lyon</hi> is ſick, nothing will cure him ſo ſoon as the blood of an <hi>Ape.</hi> 7. A <hi>Lyon</hi> cannot endure to ſee a <hi>Wolf. Philip Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> telleth us that a <hi>Lyon</hi> hath no ſuch hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Cock,</hi> for they have been oftentimes ſeen to have taken both <hi>Cocks</hi> and <hi>Hens,</hi> and tear them in pieces; we have ſeveral names in Scripture, by which <hi>Lyons</hi> are called, which are eſpecially four. 1. They are called <hi>Whelps,</hi> that is, thoſe young <hi>Lyons</hi> that are not yet able to ſeek their prey: but although a <hi>Lyon</hi> is ſo fierce, notwithſtanding the divine providence hath put ſuch an affection into theſe Creatures towards their young, that they will bring them food into the Den, until they are able to go out to take their prey. 2. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Kephir</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which ſignifieth thoſe <hi>Lyons</hi> that are not yet come to full age, but are of middle age, at which time they are moſt ravenous and greedy of their prey. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the covetous to <hi>Lyons</hi> whelps, being violent and greedy Creatures. 3. They are called <hi>Ari,</hi> which is when they are at the ſtrongeſt that they will be; it cometh from an <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, <hi>Arah,</hi> which ſignifieth to ſnatch, and devour, becauſe at that age they are apteſt to tear and devour: we find that Tyrannical Rulers are ſet out in Scripture by <hi>Lyons.</hi> Theſe <hi>Lyons</hi> when they grow old are called <hi>Levi,</hi> becauſe then they are not able to go out to ſeek their prey, but hide themſelves in Dens,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54366:29"/>
and behind buſhes, and lye as if they were aſleep, and move no part of their body; ſo when any beaſt paſſeth by, he ſetteth upon him on a ſudden, and teareth him in pieces; juſt as <hi>Cats</hi> cateh Birds and Mice; but if they are ſo old, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get their prey, they ſometimes do fall upon men and deſtroy them. But it is ordained ſo by divine providence, that their young ones bring them meat when they are not able to go for it themſelves. A <hi>Lyon</hi> liveth to a great age, for ſeveral of their teeth have been very much eaten in, which ſheweth that they were very old.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although the <hi>Lyon</hi> is of a noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit, yet ſometimes alſo he is very fierce and cruel; from whence we may learn ſeveral good inſtructions; and firſt we will conſider what the Scripture ſpeaks, as when the <hi>Jews, Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and all wiſe men are called <hi>Lyons:</hi> hence <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 9. Kings are called <hi>Lyons,</hi> whom no one dare raiſe; and as the bones of a <hi>Lyon</hi> are firm and ſtrong, ſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate was ſo firmly eſtabliſhed that although it had many enemies, yet they could never overthrow it. Moreover though the <hi>Lyon</hi> is a ſtrong Creature, yet is he not proud of his ſtrength, neither hath he any craft or guile, but doth all his actions openly; ſo in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate right and Juſtice ought to prevail before fraud and injuſtice; and as the <hi>Lyon</hi> is a great Enemy to the <hi>Wolf;</hi> ſo all Common-wealths ought to be armed with ſtrength and power againſt all ſedition and hereſie; ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 101. 7. <hi>He that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deceit ſhall not dwell within my houſe, and he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54366:29"/>
that telleth lies ſhall not tarry in my ſight.</hi> And though a <hi>Lyon</hi> be ſometimes very fierce, yet he is then ſo noble and generous, that he will ſpare thoſe who crouch to him; ſo it is policy in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be ready to forgive, according to that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>

               </q>
to ſpare the humble, and to bring down the proud; and as <hi>Lyons</hi> ſleep but very little, ſo all Rulers ought to be vigilant and watchful, as <hi>Homer</hi> ſeems to intimate to us.</p>

            <p>It is not fit for a Governour to ſleep much; and therefore it is that the Ancients have given a <hi>Lyon</hi> in the Arms of Princes, to ſhew that they ought to be pitiful and merciful towards their ſubjects; yet alſo juſt and impartial to all malefactors and offenders; therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> compareth the wrath of a King to the roaring of a <hi>Lyon, Pro.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>The wrath of a King is as the roaring of a</hi> Lyon, <hi>whoſe provoketh him to anger ſinneth againſt his own ſoul;</hi> and we find it propheſied by <hi>Joel, chap.</hi> 2. 10. concerning God, <hi>That he ſhall utter his voice as a</hi> Lyon; thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah, Rev.</hi> 5. 5. ſo the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> is called a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and a <hi>Lyons whelp, Gen.</hi> 49. 9. So called becauſe it was ſuch a ſetled and ſtrong Government, which continued even untill <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, and was then the moſt famous Government in the whole World; and although they had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kings and Judges, famous for power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet <hi>Christ</hi> by way of eminency is called the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54366:30"/>
               <hi>Lyon</hi> of them all; which is plain, as we might ſhew in ſeveral particulars; as his ſatisfaction for our ſins, his conquering the Devil, and his ſeveral miracles. And as the <hi>Lyon,</hi> when he roars, doth make the other beaſts to quake and tremble; ſo <hi>Christ</hi> by his word hath converted ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to himſelf, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 8. we read that the <hi>remnant of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhall be among the Gentiles, in the midſt of many people, as a</hi> Lyon <hi>amongst the beaſts of the Foreſt, as a young</hi> Lyon <hi>among the flocks of Sheep, who if he goeth through, both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</hi> Thus Chriſt brought the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: ſo holy men are compared to <hi>Lyons,</hi> for as <hi>Lyons</hi> do prepare themſelves to take their prey by ſetting them in a convenient place, by watching, &amp;c. ſo the <hi>Apostles</hi> were made all things to all men, that they might gain ſome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Lyons</hi> by their roaring do affright their prey, that they may make it ſtand ſtill aſtoniſhed; ſo the Miniſters not by force of Arms, but by the word of God, ought to bring men to Repentance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As <hi>Lyons</hi> will not ſuffer their prey to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, ſo the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> gave all diligence by viſiting the Churches which they had planted, leſt they ſhould be drawn aſide by <hi>Satan,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, we find juſt men compared to <hi>Lyons, Pro.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>The Righteous are as bold as a</hi> Lyon. For firſt, as a <hi>Lyon</hi> is a ſtrong and bold Creature, ſcorning none of his fellow Creatures, ſo the true Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> all holy and pious men are armed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54366:30"/>
with the ſpiritual ſtrength of the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> by which they can overcome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all thoſe dangers and difficulties which do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them in this World.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As the <hi>Lyon,</hi> if he finds himſelf ſleepy, doth lye down and ſleep, let it be where it will; Thus the righteous are prepared to undergo all dangers, let them happen in what place ſoever, according to the old verſe,
<q>
                  <l>Omne ſolum forti patria eſt, ſeu piſcibus aequor;</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>A valiant man is never out of his Countrey.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, as <hi>Lyons</hi> have nothing of craft or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, nor will they look aſquint on any one, neither will they hide themſelves when hunted; ſo holy and pious men are plain and open in all their dealings.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Lyons</hi> do hate <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Wolves,</hi> ſo true Chriſtians are Enemies to all Tyrants and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers; <hi>Pindar</hi> compares a wiſe man to a <hi>Lyon,</hi> being ready to bear all burthens and hard-ſhips that ſhall be laid upon him; but he is alſo like a <hi>Fox,</hi> taking counſel in all his actions; thus we have ſhewn what good we may learn from this Creature; and we will conſider what we may learn from thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil qualities which are in him.</p>
            <p>We find in holy Scriptures, that all Tyrants, Hypocrites, and the Devil himſelf is compared to a <hi>Lyon;</hi> and we find alſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 4. that the <hi>Aſſyrian, Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Monarchies are compared to a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and an <hi>Eagle,</hi> which might be for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe as a <hi>Lyon</hi> is a ſtrong and fierce Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, ſo moſt of the Kings of the above-named
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54366:31"/>
Monarchies, were both potent and cruel, as <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth, Salmanaſſer, Sennacherib, Nebuchodonoſor, Xerxes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the <hi>Lyon</hi> is the chiefeſt of Creatures, ſo the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King had vaſt Dominions and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of which we may read at large in holy writ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the <hi>Lyoneſs</hi> is a moſt leacherous Creature, ſo the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and moſt of their Kings were ſubject to luſt and gluttony; ſo we find <hi>Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who by his luſt did loſe his Kingdom; we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 14. that Chriſt complaineth, <hi>that his Enemies are like</hi> Lyons; and in another place, he calls them <hi>Lyons,</hi> the Prieſts <hi>Bulls,</hi> and the Scribes <hi>Dogs;</hi> as alſo <hi>Pro.</hi> 26. 15. <hi>As a roaring</hi> Lyon, <hi>and a hungry</hi> Bear, <hi>ſo is a wicked Prince over the people.</hi> For as a hungry <hi>Lyon</hi> ſpares none, ſo wicked Princes are cruel towards the innocent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Sheep. <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls Tyrants <hi>Lyons,</hi> but more cowardly Princes he compares to <hi>Hares;</hi> ſo the fable of the <hi>Hares</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Lyons,</hi> who could ſcarcely ſpeak for fear of being devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them: it may fitly be applyed to thoſe timerous men who dare not reprove great Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>
            <p>Moreover we read, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4. 35. where it is ſaid, <hi>be not thou as a</hi> Lyon <hi>in the houſe,</hi> by which all Governours of Families are taught to be mild and gentle towards their Families, and never to diſturb that conjugal love and ſociety which ought to be between Man and Wife, which we are taught by the <hi>Lyon,</hi> who is never angry with the <hi>Lyoneſs;</hi> and as the Devil, ſo all wicked men who are his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54366:31"/>
inſtruments, are compared to <hi>Lyons;</hi> for although the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Goſpel called <hi>Satan Beelzebub,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>the Prince of lies,</hi> which they ſpoke out of diſgrace, yet the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> compares him more fitly to a <hi>roaring</hi> Lyon, <hi>going about ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he may devour:</hi> for though the <hi>Lyon</hi> can go three dayes together without any ſuſtenance, yet afterwards it makes him follow his prey with more eagerneſs and fierceneſs.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Lyon</hi> is fierce and cruel when he hath got a prey, and in the purſuit of it covers his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps with his tayl, leſt the Huntſmen ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him by his ſteps; ſo the Devil is cunning and diligent to take all occaſions to get men into his ſnare, which he doth ſometimes by drunkenneſs, or ſome other ſin.</p>
            <p>Further, as the <hi>Lyon</hi> doth not eat one part of his prey only, but devours it all; ſo the Devil doth deſtroy both body and ſoul; and as <hi>Lyons</hi> are fierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt when old, wandring near Cities making a prey of Men, ſo the Devil in theſe laſt times is moſt diligent and watchful to ſeduce the ſouls of men: and as a <hi>Lyon</hi> doth not break wood (though it be weakeſt) but Iron; ſo the Devil ſets on thoſe that are moſt ſecure; therefore <hi>let him that ſtands take heed leſt he fall.</hi> And as a <hi>Lyon</hi> cannot endure the crowing of a <hi>Cock,</hi> ſo the Devil is only by the ſound of the Goſpel overcome, not by external means.</p>
            <p>Finally, as the <hi>Cock</hi> is a weak Creature, yet is proud of his crowing; ſo the Saints, though weak and feeble in themſelves, yet do make their boaſts, and do confide in the promiſes of <hi>Christ;</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:54366:32"/>
we have to this purpoſe the Examples of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who were caſt to <hi>Lyons,</hi> yet were not at all amazed; and thoſe ſeveral fables of the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are not to be made light of, for from them we may learn good Morals.</p>

            <head>Of the <hi>Bear.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe word <hi>Bear,</hi> is derived from the latin word <hi>Urgeo,</hi> which ſignifies to urge or provoke. It is a very large Creature, and very ſtrong; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, perfidious, and deformed, and a great lover of Honey: we ſhall ſpeak to the properties of this Creature more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Although, as we ſaid, it is ſo fierce, yet it is not ſo ſtrong as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> nevertheleſs it can break a mans back-bone aſunder at once.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though it hath ſuch a ſtrong body, yet it hath a very weak head, and therefore it is when he comes down from a Tree, he comes down back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but if he be forced to leap down, he takes great care to defend his head with his fore-feet. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us that there have been ſeveral <hi>Bears</hi> found dead in the Sand at <hi>Rome,</hi> which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have had ſome blow on the head, which killed them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Male and Female meet together for Copulation, afterwards they go backwards,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54366:32"/>
and never ſee one another again, but hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome Cave or Den, and therefore it is very rare to find a <hi>Bear</hi> who is big with young; there is a time in the Winter quarter when they ſleep for ſeveral dayes together, and that ſo ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is a difficult thing to awake them; and this is the time in which they grow fat; when they are awakened, they ſuck their fore-feet (which are ſweeter than their hind-feet, becauſe they are more in uſe) and do exceedingly like the juyce which they ſuck from thence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The female is ſaid to be very leacherous, and doth bring forth very deformed young ones, which are ſo deformed, that as ſoon as they are brought forth, it ſeems to be but a meer lump of fleſh, without eyes or hair, and little bigger than a <hi>Mouſe,</hi> but not ſo big as a <hi>Cat,</hi> which ſhe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brings into ſhape and form by licking of it; therefore <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaid, that he compoſed his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as <hi>Bears</hi> do form their young ones, <hi>viz.</hi> by licking, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a great deal of difficulty. <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger</hi> proves the contrary, <hi>Exercitat.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15. where he alleadges that <hi>there have been ſeveral Bears found in the</hi> Alps <hi>big with young, which were cut open, and the young ones were found to be perfectly ſhaped in all its parts;</hi> and others have obſerved that the young ones of <hi>Bears</hi> as ſoon as they are brought forth, are encloſed in a certain skin, which cannot be got off but by licking, and it is a long while ere they can get it off ſo too.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Female hath a great love and affection to her young ones, and ſits over them as a <hi>Hen</hi> doth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54366:33"/>
over her Chickens, by which ſhe cheriſheth them exceedingly.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6. She is very fierce and cruel when ſhe hath young; therefore</hi> Solomon <hi>ſaith,</hi> that is it better to meet a <hi>Bear</hi> robbed of her Whelps than a fool in his folly, Pro. <hi>17. 12. thus we find God ſpeaking,</hi> Hoſ. <hi>13. 8.</hi> I will meet them as a <hi>Bear</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of her Welps, and will rend the caul of their hearts; <hi>ſo 2</hi> Sam. <hi>17. 8. we find that</hi> Davids <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours were compared to</hi> Bears.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They love to be in Caves and ſecret places; and if they can find none, they will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a hiding place with boughs of Trees, which they will place ſo cloſely together, that it will ſhelter them from rain.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They exceedingly love honey, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do ſmell out Bees in a hollow Tree by the ſcent of the Honey-combs, which they deſire, poſſibly, not ſo much out of love to the Honey, as to be ſtung with Bees, which cures them of the <hi>Head-ach,</hi> a diſeaſe with which they are often troubled.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is very ſtrange and wonderful to ſee how they will climb a Tree, and with their paw will tear off the bark from the Tree where the Bees are.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They will eat any thing; as Pears, Nuts, Plumbs, fleſh; yea, ſome will eat Carrion: and if at any time they perceive that they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their ſtomacks, they eat <hi>Piſmires,</hi> which cauſeth them to vomit, which eaſeth them; they are alſo very full of revenge, and if any one doth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54366:33"/>
injure them, they will be ſure to be revenged of him; and though they are uſeful in carrying of burthens, and drawing of water, yet their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters often find, to their coſt, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful and perfidious. Further, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that a <hi>Bear</hi> is extraordinarily delighted with muſick. <hi>Paulus Diaconus,</hi> and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> telleth us a ſtory, that there are multitudes of <hi>Bears</hi> in the South, who oftentimes will come to Shepherds, and will make them play to them, till hunger forceth them to go away; and as ſoon as they are gone, the Shepherd will ſound his horn, by which they are ſo affrighted, that they will never come more.</p>
            <p>Moreover (as we ſaid before) it is a very miſchievous Creature; they are often ſeen upright ſtanding on their hind-feet, and many of them will leap very well, and are very nimble and agile in ſeveral other Actions; as running, dancing, &amp;c. <hi>Sindrigal, Prince of Littaevia,</hi> had a certain <hi>Bear</hi> which he had brought up by hand, and uſed ſo to the houſe, that he would every day come out of the wood to his houſe and knock at the door, and wait like a beggar, untill ſome one had brought him ſome meat, which when he had got, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the wood again; other <hi>Bears</hi> have been ſeen to hunt <hi>Cows</hi> and <hi>Horſes;</hi> and if they ſee a <hi>Cow</hi> with Calf, they will with more eagerneſs purſue her; ſome tell us that when the female hath young ones, ſhe will work her ſelf on her back to the Cave where her young ones are, leſt any one by her foot-ſteps ſhould follow her to her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54366:34"/>
Den; but if ſhe perceive that the Hunters have followed her, and have eſpied their Den, ſhe then immediately takes ſome of her young ones in her mouth, and ſome on her back, and carryeth them into ſome high Tree.</p>
            <p>Again, he is often troubled with ſore eyes; there are abundance of them almoſt in all parts, except in <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Numidia;</hi> and therefore <hi>Virgil</hi> was much miſtaken, when he ſpeaks of the <hi>Bears</hi> of <hi>Africa;</hi> he never drinks as the Dog, nor ſups up the water as other Creatures do, but as it were bites it up.</p>
            <p>Huntſ-men have no device to entrap them ſo well as by laying honey over the pit-fall, which they ſmelling, come immediately to the place where it is, and ſo are got; but they have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other wayes to entrap them; one cannot more enrage a <hi>Bear,</hi> then to ſtrike or cut him on the Noſe, which is the tendereſt part about him; hence the Proverb, <hi>As good take a</hi> Bear <hi>by the Noſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, it hath an inveterate hatred againſt <hi>Horſes;</hi> and as in other Creatures, ſo in this, their hatred remains after their death; hence it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that a <hi>Bear</hi> will flye at the ſight of a <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> skin.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the properties of this beaſt, we will next conſider what we may learn from it. The Holy Scripture compares the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy to a <hi>Bear,</hi> becauſe as the <hi>Bear</hi> after he hath ſeized on any man as a prey, the firſt thing he doth is to flea off his skin, which is a ſign of his cruelty; ſo the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings were very cruel and inhumane in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54366:34"/>
puniſhing Offenders and Malefactors, as <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who inflicted this puniſhment on an unjuſt man, <hi>viz.</hi> He commanded his skin to be flead off. There are three things, eſpecially, to name no more, in which the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy and a <hi>Bear</hi> are alike.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a <hi>Bear</hi> doth exceedingly love and delight in Honey, which by the ſcent they find out; ſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> are meer gluttons and Epicures, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to delight and pleaſure; being prodigal in Cloaths, and no leſs in the furniture of their Houſes, it being common among them to have golden Tables, and Beds of the ſame; neither do they come behind hand in luſt and uncleanneſs, for <hi>Cambyſes</hi> defloured his own Siſters; and <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports of them, in his fifth Book, that it was a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among them, at any feaſt or banquet, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to bring in his Concubine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Bears</hi> are often troubled with ſore Eyes; ſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> had very little skill or inſight in Military affairs; ſo <hi>Herodotus,</hi> lib. 7. affirms that <hi>Xerxes</hi> brought an Army into the field, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of almoſt an incredible number, yet he could not ſubdue the <hi>Graecian</hi> Monarchy: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Perſians,</hi> when they fought againſt <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> where a vaſt Army of the <hi>Perſians</hi> were eaſily overcome by <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> as the Reader may ſee more at large in <hi>Q. Curtius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As <hi>Bears</hi> are obſerved to have very weak heads, ſeveral of them at <hi>Rome</hi> having been killed with a ſmall blow on the ear; ſo the <hi>Perſians</hi> give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves wholly up to luſt and pleaſure, did
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54366:35"/>
deſtroy the natural ſtrength and vigour of their bodies, which was the reaſon of that ill ſucceſs which we read they had in all their wars. <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> lib. 3. tells us, that after a war, ſeeing the heads of many <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> he obſerved the heads of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to be ſofter, whenas the heads of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were much harder and firmer, they waſting their ſtrength in luſt and laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: there are ſeveral things I have obſerved in the nature of a <hi>Bear,</hi> which may not unfitly be compared to a <hi>Scholaſtical</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi> life; for inſtance, the <hi>Bears,</hi> at firſt when young, are very deformed Creatures, untill ſhe by licking them hath brought them into ſhape; thus it is moſt commonly amongſt <hi>Scholars,</hi> the firſt thing they put out is not ſo polite and well digeſted as the next is: and then ſecondly, as the <hi>Bear</hi> hath a great love and affection to her young ones, thus we ſee that <hi>Scholars</hi> do ſet a high price and value upon the firſt fruits of their ſtudy. Thirdly, as the <hi>Bear</hi> is ſo good at climbing of Trees, thus learned men ſhould make it their chiefeſt buſineſs to ſeek thoſe things that are above. Again, as a <hi>Bear</hi> loveth Caves and Dens, thus <hi>Scholaos</hi> love retiredneſs and ſecrecy; moreover, as the <hi>Bear</hi> when he is tyed to a ſtake, will ſtill be walking round it; thus the <hi>Scholar</hi> delighteth to be in his ſtudy, and among his Books, ſpending all his time there. Again, as <hi>Bears</hi> love honey, thus learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men cannot endure to ſpend their time in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of dull Books, but in thoſe Books wherein they find ſomething of ſweetneſs, the reading of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54366:35"/>
which is their chief buſineſs; for eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is a thing they do by the by, as the <hi>Bear</hi> that doth not drink as the <hi>Dog,</hi> nor ſup up his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as other Creatures do, but doth as it were bite up the water when he drinketh. And as the <hi>Bear</hi> loveth Muſick, ſo do Philoſophers, who are like to this Creature for paſſion and revenge; and as theſe Creatures are deformed, oftentimes troubled with bad eyes, having but weak heads; thus it is moſt commonly with <hi>Scholars,</hi> who are oftentimes troubled with the ſame diſtempers; who oftentimes are ſeduced with the pomps of this World, and blinded with the vanities thereof, as they ſay that <hi>Bears</hi> if you hold but a bright ſilver Baſin before their eyes, they cannot ſee. <hi>Albertus</hi> telleth us of certain white <hi>Bears,</hi> which are <hi>Amphibious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and live both in the Air and Water; I have read that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> ſent ſeveral <hi>Bears</hi> into the Room where were ſeveral of his gueſts, whom he had made drunk. I need not ſpeak of thoſe men that have been turned into <hi>Bears,</hi> which as it ſeldom happeneth in Phyſicks, yet it is often ſeen, as to their <hi>Morals; ſome being more like</hi> Bears <hi>than men, as others are like Swine.</hi>

            <p>THe <hi>Panther,</hi> or <hi>Libbard,</hi> is called in Low-Dutch <hi>Lin Panterthier,</hi> which is alſo called in <hi>Dutch Panther,</hi> the Female is called a <hi>Libbard</hi> or <hi>Panther;</hi> it is a Creature which is found in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the Males are as big as a <hi>Calf,</hi> the Females as big as a <hi>Beagle;</hi> it is a fierce and crafty Creature, his skin being full of little ſpots.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. He is very fierce, and eſpecially aims at a mans eyes, as</hi> Baſil <hi>ſaith in theſe words,</hi> I have ſeen and partly heard, as a thing moſt certain, that the <hi>Panther,</hi> of all Creatures, is the greatest enemy to man; ſome have ſhewed him the picture of a man, which with a great deal of rage he hath tore to pieces, which is an evident argument of his hatred to man; thus we may plainly ſee what an Enemy Satan is to God, by that enmity which he ſhews to man, which is his Image; thus far St. Baſil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he is fierce, ſo he is very ſwift and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; thus <hi>Oſonins, in his Hiſtory of</hi> Portugal, <hi>lib.</hi> 9. reports that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſent forth a <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> which was ſomewhat tamed, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when he was let looſe into the fields or woods, did with a wonderful eagerneſs deſtroy ſeveral beaſts which were in the field; as <hi>Harts,</hi> &amp;c. A fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of their ſwiftneſs we have, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 8.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54366:36"/>
               <hi>God ſaith he would bring the</hi> Chaldeans <hi>upon them, whoſe Horſes ſhould be ſwifter than</hi> Leopards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It hath a very beautiful skin, ſpotted with divers Colours, the ſpots are like an eye, ſo that his skin looks as if it were full of eyes, the ſpots are blacker in the Male than in the Female, to which the Prophet alludes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. ſaying, <hi>Can the</hi> Leopard <hi>change his ſpots?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is very crafty and ſubtle, and hath a very deformed head, inſomuch that it frightens all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures (as all other Creatures hate a <hi>Cat,</hi> or any thing like it) but the reſt of her body is very beautiful and comely, which is the reaſon why ſhe hideth her head between her legs: it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſhe is moſt cruel to any beautiful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thus <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>The Wolf of the Evenings ſhall ſpoyl them, and the</hi> Leopards <hi>ſhall watch over their Cities, every one that goeth out thence ſhall be torn in pieces:</hi> For he oftentimes feigneth himſelf dead, or faſt aſleep; or elfe ſhe hideth her ſelf that ſo ſhe may better take other Creatures for her prey.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of all Creatures the <hi>Panther</hi> hath a moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and pleaſant ſmell, by which means he draweth other Creatures to him, and ſo maketh a prey of them; thus <hi>Ariſtotle, in his Problems, Sect.</hi> 23. <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. <hi>enquireth into the reaſon why a</hi> Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>of all other Creatures ſhould ſmell the ſweeteſt?</hi> Some learned men tell us that it is from the place they are in, <hi>Aſia</hi> being a hot Region, all ſweet ſcents being hot and dry; yet we may very well doubt of this reaſon, untill we have plainer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54366:37"/>
of the truth of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If he hath at any time eaten any poyſon, he preſently ſeeketh for ſome of mans dung, which he with a great deal of eagerneſs devoureth, and it is a certain remedy for him, ſpeedily curing him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is obſerved that they will ſleep three whole dayes together, and after he is awake he roareth out, and then it is that his body ſmelleth the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, at which time abundance of Creatures are drawn to him by the ſcent of his body.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Although he be ſo fierce and cruel a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it is reported of him, that he is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful, or ungrateful to any one that doth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courteſie: for the truth of which we have the teſtimony of ſeveral <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> which do affirm that if he meeteth a Paſſenger that is wandring up and down in a Wood and cannot get out again; if he hath formerly ſhewed any kindneſs to his young ones, he will take him and ſet him in his way. <hi>Aelian</hi> telleth us that the <hi>Leopard,</hi> while young, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth with the <hi>Kid;</hi> it is reported that a certain <hi>Kid</hi> being cut to pieces, and given to the <hi>Leopard</hi> to eat, he would not touch it, being his old companion. Although men oftentimes do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed devour as it were their neer relations.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If at any time he hath touched any poyſonous fleſh, he immediately dieth. The <hi>Panther</hi> hath an inveterate hatred againſt three kinds of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more eſpecially.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the <hi>Dragon,</hi> whoſe voice he cannot endure, neither the ſcent of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath an inveterate hatred againſt the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54366:37"/>
               <hi>Hyaena,</hi> and that not only while he is alive, but after he is dead; ſo he hateth the <hi>Leopard,</hi> that if he ſeeth a man that hath only his skin, he will fall upon him and deſtroy him; it is affirmed by ſome, that if the skin of a <hi>Hyaena</hi> and a <hi>Leopard</hi> be hung up both together, the hairs of the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards</hi> skin will all fall off. 3. He is a great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the <hi>Cock,</hi> he cannot endure his fleſh, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he will not meddle with a man that he ſmelleth hath eaten of a <hi>Cock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. The Female is not ſo cruel as the Male, for ſhe hath a very large heart; the reaſon why ſhe is ſo timerous and fearful, if at any time ſhe doth any miſchief, it is meerly out of fear.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Female is very leacherous, ſhe not only coupling with the <hi>Panther,</hi> but with the <hi>Lyon</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Females skin hath a more fragrant and odoriferous ſmell with it then the skin of a Male.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Although this Creature be ſo valiant and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>btle, yet it is eaſily intoxicated with wine, which he is very greedy of; therefore it is that the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pours wine into the water that he drinketh firſt in a morning, and when he is very thirſty, he is drawn with the ſcent of the wine to the place; after he hath drunk, it flyeth into his head, which maketh him wanton, ſporting himſelf in the fields with other Creatures, until at laſt they are tired, and fall aſleep; ſo that then they are eaſily taken: and thus we have ſhewn the ſeveral properties of this Creature, let us now ſee what is to be learned from them; and although we may compare them
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54366:38"/>
to all cruel men, to Devils, &amp;c. yet we will firſt take notice what the Scripture ſaith; thus we find it comparing the <hi>Grecian Monarchy (as alſo</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>the Great,</hi> who was a chief member of it) to the <hi>Panther</hi> or <hi>Leopard;</hi> the reaſons of which according to <hi>Pererius,</hi> and others, are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Panther</hi> is no bigger than a <hi>Beagle,</hi> yet is very ſtrong, thus we ſee that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had but a ſmall Empire, yet with an Army conſiſting but of 40000 men, conquered the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Countries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> is a very ſwift Creature, thus we read how that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, in the ſpace of twelve years had got the whole Empire to himſelf, for at twenty years of age he enjoyed his Fathers Kingdom, he dyed when he was but thirty three years of age, at which age men uſe to have but little of any experience and prudence; but how much he gained in thoſe twelve years, we ſhall know hereafter more at large: he being once asked how he brought about ſuch great things in ſo ſmall a time, he anſwered, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>never delaying nor procraſtinating any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> but it is much to conſider what a fiery bloody Empire he had; therefore <hi>Apelles</hi> pictured him carrying Lightening in his hand, his Mother <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias</hi> when ſhe was with Child dreamed that it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into her womb, and that it cauſed a great flame. Iu ſeventeen dayes time he built that noble City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſeated upon the River <hi>Tanais.</hi> In three fights he conquered all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and built
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54366:38"/>
ſeventy Cities, and as <hi>Hieronymus</hi> ſaith well, that he was rather famous for his victories than his war, thus we read in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Leopard, chap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 6. ſaith, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> dominion was given to it;</hi> for when he came to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and met the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> there, he fell on his knees and worſhipped him, being asked the reaſon why he would ſo debaſe himſelf, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he did not Worſhip the man, but God; for the night before God did appear to him in the ſhape of a High-Prieſt, and promiſed him ſeveral Victories.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> hunteth all living Creatures, and maketh a prey of them, ſo the Dominion of <hi>Alexander</hi> was very large, as the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, that he had dominion over the whole Earth; thus 1 <hi>Machabees,</hi> it is ſaid that he went even to the ends of the Earth, for he had overcome the greateſt part of <hi>Europe.</hi> All <hi>Aſia, Macedonia, Armenia, Ilerica, Albania, Cappadocia, Syria, Egypt, Mount Taurus, Caucaſus, Media, Perſia, India,</hi> and indeed, all the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries in general; ſeveral Kings being ſubject to him; and he had gone further, had not his Army mutynyed; as the learned have obſerved out of Q. <hi>Curtius;</hi> coming from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he found there the Ambaſſadors from ſeveral Nations, not only from thoſe which he had conquered, but from thoſe which he had not conquered; as out of <hi>Africa, Spain, France, Italy,</hi> and alſo from the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, and he had conquered the whole <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranian,</hi> and the reſt, had he lived a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:54366:39"/>
4. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> hath a moſt ſweet and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſmell, thus <hi>Alexander</hi> was not only civil and courteous to all, and happy and ſucceſsful in all he undertook, but as <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmeth, he had a ſweet ſmell came from his Body, he being of a hot and moiſt temper; we will not now ſpeak any thing of his converting the <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, how he inſtructed them how they ought to cheriſh and nouriſh their Parents, and not to deſtroy them, as ſome of them did, he alſo taught them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from inceſt, it being common among them to lye with their own Mothers. From his loyns came four Kings, <hi>viz. Antipater</hi> in <hi>Macedonia, Antigonus</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Seleucus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Ptolome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> is a fierce and cruel Creature, thus <hi>Alexander,</hi> he overcame and deſtroyed all his Enemies, he never ſat down before a City, but he took it; although he hath fought with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my when they have been <hi>Armed,</hi> and his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>unarmed,</hi> yet he got the <hi>Victory;</hi> many times he hath fought alone himſelf, and ſcaled the walls himſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As this is a moſt crafty ſubtle Creature, ſo <hi>Alexander</hi> by his policy overcame many wiſe and grave <hi>Seniors,</hi> he had a quick and ready wit, he having an extream love to all learned men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> is full of ſpots, but beautiful ones, ſo there were in <hi>Alexander</hi> many vertues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, for he was like <hi>Achilles,</hi> and like <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> for chaſtity, for piety like <hi>Diomede,</hi> and like <hi>Cyrus</hi> for Magnanimity, and for a quick wit
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54366:39"/>
like <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and for learning like his Father; but whatſoever we have ſaid of him, or can ſay of him, is leſs than he deſerveth.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> is a furious Creature, and cannot be taken but by wine; thus <hi>Alexander</hi> is ſaid to have loved wine extraordinarily, and when he was drunk he was guilty of many enormous crimes; he often drunk ſo much that he ſlept three dayes together; he would often appoint drinking matches, giving large rewards to them that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came; when he was drunk he ſet that famous City <hi>Perſepolis</hi> on fire, and killed his dear friend <hi>Clitus</hi> when he was in drink, at which he grieved ſo much, that it had almoſt killed him; he once made a feaſt, to which he invited 9000. gueſts, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one he gave a golden plate; ſo that he who once overcame the whole world, and was moſt chaſt and continent, at laſt could not overcome his voluptuouſneſs and gluttony. Q. <hi>Curtius,</hi> in his tenth Book, goeth about to excuſe him for this; we may alſo learn from what we have read of this beaſt, to apply them to ſeveral other noble men, who being deſtitute of divine grace, although at firſt were famous for many noble and <hi>Heroick</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and would ſtick at no dangers, yet at laſt loſt all this, and came to ſad and tragical ends. <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was in ſome things very like to a <hi>Leopard,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying all Thieves and Robbers, at laſt being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with his own luſt and paſſions, he gave himſelf wholly up to Women, one of which knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on the head with a <hi>Slipper;</hi> thus <hi>Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> who overcame all the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and kept all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54366:40"/>
               <hi>Greece</hi> under him, yet in his old age he was ſo <hi>leacherous,</hi> that he was drawn into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place by four Women inſtead of Mules; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver now I will compare this <hi>Leopard</hi> to the Devil, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> did, for</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Leopard</hi> is ſo crafty and ſubtle, ſo we cannot expreſs the malice and ſubtilty of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus the Devil (as the <hi>Leopard</hi> hath a moſt fragrant ſcent) ſometimes transformeth himſelf into an Angel of light; and as the <hi>Leopard</hi> hideth himſelf, feigning himſelf to be dead, or aſleep, the eaſier to enſnare his prey; ſo the Devil often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times covereth his temptations with fallacies and deceits, the better to take the ſimple: and as the <hi>Leopard</hi> with a great deal of eagerneſs leapeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his prey, ſo the Devil is never ſluggiſh nor ſlothful in tempting of us, but he doth (as he is a roaring <hi>Lyon)</hi> ſnatch away the wicked; finally, as the <hi>Leopard</hi> never changeth his ſpots, ſo he will not leave off deceiving mankind; nay, by ſo many years experience as he hath had, he is much crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and now in theſe later ages he is more fierce and cruel, by how much the nearer he ſeeth his <hi>Judgment</hi> coming; and therefore we ought alwayes to implore the Son of God that he would reſtrain and confound this cruel Creature; but ſo much for the <hi>Leopard.</hi>

               <hi>ARistotle</hi> in his ninth Book of his Hiſtory of <hi>Animals, Chap.</hi> 29. ſaith, <hi>that in</hi> Aſia <hi>are found more cruel beasts, in</hi> Europe <hi>ſtronger, and valianter; but that in</hi> Africa <hi>there are beaſts of ſtranger ſhapes;</hi> and therefore this Creatute being found only in <hi>Aſia,</hi> is more fierce and cruel; as for the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word, <hi>Tyger</hi> is an <hi>Armenian</hi> word, and ſignifieth in that tongue, an <hi>Arrow;</hi> hence it was that in ancient times there was a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called by the ſame name, becauſe it ran ſo ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Creature is found moſt commonly in <hi>Hircania,</hi> being generated only there; hence <hi>Virgil,</hi> in the ſecond Book of his <hi>Aeniods,</hi> calleth them <hi>Hircanian Tygers.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. It is like a great Horſe for the bigneſs of it.</p>

waſhings; waſhing their whole bodies, their eyes, mouth, privities; they are very cleanly in their dyet; they will not ſuffer any unclean Creature to be where they are, they have certain conveyances in the Tents for all manner of filth, which runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral ditches, which are daily covered with Sand, leſt the ſtench that cometh from it ſhould infect the Air; further, in their Market-places they have ſeveral deep holes, wherein they caſt all the filth of the beaſts that they kill, as their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, guts, &amp;c. they are very ſevere in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any one that playeth at any game for money; as alſo thoſe that neglect their kind of worſhip are exceedingly derided and ſcorned by all people; if any one is not ſeen at their worſhip for three Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes together, he is immediately excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they make mention of their Gods with a great deal of reverence, if they find any pieces of paper, they either burn them or hide them, if they think that the name of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is written in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y they are guilty of many hainous vices; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are very cruel and unnatural, ſo that the very Emperours themſelves as ſoon as they have the power in their hands, they put all their Brethren to death, nor have they any regard or reſpect for any of their <hi>Concubines,</hi> oftentimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Captive; they uſe their Enemies like Beaſts, which they ſell, or elſe put them to cruel torments, nay oftentimes they will put out their eyes, others they will pull their skin off, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other wayes of cruelty they have among them, that they exerciſe upon their Enemies: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they give a great deal of honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Kings while they are alive, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are once dead, they then care not what they do; they will mutiny, rob his Treaſury; but this will be too tedious a buſineſs to follow any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being but a digreſſion, I ſhall ſay but a little more of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5, As <hi>Tygers</hi> cannot endure the ſound of <hi>Drums,</hi> thus the <hi>Turks</hi> baniſh from them all good <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> as <hi>Rhetorick, Phyſick, Limning,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Muſick;</hi> becauſe they know that they are apt to uſe it immoderately. Finally, although <hi>Tygers</hi> are ſo fierce and cruel, vet have been, and may be tamed; thus the <hi>Turks,</hi> were they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned as they ſhould be, would ſoon be a more civilized people; as to the difficulty that there is in the taking of their young ones, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> applyeth it to niggardly covetous men; for as Huntſmen
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54366:43"/>
think they do very well in robbing the <hi>Tyger</hi> of her young ones, ſo thoſe that poſſeſs other mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, think they have them lawfully, and at firſt ſatisfie themſelves with thoughts of returning it back again; thus we ſee how the ſeveral proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a <hi>Tyger</hi> may be applyed to ſeveral other things. Thus we ſee a <hi>Tyger</hi> pictured lying by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which ſignifieth to us, that men when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, are more fierce than they are at other times.</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Elke</hi> is only to be found in the Northern parts of the World; they are chiefly to be found in the Woods of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Illyria.

Julius Caeſar</hi> in his Comment of the <hi>French</hi> war, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. deſcribing the Wood <hi>Hyrcinia,</hi> ſaith that it did extend much
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54366:43"/>
towards the <hi>North,</hi> and further addeth that he found in it the <hi>Elke,</hi> and the <hi>Machlin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is like a <hi>Goat,</hi> whoſe fore-head is two handfuls broad, his upper lips are very large.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His legs have no joynts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He hath horns, but they grow only back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Hoofs of this Creature do cure and heal all Epileptical diſeaſes in young Children, it being covered with gold, and ſo hung about his neck; there are ſome who inſtead of this, ſell an <hi>Oxes</hi> Hoof, but it is very eaſie to diſcern the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for if you ſhave an <hi>Oxes</hi> Hoof, it will have a very bad ſmell with it, which this hath not.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It hath a doleful, mournful cry, as I my ſelf have heard, ſo that if you did not ſee it, you would think it were a young Child, and therefore it is that the <hi>Germans</hi> call it <hi>Glen.</hi> They have been tamed and ridden upon; others have uſed them for drawing, it being a very ſwift Creature, and will go further in one day than a <hi>Horſe</hi> doth in three, eſpecially upon Ice, where he will go much faſter than upon the Earth: Thus we have ſhewn the nature of this beaſt, which ſomewhat reſembleth a Chriſtian; as, 1. His leg is without any joynts, ſo that if it lye down, it cannot get up again; thus Chriſtians are ſeldom guilty of any craft or ſubtilty, and not armed with any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power, for if they once fall into any danger, they are not able to deliver themſelves; and as ſhe never goeth backwards, leſt ſhe ſhould be got in a ſnare; thus Chriſtians have a great care leſt they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54366:44"/>
ſhould be enſnared with the ſnares of this World. Further, as ſhe goeth ſwifter upon the Ice than upon the Land, thus the Church hath alwayes gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more by afflictions then by proſperity. Finally, as the Hoof of this Creature cureth the <hi>Epilepſy;</hi> ſo to be converſant among Chriſtians is the only way to be kept from Vices, that are the diſeaſes of the mind; there might be more corrolaries drawn, as we might apply the nature of this beaſt to Counſellours, Merchants, and almoſt to all ſorts of men, they are very watchful while they are feeding, and very ſwift in flight; it is a rare thing to meet with thoſe that will give us good counſel, and when once we have deliberated upen it, then to follow it without delay: we ſhould carefully lay up good counſel, and if we have a ſecret told us, not to reveal it.</p>

            <p>As concerning the firſt doubt, whether there be ſuch a Creature as the <hi>Unicorn</hi> or no; ſome learned
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54366:44"/>
men have denyed that there is any ſuch Creature as an <hi>Unicorn,</hi> but only an <hi>Indian</hi> Aſs, for many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors do ſay, that <hi>Indian</hi> Aſſes have but one horn, but the Scripture draweth many infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the nature of this beaſt, and doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to good men and bad men, nay, even to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, therefore it muſt neſſarily follow that there are ſuch Creatures as <hi>Unicorns,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that judicious writer, <hi>Julius Caeſar Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> in his exercitations againſt <hi>Cardanus,</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one of his friends that ſaw one.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond queſtion, whether a <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn</hi> and a <hi>Rhinoſcerote</hi> be not the ſame. The word in <hi>Hebrew</hi> for a <hi>Rhinoſcerote,</hi> which is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The <hi>Unicorn</hi> is a Creature about the bigneſs of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> he hath the beard of a <hi>Goat,</hi> the head of a <hi>Hart,</hi> he hath a neck with a large main, he hath

               </gap> as he is long, but hath very ſhort legs, and two horns, as I ſaid before; but becauſe they are both ſuch large Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> have but one name for them both, that cometh from an <hi>Hebrew</hi> root <hi>Ram,</hi> which ſignifieth high exalted; moreover the <hi>Rhinoſcerots</hi> horn is evceeding hard, which he often ſharpneth and whetteth upon a ſtone, when at any time he is to encounter with any other beaſt; for the <hi>Rhinoſcerot</hi> hath an natural enmity againſt ſeveral Creatures, but eſpecially againſt the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> which two are alwayes at variance one with another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Combate the <hi>Rhinoſcerot</hi> aimeth at the <hi>Elephants</hi> belly, which is his tendereſt part, and doth often overcome him; againſt whom the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> fighteth very fiercely with his horn that he hath in his ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We come now to ſpeak of the <hi>Unicorn,</hi> and the firſt thing obſervable is his horn, which is two Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits lon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2.

but yet keeps within ſight of him; the young man layes his hands upon his eyes, and ſo blind-folds him, whereupon the Huntſmen come ſoftly behind him, and take him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Unicorn</hi> is ſo exceeding ſtrong that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, a wild Creature, inhabiting only Mountains and Deſarts, to which <hi>Job</hi> alludes; who ſpeaking of the <hi>Unicorn,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 39. 12. <hi>Can the</hi> Unicorn <hi>be tamed, or canſt thou bind him?</hi> Whence it appears to be very fierce and wild, becauſe it cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; for we have tamed <hi>Lyons, Panthers,</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> but this we could never tame. 4. It's horn is an excellent Antidote and preſervative againſt poyſon, inſomuch that if water hath been poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if it be but touched with his horn, it takes away the poyſonous quality; it was a Cuſtome in old time among rich men to have drinking Cups made of the <hi>Unicorns</hi> horn, and when at any time they drank, they uſed to have a piece of the horn in the Cup, for it is very much commended by <hi>Phyſicians;</hi> now having explained the properties of the <hi>Unicorn,</hi> we will next conſider what we may learn from it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> in his 13 Orations, compares the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and the <hi>Unicorn</hi> together; for,</p>

               <hi>Eraſmus</hi> hath ſeveral inferences and corrolaries, which he draweth from the <hi>Horſe;</hi> as 1. The <hi>Horſe,</hi> if not tamed, will be ruled by none; thus Man by Nature is a wild and unruly Creature, untill by good education he be better mannered; and as a <hi>Horſe</hi> is not at all the better for his rich Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings; thus theſe Worldly enjoyments do not at all better him that poſſeſſeth them; and as we do not uſe to put an <hi>Aſſes</hi> Saddle on a <hi>Horſes</hi> back; ſo we ought not to back-bite or caſt any reproach on the good name of our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as we find that Horſes are not tamed by ſtripes and blows, but by gentle means; ſo we ſee that Children at School are not ſo eaſily wrought on by the <hi>Rod</hi> and <hi>Ferula,</hi> as by mild and gentle words; nay, we often ſee that good wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

have been ſpoyled by the over harſh and auſtre car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of their Maſters.</p>
            <p>Further, if at any time we ſee an unruly <hi>Horſe,</hi> we preſently conclude, that it is either for want of care, or skill in the Rider; ſo alſo we conclude, if we ſee a people given to all vice and wickedneſs, it is the fault of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>And as a free <hi>Horſe</hi> needs no ſput, ſo he who loves learning, needs no arguments to make him diligent; and as we do not ride a <hi>Horſe</hi> without a Bridle, and if we ſee that he begins to be head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, then to put on one; ſo all men who are cholerick, ought to reſtrain and bridle their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the firſt riſings of them.</p>
            <p>And as when a <hi>Horſe</hi> is made tame and tractable, one may ride him without a bridle, and eaſily guide him; ſo when once a man hath conquered and ſubdued his paſſions, they will not ſo eaſily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards exceed their due bounds and limits.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Horſe</hi> alſo, when ſingle, can go in as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a path as a man; but when he draws a Chariot, he then is forced to go through thick and thin; ſo we find it amongſt men, who are not content with their condition, but ſtill aiming at preferment, do but thereby run into greater troubles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as Horſes, when they once grow old, are good for nothing but the Cart or the Plough; ſo while a man is in proſperity, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of all; but when in adverſity, then he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed of all; <hi>Sophocles,</hi> in his Electra, ſpeaking of <hi>

            <p>THe Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> comprehend the wild <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Cow</hi> under this Creature; there is a beaſt called <hi>Hyreinia,</hi> much like to an <hi>Ox,</hi> which they called by the ſame Name, a very ſwift Creature; this word <hi>Ox</hi> was formerly taken to ſignifie a <hi>Calf,</hi> which of all the reſt agreeth beſt with the body of a Man; it is a very uſeful Creature, it was uſed to be offered in ſacrifices, it is good for food, the Husbandman maketh great uſe of him in tilling his ground; formerly it did threſh the Corn, which was done by leading him over the Corn, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; the Earth is much fatned by his drug<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhooes are made of his skin, of horns are made Combs, winding horns, and ſeveral other things, which we could not well want.</p>

when old, which <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi> thinketh would be tenderer, were he baited with Dogs before he was killed, for experience telleth us that the fleſh of thoſe <hi>Oxen</hi> that run among <hi>Bears,</hi> is ſo tender that it will almoſt melt in the mouth, but his blood is thicker; thus it is in other <hi>Oxen,</hi> that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him appear to be the ſtronger, is this; that he never <hi>Coughs,</hi> nor ſcarce ever bringeth any thing up out of his ſtomack; (it is obſerved by ſome, that a Miniſter is never heard to ſneeze while he is preaching, the reaſon of which I leave for the more curious to enquire into) this Creature hath many ventricles, by which his food is better digeſted; he is very hot naturally, whoſe Milk ſerveth for the nouriſhment of his Body; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that he giveth not ſo much Milk, either as the <hi>Sheep</hi> or <hi>Goat.</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54366:57"/>
ſeveral writers, as well ſacred as Prophane, have deduced ſeveral inferences from the nature of this beaſt, yet for brevity ſake I ſhall name but few of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſpeak to ſome places in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in which there is mention made of this Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature; as that it was offered for ſacrifice, which was a kind of a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being offered ſor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, for before the Sacrificing of the beaſt, they uſed to lay their hands upon the <hi>Heifer,</hi> by which Rite was ſignified unto us, that that particular beaſt was ſet apart for Sacrifice; thus the voice that came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> from heaven, did fore-tell that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be the general <hi>Victime</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the <hi>Heifer</hi> was ſlain before the <hi>

                  </gap>ſalem,</hi> in the ſight of the whole multitude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As his skin wa flead off, and the beaſt alſo diſmembered, thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> lay naked upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> there induring many ſtripes and wounds; and as the blood of the <hi>Heifer</hi> was ſprinkled upon the horns of the Altar; thus by the preaching of the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> is the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſprinkled throughout the whole World; and as in old time an <hi>Ox</hi> or a <hi>Cow</hi> was given as a marriage pledge, as one, in <hi>Homer,</hi> gave a hundred <hi>Oxen</hi> to his Father-in-Law as a pledge; thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is given to the World as a pledge of that Covenant which is made between God and man, ſinee the fall.</p>
            <p>Further, as the <hi>Ox</hi> is the Husband-mans ſervant, thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made ſervant to us all, for he did
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54366:57"/>
(as the <hi>Apoſtles)</hi> waſh the feet of ſeveral poor people, yet he himſelf went on foot into <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and ſo finiſhed the work of our Redemption; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as the <hi>Ox</hi> is a ſtrong Creature, thus there was an infinite power given to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and as the <hi>Ox</hi> was not an unclean Creature in the Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut gentle and tame; thus there was never found any craft or guile in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> mouth, for he was of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> men the moſt meek and humble, and ſo inviting all men to him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, as the <hi>Ox</hi> is a gentle tame Creature, being ſeldom ſeen to fight with his fellows, neither hath he any pride in him, thus was <hi>Chriſt</hi> the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, humbleſt perſon that ever lived on the face of the Earth, and all his Sermons which he preached while he was here on the Earth, tended all to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to meekneſs and humility; it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that there are ſome <hi>Oxen</hi> in <hi>Tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ary,</hi> which will kneel down like a <hi>Camel</hi> when they take up any burthen; thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> patiently and willingly took up the Croſs; and as we ſee that <hi>Bees</hi> are bred out of the carkaſs of the <hi>Ox;</hi> thus by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> many have been turned to God, and by this ſpiritual Death they are reſtored to life; and as Corn that was but touched with the horn of an <hi>Ox</hi> will never come up in the ear; thus wicked men, through the juſt judgments of God periſh to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, becauſe of their unbelief. I might have inlarged on each of theſe particulars, and alſo upon the ſeveral circumſtances of the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and alſo of the red <hi>Heifer,</hi> which in the Law was offered for a Sacrifice, which ſignified the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:54366:58"/>
one drop of which (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Redemption of the whole World, were there a thouſand more than there are; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we find, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> (who repreſent the perſon of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Holy Scripture to <hi>Oxen;</hi> the firſt place where we find them thus compared, is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. where we find the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> thus ſpeaking; <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing, that we ſhould receive your carnal things? i. e.</hi> That as the <hi>Ox</hi> was not to be muzled that trod out the Corn, which Law ſeemeth to have reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Oxen,</hi> as appeareth from that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 4. yet the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſheweth that when this Law was given it had reſpect to <hi>Miniſters;</hi> but this will appear, if we conſider, we may compare <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> and <hi>Oxen</hi> together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the <hi>Ox</hi> is a ſtout Creature, endued with a great deal of courage; thus ought <hi>Miniſters to</hi> be valiant for the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and fight manfully under <hi>Chriſt's</hi> banner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Oxen</hi> by nature are gentle, tame, chaſt, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to drink alwayes in clear water, and hath a great love to his fellow; thus ought <hi>Miniſters</hi> to be like them in all reſpects; and as an <hi>Ox</hi> is uſeful, whether he be dead or alive; thus ought <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> by their preaching and writing, ſeek to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Church;</hi> and as the horns of young <hi>Oxen</hi> do ſoften by lying in wax; thus are younger affections eaſier wrought upon; and as <hi>Oxen</hi> will labour more, and work harder in the VVinter than in the Summer; thus <hi>Miniſters</hi> get more when under

ſufferings, then when in a proſperous Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">1. It is a very timerous fearful Creature, he hath a very large heart, but no gall at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that he will endure more hardſhip than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Creature; he is content with his Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, let it be what it will; and if you lay upon him more than he can bear, he will no wayes complain,

               </gap>. 23. The <hi>Aſs</hi> will eat brambles and Thiſtles better than any thing elſe; his skin is very hard and braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for he cannot feel a blow with a ſtick, when he goeth into any field where there is any graſs, he is kept from eating it, or any other green herb; and when he is loaded with wheat, he keepeth himſelf upon hay; the little birds are oftentimes very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to him, for by rubbing himſelf againſt thoſe hedges where the birds build, and by his dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cry doth ſo affright the young ones, that were not his eyes very low in his head, the birds would peck them out; he uſeth to drink in muddy water, he can endure the ſmell of no oyntment, and if by hard labour he is killed, he is good for nothing but the Dogs, after his skin is pulled off.</p>
            <p n="3">3. VVhen once he falleth, he is alwayes afraid of that plaee; he will ſcarcely go over that bridge where he can ſee the water through the creviſes of the boards; and if you force him to go through the water, he Urines; he hath but a weak head, and oftentimes is troubled with the dizzineſs in his head.</p>

            <p n="4">4. There is no Creature ſo fruitful as this is, for ſhe is with young, when ſhe is but young her ſelf, and ſo continueth ſtill to have Colts, untill ſhe is thirty years old.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When ſhe is bringing forth, it is alwaye; in ſome dark place, where no one can ſee her; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he copulateth, he doth with a loud voyce call the Female, continually braying until ſhe cometh; and as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> very well obſerveth, an <hi>Aſs</hi> will bray although loaden with gold, the fleſh of <hi>Aſſes</hi> is allegorically compared in Scripture to the groſfeſt kind of Idolatry, which the <hi>Jews</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very much inclined unto, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The <hi>Aſs</hi> will alwayes drink in the ſame place, if he can go dry to it, for he will not go through

            <p n="7">7.

            <p n="3">3.

to that knowledge which men have of God, and of his wayes; and <hi>Balaam</hi> may be compared to the will which oftentimes goeth contrary to conſcience, untill they ſee divine vengeance coming upon them.

Becauſe of his great ſwiftneſs and ſtrength, in leaping over the Mountains, ſo that he ſeemeth rather to flye than leap; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to come <hi>leaping over the Mountains, and skipping over the Hills;</hi> the word may alſo ſignifie <hi>Harts,</hi> for as <hi>Harts</hi> do fight one with another for the <hi>Hind;</hi> ſo doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> wage war with the Devil for the defence of the Church. 3. Many in <hi>Chriſt</hi> might be applyed to the Church, and to all good men as members of the ſame; thus all good men are compared to <hi>Harts, Pſal.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>The</hi> Hart <hi>panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God:</hi> We might draw ſeveral inferences from the nature of this beaſt, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew wherein the good man and the <hi>Hart</hi> do agree; as, 1. The <hi>Hart</hi> is meek, and a very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Creature, loving the company of his fellows; thus the Church hath received from <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſs. 2. As the <hi>Hart,</hi> when ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and beſet with the <hi>Hounds,</hi> ſeeing no way to eſcape them, he will run to the Huntſman, rather then be made a prey to the <hi>Hounds;</hi> thus the Church in her greateſt danger runneth for help to God, and like an humble ſupplicant acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her tranſgreſſions, and confeſſeth that ſhe hath deſerved greater puniſhments. 3. As <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> when hunted run for refuge to high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks; ſo <hi>Chriſtians</hi> when any wayes diſtreſſed, look up to Heaven, from whence cometh
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54366:67"/>
their Salvation; and as the <hi>Stag,</hi> when he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf wounded with a dart, their only cure is <hi>Betony;</hi> thus <hi>Chriſtians</hi> perceiving doubts to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, can find comfort no where but in the Holy Scriptures; and as I ſaid before, ſome <hi>Harts</hi> have their Gall in their Tayls; ſo ought all good men patiently and quietly to endure injuries done unto them; not prone to revenge, but labouring daily to bridle and reſtrain their uuruly paſſions. 4. As there is a natural <hi>Antipathy</hi> and enmity between the <hi>Hart</hi> and the <hi>Serpent;</hi> thus the Church in all Ages hath alwayes had implacable Enemies, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, Hereticks, &amp;c. And as when he is hunted, it groweth exceeding hot, and extreamly thirſteth for water; ſo when good men are vexed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by wicked men, they immediately betake themſelves to the ſervice of God, expecting there alone to find help and ſuccour in all their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and as when they ſwim over any River, they ſo order themſelves, that the head of one lyeth on the back of another; ſo we ought all <hi>to bear one anothers burthens;</hi> and as, although they have large Horns, yet they hurt no one, but are very time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; ſo Chriſtians ought not to truſt in an <hi>Arm of fleſh:</hi> St. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, that as <hi>Harts</hi> by their breath do expell, and (as it were) draw out the poyſon from the <hi>Serpents</hi> hole; ſo good men, by their good coverſation do often convert and reclaim men from their ſins.</p>
            <p>And as in the <hi>Cant. Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> are compared to two friends, in like manner the <hi>Hart</hi> is an eminent inſtance and <hi>Symbol</hi> of love and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54366:68"/>
frieudſhip, concerning which we will not now ſpeak any thing, having at large ſpoken to it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>And as oftentimes the Horns are of no uſe to the <hi>Hart;</hi> ſo neither do riches profit the owner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as we often ſee the owner never liveth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy what he hath gotten; thus it often cometh to paſs, that outward ſtrength hath done a great deal of miſchief, therefore it is alwayes good to truſt in God for relief in all our miſeries; we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. <hi>That the voyee of the Lord maketh the Hinds to Calve;</hi> which is as if he ſhould ſay, that God was even the midwife and Phyſician at the time of their bringing forth; ſome ſay that the <hi>Hart</hi> is very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Thunder, for when it Thundreth ſhe never bringeth forth her young alive, which God, in the fore-cited place, is ſaid to prevent; he alſo <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon; <hi>i. e.</hi> by his word he humbleth the high and lofty ſpirits of men, he is ſaid there to make the <hi>Hinds to Calve, i. e.</hi> he by his Goſpel comforteth and ſupporteth all weak and deſpairing Chriſtians; but having ſo largely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this beaſt, we ſhall ſay no more of it.</p>

            <p>BEfore we ſhall ſpeak of the Nature of this Creature, we ſhall conſider the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Hog,</hi> the <hi>wild Boar,</hi> the <hi>tame Boar,</hi> the <hi>Pig, Sow,</hi> and the <hi>Porcupine,</hi> which ſome do think is rather a kind of <hi>Hedge-hog;</hi> as the <hi>Ape</hi> is likeſt to a man in his outward parts; ſo the Author of that little Anatomical exerciſe, (which <hi>Galen</hi> is ſuppoſed to have writ) ſaith that a <hi>Hog</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures is likeſt to a <hi>Man</hi> in his inward parts, whoſe fleſh is ſo like to mans fleſh, both in ſmell and taſte, that (as <hi>Conradus Geſner</hi> ſaith) ſeveral have eaten the one for the other, not diſcovering of it by taſte or ſmell; theſe things premiſed, I come now more particularly to ſpeak of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hath exceeding hard hairs, of a devouring gluttonous Nature, and therefore his head conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually looketh towards the ground, and never can look upwards, and by his ſcent and continual ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Earth, he findeth Roots, Bones, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, Dung, and never refuſeth any thing that he findeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is hot and moiſt; and therefore it is that ſometimes we ſee hard ſwellings grow about them; ſo that <hi>Butchers</hi> looking under their tongues, will tell whether a <hi>Hog</hi> be good or no. Thoſe <hi>Hogs</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:54366:69"/>
which are fed of rotten Apples, bean cods, and ſuch moiſt meat, their fleſh is moiſter and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than other meat, but not ſo healthful for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; they have another way to know a <hi>Hog</hi> by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their backs, for they ſee whether the blood be good or no that cometh out upon the plucking ſome hairs off by the roots; the way to have them clear from theſe ſwellings, is to let them run abroad, and keep them in clean ſties; Butchers commonly ſay, that it is very ſeldom but that a <hi>Hog</hi> is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſome diſtemper or other, either in his Lungs, Lights, Liver, &amp;c. but moſt eſpecially they are troubled with Lice, which breed moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their backs; but the head-ach is an <hi>epidemical</hi> diſeaſe among all <hi>Hogs,</hi> of which many dye. 3. It is ſo greedy a Creature, that he hath no meaſure in eating, and groweth ſo fat, that ſometimes he is not able to go; they have lain ſo long in one place, that <hi>Mice</hi> have bred under them; <hi>Otto Melander</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>Arcadia</hi> he ſaw a <hi>Hog</hi> ſo fat that he could not ſtir, and that a <hi>Rat</hi> had eat a hole in his fleſh, and there bred young ones; as <hi>Marcus Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> ſaith, quoting <hi>Johannes Rivius,</hi> in his Book concerning the <hi>inſtitution of Children:</hi> this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture liveth as if he were born for nothing but to eat; and, as there he obſerveth, the groſfeſt bodies breed the worſt blood; he hath nothing of ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or craft in him, but is a dull, ſtupid, ſenſleſs Creature, and can never be brought to any ſervice, as are other Creatures, though wild; <hi>viz. Lyons, Bears,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that the life of a <hi>Sow</hi> is for nothing but to keep it from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54366:69"/>
putrifying, and as the <hi>Proverb, habet animam pro ſale,</hi> their ſouls are of no other uſe than to keep the body from ſtinking; pigs will ſuck any ſow, and therefore they uſe to diſtinguiſh one from another by ſticking pitch upon them. 4. They very much delight to be in the mud, which they doe not perceive the ſtench of, becauſe they often breathe in the mud, and doe not take the ſcent up into their noſe; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the ſmel of a <hi>Roſe</hi> or <hi>ſweet Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram;</hi> and, as <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith, that tumbling and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mud is as pleaſant to the Swine as waſhing to a man; he loveth roots better then any thing, will eat ſomething of whatever he findeth, he very greedily devoureth ſerpents, and the dead carkaſs of any creature, nay he will eat the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs of his fellow creature, which no other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will doe. She is ſo impatient of hunger, that oftentimes ſhe devoureth her young, and therefore it is no ſtrange thing, as ſome have thought, for a Sow to devour her pigs. 5. <hi>It is no leſs fruitful then leacherous,</hi> for it is ſo exceeding enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with luſt that they will fight one with another for the female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hath almoſt the ſtrength of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> for a <hi>Boar</hi> when hunted will not only throw the Huntſman down, but if he hath no help will kill him. 6. <hi>The Sownever ſheddeth her hair in the winter time,</hi> as all other four-footed creatures doe. It is the particular property of the <hi>Boar,</hi> who when he ſeeth unavoidable death, he ſingleth out one of the Huntſmen and will run upon him, with the greateſt rage imaginable, not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with ſwords or ſticks; it is worth obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54366:70"/>
to conſider that if one Hog be hurt, and he beginneth to grumble, all the reſt of the Hogs of the ſame company come in to him; it is needleſs to recite any thing more of this creature, it being ſo commonly known: now let us ſee what we may learn from the nature of it. I might give <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of this creature, out of ſeveral prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; but I ſhall only ſet down one or two out of the <hi>Holy Scripture:</hi> the firſt place I ſhall ſpeak to, ſhall be taken out of the Old Teſtament, in the 14. of <hi>Deut. v.</hi> 8. where we find the <hi>Jews</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the <hi>eating of Swines fleſh;</hi> ſome may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the reaſon of this prohibition, ſince, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the judgement of all Phyſitians, it may be reckoned one of the beſt ſorts of meats, provided that it have no diſtemper upon it; nay they were not only forbidden the eating of it, but they were not ſo much as to touch the carkaſs of it after it was dead; the reaſons of which among others may be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Leſt the Vines and Olive trees in the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Gardens ſhould be rooted up by this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous creature; for he will not eat the tops of herbs, but pull them up by the roots.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To prevent the encreaſe and ſpreading of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes among them, who were alwayes very ſubject to the <hi>Leproſie;</hi> Swine being often troubled with hard ſwellings, which ſoon putrifie, being not well fed. <hi>Conradus Geſner</hi> hath obſerved that <hi>white Hens</hi> are troubled with the ſame diſeaſe. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next reaſon of their being forbidden Swines fleſh may be, that by their abſtinence they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54366:70"/>
might give a teſtimony of their obedience to God, which would not have appeared in abſtaining from thoſe things which in their own nature were hurtful; but in abſtaining from thoſe things that were uſefull and pleaſant; for Swines fleſh (as we ſaid before) is the likeſt to mans fleſh. 4. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi> telleth us a fourth cauſe, in his Book <hi>de vera ſapientia. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>God forbid the Jews the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Swines fleſh, (ſaith he) that thereby they might learn to keep themſelves from all ſins of uncleanneſs, for Swines are filthy and unclean creatures; never ſo much as once looking up unto heaven, but alwayes rooting in the earth continually ſeeking for food; and no creature is of ſo little uſe as they are, for every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is either good for drawing, for tilling the ground, for eaſing of burthens, or elſe they ſerve to clothe us, or give us milk, or laſt of all, are for a ſafegu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd unto us; ſo that no creature but is of ſome uſe or other to man. God therefore forbids them to eat Swines fleſh which was fed only to live. He would have them take heed, from this coeature, of being gluttons, which would very much hinder the free exerciſe of juſtice amongst them, as alſo that they ſhould not plunge themſelves in filthy luſts as the Sow doth in the mire, and that they ſhould not be ſubject to, nor clog themſelves with earthly pleaſures; for they are beſmeared with mud or clay, that make riches their God; thus far</hi> Lctanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. The Sow never looks up to heaven but when he grunteth, and then it is only with his eyes lift up; he will be much under trees, loving ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to feed upon <hi>Acorns,</hi> but never looketh up to the <hi>Oak</hi> from whence they fall; thus wicked
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54366:71"/>
covetous men, though they enjoy all this worlds good, never look up to God who is the tree of life, who is the Authour and Giver of them. <hi>Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay, that thoſe who have ſmall foreheads have no more learning in them than a Hog; and that they who have a thick noſe and flat at the end, are fooliſh; and if they have a thick neck, then they are cholerick: all Authors compare thoſe men that are given to luſt to Swine; thus <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 7. 6. Forbiddeth us to <hi>caſt Pearls before Dogs and Swine,</hi> not to dogs, i. e. to furious perſecutors; not to Swine, i. e. to unclean perſons, who contrary to their conſciences wallow in their ſins, and that men ſhould not be deterred from preaching the Goſpel by the ingratitude of their hearers, Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to preach to thoſe who are more willing and obedient; thus we find <hi>Epicures</hi> and <hi>Drunkards</hi> are compared to Swine. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. for firſt, as the Hog is a moſt dull ſtupid creature, having not ſo much reaſon as to diſtinguiſh good from bad; nor can he be made fit for any ſervice; thus wicked men will not underſtand the things of God, not being at all moved at any Sermon, but doe deſpiſe even wiſdom it ſelf. The ſame <hi>Chriſt</hi> telleth us, in another place, that the cares of this world is one great hinderance of our profiting by the word. 2. Swine are led only by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, alwayes living an intemperate gluttonous life, <hi>Jeremiah, cap.</hi> 12. 3. ſaith, that wicked men who flouriſh in this life, and enjoy all the world can afford them, are <hi>fatted for the ſlaughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and as Swine doe devour any thing that cometh next to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54366:71"/>
their mouth, (for diſh-water is a very pleaſant drink to them) thus wicked covetous men uſe all meanes, both right and wrong, to obtain their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſires; ſometimes we pull out ſome of their teeth to prevent miſchief; thus wicked men are kept from doing that miſchief which otherwiſe they would doe, for fear of the Laws. 3. As Swine cannot diſtinguiſh between Pearls and Carrion, but trample upon them both, ſo ſinners doe not ſee any difference between earthly and heavenly things; Nay, they contemn the latter, and only ſeek for earthly things; and as they cannot endure the ſcent of roſes and ſweet Marjoram; ſo cannot wicked men endure that breath of life which is breathed out of the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> Swine doe not onely delight in dung, but they count the ſmel of carrion a ſweet ſcent. Thus wicked men count all their ſins vertues; ſo it is common among us now, not to count drunkenneſs any ſin, but a vertue; ſo of other vices; and as the Sow after her waſhing will turn to the mire again, ſo wicked men, after a feigned repen tance, will turn again to their former wicked life; and alſo, as this creature defileth any thing which he toucheth with his ſnout, thus doe wicked men by their evil lives; and as we commonly ſee the Sow teacheth the young Pigs betimes to wallow in the mire, ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men begin betimes to teach their children to doe wickedly; if one Hog be hurt, all the reſt of the company will run to help him; ſo if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter accuſeth one wicked man of his ſins, all his company will run to help him. But we may learn
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54366:72"/>
ſome good inſtructions from the nature of the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in this particular, in which ſhe ſheweth a tender nature and a great love to her fellows; thus ought Chriſtians to be pitiful &amp; tender-hearted to their fellow creatures when under any miſery or affliction; but more particularly we may compare the Hog and the covetous man together; for as the Hog doth nothing all his life long but eat and ſeek for food; thus is it the whole buſineſs of the covetous mans life to heap up riches, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his wealth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Hog is never ſatisfied with what he eates, ſo are the deſires of the covetous never to be ſatisfied with riches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the Hog is of no uſe nor ſervice to any one while alive; ſo it is with the covetous man, who never doth any good with what he hath while alive.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As Swines when very hungry and cannot get any thing to eat, doe not ſpare their young piggs, but greedily devour them; thus covetous men will have their greedy deſires ſatisfied, and ſpare neither friends nor relations, but are for what they can get of either.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As the Hog if he heareth any noiſe about his ſtye preſently beginneth to gruntle, fearing that ſome body is coming to take his life away; thu are covetous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men afraid of every one, leſt they ſhould rob him of his pelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As the Hog is continually grunting all the while he is at the trough, eating in fear leſt any ſhould take it away from him; thus covetous men
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54366:72"/>
doe not enjoy what they have, but are in fear leſt by any accident they ſhould loſe what they have.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As the Hog will ſoon forget the miſery of his fellow, though at the hearing of him cry many of them will run to help him; thus it is with the covetous men, who have no true affection to their friends and relations, but when ſelf-intereſt is at the bottom of it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As the Hog maketh a great noiſe and loud cries when he is going to be killed; thus are cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men as fearfull of death.</p>
            <p n="9">9. As when Swine are killed, there are pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and ſauſages ſent about to friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which are eaten with a great deal of joy; thus do wicked heires daily expect and deſire the death of the covetous miſer, and then with joy they divide what with care and pains he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together.</p>
            <p>As Swine never ſhed their hairs in the winter time, thus it is with the wicked, who never leave off their wicked wayes; and as the Sow after her waſhing, returns again to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire; thus doe wicked men after a feigned repentance return again to their former wicked courſes; and as Swine doe not make any noiſe towards heaven; thus wicked men while in peace and proſperity never ſeek God; but when under afflictions and troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 14.</p>
            <p n="10">10. To conclude, the enemies of the Church are compared to <hi>wild Boares deſtroying the Vineyards,</hi> who will often whet and ſharpen their teeth, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54366:73"/>
upon the Huntſman with ſo great violence that it is very hard for him to eſcape with his life; thus with no leſs rage and violence doe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church act againſt her. <hi>Xenophon, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianus, Pollux,</hi> and ſeveral other writers do tell us, that it is of ſo fiery a nature, that when for weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he is forced to lye down upon the ground, his teeth are ſo inflamed and his whole mouth, that if you take a hair from his neck, and put it into his mouth, it will ſet it on fire; the enemies of Chriſt are as fierce againſt his Church, as the Boar is againſt the Huntſman; an example of this we have, in our modern ſtory; who have ſworn for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their poſterity the ruine who have and deſtruction of all <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and as the Boar (which may not unproperly be called a kind of Swine) until ſhe hath voided her ruine, cannot fly the enemy, but will ſtand ſtill and be taken; thus the enemies of the Church, unleſs they doe leave and forſake their ſins, cannot avoid the wrath of God; and as the Boar, when ill, cureth himſelf tby the Ivy-tree; thus there is no remedy for the cure of ſinners but the word of God; and as the Boar if inraged will for madneſs run into his ſtye; thus many men, in a paſsion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will ſay and doe that which at laſt proveth their own ruine: we reade in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, of the Devills that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Chriſt, if he caſt them out <hi>that they might enter into the herd of Swine,</hi> Chriſt gave them leave to goe, the Devil was very willing to enter into the herd; from whence we may learn thus much, that the Devil dwelleth in thoſe perſons, who like Hogs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54366:73"/>
and Swine delight to continue in their ſins and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; and as the <hi>Gadarens</hi> deſired Chriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their Coaſts, leſt they ſhould loſe any more Hogs; thus it is with wicked men, who rather then they will loſe the enjoyment of a baſe filthy luſt, will let Chriſt, God and Heaven, and all go.

            <head>Of the <hi>Fox.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Fox is a creature commonly known to all, and therefore I ſhall not be very large in ſpeaking of it; only I ſhall ſay ſomething to thoſe ſeveral places of Scripture, where we find this creature made mention of: there are three things which I obſerve in the Fox; it is a very crafty and ſubtle, and it is a cruel and gluttonous Creature. <hi>Ambroſius</hi> (in his <hi>Hexameron)</hi> ſaith, that the Fox is to be hated for his greedineſs, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed for his weakneſs, and that while he is laying waite for another, he doth not take care enough of himſelf. I find that Foxes and Weaſels may be ſaid to be equally cunning, eſpecially Ferrets and white Weaſels; there is alſo a ſea-fiſh called a Fox, which I think doth not come far ſhort of this Creature we are now ſpeaking to, for ſubtilty and craftineſs; that the Fox is ſo, appears from thoſe Fables which are extant concerning him, by which his craftineſs, &amp;c. is ſignified to us; but we ſhall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54366:74"/>
ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of this at large hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that he is malicious and revengeful appears, in that all his craftineſs, &amp;c. is only imployed to the deſtruction of other Creatures; and his gluttony appears in that he is continually ſeeking for his prey, never being ſatisfied; which three odious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties are applyed to Hypocrites, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 58. and that chiefly to <hi>Herod, Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 13. 32. <hi>Go and tell that Fox,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Fox therefore, as we ſaid before, is very crafty; which will appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that he claps his tail between his legs when he is purſued,</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath a very large hairy tail, inſomuch that the dogs purſuing of him catch hold of his tail; &amp; thinking to catch hold of him, inſtead of fleſh get nothing but their mouthes full of hair, by which means they loſe their hold of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When he perceiveth he cannot eſcape he urin's on his tayl and whisks it on the dogs, which hath an exceeding ſtrong ſcent, inſomuch that the dogs not enduring the ſcent are for a while forced to deſiſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He often when he is in danger, and no avoiding of it, he will bite the dogs on their hinder legs, for that is the tendereſt part about them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe the Urchine is too ſtrong for him, he taketh him by craft; for when he caſteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down upon the ground, he leapeth upon his belly and deſtroyeth him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Fox hath a way to take fiſh; wandring by the ſhoar, he dippeth his tayl in the water; the

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54366:74"/>
little fiſh immediately entangle themſelves in his tayl, and ſo are taken.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He his often troubled with waſps in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, but uſeth this wile to deſtroy them; he hideth himſelf, but layeth his tayl out; the Waſps fly to his tayl, and when there are abundance in it, he runneth to the wall or to ſome tree, and there ſtriketh his tayl againſt the tree, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ubbeth it againſt the ground, and ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth all of them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If he wanteth any food and cannot tell where to get it, he lyeth upon the ground upon his back with his legs ſtretched abroad, and ſo feigneth himſelf dead; the Birdes ſeeing him lye ſo light on him, thinking he is dead; &amp; when they are upon him he taketh them, and devoureth them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He hideth himſelf privately when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there are Hens, Geeſe or Ducks, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth them in the night time; he will be often ſucking the milk Pailes where he can find them; ſometimes he taketh a Hare by his trapps which he layeth for him. The Fox will eat Mice, and hens, after he hath killed them, but before he will not meddle with it. He is a deſtroyer of Peacocks, Doves, and almoſt all Birdes, as alſo of Hares; and therefore there are but few Hares where there are many Foxes; it is a known Fable of the Fox, the Geeſe, and Hens.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He will never eat if any one ſeeth him, but alwayes feeds by himſelf in his hole.</p>
            <p n="11">11. When he goeth abroad he never goeth ſtraight forwards, but in ſeveral paths and turnings,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54366:75"/>
and therefore he is called <hi>Vulpes quaſi Volvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. He goeth as if he were lame, for his right legs are ſhorter than his left.</p>
            <p n="13">13. He is a greater devourer of tame, than of wild Creatures.</p>
            <p n="14">14. His breath is very ſtrong, and his urine is no leſs unpleaſant than his breath; and if he bites any one it is venemous; it is obſerved, that thoſe places where they are are very barren; the reaſon of which ſome think may be, that rank and unpleaſant ſmell which cometh from his body; ſo that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proverb, he ſtinks <hi>ano &amp; ore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. When he wants food he will be very tame, &amp; keep about houſes, and in the night time, if he can get any thing he takes it, and runs with it into the woods, and his hole or den hath ſix or ſeven wayes to it, leſt any one ſhould trayle him.</p>
            <p n="16">16. There is a kind of mutual love between the Fox and the Serpent; for both of them love to be in holes and Caves; but though Foxes have holes, yet they be not of their own making; for thoſe holes which the Badgers make for themſelves, they by craft couſen them of by this ſtratagem; when he ſeeth any of their holes empty, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dungs juſt at the mouth of the hole; when the Badger returns he not enduring ſuch a rank ſmell is forced to leave his hole; the ſeveral wayes which lead to his hole are a great diſtance one from another; for were they near one another, if the Huntſman laid a gin at one place, let him come out where he would the dogs would ſee him. We find
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54366:75"/>
that Chriſt ſpoke of the holes of Foxes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 58. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birdes of the air have nests,</hi> &amp;c. Serpents, Apes, and Foxes, and all ſuch like miſchievous creatures, are obſerved to have very ſmal eyes; but the more innocent creatures, ſuch as Sheep, Oxen, &amp;c. have very large eyes; the Crow and the Fox are often ſeen to be together.

            <p n="17">17, The Fox feedeth upon dead carkaſſes; we find <hi>David</hi> curſing his enemies who had ſought for his ſoul, <hi>thoſe that ſeek my ſoul to destroy it, ſhall go into the lower parts of the earth, they ſhall fall by the ſword, they ſhall be a portion for Foxes.

from it; I ſhall for brevity ſake only tell the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus much, that the craftineſs and ſubtilty of the <hi>Fox,</hi> is an evidevt ſymbole and example of that craft and deceit which is in the Devil and all his agents; which how great it is in transforming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light, will be better altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitted, then briefly to ſpeak of, as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator once ſaid of <hi>Carthage:</hi> with what fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent expreſsions did he deceive our firſt Parents? with what ſubtilty did he tempt Chriſt himſelf? and how many cheats doth he put upon men dayly, but chiefly thoſe that think themſelves moſt ſecure? how eaſily doth he deceive Witches and Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? he telleth them how to bring a flood, how to make thunder, and he deſtroyeth theſe; nay he is not contented with this neither, but at their death he being not able to give that help which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, deſtroyeth both body and ſoul; <hi>Sampſon</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. 4. to get 300. <hi>Foxes,</hi> and to tye them together with firebrands at their tailes, and ſo ſent them into his enemies corn; ſome doubt how it could be done; for firſt, <hi>Sampſon</hi> could not get ſo many; and ſecondly, although he might get them, yet he could not tye firebrands to their tails; to both which I anſwer, that about the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea there are ſo many <hi>Foxes,</hi> as <hi>Aelian</hi> reporteth, that they will come into Towns and Cities in great companies, but doe no one any hurt, fawning upon every body; and as amongſt us we have ſo many Goats, that they will often get into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and pull down the Vines; So in <hi>Judaea,</hi> in old times, they were as much troubled with <hi>Foxes,</hi> as

            <head>Of the <hi>Cat.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN former times <hi>Cats</hi> were not ſo tame as to live in Houſes, and be familiar with us as they are now; for they uſed formerly to live only in Woods, and were exceeding cruel and venomous, making a prey of Foxes and Rabbets, &amp;c. but yet doubtleſs their nature was the ſame then as it is now; for <hi>God</hi> at the firſt creation gave every creature thoſe properties which afterwards it retained; but yet I do not deny, but that about <hi>Helvetia</hi> there are wild <hi>Cats</hi> now, and, as <hi>Conradus Geſner</hi> ſaith, are very good food; the <hi>Cat</hi> in former times was one of the <hi>Aegyptian Gods,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> telleth us, and <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 27 <hi>th.</hi> Book ſaith, that in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius</hi> there were above 7000 Romans ſlain in <hi>Aegypt</hi> for the killing of one <hi>Cat;</hi> but we will let this paſs: a <hi>Cat</hi> is not much unlike a <hi>Lion</hi> in his <hi>face,</hi> teeth, and claws, but his ears are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rounder; the wild <hi>Cats</hi> moſt commonly are grey, and are almoſt of the colour of ice; the tame <hi>Cat</hi> is of divers colours, but moſt commonly are grey; Cats eyes ſhine in a dark night, they can ſee to get mice in the darkeſt night; thus the <hi>Hyena</hi> and the Batt have their ſight the ſtrongeſt when it is dark, their eyes are obſerved to be bigger and leſſer according to the change of the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54366:80"/>
Moon; if he ſeeth a mouſe run by him, he will run after him whatever he is doing of, and thence came the Proverb, the <hi>Bride Cat,</hi> which <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> expoundeth thus, that if a <hi>Cat</hi> be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like a Bridegroom with rich attire, if he ſeeth a mouſe ſtir, though a Bride for attire, yet ſhe runneth after it, never minding her attire; thus are all ſpurious and falſe Miniſters; and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them to ſome Gentlemen that have been given to lewd courſes, but afterwards have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the office of the Miniſtry, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſame as they were before. 2. <hi>Aelian, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 40. ſaith, that <hi>the Male Cat is the leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſest creature that is,</hi> but the female not ſo bad, and very tender of her young ones; when the Male is thus inflamed with luſt, ſhe leaveth the Houſe, and wandereth up and down; the Male be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo leacherous, killeth all the young ones, that he may enjoy the female the ſooner; the male at that time is exceeding fierce, and oftentimes do wound one another in the night time, where we commonly hear them make ſuch noiſes; but ſome do ſay that the male is not more luſtful than the female, but that they are both alike, nay ſometimes the female will fight for the male. 3. <hi>A young Cat is very nimble,</hi> climbing over Houſes, and up into Trees, and if he ſeeth any thing to move upon the ground, he will leap upon it, he will play with any that he meeteth with; but when old, then he is as dull and lazie: <hi>Julius Caeſar Scaeliger</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>Malabar</hi> there are ſome Cats ſo nimble, that they will run as nimbly as a <hi>Squirrel.</hi> 4. <hi>He
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54366:80"/>
is exceedingly cleanly,</hi> he will often be licking of himſelf, not induring any bad ſcent, and therefore maketh a hole with her feet, and hideth her own excrements in the earth. <hi>Pliny</hi> telleth us the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, that ſhe might not diſcover to the nice where ſhe is. 5. <hi>At night ſhe will run into the darkeſt corners of the Houſe,</hi> having a very ſharp and acute ſight, and can better ſee in the night time than in the day; very intemperate in her diet, and often is diſtempered by over-much eating, and therefore ſeldome liveth long; ſhe loveth to lye near ovens, and in the chimney-corner, and often burneth herſelf, ſhe will alwaies lye clean and ſoft, &amp; will not leave the houſe that ſhe hath long lived though the houſe be left alone; not like the Dog, that loveth the people, and not the houſe; the breath of a <hi>Cat</hi> is very unwholſome, and the ſmell of his urine is very ſtrong, and therefore we uſe to ſay, that a <hi>Cat</hi> alwaies leaveth a ſtink behind him; he is naturally very hot, his skin is very warm, he being alwaies ſo hot, hath a bad ſcent about him; ſome cannot endure the breath of a <hi>Cat,</hi> and will ſmell it though they do not ſee him, and will ſweat untill he be removed out of the room, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mother, when big of that child, could not endure a <hi>Cat</hi> her ſelf; the <hi>Cat</hi> will light on his feet though he falleth a great height, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is hurt by any fall; if his skin be burned any where, he will not ſtir out of doors, but at other times will go about to ſhew himſelf: his breath is exceeding ſtrong and unwholſome (as we ſaid before) and therefore thoſe that let them lve
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54366:81"/>
with them in bed are ſeldome free from diſeaſes; he is a great enemie to ſerpents and toads; in time of ſickneſs he will carry the contagion about him; he hateth no creature more than mice, and will eaſily find them out by their ſmell, and will ſee them when they do not ſee him; and oftentimes when he hath got one, firſt he will play with it, and afterwards devour it: thus do they ſerve birds; he loveth fiſh, but cannot endure the water, and theſe are the moſt noted things that we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the <hi>Cat;</hi> and I know none that more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>Cat</hi> than Flatterers: For, 1. As it is <hi>a common creature,</hi> ſo there is no place free now from Slanderers and Back-biters. 2. As <hi>they creep into all corners and holes,</hi> thus do Tale-bearers prye and ſearch into all mens actions; and as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not perceive the ſtrong ſmell that cometh from them, thus Back-biters aggravate other mens faults, but hide their own, and as the <hi>Cat</hi> loveth to be handled and ſtroked on the head, thus Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers love thoſe that will give eare to their reports: as in the old time it was one of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> gods, ſo Back-biters and Flatterers are by too many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple honoured and loved; they, like the <hi>Cat,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come, leave a ſtrong ſcent behind them, and by the juſt judgement of God are often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

            <head>Of the <hi>Hare</hi> and <hi>Coney.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe <hi>Hare</hi> is generally known, and is very ſwift, and therefore ſome give the <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the word <hi>Lepus</hi> from <hi>levi-pes;</hi> he hath a very light round head, his ears are long, and but of a ſmall body, he never groweth fat, and never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but alwaies leapeth; his hair is as ſoft as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but the Fox hath a way to take him although he be ſo ſwift; when the Fox purſueth him, when he hath run after him a great way, he ſeemeth to give over purſuing him; the Hare perceiving of it, goeth on but very leaſurely, the Fox perceiving that, followeth him to his Burrough; the Hare can go up a Hill eaſier than he can go down, he is eaſier taken in a Valley than on a Hill; when he goeth down a Hill, he never goeth ſtraight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but windeth about; for his hinder feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing longer than his fore-feet, it is troubleſome for him to go down hill: his feet are very hairy, and cannot eaſily be hurt with running. 1. <hi>He is very timerous,</hi> as are all other creatures that have ſuch great hearts; (he is frighted at the ſhaking of a leafe) thoſe creatures that are ſtrong, as the Bull and Dog, have a lowd cry, but the Hart and Hare have a very ſmall cry: the Hare exceedingly fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Eagle,</hi> and is no leſs fearful of the ſnares
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54366:82"/>
of the Fox; there is no virtue in the Hare worth commendation; but inſtead of this, Nature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence them (as the Heathen Philoſophers ſay) hath given them very long ears, that they might the better perceive dangers approaching; and as ſoon as he feareth any danger, he flyeth ſo ſwiftly, that ſometimes in the midſt of his flight he dieth; he is ſo fearful, that oftentimes to avoid one dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he runneth into another; when he is purſued he runneth into his hole: It is reported of a <hi>Hare,</hi> that being hunted very hard, he ran into the Sea, and there was killed by the Sea-dog; no one would hunt a Hare with a Snail, according to the Dutch Proverb. It is a further argument of the timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Hare, that ſhe ſhunneth thoſe places that paſſengers come through, but loveth woods and hedges; <hi>Lyſander</hi> did well when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his men to be of good courage when they lay before <hi>Corinth,</hi> becauſe he ſaw a Hare running up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the walls; for, ſaith he, it cannot be that the <hi>Hare</hi> would be there, if they had ever uſed any military exerciſe upon them; and poſſibly from hence came that ſaying, that it is a bad ſign <hi>for a Hare to croſs us</hi> in the way; for it ſignifieth that thoſe places are very loneſome, and that few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frequent them, and ſo the more dangerous. 3. <hi>It hath a very weak and infirm ſight,</hi> he ſleepeth not as other creatures do with his eyes ſhut, and therefore of old, <hi>to live the life of a Hare,</hi> was as much as to ſay, you are in perpetual fear. 4. <hi>It is exceeding fruitful,</hi> and of all other creatures, this only after ſhe hath brought forth her young, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54366:82"/>
another; ſhe bringeth forth young, and yet continually is with young; whence <hi>Herodotus</hi> well obſerveth, that <hi>God</hi> hath ſo ordered it, that thoſe creatures which are uſeful and beneficial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankind, ſhould exceedingly increaſe; but on the other ſide, thoſe things that are ravenous and miſchievous, ſuch as are <hi>Lions, Bears,</hi> and <hi>Wolves,</hi> ſhould not increaſe ſo much; in old time it was thought, that thoſe that eat much <hi>Hares fleſh,</hi> it made them very fair, as <hi>Martial</hi> ſaith, and that it did in ſeven daies time, becauſe it is a kind of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy fleſh, and good blood; <hi>Martial</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore maketh the <hi>Hare</hi> to be the beſt of all four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed creatures;

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That a <hi>Hare</hi> ſhould make one beautiful, I know no reaſon can be given. 5. <hi>It is exceeding leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> but moſtly in <hi>January,</hi> when if ſhe be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the male, ſhe will devour thoſe young ones which ſhe had brought forth not long before. 6. <hi>She may in ſome reſpects be ſaid to be crafty;</hi> for in the Winter time ſhe is alwaies in plowed fields, but in Harveſt time ſhe hideth her ſelf in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and after Harveſt, when the Grapes begin
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54366:83"/>
to grow ripe, ſhe leaveth the Vineyards; when ſhe goeth to ſeek her food, ſhe alwaies goeth and cometh the ſame way, but not in a ſtraight line, but in ſeveral turnings and windings; ſhe ſeldome goeth amongſt the thorns, leſt it ſhould tear her hair; for the dogs by the ſcent of her hair would ſoon diſcover her: when ſhe bringeth forth her young, ſhe hideth them up and down in ſeveral places, and of all enemies ſhe feareth the <hi>Hawk</hi> moſt, and continually when hunted windeth up and down, and ſo deceiveth the dogs; we do not hunt the <hi>Hare</hi> for any hurt it doth us, but as we uſe to ſay, <hi>the Hare is hunted for her fleſh,</hi> from whence came the Proverb, <hi>As ſafe as a Hare,</hi> ſpoken of one who had riches, &amp;c. for which only he was vexed and troubled by others: Neither is the <hi>Hare</hi> of an uncertain Sex, ſometimes male and ſometimes fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, as ſome have falſly imagined, but it is alwaies the ſame.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coney</hi> is not much unlike the <hi>Hare,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, but much ſtronger, alwaies being under the earth, and makes her burroughs ſometimes under mountains, as <hi>Martial</hi> ſaith;

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54366:83"/>
cometh out of her burrough, and there ſhe ſits at the entrance of it, to ſee if there be any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger; and if at any time ſhe be cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, and hath no way to eſcape, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately runs into her burrough, out of which there is no way to get her, but by ſending a <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> after her; for there is nothing which the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> hateth more than the <hi>Ferret;</hi> there is ſuch plenty of them in ſome parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have deſtroyed the <hi>Harveſt:</hi> Nay, we read of the Iſland called <hi>Carpathia,</hi> that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were once deſtroyed by them; and <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> (quoted by <hi>Pliny)</hi> ſaith, that there was a City in <hi>Spain</hi> undermined by <hi>Coneys:</hi> but what we ſaid before concerning the <hi>Hare,</hi> that it might be compared to timerous and cowardly men, we may ſay the like concerning the <hi>Coney;</hi> the Fable of the <hi>Hares</hi> and the <hi>Lion</hi> is known, how that the Hares would have given Laws to the <hi>Lion,</hi> who afterwards were deſtroyed by him; which may ſignifie thus much to us, that oftentimes mild and timerous Princes do rule and govern a fierce and war-like people, by whom their Kingdome is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overthrown; or elſe it may ſignifie thoſe men who are afraid to tell men of their faults: the <hi>Germans</hi> have a <hi>Proverb, Ber haſen Spurng,</hi> i. e. <hi>The anckle of an Hare,</hi> meaning any thing that men truſt to, or relye upon; for the <hi>Anckle-bone</hi> in the <hi>Hare</hi> is that without which ſhe could not leap: but by the way we ſhall ſpeak to <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 21. 25, 26. <hi>there are four things which are upon the earth, but are exceeding wiſe; the Ants are a people

not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the Coneys are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houſes in the Rocks; the Locuſts have no King, yet go they forth all of them by Bands; the Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings Palaces;</hi> by all which this wiſe King ſignifyeth to us, the great inadvertency and perverſeneſs of mankind, who of all creatures is only able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his waies, and knoweth his own greatneſs and ſtrength, and yet daily runneth into dangers: theſe four ſorts of little creatures that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake of in the forecited place, though ſmall, yet know their own weakneſs, and therefore chuſe alwaies thoſe places where they may be moſt ſecure; and will not go into any place where there may be a poſſibility of danger: the <hi>Ants</hi> begin betimes to lay up food for Winter: the <hi>Hare</hi> being timerous, doth not love to be in thoſe places where any one cometh: the <hi>Locuſt</hi> being weak, liveth quietly, and doth not go where any one is in the place, knowing that it cannot ſo well avoid dangers: the <hi>Spider</hi> is alwaies exerciſing her curious art; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is to be wiſer than the wiſeſt. 1.

His craftineſs is more than his cruelty; for thoſe beaſts which have horns, ſhe cometh upon them, and beginneth at their tail, leſt by his horns he might be too hard for him; he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten filleth his belly with earth, which maketh him more ponderous, and not ſo eaſily to be deſtroyed: he alwaies obſerveth this, never to go for his prey but in the night, or early in the morning, a little before day, that ſo he might not be ſeen by man or beaſt, by which means he alſo avoideth all ſnares and ginns that are laid for him: his eyes ſhine in the night, and do as it were ſparkle in the dark; his ſight is very ſtrong, ſeeing very exactly in the darkeſt night. 3. <hi>He hath a great hatred to

man,</hi> which appeareth in this; if a <hi>Wolf</hi> ſeeth a man firſt, he is not able to ſpeak; and on the other ſide, if a man firſt eſpyeth a Wolf, immediately he becometh tame, and hath nothing of fierceneſs or cruelty in him; the reaſon of which ſome have enquired into, who tell us it proceedeth from the hot, fiery ſpirit of the <hi>Wolf;</hi> that, they tell us, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the man; how true it is I know not, but <hi>Camerarius</hi> telleth us it is altogether fabulous, in his <hi>Succiſ.

Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Camerarius,</hi> in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place ſaith, That a <hi>Wolf</hi> hath not ſuch a fear of wood and iron as of ſtone, which appeareth in this, that if a ſtone touch him, where it is touched, that part ſhall rot and putrefie; and therefore it is that he flyeth from the noiſe of ſtones; as a dog is ſooner frighted with a ſtone than a ſword: if once he getteth amongſt the ſheep, he will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill as much as he can eat, but it he be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, will deſtroy the whole flock. 5. When he is extreme hungry, he will eat earth; he never hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for his prey where his young ones are, leſt they ſhould be diſcovered, for he hath a very great care of, and love for his young ones; and is very fierce when big with young: in all dangers ſhe betaketh her ſelf to flight before it be too late, and taketh her young ones with her into the woods; if ſhe goeth to the ſheep-fold, ſhe alwaies goeth againſt the wind, becauſe if ſhe ſhould go with the wind, it would carry her ſcent to the dogs; if ſhe loſe her feet in a ſnare, or one of them, ſhe tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſelf for vexation, and is mad that ſhe is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54366:86"/>
taken. 6. He is very fearful of ſtones, if he heareth the noiſe of ſtones, immediately he runneth away into the woods; nay, he will ſwim over rivers, which they do in companies, the hindermoſt taking hold of the tail of the foremoſt. 7. If he eſpyeth a Goat, he hideth himſelf among green boughes that he may not be ſeen; when he is exceeding hungry, he will yawn and open his mouth; and if he can get nothing, he walketh with his mouth open: Wolves may be fitly compared to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way men, who go in companies. At <hi>Atticu</hi> a Province in <hi>Greece</hi> there was a Law made, that whoſoever killed a young <hi>Wolf,</hi> ſhould be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a talent of ſilver; but he that killed an old one, ſhould have two talents; for they are great enemies to man; though the voung ones did never do any miſchief, yet they did what they could to kill them, to prevent the miſchiefs that they might do for the future: Adulterers and Whoremongers are often puniſhed by God with want and poverty, and thence it is that they are often forced to rob and ſteal to keep themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; and therefore we may not unfitly compare Adulterers and Wolves together; and therefore it is that Harlots are called Wolves; ſo <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> were nouriſhed by a <hi>Wolf,</hi> that is, a Harlot, they being baſtards themſelves: if the Reader hath a mind to ſee more of it, let him read <hi>Lactant.

               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:54366:86"/>
between the Sheep and the Wolf, that is plainly ſeen while alive, and when dead; for the ſheep-skin that the Wolf biteth, is afterwards full of lice; and I have heard that the guts of ſheep made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fiddle-ſtrings, will never tune with the ſtrings made of Wolves guts; if Wolves skins lye among ſheep-skins, they will be utterly ſpoyled; and if a Drum that is covered with a Wolves skin come neer a Drum that is covered with a ſheep-skin, it will preſently flye in pieces; but for the reaſon and truth of it, I ſhall further enquire when I come to ſpeak of the ſheep. 11. They are very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of fire, and cannot endure to ſee a ſword, and therefore ſome alwaies carry flints about them, and when they ſee a Wolf they ſtrike fire, which when he ſeeth, he flyeth away; the like he doth at the ſight of a naked ſword. 12.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54366:87"/>
of the field to his houſe; ſo that the fierceſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are be mindful of kindneſſes done to them; a <hi>VVolf</hi> when his belly is full, if among a flock of ſheep, ſeemeth rather to be a lamb than a <hi>VVolf. Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>that in a certain place in</hi> Greece, <hi>the VVolf will couple with the dog:</hi> when a company of Wolves have gotten a prey, they will equally divide what they have got; ſometimes the Wolf and the dog will plot as it were together to go into a ſheep-fold; She hateth the Bull, the Hart, the Fox, and the Goat; it hath all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and qualities of a <hi>Lion,</hi> he exceedeth the Lion in craft and deceitfulneſs; that creature which <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith is begotten of a Stag and a Wolf, which ſome call a <hi>Los</hi> or a <hi>Lynx,</hi> is a kind of <hi>VVolf;</hi> it beareth an inveterate enmity to the <hi>Hart,</hi> and thence it is that in Latin he is called <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Cervarius,</hi> and for his ravenous and greedy nature cometh not behind the VVolf; nay, he will kill a VVolf, and hath been ſeen to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a young Lion; when he is hungry, and is eating, if he looketh back, he forgetteth that he hath any thing, and goeth to look after another prey: there is a beaſt like a VVolf who hath a mane like a horſe, whom ſome call a <hi>Hyaena,</hi> he will go into graves, and devour dead bodies, a fit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation and ſymbole of thoſe ſlanderers which do not ſpare to deſtroy the good name of their neighbour after he is dead. A VVolf will go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſheep in the night time, and will learn thoſe tones that the ſhepherds uſe to them; nay, they will learn the ſhepherds name, and will call
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54366:87"/>
them out by their names; the ſhepherd thinking it to be the voice of a man, cometh forth, and when he is come out, the Wolf falleth upon him, and deſtroyeth him; ſo ſhe often ſerveth dogs: Thus the Papiſts uſed to let Book-ſellers ſell here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Books, and then mark what Noble men did buy of them, and afterwards accuſe them for it. The female <hi>Hyaena</hi> is much craftier than the male, for it was never yet found where ſhe lyeth at night; whatſoever ſhe toucheth is made dull and ſtupid ever after. <hi>Philippus Camerarius, Suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As the <hi>VVolf</hi> continually goeth about to deſtroy men and beaſts, ſo is the Devil the moſt implacable enemie to all mankind. 2. As the <hi>VVolf</hi> by nature is ſo greedy and ravenous that he can never be ſatisfied, ſo neither is the Devil ever ſatisfied with thoſe millions of ſouls that he yearly deſtroyeth. 3. The <hi>VVolf</hi> hath a ſharp and acute ſight, ſeeing beſt in the night time; and they ſay of her that ſhe can ſmell her prey when ſhe is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54366:88"/>
half a Germane mile from him: Thus the Devil by ſo many years experience groweth more ſubtil, eaſily perceiving to what ſins every mans natural inclination leadeth him unto. 4. As they will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times devour a whole ſheep, ſometimes only ſome part of it; ſo doth the Devil, by divine permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſometimes take away our eſtates only, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our health; nay, ſometimes deſtroyeth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul. 5. As the <hi>Wolf</hi> is a moſt crafty, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning creature; ſo is the Devil full of his crafty and ſubtil devices; for as the <hi>Wolf</hi> chiefly ſeeketh her prey in a clowdy night, being then not ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived: ſo the Devil maketh his aſſaults, and tempteth men chiefly when under ſome heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; and as the <hi>Wolf</hi> goeth ſlowly, and often licketh her feet, which maketh her ſteps not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily heard; ſo the Devil inſinnuateth himſelf into men, darting his tentations as inſenſibly as the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams. <hi>Goats</hi> cannot defend themſelves by the weapons which nature hath given them; neither can <hi>Sowes</hi> keep their pigs from any one that will take them away from her; therefore the <hi>Wolf</hi> when ſhe goeth to take any of theſe, taketh them by the ear, and if he cometh not forward willingly, he ſtriketh them with his tail; ſometimes he maketh them run faſter than himſelf, and ſo he leadeth them by the eare to the reſt of his company, who ſtand in a certain place expecting the prey; and when he hath brought it, the reſt of them fall on, and tear it in pieces. <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith that he ſaw a <hi>Wolf</hi> catry a green willow in his mouth to deceive the Goats that love a ſprig of a Willow-tree; than
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54366:88"/>
which there cannot be a fitter repreſentation of <hi>Sathans</hi> malice and ſubtilty, whereby he entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and enſnareth poor ſilly people, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw them from the truth, by ſuggeſting his tentations and flattering devices, thereby drawing them into eternal deſtruction. The <hi>Wolf</hi> uſeth no leſs ſubtilty in taking of the Bull; for ſhe never ſetteth upon him forwards, leſt he ſhould kill her by his horns, but cometh behind him, leaping upon him (as we ſaid before) filling her belly with earth, which maketh her the heavier, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up her weakneſs by her weight; ſhe taketh a ſingle calf thus, ſhe draweth him away from the Cow, which ſhe perceiving, it cauſeth a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between the Cow and the Wolf for a time, the calf in the mean time running up and down; when he hath tired the Cow, then he goeth to the calf, and teareth him in pieces: thus in like manner doth the Devil ſet on young and old, ſuiting his temptations to their conſtitutions and inclinations; and oftentimes by the force of his temptations, and of thoſe aſflictions which oftentimes godly men lye under (were they not endued with faith and ſtrength from above) would vanquiſh and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; but when by ſtrength he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he doth as it were come behind them by his fraud and deceit, and then beginneth a little to fall back, as if he were overcome, and ſo maketh him the leſs wary of him, thinking he is gone; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cometh on afreſh with his new wiles with a greater violence, and ſo deſtroyeth them; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances and examples of this might be given;
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54366:89"/>
but I ſhall proceed. 6. If a <hi>Wolf</hi> firſt eſpyeth a man, he doth by a ſecret virtue ſo aſtoniſh him, that he cannot cry out for help: thus the Devil, when by his tentations he beſetteth a careleſs ſinner, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obtaineth the victory, triumphing over him when conquered; but on the other ſide, if a man firſt eſpyeth a <hi>Wolf,</hi> he is not ſo fierce nor rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous as before: thus good men who are afraid of <hi>Sathans</hi> devices, who by prayer and other holy duties arm themſelves againſt him, do as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright him, and make him fly; and as Wolves hate nothing more than the ſight of fire, and of a naked ſword; ſo doth the Devil no leſs dread thoſe ſparks of divine light that come from the Scripture, and the prayers of good men, which are the arms and weapons of the Church; and therefore St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> rightly ſaid, <hi>that ſwords are not ſo terrible to</hi> Wolves, <hi>as are the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of good men to Sathan.</hi>

that are a kind of Goats, which are ſwifter than any of the former; for they go to hunt early in the morning, and do as it were leap upon their prey with an incredible violence; theſe are found in great companies upon Mountains; in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time they are ſo venturous, that they will come into Cities, and there will go up and down very quietly untill they can ſee a Goat, &amp;c. which they will greedily fall upon, and run away with; this may ſeem to have reſpect to that Propheſie of the <hi>Patriarch, Gen.</hi> 49. 27. <hi>Benjamin ſhall ravine like a Wolf, in the morning he ſhall devour the prey, and at evening he ſhall divide the ſpoyle;</hi> although ſome would have this to ſignifie the covetouſneſs of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> yet I can ſee no reaſon for it, becauſe they were not ſo cruel; and beſides, what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could that be of their covetouſneſs, who though they took their prey in the morning, yet he divided it again at night: the Holy Fathers therefore do make this to be a prediction concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Holy Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamine;</hi> for he in the morning, that is in his youth, was like a cruel and devouring Wolf; but at the evening, towards his old age, he gave food, the bread of life, which he diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Heathens; theſe things being premiſed, any one, from what hath been ſaid, may deduce very uſeful corollaries, ſuch as theſe. 1. The <hi>Wolf</hi> is ſaid to aſtoniſh a man ſo much, that he taketh away his voice and ſpeech; thus wicked men do rob the Saints of their wonted purity, yet they will talk of great things; for alwaies amongſt
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54366:90"/>
wicked men there is more ſeeming Religion than true piety; and as the <hi>Wolf</hi> is of ſo ravenous and greedy nature that he killeth more than he can eat; and if not hindred, will deſtroy the whole flock: ſo wicked men do not ſo much ſeek the hurts and ruine of one particular man, as of the whole Church; and as the <hi>Wolf</hi> is very ſubtil and crafty, firſt going very ſlowly round about the flock, to ſee whether the ſhepherd, or any dogs be there; and when he ſeeth his opportunity, will ruſh among them with a great deal of fierceneſs: thus Hereticks, before they diſcloſe their errors, will inſinuate themſelves into the minds of the people, and will uſe a great deal of hypocritical piety, boaſting of their angelical holyneſs and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar viſions which they have from God, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have thus prepared the minds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, vent their impious errors that tend to the ruine of the whole Church, and as there is a natural enmity and antipathy between the ſheep and the Wolf even after death: thus wicked men by their doctrine do not hurt the Church only while alive, but after death: there is a Law among the <hi>Atticks,</hi> that whoſoever killeth a Wolf ſhall be highly rewarded; of no leſs praiſe are they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that do diſcover the plots and devices of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> and Deceivers: the <hi>VVolf</hi> if he cannot get the prey that he ſought, he runneth up and down with his mouth open, making a great noiſe; thus are Hereticks very much troubled if their ſnare do not take as they would have them.</p>

What <hi>Hereticks</hi> are in the Church, that are Tyrants in the Common-wealth; and therefore they are called by ſome <hi>Aethiopian VVolves;</hi> the Poets do feign Tyrannical Princes for their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to be changed into Wolves: we read, in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> of Princes that are like ravening Wolves devouring the prey, <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. 27. the ſame is ſaid <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 3. 3.

            <head>Of the <hi>Dog.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis is a creature more commonly known than any we have yet ſpoken of, and hath many good properties in him; fidelity, love to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, conſtancy, vigilancy, obedience, ſagacity and memory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is more faithful than a ſervant, watching in the night, and like a Porter keeping the doors, and gives notice by his barking of any thief or ſtranger; and therefore the Proverb is true, That the <hi>Dog hath nine lives,</hi> but,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Amongſt all other creatures, there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſo much love to his Maſter as the <hi>Dog,</hi> alwaies going along with him, knowing his voice, and will find him out by his ſcent; if his Maſter be killed, he will not leave his Garkaſs, but will
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54366:91"/>
betray the Murtherer if he ſeeth him, barking at him, and faſtning upon him, fighting for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter againſt any one that ſhall aſſault him: <hi>Plutarch</hi> relateth a ſtory of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who in a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney found a <hi>Dog</hi> who for three whole daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lay by his Maſter that was murthered, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eating any thing all that while; afterwards he found out the murtherer by flying on him, who being examined confeſſed the fact.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is very conſtant to any houſe where he is kept, and will not follow any one that ſhall entice him away: <hi>Jovius</hi> relateth of the Dogs in <hi>France</hi> that fled into the enemies Camp, and licked their feet, which they took to ſignifie their Victory, which afterwards came to paſs; for thereupon <hi>Maximilianus Sphorſia</hi> vanquiſhed the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Their vigilancy is known to all, although <hi>Geeſe</hi> are more watchful than they; and thence the <hi>French</hi> entring into <hi>Rome,</hi> were not diſturbed at the Dogs, but were betrayed by the noiſe of a company of Geeſe; and therefore once every year ſeveral Dogs were ſlain, becauſe they gave no notice of the enemies approaching.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No leſs is his prudence and ſagacity, being no leſs fierce and rough to ſtrangers than he is courteous to his Maſter: but he is eſpecially an enemie to any one that he ſeeth come in a poor habit; for he knoweth theſe do but rob him of what he ſhould have. Among all birds the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and of all four-footed beaſts the <hi>Dog</hi> hath the beſt ſmell; and therefore <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith he hath ſo quick a ſcent, that if you cut a piece of a dead
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54366:92"/>
               <hi>Dog</hi> amongſt ſeveral ſorts of meats, he will ſcent it from all the reſt, and will not touch it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He is as obedient as he is conſtant or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; he will learn to do any thing, he will go into the Shambles, and fetch meat, pluck hairs off from ones head, &amp;c. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that in a Comedy acted at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſaw a <hi>Dog</hi> that feigned his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> had poyſoned him, and as ſoon as he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, all his body would ſhake and tremble, but that would abate by degrees, and at laſt would ſtretch himſelf, and never move at all; his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cometh to him, and biddeth him riſe, he then hearing him ſtirreth one part, and then another, untill at laſt he came to himſelf again; all which he did ſo cunningly, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> and all the reſt of the Spectators were moved with no leſs laughter than admiration; not long after that he would draw himſelf up altogether, as if he were going to dye, and would lye without any motion at all, ſuffering himſelf to be dragged out by the heels, as if he had been dead; but in a little while after he recovered himſelf again, to the admiration of the Spectators; when he is hunting, or at any other time he will come at his Maſters call, although he hath a good prey before him; he hath a greater reſpect for his Maſter than for himſelf, his actions are all for the good of his Maſter; when he is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he will bring the prey to his Maſter, and he himſelf is content with the bones, nay, is content without them, if his Maſter will not give them him.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:54366:92"/>
7. He hath a very ſtrong memory, inſomuch that he will remember the way to his Maſters houſe, though through Woods and Lands, and will remember thoſe perſons a long time that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him: he will lay up thoſe bones that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat, and fetch them out again when he hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for them; when he is aſleep in the night he will remember what he hath ſeen in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; and therefore it is we often hear them bark in their ſleep when no body is nigh them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He is very careful of his whelps, and will ſuffer no one to take them away from him; he loveth to be among company, but as timerous when among ſtrangers, as he is bold among his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He hath a kind of ambitious deſire; for <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that Dogs, if they get a hare alive, beſmear their mouths with the blood of it; this they do not do if they run her dead, then they will not touch her, but ſtand about it wagging their tails, to ſignifie that they rejoyce not ſo much in the fleſh of it, as in the Victory; <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that it is a ſign of an <hi>Heroick</hi> ſpirit in Dogs, that if any one lyeth upon the ground, they will not meddle with them; and the <hi>Scholiast</hi> upon <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, that it is the beſt way to ſecure our ſelves againſt Dogs, to ſit down and hide our ſticks; and we may adde further, that as the deepeſt Rivers make the leaſt noiſe, ſo, fearful Dogs will bark more than they will bite.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A <hi>Dog</hi> cannot endure to ſee the Moon, and are very much afrighted at a <hi>Spectrum</hi> or appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54366:93"/>
and therefore when the Moon ſhines, Dogs be continually barking.</p>
            <p n="11">11. When they grow old they are very dull and heavy; they then will ſleep in the dirt, and the flies oftentimes will eat through their ears, which they might eaſily prevent, yet are ſo lazie that they will not, unleſs they come upon their face, and then they ſnap them in their mouthes.</p>
            <p n="12">12. They cannot hunt if the South-wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for that is the moiſteſt of all the four winds, and all moiſture hindereth the ſmelling: in <hi>Egypt</hi> the Dogs are ſo ſubtil, that becauſe they know the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> oftentimes devour them, they will not ſtand ſtill when they drink, but drink as they run; and therefore the Proverb is, <hi>Canis ad Nilum, i. e.</hi> a ſup and away; juſt as many men learn Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; but on the other ſide, they have their ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as well as their good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is a very filthy, uncleane creature, coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf publickly in the ſtreets; and hath a very greedy ſtomach after his meat, and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loveth carrion; he ſatisfieth his luſt with the Bitch that puppyed him. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. <hi>God forbids that any money ſhould be brought for the price of a Dog into the houſe of the Lord, verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is eaſily angered, and will be ſoon enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at a ſtone or a ſtick that is thrown at him. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his <hi>Sympoſ.</hi> ſaith, that ſome Dogs have died becauſe they could not take their revenge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They cannot endure one another; one Dog will not ſuffer another to come to the houſe, yet they will eat one anothers vermine.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:54366:93"/>
4. Some dogs ſleep all the night-time, and go about in the day, theſe are very miſchievous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Dog will eat his own vomit, and is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many Diſeaſes, but eſpecially they are apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to grow mad; and when they are ſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they bite they make like themſelves: it is a ſign when a Dog will grow mad, if he will not eat what he uſed to eat, and will purge at the noſe and mouth, and is very dull and heavy, barking at every one they ſee; <hi>Heſychias</hi> ſaith, that all dogs have very hard deaths; and thus we have ſhewn both the good and the bad properties of the Dog; the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, draw many inferences from the nature of this creature, which, although they be very many, yet I ſhall ſatisfie my ſelf, in ſpeaking to two only, one out of the Old Teſtament, and another out of the New; that out of the Old Teſtament, is <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 5. when <hi>Gideon</hi> had brought a vaſt Army againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> leſt if the Jews had overcome them they ſhould have aſcribed it to their own ſtrength and valour, the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Gideon, Every one that lappeth the water with his tongue as the Dog lappeth, him ſhalt thou ſet by himſelf; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink: there were left but</hi> 300 of 20000. and thoſe few were crowned with victory; a fit <hi>Symbole</hi> of the Elect, who get the victory over all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and thoſe that drank water, repreſent thoſe that received the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and ſo are liſted among Gods Souldiers. 1. As there were a great multitude which drank, yet were rejected
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54366:94"/>
by <hi>Gideon,</hi> being a great ſign of lazineſs and ſloath; ſo, many of thoſe who are baptized, are rejected; which being careleſs and ſloathful, do not <hi>fight the good fight, nor keep the faith,</hi> and therefore loſe the Crown, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. 2. As <hi>Gideon</hi> received thoſe only into the number of his Souldiers, that lapped of the water with his mouth as the Dog lappeth; a ſign of fortitude and valour: ſo, thoſe who were baptized, carry away the heavenly crown, being not addicted to this World, but diligent and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their calling; and, like Dogs, are faithful and induſtrious in ſearching out divine myſteries, being lovers of Chriſt, knowing his voice; neither will they be drawn from Chriſt through the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Sathan, being very watchful, and like the wiſe Virgins, alwaies expecting the coming of Chriſt, very courteous to their kinsfolks, but are fierce and unpleaſant to thoſe who are ſtrangers and enemies to Chriſt; they do alſo every thing to the honour of their Maſter Chriſt, though no temporal advantage ſhould from thence acrew, who laſtly are eaſily called back from a courſe of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We read <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. there are ſeveral inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces drawn from the Dog, ſome of which ſeem to be ſpoken in his commendation, and others not. Thus, when the <hi>Syrophaenician</hi> woman, whoſe daughter was ſore vexed with a Devil, came to Chriſt and implored his help, received this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that <hi>it was not good to take the childrens bread, and caſt it unto Dog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54366:94"/>
eat of the crumbs that fall from their Maſters table;</hi> in which words Chriſt compareth the Heathen to Dogs: For, 1. We ſee that Dogs will couple with any ſtrange Bitch; thus, the <hi>Heathens</hi> were not like all other men, born in ſin only, but of thoſe Parents who made nothing of the ordinance of Marriage; this might be confirmed from many examples; thus the <hi>Apoſile, Rom.</hi> 1. 26. complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>that the Women changed the natural uſe into that which is againſt nature; as alſo the men leaving the natural uſe of Women turned in their luſt one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another.</hi> 2. They commonly bark at any paſſenger that cometh by, and a <hi>mad Dog</hi> will flye upon his <hi>own Maſter:</hi> thus, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of divine light, and without the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do blaſpheme God, and, as it were bark at their Neighbours, by curſing of them. We do not uſe to feed <hi>Dogs</hi> with any thing but what is not fit for others to eat; the Heathens being ſo wicked and blaſphemous againſt <hi>God,</hi> are not worthy of Chriſt. Further, Dogs do not uſe to run from their Maſters, if they can but get food; the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as long as they proſper in this World, are very well contented, but when under trouble and afflictions, have nothing to ſupport them: Dogs are of ſuch a beaſtly nature, that (as we ſaid before) they will devour their own vomit: thus it is with the Heathens, who, though often inſtructed in vertue by divers of their <hi>Poets,</hi> yet ſoon return unto their former wicked life; thus, having ſpoken what is neceſſary for his diſcommendation, now, I ſhall ſee what may be ſaid to his praiſe and commendation.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54366:95"/>
1. Dogs only wait at their Maſters table, expecting what may fall; thus, the ignorant <hi>Gentiles</hi> had no other comfort but this, that they ſhould expect what God had promiſed them, ſaying, <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed;</hi> neither did they deſire to be preferred above the <hi>Jews,</hi> but were very well content with what the bounty and goodneſs of God did give them: Children often ſport themſelves with little dogs, hence it is that we read, in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> (i. e. the ſon of God) <hi>ſporting her ſelf among the ſons of men;</hi> and we ſee that children take great care of Dogs, and will feed them if they can get it; the Heathens did continue long in their primitive ignorance and ſtate of darkneſs untill Chriſt came and deliver'd them; Dogs will bemoan themſelves when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of their whelps; and it is the greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good men to ſee their children drawn aſide from the truth; although, I muſt confeſs, Dogs as well as moſt other beaſts have a great love for their young; yet, I doubt, we may find ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who, like fiſhes, leave their ſpawn in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, never minding it afterwards what becomes of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 He will not leave off barking and howling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till his Maſter give him ſomething: thus, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh</hi> woman, and every true Chriſtian, ought to be conſtant, perſevering in duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Alſo the Dog will be ſo fierce that he will flye upon any ſtranger, yet when corrected by his Maſter, will hang down his tail: thus all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, when in peril and trouble, will cry out with

That <hi>Ram</hi> which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offered in the Mount, inſtead of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> was a Type of <hi>Christ;</hi> for, as the <hi>Ram</hi> was ſlain for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> was offered up inſtead of us; every day (as I ſaid before) were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up two Lambs, beſides all other ſacrifices which ſometimes did require Lambs and Sheep, as in the conſecration of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as alſo on their <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>New Moons,</hi> and at the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Feaſtivals,</hi> as alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Confeſſions, Purifications, &amp;c. of which we may read at large in <hi>Exodus, Leviticus,</hi> and ſeveral other places, all which were but <hi>types</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> as they are called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.

They ſeem to have a great love to their Shepherds; for nature hath made them ſo cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly and weak, that they cannot live without ſome one to rule over them. A Shepherd hath eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally theſe four things to do for the Sheep;</p>
            <p n="1">1. To lead them into good Paſtures, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome clear Waters; for a <hi>Sheep</hi> loveth green Meadows, and is very delicate; for if ſhe cannot feed in ſuch green Meadows, ſhe will eat nothing at all; and counteth no labour loſt if at laſt ſhe getteth into a field that is green, and then ſhe looketh about for cold, clear water, loving nothing more, not induring to drink of muddy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Shepherd is to keep them together, leſt by their ſimplicity and fooliſhneſs they ſhould ſtray from the flock, and run into ditches and fens where they are deſtroyed without remedy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is to defend them by his Dogs againſt Wolves, or any one that ſhall diſturb them when feeding: when any of them is with young, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them up upon his knees, and cheriſheth them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He is to underſtand and know the ſigns and cauſes of their diſeaſes; all good Shepherds
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54366:97"/>
ought to be thus qualified. When the Sheep hear the Shepherds voice, they all get together into one place, but eſpecially when he ſingeth, for they love muſick exceedingly, and it maketh them feed the better; they are ſo delighted with it, that ſome think they would not live long if the Shepherd did not ſing: the young Lambs as ſoon as brought forth know their Damms, though there be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Sheep in the field together, yet they will know their Damm from them all by their bleating; and though they be never ſo hungry and thirſty, yet will they ſuck of no one but of their own Dam; and the Damm, amongſt hundred of Lambs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of the ſame bigneſs, colour, and make the ſame noiſe, yet they will know their own Lambs; this they do while young, but when once they come to be weaned, they know the Shepherds voice ſo well, that they will follow him, and flye from any one elſe; the <hi>Scripture</hi> reckoneth this amongſt thoſe creatures that cleave the Hoof, and chew the Cud, of which we have ſpoken very largely before: He loveth to eat of green willow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves though they be very bitter: ſalt getteth them a great ſtomach, and therefore the Shepherd will oftentimes ſprinkle ſalt in the water where they uſe to drink. The <hi>Sheep</hi> is obſerved to be very cleanly, and cannot endure, like the ſwine, to be in dirty places; there is ſcarce any thing in the <hi>Sheep</hi> but is of uſe to us, ſhe giveth milk, bringeth forth lambs, we make cloath of her wool, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly her skin was worn for garments, of her guts are made fiddle-ſtrings, and her dung maketh the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54366:98"/>
ground fruitful; they bring forth young as long as they live, and are never barren, though not ſo long liv'd as ſome other creatures: but to conclude, ſhe will never go into water unleſs compelled, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth company, and will not be alone if ſhe can get to her fellows; hath alwaies the ſame bleating when hungry as when full; whereas men do not more rejoyce in proſperity, than they are caſt down in adverſity: And thus I have briefly run over the principal properties of the <hi>Sheep,</hi> from whence the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> draweth many uſeful inferences from the nature of this creature; we read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>I lifted up mine eyes, and ſaw, and behold there ſtood before the river a Ram which had two horns, and the two horns were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up laſt: I ſaw the Ram puſhing weſtward, and northward, and ſouthward;</hi> ſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7 <hi>th.</hi> there was the viſion of a <hi>Bear,</hi> by which we are to underſtand the fierceneſs, and ambitious deſires that were in thoſe Kings, like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuerus,</hi> who by the inſtigation of <hi>Haman</hi> did intend to deſtroy all the <hi>Jews</hi> in one day; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he became as mild as a <hi>Ram;</hi> which, as he is even loaden with his horns, his fleſh, and wooll, ſo, the <hi>Perſian Monarch</hi> did abound in all mauner of wealth, and it had two horns, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> with which he did <hi>push,</hi> as it were troubling and tormenting the <hi>Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> which uſed to be eaten at the Paſsover, is a fit <hi>Symbole</hi> of the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with which we are fed at his holy table; and doubtleſs, it did alſo ſignifie unto us, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, Patience and Meekneſs that was in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for the whole life and death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued example of humility and patience; and his death was of great advantage to us, <hi>in whoſe mouth was found no guile;</hi> &amp; he truly might be ſaid to <hi>bear our infirmities,</hi> who was throughly tri'd in all things; the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us by the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> but thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was ſlain towards even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lamb of God ſuffered not for us in the firſt ages of the World, but ſome thouſands of years after the fall, to exerciſe the faith of good men, and then <hi>in the fulneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was uſed to be taken from among the flock; <hi>Chriſt took not on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> and ſo became the Captain, and Shepherd of his Sheep.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was to be a male of a year old, without ſpot or blemiſh; <hi>Chriſt</hi> was perfect man, but yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to divers infirmities, though without ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The blood of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was to be ſprinkled on the door-poſt; thus is the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel ſprinkled on the hearts of men.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It was to be eaten with unleavened bread; <hi>Christ</hi> never doth that man good that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into a pure heart.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It was to be eaten with <hi>bitter herbs,</hi> by which was ſignified to us thoſe many afflictions and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that the <hi>Christians</hi> were to undergo.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As there uſed to be but one <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> in a houſe, ſo was there but one <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was King both of Jew and Gentile.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That which remained of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was not to be kept, but to be burned, to ſignifie to

            <p n="11">11. The blood of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> which was ſprinkled on the door-poſts, was a means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Jews</hi> from deſtruction, but was no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit at all to the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in like manner doth not profit us, unleſs we have true faith, and ſhew it forth by our works: finally, the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was to be eaten in haſte, with their loyns girt; and poor people that could not kill a <hi>Lamb</hi> of their own, were to go to their neighbours, and eat it with them: thoſe likewiſe that do eat of the body of Chriſt, ought not to be dull and ſluggiſh, nor of diſſolute and wicked lives, but courteous and charitable to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 15. a <hi>Ram</hi> was to be offered at the conſecration of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> from whence we may learn, that as the blood of the <hi>Ram</hi> was to be poured on the <hi>right eare;</hi> ſo ought we to hear the word of God, for faith cometh by hearing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was to be poured upon the right eare, and not on the left, which intimateth unto us thus much, that our faith ought not to be feigned, but ſincere.</p>

               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:54366:100"/>
3. The bloud was to be ſprinkled upon the thumb of the right hand of the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> it doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to hear the word of God, but we muſt ſet our hand to the Plough; for the Kingdome of God conſiſteth not in words, but in holy living; we muſt put to our right hand, following the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, not of men.</p>
            <p>Further, the blood of the <hi>Ram</hi> was to be ſprinkled round about the Altar; the bloud of Chriſt, in like manner, is to be ſprinkled through the World, <hi>one drop of which</hi> (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> faith) <hi>was ſufficient for the redemption of the World, were there</hi> 1000. <hi>Worlds more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the blood of the <hi>Ram</hi> was to be ſprinkled on the garments of the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and yet many of them were meer <hi>hypocrites;</hi> there are many likewiſe which partake of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s table which are unworthy to be his gueſts.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſome parts of the ſacrifice were given to the Prieſt, as the breaſt, and the ſhoulder, one of which is the ſign of wit, and the other of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; two vertues which of all others are moſt neceſſary for Miniſters; by which alſo we ſee that Miniſters ought to be allowed a competent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, for which God did bleſs the people the better.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is very well worth our obſervation, that <hi>Christ</hi> compareth all good men to <hi>Sheep,</hi> as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is compared to them; and without queſtion it doth figurate unto us that ſweet and near union that there is between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:54366:100"/>
1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> being to preſcribe laws to his Church, doth not compare it to a den of <hi>Lions,</hi> which all other creatures dread; nor to <hi>Wolves</hi> which are never ſatisfied, having ſuch a greedy deſire; nor to <hi>Bears</hi> which are alwaies doing miſchief; nor to the ſtately <hi>Horſe;</hi> nor to the crafty <hi>Fox;</hi> nor to the ſluggiſh <hi>Aſs;</hi> nor to the contentious <hi>Dog;</hi> nor to the luxurious <hi>Swine;</hi> nor to the leacherous <hi>Goat;</hi> nor to the intemperate <hi>Glutton,</hi> but to the <hi>Sheep;</hi> by which we are taught to ſhun and avoid all the former vices.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sheep</hi> have nothing of fraud nor deceit in them; Chriſtians likewiſe ought not to be crafty and deceitful in their dealings one with another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sheep</hi> do no harm neither to man nor beaſt; neither ought <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to do any injury to their friends or enemies, to good or bad; moreover, the <hi>Sheep</hi> is very patient and mild; Chriſtians in like manner ought to be courteous and civil to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and they are of all creatures the cleanlyeſt; ſo ought every member of the true <hi>Church</hi> to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their luſts by the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> again, they love green Meadows, and clear water; neither doth the <hi>Church</hi> make the <hi>Jewiſh Fables</hi> nor the <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran</hi> any part of their Creed, but the word of God: but yet a little further, <hi>Sheep</hi> love to be among their fellows; thus ought it to be with good men, who ſhould love the company one of another: if a <hi>Sheep</hi> ſtrayeth, he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth again of himſelf, but lyeth liable to all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, unleſs the Shepherd bring him home; ſo
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54366:101"/>
good men, when they fall into errors, cannot be brought home but by the word of God: we do not uſe to bind <hi>Sheep</hi> in chains, but they go freely of themſelves, with no leſs willingneſs ought all Chriſtians to do their duty: when the <hi>Sheep</hi> is purſued by the <hi>Wolf,</hi> ſhe hath nothing to defend her ſelf withal; thus, neither have Chriſtians any ſtrength of their own to reſiſt the Devil, but what they have from their <hi>ſpiritual Armory</hi> mentioned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>Sheep</hi> are often troubled with weak and infirm heads, having nothing of craft or ſubtilty in them; neither can Chriſtians do any thing in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things by their own wit; they, (as we ſaid before) are as obnoxious to diſeaſes as any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, excepting man and horſes. <hi>God</hi> in all ages hath been pleaſed to exerciſe his <hi>Church</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions and calamities, and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> is compared to <hi>a Sheep that is fatted for the ſlaughter;</hi> for, as Butchers are glad when they find a fat <hi>Sheep,</hi> ſo wicked men rejoyce at the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and afflictions of the <hi>Church:</hi> when once the <hi>Sheep</hi> hath the ſcab, he is ſeparated from the reſt of the flock; neither ought notorious, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinners to be ſuffered to have communion with the reſt in the publick congregation; for, as one ſcabby <hi>Sheep</hi> infecteth the whole flock, ſo the ſlips and failings of one Chriſtian is often the cauſe of the fall of many weak ones. <hi>Sheep,</hi> as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, know their Dams as ſoon as they are brought forth; ſo ought we all to learn how to diſtinguiſh the <hi>true Church,</hi> and once found, never to leave her. I ſpake, in the former part of this <hi>Chap.</hi> of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54366:101"/>
four properties which did belong to the good Shepherd, all which may be fitly applyed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>good Shepherd:</hi> For, 1. He feedeth us, he giveth us food and raiment, health and plenty, mercies ſpiritual and temporal. 2. The Shepherd is to take care that the <hi>Sheep</hi> do not wander; Chriſt, as the Shepherd of our ſouls, giveth us his holy Spirit to guide and direct us, that we ſin not againſt him. 3. In like manner he defendeth us from the Devil and all his inſtruments (this he doth by his own power, and the tutelage of Angels) who by all waies, by force and fraud, endeavoureth to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and ruine the Church. 4. Neither doth he neglect wandring and weak Chriſtians; he taketh them up in his arms, and wipeth all tears from their eyes.</p>
            <p>But, to conclude, we ſaid before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Wolf,</hi> that two drums, one covered with the Wolve's skin, and another with a Sheeps skin, will never agree in ſound; and that an inſtrument tuned with the gut of a Wolf, and the gut of a <hi>Sheep,</hi> will never make any harmony: and that a Sheeps skin and a Goats skin layed together, the hair of the Sheeps skin will ſhead: the reaſons of which <hi>Conradus Geſner</hi> giveth us in theſe words; It is no wonder that a Wolves skin which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more hard and ſolid, ſhould give a clearer, &amp; lowder ſound than a Sheeps skin which is more ſoft and porous: and, it is no wonder that a hard, ſolid body, ſhould endure longer than a body that is more ſoft and pliable; as we ſee the feathers of an <hi>Eagle</hi> will laſt longer (it being by nature
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54366:102"/>
very dry) than the featners of a Gooſe, which is by natuee more moiſt and humid; ſo that a <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin</hi> conſumes ne're the more for being laid by the skin of a <hi>Wolf,;</hi> for it is by nature more ſolid and ſubſtantial, and therefore may very well laſt longer than the other; as we ſee that the bodies of thoſe perſons which are lean and ſpare, may be kept much longer from putrifaction than thoſe bodies which are more fat and groſs.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not ſpeak to that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 37. where <hi>Jacob</hi> peeled rods and laid them before the Sheep when they conceived; but ſhall only take notice of this by the way, that the ſame Device would not have the ſame Effect in other places; for, we muſt conſider, that in thoſe Countreys where <hi>Jacob</hi> lived, the <hi>Sheep</hi> were wont to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down in dry, barren fields, where they could not come by a drop of water untill noon, at which times they uſed to be driven to the wells, and there were watered; by which they being much refreſhed, became more apt for Copulation, and the ſight of the rods did work on their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but I doubt whether it would have the like effect in other Countreys.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> will not eat the ſinnew that is in the leg of a <hi>Sheep,</hi> eſpecially, though they will not eat that part of any other creature, as being that part in which <hi>Jacob</hi> was touched by God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10.</p>

whence cometh the Proverb of thoſe men that have a ſtrong ſcent about them, that <hi>they ſtink like a Goat; Olet ut Hircus,</hi> there is a kind of an <hi>antipathy</hi> between the bloud of a <hi>Goat</hi> and the <hi>Adamant</hi> ſtone; for, although it cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken neither by the hammer, neither can it be ſoftened by the fire, yet the blood of a <hi>Goat</hi> will break it: a fit repreſentation of the blood of Chriſt, by which only <hi>Sathan</hi> is overcome: ſome have made Bowes of <hi>Goats-horns,</hi> with which they uſed to kill wild <hi>Goats,</hi> like thoſe men that cheriſh thoſe who afterwards are their greateſt croſſes: thus are arrows feathered with the wings of Birds, that afterwards prove their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: thus we uſe to ſay, that when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by any of our own kinred, we ſee ſome of our feathers in the wound. The <hi>Goat</hi> is of no uſe to the Husband-man for the tilling of his ground; neither is it of any uſe in war, but, that ſometimes coats are made of their skins; in ſome parts of <hi>Africa</hi> they make cableropes of <hi>Goatshair;</hi> and <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, that in ſome places of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea there are <hi>Goats</hi> as big as <hi>Horſes;</hi> their hair is ſo fine, that the beſt ſorts of Garments are made of it; as, in <hi>Arabia,</hi> good cloath is woven of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes-hair;</hi> and <hi>Zembelitas</hi> telleth us, that in <hi>Lycia</hi> there are <hi>Goats</hi> have hair as long as womens hair; we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. that the <hi>Jews</hi> were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bring Silver, Gold, Purple, Scarlet, and fine Linnen, and <hi>Goats-hair,</hi> of which were made cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which hung over Silk-curtains; by which is ſignified unto us, that every one ought to give
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54366:104"/>
ſomething towards the building of the Temple; but prophane ſtories tell us, that they uſed to make their tabernacles of <hi>Goats skins, (Coelius, Lib.</hi> 27. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.) as in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, tabernacles uſed to be covered with <hi>Rams skins,</hi> and <hi>Badgers skins</hi> dyed, as we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 14. thus, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe courſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Prophets of old were forced to wear, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 37. ſaith, that they were clothed with <hi>Sheep-skins</hi> and <hi>Goat-skins;</hi> for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo uſeful to us as their skins, though ſome do make cheeſe of their milk; but it is very rank: many of them cannot feed together, as <hi>Gaberius,</hi> a Senator of <hi>Rome,</hi> found dearly to be true; who feeding a 1000. <hi>Goats</hi> together, loſt them all; ſo that it appeareth from this, that that place which will feed a 1000 <hi>Sheep,</hi> will not be ground enough for an 100 <hi>Goats.</hi> She, like the Cow, will kick down the milk as ſoon as ſhe hath given it; like thoſe men, who, though they have many good qualities, yet have more bad ones; thence cometh the Proverb, Like the Cow, that giveth a good meſs of Milk, and afterwards kicketh it down with her heel. He ſeldome ſtayeth long in a place, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies running up and down: the <hi>Goats</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> do exceedingly love <hi>Cinamon,</hi> and if you have but any <hi>Cinamon</hi> about you, he will follow you any whither; ſo that we may ſee a kind of <hi>ſympathy</hi> that there is between the <hi>Goat</hi> and <hi>Cinamon;</hi> they have a very quick hearing; for <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith (but how true, I know not) that ſhe heareth not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, in ſome places bring forth twice in a year; ſome do gather it from that place, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. when as, in that place, <hi>Jacob</hi>'s words do not mean as if the ſame <hi>Goats</hi> brought forth twice in a year, but that ſome brought forth, ſome ſooner, and ſome later.</p>
            <p>The ſubtilty and craftyneſs of this creature is very great, if we may believe <hi>Munanus;</hi> who reports, out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> that a couple of Goats meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another on a long Bridge, which was ſo narrow, that they could not paſs by one another; neither of them would go back to give the other way; ſo that one of them lyeth down, and the other goeth over his back; which ſhould be an example to us of love and unity; and when once our private intereſt doth meet with the publick, ſo that one of them muſt go back (as it were,) let the one give place to the other, to prevent all contention and diviſions: an inſtance of which we have in <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> who, though poſſibly was as ſtrong as <hi>David,</hi> yet he would not ſtand to contend, or reſiſt him, knowing that he was choſen of God, but gave place to him: I might further inlarge this, but let this ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It is very patient, and content with a little; the <hi>Buck-goat</hi> moſt commonly goeth the foremoſt of the flock, like as the <hi>Bell-wether</hi> goeth out, and cometh in, the firſt of the flock; and they (as ſome have obſerved) are prouder than the reſt, becauſe of the ſmall difference that there is between him and the reſt; according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Vacua vaſa plus tinniunt, i. e.</hi> Empty veſſels

Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia:</hi> but when this <hi>he-Goat</hi> was grown too big, his great horn was broken; that is, he did not dye in his old age, but in the flower of his age; which is ſignified in theſe words, his <hi>horns were broken:</hi> that day in which <hi>Alexander</hi> was born he ſet the moſt famous <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> on fire, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Magicians</hi> propheſied, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi> was born that day: of his broken horn aroſe four other horns, <hi>i. e.</hi> the four Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> of which we ſpake at large, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Further, <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he was 23 years old, went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſacrificed, and heard this propheſie, concerning himſelf, read, and explain'd, with a great deal of joy: the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is worth the reading at large, in <hi>Joſephus</hi> Book, 11.

concerning their priority; which King <hi>Pſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metychus</hi> undertook to decide, thus; He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two infants to be brought up by a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, amongſt the Sheep, and commanded him, that no one ſhould ſpeak a word to them, and that they ſhould ſuck a <hi>Goat,</hi> which accordingly was done; the Shepherd was to obſerve the firſt word that they ſpake; at a certain time the Shepherd opening the door, both of them being hand in hand, cryed out <hi>Beccus,</hi> which they often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this was told to the King; he enquired what that word ſignified in any language, and they found, after long ſearch, that it ſignified bread, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Phrygians;</hi> and ſo ever after the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> acknowledged the <hi>Phrygians</hi> to be the more ancient Nation; although <hi>Weken</hi> ſignifieth Bread, and <hi>Becket</hi> ſignifieth a Baker; and the <hi>Phrygians</hi> did uſe the Germane Tongue, as Hiſtorians tell us; yet, no doubt but they expreſſed that inarticulate ſound which they heard from the Sheep; for there is no tongue or language that is natural to any one, but all are to be learned: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue is not natural to the <hi>Jew;</hi> for if a <hi>Jew</hi> be born in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> he will ſpeak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Countrey where he is born; and will as ſoon learn <hi>Hebrew</hi> there, by the help of a Maſter (without which, he cannot attain it in his own Countrey) as his own Countrey: but this by the way.</p>

            <head>Of the <hi>Ape.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis is a very known creature, very much like the <hi>Monkey;</hi> the Ape hath a large <hi>Tail,</hi> but the <hi>Monkey</hi> hath none at all; this being the only thing almoſt wherein they differ: this creature very much reſembleth the <hi>Marmoſet,</hi> which is like an <hi>Ape,</hi> very apiſh, and never ſtaying long in one place: <hi>Veſalius</hi> and <hi>Columbus,</hi> two famous Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts, tell us, that <hi>Galen</hi> had more skill in the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of an <hi>Ape,</hi> than of a Man. But now I ſhall ſpeak to the nature of an <hi>Ape,</hi> properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is very like a man in ſeveral parts of his body; he hath a very ill-favoured face, his noſe is almoſt flat to his face, which is full of many wrinkles; his eares are movable; he liveth on the tops of Mountains and Trees, and in the holes of Rocks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he is very like to man in ſeveral parts of his body, ſo he doth ſtrive to imitate mens acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but very fooliſhly, and not at all like thoſe actions which he ſeemeth to imitate; he will learn any childiſh action quickly, as to play upon the pipe; ſometimes he will act the part of a Carter, at another time he will look a childs head, crack nuts, &amp;c. he will play wlth dogs and little children,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54366:108"/>
and if care be not taken, will kill them: ſo <hi>Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> reporteth of an <hi>Ape,</hi> who ſeeing a Nurſe waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little infant, he, in the Nurſes abſence, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the child, and waſheth it with hot water, and ſo ſcalded the child to death.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fooliſh imitation of the <hi>Ape</hi> often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his own ruine; for he hath a very ſtrong bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and cannot be taken by force, but by ſome wile or trap: the huntſ-man when he ſeeth an <hi>Ape,</hi> goeth before him, and pulls off his ſhooes, and combs his head, and waſhes his face, and ſo goes his way, leaving a veſſel full of mud behind him; the <hi>Ape</hi> coming to waſh himſelf, as the huntſ-man did, and daubing himſelf with the mud, the dirt getteth into his eyes that he cannot ſee; and he leaves alſo ſhooes of lead behind him, which, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he hath tyed on, he cannot ſtir: the huntſ-men when they go to take him, carry a looking-glaſs tyed to their head, with many ropes hanging upon it, which, when they go away, they leave behind them, which the <hi>Ape</hi> tyeth on when they are gone; the huntſ-men ſeeing this, catch hold of the ropes, and ſo take him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He loveth himſelf very much, and is very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible when any one praiſeth him; and loveth to ſee himſelf in a glaſs. There is no creature loveth her young ones ſo well as the <hi>Ape,</hi> and with a great deal of joy he will ſhew them to all in the houſe; he is alwaies hugging, and making much of them, although they be the moſt deformed creatures of all others: <hi>GOD</hi> hath given them dugs in their breaſt, not as other creatures; whence it is, that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54366:108"/>
they can feed them in their boſome; they love their young ſo much, that oftentimes, by too much imbracing, they kill them: when he is put to flight at any time, he carryeth one of his young ones at his back, and the other before him; he carryeth that on his back that he loveth beſt; in any great danger ſhe is fain to let go that which ſhe holdeth in her claws, while the other that ſhe hath the leaſt love for, remaineth ſafe upon her back: which repreſenteth to us thoſe Parents that have too great a love for ſome children, while they neglect the others; but yet we often ſee, that thoſe that they love leaſt prove the beſt, when the other come to ruine: an example of which we have in our firſt Parents; which bare a greater affection to <hi>Cain</hi> than they had to <hi>Abel;</hi> yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Cain,</hi> and his whole poſterity, were rejected in the deluge, when as the other was received into God's favour, and ſaved. Moreover, the male hath ſo great a love for his young ones, that if he ſeeth one of them look as if it were not kindly uſed by her damm, he will correct her for it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ridiculouſneſs of his actions is no leſs than the deformity of his body; for he will not only imitate the actions of men, but is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, and miſchievous; whereſoever he biteth any one, it is very dangerous, and hard to be cured: he is ſo wild, that he can hardly be kept in with chains; and though he be tamed, yet he is ſoon as wild again as ever.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He will eat any thing, be it never ſo filthy; he will eat lice with a great deal of delight, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54366:109"/>
loveth to crack nuts; but eſpecially he loveth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and wine; and will drink ſo long of it untill he is ſo drunk that he cannot ſtand.</p>
            <p n="8">8. There is a great <hi>antipathy</hi> between the <hi>Ape</hi> and the <hi>Lion;</hi> the <hi>Ape</hi> being a crafty, ſubtil crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the <hi>Lion</hi> (as we ſaid, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.) hateth all manner of craftyneſs: the <hi>antipathy</hi> between the <hi>Lion</hi> and the <hi>Ape</hi> is further ſeen in this; that if the <hi>Lion</hi> be ſick of any diſeaſe, he can no waies be cured but by eating of the fleſh of an <hi>Ape. Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaith, that among the <hi>Indians,</hi> no <hi>Apes</hi> that are red are ſuffered to come into their Cities, becauſe they are ſo luſtful and laſcivious, inſomuch, that they oftentimes aſſault the women. They will know their Maſters where they are long kept, and will remember any injury that is done unto them, but will as long feign their anger, untill they have a fit opportunity to revenge it; an <hi>Ape</hi> is an <hi>Ape,</hi> though cloathed in never ſo rich garments; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by fools and children he may be taken and ſaluted for a man, yet he cannot hide his natural deformity. <hi>Gregory Nicene</hi> telleth us of an <hi>Ape,</hi> who being cloathed in very rich habit, did dance very exactly, according to the Muſick, in the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and that for a long while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, untill one of the company throwing ſome nuts to him, he left off his dancing, and fell to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering up of the nuts, to the great laughter of the beholders; like, as many men, who are intruſted in great Offices, honoured by all men; yet if any private gain offereth it ſelf to them, they preſently diſcover that ſecret wickedneſs that lyeth hid.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54366:109"/>
               <hi>Athenaeus</hi> relateth of <hi>Anacharſis</hi> the Philoſopher, who ſeeing many fooliſh things acted, did not laugh at all; but ſeeing an <hi>Ape</hi> brought upon the Stage, broke out into a great laughter; and being asked the reaſon of it, anſwered, that it was made for nothing elſe but to laugh at: and theſe are moſt of the chief qualities and properties of the <hi>Ape;</hi> to which we might compare all Flatterers and Diſſemblers, and even the Devil himſelf, who may not unfitly be called God's <hi>Ape.</hi>

Then, the <hi>Ape</hi> hath not the reaſon of a man, but without reſpect to the place, perſons, or time, do imitate many of mens actions, without either wit or diſcretion: thus do Diſſemblers and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; when they cannot give counſel, they applaud and commend that which they have done; by which means, as <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith, they often betray not only their weakneſs, but their folly: thus it was in the Reign of <hi>Philip,</hi> ſome then imitating <hi>Melancthon,</hi> in the geſtures which he uſed in his Sermons; thereby diſcovering their great folly; not conſidering their time, nor the difference of perſons; to which we might adde the fooliſh imitation of the <hi>Germanes,</hi> wherein they ſhew a great deal of weakneſs; according to that known ſtory of the <hi>Painter,</hi> who was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> to deſcribe the ſeveral habits of the Countreys; when he came to paint the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> he painted the <hi>Ape,</hi> carrying a piece of cloath; and being asked the reaſon of it, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the <hi>Germaues,</hi> like ſo many <hi>Apes,</hi> did imitate the garments and habits of all Nations;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54366:110"/>
and therefore he had left them a whole piece of cloath, that they might pleaſe themſelves in their habits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Apes,</hi> (as we ſaid before) are often caught by their fooliſh imitation: ſo, oftentimes ſuch Flatterers get nothing elſe, but to be made a laughing-ſtock; like <hi>Phaeton,</hi> who would needs drive his Fathers Charriot, but could not do it. <hi>Apes</hi> are very proud, and love to behold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in looking-glaſſes: Flatterers, of all men, love to be praiſed; <hi>Apes,</hi> although they move laughter oftentimes, yet are very unlucky, and miſchievous: thus are Flatterers, as we find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſad experience, in the Courts of Princes. We ſeldome find an <hi>Ape</hi> in poor peoples houſes, but moſt of them are to be found in great mens houſes, and Princes Courts: Flatterers are ſeldome in the poor mans cottages. <hi>Apes</hi> often ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and play with their Maſters: thus do Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers oftentimes deceive their Princes, and bring them into unavoidable dangers: examples of which we read too often in Hiſtory. <hi>Apes</hi> are ſo impudent, that they will not fear to diſturb a <hi>Lion;</hi> Flatterers are oftentimes the ruine of great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, by the calumnies and reproaches which they caſt upon them, which <hi>Euripides</hi> found to be true; being very familiar with <hi>Archelaus,</hi> one uight coming out of the Court, the Courtiers ſet the dogs at him, which tore him to pieces.

            <p>THE <hi>Squirrel</hi> is very common amongſt us; he hath a very large tail, which ſerveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently for a ſhadow and a covering: he layeth up his food in the Summer for the Winter; he eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often, but drinketh very little; he layeth up what he cannot eat, and loveth ſleep, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him very fat: he liveth in hollow trees, where they build their neaſts, and bring forth their young; his tail ſerveth him for wings, which he uſeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wagging of it when he is to leap on any thing; if he is to go through any water, he will get
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54366:111"/>
upon a piece of wood; his tail ſerveth him inſtead of a ſail, ſo ſwimming over, carrying his food in his mouth. She hath divers holes and caverns in the earth where ſhe liveth, and each of theſe hath ſeveral waies to it, which ſhe ſtoppeth up with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Weaſel</hi> is no leſs crafty than it is time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and although ſhe bringeth forth her young ones in the houſe, ſhe often changeth her neaſt, leſt being diſcovered, her young ones ſhould be taken away: ſome tell us, that if her young ones at any time were hurt, ſhe ſeeketh out for ſome herb proper for the diſtemper, with which ſhe cureth them.</p>

2. They have a natural enmity againſt <hi>Serpents,</hi> and <hi>Mice</hi> have as great an enmity againſt them. The ſecret members of the <hi>Weaſel</hi> are very defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; as therefore the <hi>Serpent,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Weaſel</hi> commonly ſeen in houſes: it is their work to catch mice, which is moſt of their food; <hi>Weaſels</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy more mice and moles than <hi>Cats:</hi> it hath been obſerved, that thoſe creatures which eat both the ſame food, can never agree one with another. The <hi>Weaſel</hi> hath a particular way to find out ſerpents holes; for they defend themſelves againſt the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, by taking ſome <hi>rue</hi> in their mouths, and then go in boldly to the ſerpent, and will kill it, let it be never ſo big; nay, they will kill a <hi>Baſilisk:</hi> it may be a repreſentation to us of all Chriſtians, againſt whom the Devil hath alwaies had, and doth ſtill expreſs the great enmity he hath againſt them; but this may be for our comfort, that he is eaſily overcome by the vertue of <hi>rue,</hi> that is, by the blood of Chriſt. If the <hi>Weaſel</hi> be angered he will ſend forth a ſtinking ſmell from his body, and is as miſchievous when vexed, as a mad dog: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth many ſmall birds; for what the <hi>Wolf</hi> is to the <hi>Sheep,</hi> that is the <hi>Weaſel</hi> to <hi>Fowls;</hi> and as he cannot endure the ſerpent while he is alive, ſo when he is dead, his gall is a ſovereign remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poyſon of the ſerpent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Weaſel</hi> is a very ſwift creature, his teeth are venomous, he ſheddeth his hair, and is very wild, and hath a very nimble body. The field or wild <hi>Weaſel</hi> is ſomewhat larger than the <hi>dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick;</hi> he will catch abundance of ſmall birds in a

That his dung ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth very ſweet; therefore it is that they are ſo much prized. 2. Although he will deſtroy the poultrey, yet he will bring them home to the houſe where he is; which is a fit reſemblance of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: an example of which we have even among thieves, who have alwaies ſome reſpect to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and thoſe men are worſe than beaſts who will lay violent hands on thoſe men by whom they ſubſiſt: by the way I ſhall note this, that the <hi>Squirrel Weaſel</hi> will become tame, if their teeth be rubbed with <hi>garlick. Deut.</hi> 11. 29. the <hi>Jews,</hi> among other things, were forbidden the <hi>field-mouſe</hi> or <hi>ſhrew,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Weaſel,</hi> though not ſo commonly known to us; but ſome do think that the word doth not properly ſignifie the <hi>field-mouſe</hi> called a <hi>ſhrew;</hi> for there are many words in the Latine verſion of the Bible, which do not agree with the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> this is a very ſmall creature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as big as a <hi>Weaſel;</hi> it is wholly given to his prey, and is very crafty in taking of it, and given much to exceſs and intemperance; if any one cometh by him, he will lye ſtill, and ſeem tame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54366:113"/>
he come nigh, and then he will bite, which is venomous: if therefore the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>ſhrew,</hi> we may learn thus much, that God would have us to ſhun all the <hi>vices</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named. The <hi>Ferret</hi> may not unfitly be called a kind of <hi>Weaſel;</hi> he hath a little head, a red back, and a white belly; his hair ſticketh ſo cloſe to him, that his skin will come off as ſoon as his hair; this reſembleth covetous men, who, as the <hi>Comoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> well ſaid, will part with their teeth rather than with their money; it is called in Latine <hi>Furo,</hi> or <hi>Furunculus,</hi> from <hi>furor,</hi> to ſteal; becauſe it ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and carryeth away all he can get to his hole, laying up a great deal of corn againſt winter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any chaff amongſt it; ſo that one may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſee half a buſhel of corn layed up in one <hi>Weaſels</hi> hole, ſo that it may be well called <hi>Viverra, quaſi vi omn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54366:113"/>
fierceſt when at home; but when in ſtrange places are very tame; like thoſe men who are very cruel and rigid at home, but when they go abroad, ſeem to be very mild and courteous. Formerly they uſed to carry <hi>Ferrets</hi> along with them to hunting, and to ſend them into the <hi>Coney-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> to drive them out. The <hi>Poltcat</hi> is a kind of <hi>Weaſel</hi> alſo, they are moſt commonly very fat and ravenous: he will fore-ſee a tempeſt coming, and will run into their holes to ſhelter themſelves; I cannot give much credit to thoſe who ſay that they can know a tempeſt a great while before it cometh, which, I think, no man can do; not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologers,</hi> who pretend ſo much skill in knowing the weather; for tempeſts and ſtorms, and all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of weather depend only on the will of God; but I think they may ſometimes hit to fore-tell the weather by chance: but to ſay that it will certainly be ſuch &amp; ſuch weather, I think no one can tell; for we have oftentimes ſeen that God hath diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in that which they have fore-told would moſt certainly come to paſs; but this by the way. The <hi>Poltcat</hi> lyeth hid, and is ſeen but very little all the winter; ſleepeth very much, which maketh them grow exceeding fat: when they are purſued by the dogs very cloſe, and are in danger of their lives, they will hold their breath, thereby puffing themſelves up, being then better able to bear blows. There is a natural antipathy between this creature and the <hi>Fox;</hi> for the <hi>Fox</hi> will oftentimes be in his holes, which if he cannot get by force, he will do it by fraud; he will dung and urine at
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54366:114"/>
the mouth of the hole, which maketh ſuch a ſtink, that he cannot endure the ſmell of it, and is forced to leave her hole. The <hi>Poltcat</hi> is almoſt as big as a <hi>Fox,</hi> and ſome ſay that it is a kind of <hi>Fox:</hi> if ſo, it may repreſent to us Apoſtates, who of all other men are the moſt bitter enemies againſt that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of which they were once themſelves; for in all ages of the World, hereticks, like thoſe <hi>Apostates,</hi> have oppoſed and perſecuted the true Church, ſtriving only for riches, and by calumnies and reproaches intend to ruine the rulers of the Church; and if they cannot do it ſo, they will do it by curſes and maledictions; they never go far from their holes, nor do they ſtay out long when they do go out, which is only in the night-time, becauſe then they know all things are ſafe and quiet; it is called in Latine <hi>Taxus,</hi> which is the word for the Ewe-tree, yet from thence came the <hi>Dachſus:</hi> to conclude, <hi>Weaſels</hi> may be tamed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies, and when they are tamed they are very uſeful; they will fetch young birds from trees, they will drive out young Pidgeons out of their holes, and will hunt Coneys out of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs: by which we ſee, that God hath made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain, though at preſent we cannot ſee the uſefulneſs of it: the next thing that cometh in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſpoken to, is the it was unknown to the Ancients, found only in the Southern Countrys; of a very greedy and ravenous nature; about the bigneſs of a <hi>Dog,</hi> and hath a <hi>Cats</hi> face, the body and tail of a <hi>Fox,</hi> and the colour of a <hi>Weaſel;</hi> he hath 2 particular properties; 1.

and, 2. Very ravenous. He will climb up trees, and leap upon any man that goeth by, and is very cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, feeding moſt upon dead carkaſſes; and where he ſeeth one, he will eat ſo long of it, that his belly will be almoſt ready to burſt; as ſoon as he hath done, he will look for two trees that ſtand cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and will ſqueeze himſelf between theſe trees; and ſo what he had forced in, he forceth out; having done ſo, he maketh haſte again to the dead carkaſs, then to the two trees again, and doth as before: this he doth untill he hath devoured the carkaſs: by which filthy creature, God would have us to hate that ſin of Intemperance; for we ſee that moſt of our domeſtick creatures obſerve a rule in eating and drinking, and will not exceed the rules of temperance; nay, we cannot make them, neither by fair means nor foul, to take more than will ſatisfie nature: but it is to be much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that man, who was born in the image of God, ſhould ſo violate the laws of nature, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the bounds of ſobriety, that which the very beaſts are free from: and by this creature we ſhould learn to deteſt the beaſtly ſin of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

he ſeeth any one coming to take him, he rouleth himſelf up, and ſo ſecures himſelf; but when he cannot run away, he urines upon his back, which maketh his skin to rot and putrifie; this he doth for very fear; but ſome are of a contrary opinion, who think it is becauſe no one ſhould have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his skin: there is no way to take him ſo eaſily, as to pour cold water upon him, which will make him unfold himſelf: his skin is very good to ſcour garments with, to bruſh them from the duſt: if he loſeth one apple by the way as he carryeth them, he will throw away all the reſt, and run to his hole.

            <p>THis is an <hi>amphibious</hi> creature, hath four feet, two of a <hi>Dog,</hi> and two of a <hi>Gooſe:</hi> his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part is hairy; he hath a long, broad, ruggid tail, like the tail of a fiſh; his feet are skinny, which maketh him ſwim with a great deal of eaſe; he cannot dive long together, being of very ſhort breath; and therefore is fain often to put his head up above water for air: he biteth very hard, and loveth to be among fiſhes, or where they are: he may be like a thief in this thing; for he loveth to lye in the way that paſſengers come ofteneſt by: he is as big as a large <hi>Cat,</hi> his teſticles have neither a bad ſcent nor a good, but is very good againſt the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Matrix;</hi> and is often given to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with child.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54366:116"/>
biteth them off, becauſe he will not have any one have the benefit of them; which, I think, may be rejected as fabulous: this reſembleth thoſe men, who, when in an eminent danger, will part with thoſe things that are deareſt to them, if they can but eſcape. He loveth to be upon the banks of <hi>Rivers,</hi> and in thoſe places where trees grow cloſe to the water; and there he will ſit, with his body in the tree, and his tail in the water: his ſubtilty is ſeen in this, that he will make a tree hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with his teeth, as if it were made ſo by art: he will not looſe his hold that he hath taken of any man, except he hath broken the bone, or that part that he hath hold of. The tree that he thus hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth he maketh threce ells in it, one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if it raineth ſo that the tree is full of water, then he goeth up a ſtory higher, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the water decreaſeth or increaſeth, ſo he goeth up higher or lower in the tree; yet ſo, that ſtill he may keep his body dry, and his tail in the water: this may teach us to foreſee dangers that are coming upon us, and to arm our ſelves againſt them.</p>

            <p>THis is alſo an <hi>Amphibious</hi> creature, very much reſembling the <hi>Beaver;</hi> there is no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as to their outward ſhape; <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54366:117"/>
that the <hi>Otter</hi> and <hi>Beaver</hi> are both the ſame, but in this they differ; the <hi>Beaver</hi> hath a tail, but the <hi>Otter</hi> hath no tail at all: he biteth as hard as the <hi>Beaver,</hi> and hath many other qualities which the <hi>Beaver</hi> hath. There is a creature which is much like the <hi>Otter,</hi> called <hi>Latax,</hi> which hath all his food out of the water: all theſe creatures, the <hi>Beaver,</hi> the <hi>Martin,</hi> the <hi>Ferret,</hi> &amp;c. are mentioned among thoſe doleful creatures, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 13. 21. called there by the names of <hi>ohim</hi> and <hi>zihim,</hi> by all which, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto us the lives of thoſe who live pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and ſolitarily in the World, only looking after what concerneth themſelves, meat and drink, not skilled in any Art or Science that may fit them to do their Countrey ſervice: for, as the creatures above-named are very timerous and fearful, ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſight of men; ſo are theſe Countrey people, who are ſtrong, but nothing of courage in them; neither are they able to do any ſervice; ſo that, as <hi>Terence</hi> ſaid, <hi>Homine imperito nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtius,</hi> nothing is more injurious to men, than when ignorant men are put in place. 1. They live moſt under ground, and ſeldome come abroad but in the night-time, when they know all things are quiet and ſtill, and then only when they are forced to it to ſeek for food: thus is it with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who will not take any journey to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their knowledge, or to ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; but to ſerve their own private ends holding this for a Maxime, <hi>Bene qui latuit bene vixit,</hi> He liveth the beſt that liveth the privateſt life.

or in their holes; like thoſe men that breed their children at home, and never ſend them abroad, whereby they might ſee the World, becauſe moſt commonly it is liable to the greateſt hazards: moreover, he careth for nothing but food, ſome of them laying up whole heaps of corn againſt the Winter: thus do they take thought for nothing, but how to increaſe their wealth. The <hi>Lion</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced daily to ſeek his prey, when theſe creatures have food enough in their holes; ſo that they do not only live in the Winter, which ſome creatures cannot do for want of food; but they grow fat. Thus Learned men, who have done their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſervice either in War, or otherwaies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are not ſo ſollicitous to get wealth as others are, yet they do ſeldome want; ſome of the fore-mentioned creatures will not let the female eat as much as ſhe will, but yet ſhe will find a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way to his heap, and eat as much as ſhe will: ſo, thoſe <hi>Churles</hi> who are ſo harſh to their Wives, do but endamage themſelves by it. Theſe creatures daily change their neaſts; ſo thoſe men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually laying up their riches, knowing no end of them. Some are of opinion, that they can fore-ſee a ſtorm long before it cometh, and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it. <hi>Ferrets</hi> will not devour the <hi>poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> in the ſame houſe where they live: thus, thoſe people, who although they have no love for their rulers, yet are forced to obey them out of fear. There is another ſort of <hi>Otter</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is called <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> or the <hi>Indian-rat,</hi> about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a <hi>Cat,</hi> his hairs are as hard as <hi>Sowes briſſels,</hi>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54366:118"/>
creature that is, which from ſo ſmall a bigneſs, groweth to be ſuch a great creature; he groweth as long as he liveth: he liveth 60 years, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till he be 17, 18, or 20. cubits long: his teeth are more like <hi>rakes</hi> than teeth, being ertraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily big: his skin is ſo hard all over his body, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his belly, which is exceeding tender) that he cannot feel the hardeſt blow. 2. Although he is ſo exceeding timerous, purſuing none but thoſe which flye from him; and flying as faſt from thoſe that do purſue him; yet he may be accounted bold and valiant. When he goeth out for his food, he will ſometimes lye ſtill, as if he were dead, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; thus inviting the birds to him, which think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is dead, come very near him, flying about him, and when they are within his reach, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them. There is a little Bird which is called in Latine <hi>Trochilus,</hi> that he ſuffereth to feed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in his mouth, becauſe it keeps his teeth clean, by picking out any thing that is between them; like to thoſe men who will do nothing but what may ſerve their own intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile</hi> wanteth food, and is exceeding hungry, he will fill his mouth full of water, and poureth it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beaten path, and ſo making it very ſlippery, if any one falleth down, he will catch them before they can riſe again: he firſt eateth the carkaſs, and then, with tears, he will eat the head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence came the Proverb, <hi>The tears of the Crocodile,</hi> which are feigned, and hypocritical. There is a great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy between the <hi>Crocodile</hi> and <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> or <hi>Indian-Rat,</hi> which is a kind of <hi>Otter,</hi> to be found

only in <hi>Egypt:</hi> when the <hi>Crocodile</hi> lyeth aſleep with his mouth open on the ſhore, he will go into his mouth, and down his throat into his belly; and that he may the more eaſily go down, he daubeth himſelf with mud: the <hi>Crocodile</hi> awaking, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>rat</hi> in his belly, runneth up and down, ſometimes lying down upon the ground, and ſtretching himſelf out, then he will go and plunge himſelf in the water; all this while this little <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Rat</hi> never mindeth what he doth, but lyeth in his belly, gnawing of his bowels, (which is very pleaſant meat to him,) where he ſtayeth untill he hath gnawed his way through the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> ſide, which killeth him; but he cometh out alive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt at all: he is very diligent in ſeeking out the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> eggs (from whence ſome are of opinion, that her name is derived from <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Moreover, it is exceeding ravenous and greedy, and wants the uſe of his tongue; his ſight is dull when in the water, but very quick on the land: it exceedingly fears ſerpents, for they will lye hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe herbs which they know the <hi>Crocodile</hi> moſt loveth; in all which he much reſembleth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; for, 1. The <hi>Crocodile</hi> is a very great creature, <hi>amphibious,</hi> living either on the land, or in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a very cunning, crafty creature. 2.

            <p>THE <hi>Lizard</hi> is a creature ſo well known, that there are few better known. There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain kind of <hi>Lizard</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is called <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncus,</hi> or <hi>Scineus;</hi> but that which we have out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <hi>Scineus,</hi> is not a true <hi>Lizard,</hi> but a kind of <hi>land-Crocodile,</hi> (which is uſed, by ſome, to provoke luſt,) having his ſcales growing towards his head; as alſo, a very white, thin skin.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Lizard</hi> hath a very great love to man, inſomuch, that whenſoever he ſeeth any man, he expreſſeth it by ſeveral <hi>apiſh</hi> actions, fawning, &amp; wagging his tail like a <hi>dog;</hi> and when he ſeeth a ſerpent to lye lurking under any herb, (as they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do) he is more active and apiſh, which he doth to give notice to any one that is paſſing that waies, that they may defend themſelves againſt it: which is a very fit reſemblance of thoſe men who are <hi>crafty</hi> and <hi>miſchievous,</hi> and make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do miſchief; yet it is ſo ordered by divine Providence, that they do even betray themſelves; like <hi>Balaam,</hi> who was forced to bleſs thoſe whom he would have curſed: and ſo it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who was forced, againſt his will, to let the people go; ſo that it is verified which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>When a
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54366:120"/>
mans waies pleaſe the Lord, he maketh his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be at peace with him:</hi> and ſo it happens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, our greateſt enemies ſometimes being the occaſions of our greateſt good: and thus much for this creature, which is hatched out of an egg.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Salamander (Ein Melch)</hi> is a kind of a white <hi>Lizard,</hi> being hatched of an <hi>Egg;</hi> it is very like the <hi>Lizard,</hi> having along, crooked tail, and crooked, ſharp feet; his skin is very rough, and rugged, and is ſaid to be of ſo cold a nature, that he can e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ven put out the fire; but experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the contrary; for if he be kept ſome time in the fire, he is eaſily burnt, although at the firſt ſight one would think otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>They ſay, that if he get into a tree, he doth ſo impoyſon the fruit, that it proveth mortal to thoſe who ſhall eat of it afterwards: and his ſpittle (as it were) or that which cometh out of his mouth, is of ſo venomous a quality, that if it chance to light on any one, it maketh the hair to come off; and yet, notwithſtanding, <hi>Swine</hi> will eat it without any hurt to them at all; which fitly reſembles wicked men: for, the <hi>Salamander</hi> (as we ſaid before) is a kind of <hi>Lizard:</hi> ſo wicked men likewiſe, are but the iſſue and off-ſpring of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as its <hi>ſpittle</hi> makes the <hi>hair</hi> to fall off; ſo, the reproaches which wicked men caſt on the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, robs them of that honour and eſteem which is due to them. The <hi>Salamander</hi> is never ſeen abroad in fair weather: wicked men, in like manner, ought not to be ſeen in a well-ordered <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:54366:121"/>
Again, he never cometh out of his denn, but in great ſtorms and ſhowers: it is likewiſe only in times of <hi>ſedition</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi> that wicked men dare ſhew themſelves.</p>

            <head>Of the <hi>Chamelion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis is a creature very well known, four-footed, and engendred of an Egg; to be found in <hi>Aſia</hi> only; almoſt like a <hi>Lizard:</hi> he holdeth his mouth open to take in the air. It is reported of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that of all the creatures that he hath deſcribed, there is none that is more timerous and crafty than the <hi>Chamelion:</hi> it is to be found in <hi>Africa</hi> alſo, but very rarely, as alſo in <hi>India.</hi> His ſnout is like a <hi>Hogs,</hi> which routeth up the ground; and although the <hi>Chamelion</hi> is very much like a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> yet in this he differeth from him, his tail being much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thicker: he is very crafty and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, although ſo fearful and timerous. It is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this creature, and of this creature only, that when at any time he is frighted, he, for very fear, changeth himſelf into the colour of that thing at which he is frighted: the reaſon of which <hi>Bodinus</hi> thinketh to be the <hi>pellucidneſs,</hi> and <hi>tranſparency</hi> of his body; and therefore whatſoever colour is next to him, that colour ſeemeth to reflect from his body: a fit reſemblance of <hi>Stage-players,</hi> who can be any thing for their profit and advantage: he can change himſelf into any colour except red and white; which is a fit reſemblance of ſubtile Diſputants, who run from one thing to another, to

evade the force of their adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aries argument. When he is dying he turneth very white, and pale; he can no more be without the cool air, than he can without food: he hath very large lungs, yet when opened, there is nothing found within them: which fitly reſembleth flatterers and diſſemblers. The <hi>Chamelion</hi> being a very timerous and fearful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, changing himſelf into all colours but red and white: thus, flatterers do live in fear continually, and leſt they ſhould be diſcovered, are ſometimes put to their ſhifts; but they can never endure to behold the truth in its luſtre. Moreover, the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melion</hi> alwaies goeth with his mouth open, and hath large lungs, but nothing within them: thus, theſe <hi>Sycophants</hi> and <hi>Diſſemblers</hi> covet nothing ſo much as the breath of people; who, although they have not the leaſt ſpark of Religion, yet would ſeem to have the moſt: good men had rather be real, than ſeem to be Religious; but wicked men had rather ſeem to be Religious, than to be really ſo: ſuch are thoſe that do all things for their own praiſe, and by their geſtures and actions do plainly ſhew that they would be praiſed of all men. There is a natural <hi>antipathy</hi> between the <hi>Chamelion</hi> and the <hi>Crow;</hi> which, as often as they meet, the <hi>Crow</hi> remembreth that poyſonous quality that is in the <hi>Chamelion;</hi> and therefore, before he encounters with him, he eateth a leaf or two of <hi>lawrel;</hi> and, although he be often wounded in the combat, yet he alwaies is conqueror.

                  </gap>, the Fable of the War between the <hi>Frogs</hi> and the <hi>Mice. Frogs</hi> are commonly taken to be a ſign of the approaching <hi>Spring;</hi> and are thought to be engendred of <hi>mud,</hi> like <hi>Eeles:</hi> it is to be obſérved, that there are moſt <hi>Frogs</hi> to be found in a moiſt year; and therefore, when we ſee a multitude of <hi>Frogs,</hi> we may conclude no happy year to follow: but it is to be rejected as fabulous, and ridiculous, which ſome ſay, that they are bred of <hi>mud</hi> and <hi>ſlime,</hi> when we may ſee them copulate, and of their <hi>ſperm</hi> or <hi>eggs</hi> are generated young <hi>Frogs;</hi> they are not ſeen to copulate in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, neither can they do it in the water; but yet, by their continual croaking, the male provoketh the female, and both of them wait for the night, that they might the freelier enjoy one another; this they do in the night-time, leſt they ſhould be diſturbed by men or beaſts, and are very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the act: ſometimes men, through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, drink the <hi>ſpawn</hi> of the <hi>Frogs;</hi> whence it is, that ſometimes we have ſeen Frogs to be generated in men, and whether alſo eggs by the ſame means, the <hi>ſperme,</hi> or the little worms being eaten with our meat oftentimes, do not breed worms in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54366:124"/>
and in men oftentimes, I leave to the more learned to judge. From the <hi>ſpawn</hi> of theſe <hi>Frogs</hi> are bred other little <hi>Frogs,</hi> which have long tails at firſt, but afterwards grow ſhorter and ſhorter: in Winter-time they lye hid in holes of the earth; and ſome ſay, that in thoſe Ponds that do not freeze, are <hi>Frogs</hi> all the Winter; but, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude of <hi>Frogs</hi> that we have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, there can no other reaſon be given of it, than what we have for the great company of <hi>Locuſts</hi> that was ſent upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to wit, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand of <hi>God,</hi> for our ſins. Some are of opinion that they are bred of ſhowers; others, of winds; but, I think, no other reaſon can be given of this than of the former; like as God once did create out of the <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> great ſtore of <hi>Frogs.</hi> 4. If we ſet a candle lighted on the ground, the Frogs will immediately be ſilent; they make a great noiſe when they are in warm water; but if they are caſt into a Well that is colder, they are immediately ſilent. 5. Some do pretend to foretell a ſhower, by the more than ordinary croaking of <hi>Frogs:</hi> But, I think, we may more rationally conclude, that <hi>Frogs</hi> do ſee the ſhower hanging in the air, and ſo prepare themſelves for it; they being very much delighted in rain-water, being much ſweeter than any other water. It is a common thing for children to get Frogs by a piece of red cloath, and a hook; the Frogs do catch thoſe bees that flye near the water, and, although they are often ſtung by them, yet do not feel it. There are ſome people will eat Frogs, firſt fleaing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54366:124"/>
them, and then taking only the hinder parts of them: this may be a fit repreſentation of thoſe who do delight in ſcandalizing and reproaching their neighbour. Too great multitudes of Frogs are thought, by ſome, to <hi>portend</hi> an unhappy year: thus it is with theſe men who alwaies breed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and are the promoters of diſſentions and diviſions. If <hi>Frogs</hi> do croak more than ordinarily, it ſheweth the change of weather; thus, when wicked men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>louriſh, and proſper, it is but a bad <hi>omen</hi> of ſome alteration for the worſe. <hi>Frogs</hi> are not ſenſible of the ſtings of Bees; ſo great and high are men in their wickedneſs, that reproofs and advices will do them no good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frogs</hi> croak only in warm water, but make no noiſe at all in cold water: thus wicked men are well enough while in a proſperous condition; but, when once affliction cometh, then they cannot bear it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>And I ſaw three unclean ſpirits like Frogs come out of the mouth of the Dragon;</hi> that is, <hi>Hereticks</hi> proceeding out of the mouth of <hi>Sathan,</hi> ſuch as were formerly the <hi>Monks,</hi> and at this day the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> who, by all their reaſonings and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, do only endeavour to maintain the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> and his power over all other men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. 1. If one were to judge of the bigneſs of a <hi>Frog</hi> by the noiſe that it made, and did not ſee it, we ſhould be ready to conclude that it was ſome large beaſt: ignorant people, at firſt, that do not examine their arguments, and bring them to the touchſtone of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> are ready preſently to conclude their arguments unanſwerable, when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54366:125"/>
they are nothing leſs; and like the croaking of Frogs, intending only to weary out their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries by the multitude of their arguments, but not to convince them by the force of them; and all to no other end, but to eſtabliſh the <hi>Papal Chair.</hi> 2. If a <hi>Frog</hi> be ſet upon a Golden Stool, it will leap off from it into the mud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus, <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> if brought to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> will betake themſelves to <hi>Philoſophical</hi> arguments, and creep to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Fathers, where they think themſelves ſecure. 3. <hi>Frogs</hi> do not love <hi>Wine,</hi> but had rather drink <hi>water:</hi> thus, the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> do tell us, that the Scripture is ambiguous, and chuſe rather to truſt upon the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> than the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> it ſelf.</p>

He liveth moſt under ground, and is nouriſhed chiefly by the vapours of the earth; but yet ſometimes he eateth herbs, and worms; ſome ſay that he feedeth upon the earth it ſelf; he eateth as much at one time as he can hold in one of his feet: ſome Authors do conceive that the reaſon why he eateth no more at one time, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feareth that the earth will not be enough for him; whence came the picture of a <hi>covetous old woman</hi> ſtanding upon a <hi>Toad.</hi> 3. The <hi>Toad</hi> is a

The ſpider and the <hi>Toad</hi> have a great hatred one to the other, yet the ſpider alwaies hath the better of it; he cometh down by a ſmall web, and lighteth upon his head, and pricketh him, or rather biteth him. It is a known Story, that <hi>Conradus Geſner</hi> reciteth out of <hi>Cardinal Foncetto,</hi> concerning the <hi>Toad,</hi> in theſe words; One taking up a <hi>reed</hi> in the field, there was a <hi>Toad</hi> at one end of it; he perceiving that, threw it out of his hand; and returning home, when he was at dinner, he vomited up all that he eat, neither did any thing ſtay with him that he took, untill another gave it him; not perceiving the reaſon of it at firſt; afterwards, he conſidered that the Cane which he took in the field was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, which he found to be ſo; the <hi>Toad</hi> having left a kind of viſcous, thick matter, which was not able to pierce the skin, and ſo could not prove mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: thus far <hi>Foncettus;</hi> and <hi>Geſner</hi> goeth on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reciteth a ſtory out of <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and diſcourſeth at large concerning the <hi>Toads</hi> poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of herbs, <hi>which he doth by ſittilng upon them, and ſending forth a poyſonous moiſture upon the leaves, which ſpreadeth all over the herb, and doth poyſon the herbs that are next to it;</hi> thus far <hi>Geſner.</hi> We may now conſider, a little, the ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that God gave to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> about the difference between thoſe creatures that were clean, and thoſe that were unclean; and that they
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54366:126"/>
were not to touch thoſe creatures which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; neither were they to touch any <hi>dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes:</hi> we read alſo, how thoſe men that were unclean by the touching of any unclean creature, were to be ſeparated for a time: there were alſo ſeveral laws given to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeveral waſhings; for thoſe perſons that were any waies unclean, and alſo all the <hi>ceremonial laws,</hi> had their particular uſes, and <hi>typical</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, yet they all contained ſomething that was moral: and among other things, this may be one, which is in the <hi>Story</hi> related before: thus we fee in Gardens, the little worms that are upon the herbs and fruit; yet we commonly touch the graſs with our hands, and eat fruit, never waſhing them again before we eat, when we know not what poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous humors are in the graſs that we ſo freely handle: we ſee that <hi>Cats, Mice, Flyes,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> do <hi>bepiſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>There is a Story in <hi>Herodotus, Lib.</hi> 2. that is worth the peruſing; Concerning the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Sethon;</hi> This <hi>Sethon</hi> would not indulge the <hi>Egyptian Souldiers</hi> ſo much as the former Kings had done; and therefore, when <hi>Senacharib</hi> had invaded <hi>Egypt,</hi> none of the <hi>Souldiers</hi> would come in to his help; whereupon he implor'd the <hi>Oracle,</hi> and in a <hi>dream</hi> it was revealed to him that it ſhould go well with him notwithſtanding; he truſting to this, with a few <hi>Spartans</hi> reſolves to meet the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> and coming neer, in the night-time, they did perceive that a company of <hi>field-mice</hi> had eaten off the <hi>feathers</hi> from their <hi>arroms,</hi> by which they being diſabled for fighting, were forced to flye the next day, and were purſued by <hi>Sethon,</hi> who ſlew many of them. Afterwards they did erect a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument</hi> in <hi>honour</hi> of him; with this Inſcription:

               <p>We might deduce ſeveral things from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>mouſe,</hi> from whence we have both caution, and inſtruction.</p>

            <head>Of mix'd four-footed Creatures.</head>
            <p>HItherto we have <hi>explained</hi> the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of thoſe creatures that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54366:130"/>
by their <hi>own ſpecies.</hi> It remaineth now that we ſpeak of thoſe that are begotten of creatures of <hi>divers kinds,</hi> which are chiefly to be found in <hi>Africa;</hi> that being a barren Countrey, and very dry, ſeveral kind of beaſts drinking at one <hi>River:</hi> wherefore it cometh to paſs, that creatures of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds <hi>copulate</hi> one with another: Hence cometh thoſe divers mix'd creatures, as the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,</hi> the <hi>Mule:</hi> the <hi>Leopard</hi> is generated of the <hi>Libard</hi> and the <hi>Lioneſs:</hi> The <hi>Lion</hi> being of a hot temper, doth not ſo often <hi>copulate;</hi> but the <hi>Lioneſs</hi> is a very leacherous creature, and therefore ſhe ſuffereth her ſelf to be covered with a <hi>Libard:</hi> when ſhe groweth big, ſhe runneth into the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as if ſhe went to take her prey, that there ſhe might bring forth without any danger. She bringeth forth a <hi>Leopard,</hi> a creature like a <hi>Lion,</hi> and a <hi>Libard;</hi> which, if the <hi>Lion</hi> find, he teareth in pieces; but to prevent it, the <hi>Lioneſs</hi> alwaies bringeth forth in ſome ſolitary place. Thus, the <hi>Camelopardalis,</hi> a creature like the <hi>Camel,</hi> and the <hi>Panther,</hi> is generated by them two: ſo, the <hi>Mule</hi> of the <hi>Aſſe</hi> and the <hi>Mare;</hi> and ſometimes of the <hi>Bull</hi> and the <hi>Aſſe:</hi> ſo, ſometimes <hi>Dogs</hi> are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of the <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Dog,</hi> and ſometimes of the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Dog:</hi> thus is the <hi>Lypopanther</hi> begot of the <hi>Wolf</hi> and <hi>Panther:</hi> ſo alſo in <hi>Rhoetia</hi> there is oftentimes a creature generated of the <hi>Ram,</hi> and <hi>ſhe-Goat,</hi> his fore-parts reſembling a <hi>Sheep,</hi> and his hinder-parts a <hi>Goat;</hi> and I wiſh that theſe <hi>mix'd coitus</hi> were to be found among beaſts only; for we find even men too often guilty of it. <hi>Plutarch</hi>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:54366:130"/>
relateth of one <hi>Plinius,</hi> who ſaith that he himſelf ſaw a <hi>Crocodile</hi> lying with a woman: other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might be brought to <hi>illustrate</hi> this; as, of the <hi>Girl</hi> that was born of a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>ſhe-Aſs;</hi> but ſuch <hi>births</hi> are ſo ordered by <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that they never <hi>live long;</hi> neither do they alwaies <hi>beget again,</hi> though ſometimes they do ſo. <hi>Herodotus,</hi> Lib. 4. ſaith, that in the <hi>Babiloniſh Siege,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Xerxes Army,</hi> a <hi>Mule</hi> brought forth moſt commonly. There may be a reaſon given of moſt Monſters; ſo, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Thales Mileſius,</hi> who was invited to a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> with other grave <hi>Seniors,</hi> to the houſe of one <hi>Periandrus;</hi> there was for one diſh a little <hi>Infant</hi> brought in, that was begotten of a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Mare;</hi> his head, neck, and hands, were like other childrens, and his cry was alſo the ſame; but all his other parts were like a <hi>horſe;</hi> ſeveral gave their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it: <hi>Diocles</hi> judged it to be a miracle, or prodigie, portending diſſentions, wars, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: but <hi>Thales</hi> was of another opinion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them, that all who looked after horſes ſhould be married men; for they committed this <hi>horrid, beaſtly act,</hi> for want of Wives. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> relateth, in his 7<hi>th.</hi> Book, <hi>Ennead.</hi> 6. under <hi>Martin</hi> the 4<hi>th. P. R.</hi> of one who was a-kin to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that brought forth a <hi>hairy boy,</hi> who had claws like a <hi>Bear:</hi> he was very much troubled at it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the pictures of <hi>Bears</hi> to be pulled down in all places. Thoſe men are much to be blamed, who at Feaſts do diſguiſe themſelves in frightful <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,</hi> the ſight of which may prove exceeding
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54366:131"/>
dangerous: when as we ought earneſtly to implore Heaven that we may not be puniſhed with ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed children; for the ſight of ſuch things do very ſtrangely work upon the <hi>fancy</hi> of <hi>women</hi> with child: hence it is, that oftentimes when women look upon <hi>hares,</hi> they bring forth their children with <hi>hare-lips;</hi> ſo, ſome have brought forth their young ones with horns, ſeeing the picture of <hi>Actae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who was turned into a <hi>Hart:</hi> and therefore we have horſes of divers colours, when the <hi>Mare</hi> ſtandeth in a <hi>Stable</hi> where ſhe ſeeth hangings of ſeveral colours. We read of a <hi>Bitch</hi> that lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the ſoft wool of a <hi>Ram,</hi> brought forth her <hi>puppies</hi> with a <hi>main.</hi> Thus <hi>Damaſcene</hi> relateth of a <hi>woman,</hi> who, continually almoſt, looking upon the picture of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> brought forth her child <hi>hairy</hi> all over its body. <hi>Quintilian</hi> cleared a <hi>woman</hi> who was accuſed for lying with her ſervant, becauſe the infant was <hi>black,</hi> when he found the image of an <hi>Aethiopian</hi> in her chamber. There are five things go to the making up of a mixt creature, (man, not being content with the ordinary courſe of Nature, firſt invented thoſe promiſcuous coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of one creature with another.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe creatures that thus <hi>copulate</hi> muſt not be much bigger one than another; therefore it is that the <hi>dog</hi> and the <hi>horſe</hi> cannot <hi>copulate,</hi> but the <hi>Wolf</hi> and the <hi>Dog;</hi> the <hi>Aſſe</hi> and the <hi>Horſe,</hi> the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the <hi>Panther:</hi> and hence it is that man, by a <hi>horrible act against nature,</hi> hath <hi>copulated</hi> with <hi>Mares, Swine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe <hi>creatures</hi> cannot <hi>capulate</hi> together,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54366:131"/>
when one carries their <hi>young longer</hi> than the <hi>other;</hi> therefore a <hi>Dog</hi> cannot be begotten of a <hi>Woman,</hi> nor a <hi>horſe</hi> by an <hi>Elephant;</hi> for a <hi>woman</hi> carryeth her <hi>infant</hi> nine moneths, but a <hi>Bitch</hi> not above ſeven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt be <hi>prone to luſt,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Dogs, Goats, Swine, Aſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It muſt be done at a <hi>convenient time,</hi> which, with moſt creatures, is the <hi>Spring;</hi> for ſo it hath been found by experience, that ſome creatures are more <hi>leacherous</hi> at one time of the year than at another; for there are very few creatures which at all times are <hi>equally</hi> prone to luſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is neceſſary that they be <hi>both young,</hi> that ſo the one may be the better able to give ſeed, and the other to receive it: and, although it be thus qualified, yet they do not do it <hi>voluntarily,</hi> but are compelled unto it by thoſe that look after them, that ſo they may have new ſorts of creatures. But, the reaſon why the <hi>Ancients</hi> uſed to <hi>compell crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to theſe <hi>promiſcuous</hi> couplings was, that thoſe creatures were much ſtronger than other creatures which are not ſo generated. In <hi>India</hi> formerly thoſe <hi>Dogs</hi> which were begotten of a <hi>Tyger</hi> were incredibly ſtrong, and very fierce. Thus <hi>Philes,</hi> that wiſe King, as alſo <hi>Aelian</hi> maketh mention of an <hi>Indian Dog</hi> of <hi>Aleuander</hi>'s the Great, that was preſented to him by an <hi>Indian King,</hi> which <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> commanded ſhould be brought upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and that a <hi>great Bore</hi> ſhould be let looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; the <hi>Dog</hi> would not ſtir, as ſcorning to meddle with it, thinking it was not worthy of his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54366:132"/>
anger: not long after, a <hi>Bear</hi> was brought upon the <hi>Stage;</hi> the <hi>Dog</hi> looked upon him, but would not ſtir: laſt of all was brought a <hi>Lion;</hi> the <hi>Dog,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw him, flyeth at him, and bit him ſo hard, that he made his teeth meet, and there held him: <hi>Alexander</hi> commanded that one of his legs ſhould be cut off; the <hi>Dog</hi> endured it with ſo much courage as if it had not been his own leg that had been cut off; another of his legs was cut off, and ſo a third; and then they cut off the other alſo, the <hi>Dog</hi> yet keeping his hold; but afterwards they cut off his head; yet his teeth were as hard ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as when he was alive: we may judge of other creatures by what hath been ſaid of this. And as, although all <hi>right lines</hi> are equal, yet <hi>crooked lines</hi> differ one from another, and there are many ſorts of them; ſo that it is impoſſible to ſet down the ſeveral kinds of them; Thus, I think, it is a very difficult thing to ſet down the ſeveral ſorts of mix'd Creatures; and therefore I have ſpoken only of the <hi>Camelopardalis,</hi> the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and the <hi>Mule;</hi> of which laſt I am now to ſpeak. It is a noted <hi>Story</hi> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Aelian</hi> relate of a <hi>Mule</hi> that was loaden with <hi>ſalt,</hi> if he went through any water that was ſo deep that the ſalt was wet, he found it grew lighter and lighter eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day than other: the next time he went through any water, he plunged himſelf in over head and ears: <hi>Thales</hi> the next day commanded that he ſhould be loaden with <hi>ſpunges,</hi> which he perceiving to grow heavier by being dipped in the water, would never lye down in the water any more when
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54366:132"/>
he was loaden with ſalt. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Croeſus</hi> was called a <hi>Mule</hi> by the <hi>Oracle,</hi> becauſe his Father was a <hi>Perſian,</hi> and his Mother a <hi>Lydian:</hi> but he not underſtanding it, could not believe that that <hi>Oracle</hi> ſhould ſo highly affront him, on whom he had beſtowed ſo many gifts: but his miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the <hi>Oracle</hi> had like to have been his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine: the more curious may read the <hi>Story</hi> at large in the <hi>Book of Herodotus.</hi> I noted before, out of <hi>Aelian,</hi> concerning the <hi>Indian Apes,</hi> which they could not bring into their Cities, becauſe of their <hi>leacherouſneſs;</hi> nay, they could hardly be kept off from aſſaulting the <hi>women</hi> themſelves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe <hi>Monſters</hi> that we have now been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of are not alwaies <hi>miraculous:</hi> and therefore I very much commend the judgement of <hi>Thales,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> of whom we ſpake but a little above. Theſe creatures may reſemble thoſe men who either in the <hi>Church,</hi> or in a <hi>War,</hi> own neither ſide, but ſtand as <hi>Neuters.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were forbidden to let their <hi>Cattel gender with divers kinds, Lev.</hi> 19. They were alſo forbid <hi>to till their fields with an Oxe and an Aſſe together;</hi> and as they were not <hi>to ſow the ground with mixed grain;</hi> ſo, neither were they <hi>to wear a garment made of linnen and woollen:</hi> by all which we are to learn what we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 16. to avoid the <hi>leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> exponndeth thus, that we ſhould not <hi>ſtand in the counſel of the ungodly:</hi> In former times the <hi>Grecians</hi> condemned thoſe perſons to dye, who in time of <hi>War,</hi> or any other <hi>diſturbance,</hi> did not take one ſide or another; but becauſe the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54366:133"/>
               <hi>Mule</hi> is more known than any of the former, I ſhall ſpeak to it by way of <hi>corollary,</hi> and draw two or three inferences from the nature of it. 1. The <hi>Mule</hi> is neither a <hi>Horſe</hi> nor an <hi>Aſs,</hi> but between both: ſo, thoſe which ſtand <hi>Neuters</hi> in a cauſe, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot not cold, as is ſaid in the <hi>Apocalyps. Chap.</hi> 5. But yet it is added alſo there, that ſhe ſhould be either <hi>hot</hi> or <hi>cold:</hi> Moreover, <hi>Mules</hi> are barren; ſo theſe <hi>hypocrites</hi> are barren and empty of all that is good. <hi>Mules</hi> do carry very great <hi>burthens:</hi> thoſe men likewiſe that do ſtand <hi>neuter,</hi> are oftentimes troubled and vexed by both ſides, like to thoſe men that <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus we have finiſhed the firſt part of our Diſcourſe, wherein we have ſpoken to the nature and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>four-footed Creatures.</hi>
