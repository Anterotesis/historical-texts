            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rodigies have bin in many or the most
times, and prodigious births almost in
all ages. For the first, the best Authors
affirme, that when the <hi>Tarquins</hi> were
banisht <hi>Rome,</hi> a Serpent was heard to
barke, and a Dogge to speake; and that
in the second punick Warre, an Oxe
pronounced these words, <hi>Cave tibi Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
Three Suns were seene at once<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> when <hi>Spurius Posthumus</hi>
and <hi>Quintus Nimutius</hi> were Consulls; and three Moones
when <hi>Curius Dometius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Aneus</hi> bore the like
Authority: Milke and blood, Wooll, and peeces of Flesh
have dropt from the Clouds upon the earth in severall
showers; burning Shields have bin seene in the ayre; shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
fire from the setting of the Sun, to the breake of day;
with a noise of the clashing of armour, and the sound of
Trumpets, and other Military instruments. &amp;c. And in the
Mutinensian Fields, two great Mountaines removed the
one towards the other, and fought a terrible combate; fire


<pb facs="tcp:17986:3"/>
and smoake being seeing to issue from either, in whose mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all the neighbour and adjacent Villages, were not
onely shaken, but utterly demolisht; and all the Animals
both men, and beasts, within many furlongs of that prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
conflict, were exeminated and slaine. Infinite almost
are the Histories of the like presidents, which for brevities
sake I omit; let therefore these few suffice for many.</p>
            <p>I come now to prodigious Births, of which this woman
now in agitation is the sole Argument; and that it may
appeare the more probable, to any that shall call the truth
thereof in question; I shall intreate such but to looke backe
into the Histories of the times past. <hi>Herodatus,</hi> and divers
Authors have left recorded; that when <hi>Xerxes</hi> first prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his Invincible Army to invade <hi>Greece,</hi> a Mare instead
of a Colt, brought forth an Hare, which was a presage of
his flight, and base defeate. In the yeare of Grace one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
foure hundred fifty sixe, <hi>Calixtus</hi> the third, then being
Pope, a Cow brought forth a Calfe with two heads, and
bodies incorporate in one; and in the Isle of <hi>Cous</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi>
an Ewe, of the flocke of one <hi>Nicippus</hi> an Heardsman, eaned
a Lion; which was as a prediction that he should attaine to
the Soveraignty thereof, which accordingly hapned; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neede wee much to question these, when our owne
Native soyle, and these our Moderne times, have produc'd
the like brutish monsters; publickly to be seene in all parts
of the City and Suburbes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I come now to humane Births, beginning with those
forraigne, and ending with the domesticke; about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Marsick Warre, one <hi>Alcippe,</hi> a woman of
especiall note, at the time of her childing, was delivered of
an Elephant; and another (whose name is not left unto us
of) a Serpent. In <hi>Thessaly,</hi> one was brought to bed of an
infant which had the shape of an Hypocentaure, and expired
the same day that it received breath. And in the yeare that
<hi>Haniball</hi> beseiged and utterly subverted <hi>Sagunthus:</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of the same City brought forth a Son, which was no
sooner borne, but voluntarily and of its owne accord, crept
backe into the mothers wombe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17986:3"/>
               <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> writes of a woman in <hi>Germany,</hi> who
brought into the world from her owne body fifty sonnes,
five at a birth, but not any of them lived to be three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a yeere old. And <hi>Avicen</hi> telleth us of another who
was delivered of two and twenty abortive Children at
severall times, of all which not one of them breathe one
vitall Aire.</p>
            <p>I fall now immediatly upon the party before propounded.
In a place in <hi>Holland,</hi> called <hi>Wirkham,</hi> being a neuter
Towne; as lying betwixt <hi>Holland</hi> and those parts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Empire, on the River <hi>Rhine,</hi> lived on <hi>Ioachim
Skinker,</hi> whose wife name was <hi>Parnel,</hi> a man of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
but of a great estate in money and cattle: these two
having very lovingly lived together, without any issue, to
succeed them in their goods and inheritance: it being, no
small griefe unto them, that either strangers, or some of
their owne ungrateful Kindred should after death enjoy
those meanes, for which they had so laboriously travail'd:
when they were in their greatest despaire, it hapned thus,
she found her selfe conceived with childe, which was a
greater joy and comfort to her and her husband: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were unthankful for such an unexpected blessing,
or what other thing was the cause, I am not able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
but so it hapned, that in the yeere 1618, she was safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered of a Daughter, all the limbes and lineaments
of her body, well featur'd and proportioned, only her face,
which is the ornament and beauty of all the rest, had the
Nose of a Hog, or Swine: which was not only a stain and
blemish, but a deformed uglinesse, making all the rest loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
contemptible and odious to all that lookt upon her in
her infancie.</p>
            <p>If the joy of the parents was great in the hope of a
Childe, how much greater may wee conjecture their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
were, to be the parents of such a monster: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with themselves what Heavens would have, they
had not power to hinder, and studying (as farre as in them
lay) to conceale their shame, they so farre mediated with
the Mid wife and the other women that were present at the


<pb facs="tcp:17986:4"/>
delivery, that they should keepe it as close and secret as it
was possible to doe: and they called the name of it
<hi>Tannakin,</hi> which is as much in English as <hi>Anne,</hi> or
<hi>Hann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>h.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This prodigle <hi>Ravisius Textor</hi> also remembreth us of a
female Monster called <hi>Marin,</hi> who from the navill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
had the effigies of a faire and beautifull woman, but
from thence downward had the true shape of a well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
Mare, with foure feet, a taile, and every limbe
and member corresponding to an Equinall figure, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
an hundred 23 yeeres. In the Bishopricke of <hi>Colen</hi>
a woman, some thinke a Witches Curse, some otherwise,
brought forth into the World at one birth one hundred
threescore and five children: all which though they were
of wondrous small stature, yet they were borne with life,
and christned, and a monument remaynes for them to this
day, her prayer or curse being, that shee might have as
many children at one birth, as there were dayes in the
yeere. Monsters have been borne within these few yeeres
in <hi>Virginia, New England,</hi> and other Colonies of our own
Plantation, of which it is now too long to insist. And the
like prodigious is now, that a Gentleman of quality
within these moneth died, who being opened, in his heart
was found a worme in the forme of a Serpent, which stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out, was found to be sixteene inches long.</p>
            <p>But if we shall be any way jealous of the trruth of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Antiquity, let us but looke backe upon our selves, I
will give unto you a few instances for many: not to speake
of those which have preposterously come into the world
with their Feet forward, and born with Teeth in their
head, as <hi>Richard</hi> the Third of that name King of <hi>England,</hi>
and others. Twin Children have beene borne amongst us
with two heads and bodies from the Gird lested upward,
and but two legs and feet to support them both, and when
one of them dyed, the other survived, but not many houres
after: A Scotch childe, about two yeeres since, was to bee
seen in <hi>Barthlomew</hi> Faire, a Girle about the age of seven
yeeres, who was so hairy, hands, armes, face, and body, that


<pb facs="tcp:17986:4"/>
you would have thought <hi>Orson</hi> to have bin her Father, and
some she Beare her mother, yet had she her speech, sences,
and all other deportments of a child of her age; who
had bin well educated and instructed. But to leave all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
and come to the purpose now in hand, I will onely
remember unto you a very handsome young man, late (if
not now) in Towne, whose picture hath bin publickely
set out to the common view, and himselfe to bee seene for
money; who from one of his sides hath a twin brother
growing, which was borne with him, and living still <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
though having sence and feeling, yet destitute of reason and
understanding: whence me thinkes a disputable question
might arise, whether as they have distinct lives, so they are
possessed of two soules; or have but one imparted betwixt
them both: but of this let the Philosophers, or rather the
Divines argue and Define, being I must ingeniously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
an Argument much above my element.</p>
            <p>This prodigious birth though it was knowne to some
few, yet was it not made popular &amp; spoken of by all, which
the Father and mother, for their owne reputations and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
were very carefull to maintaine; so that it was never
seene by any (being an infant bare-fac'd) but vaild and
covered, and so brought up in a private Chamber, both fed
and taught by the Parents onely; and her deformity scarce
knowne to any of the Servants: and as the daughter grew
in stature, so the Father also increased with wealth; so that
he was accounted to be one of the richest men in all that
Country. Now how she came to be borne with such defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
there be divers and sundry conjectures; but if we may
Judge the cause by the effect, and of the preceedent by the
subsequent; most probable it is that it came by Witchcraft:
And that there be such, we have manifest proofe; for in
<hi>Skedam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> there is scarce a man or woman but
they are either <hi>Magi,</hi> or <hi>Sagae;</hi> that is, men or women
witches: but for the last wee neede no further witnesse,
then that of the <hi>Lancashiere</hi> witches some few yeares since;
of which I make no doubt, but this whole City hath taken
especiall notice of. &amp;c. Now whether Witches have


<pb facs="tcp:17986:5"/>
power to effascinate an inant in the wombe of the mother,
may be a question; of which after some illustrations by
knowne examples (without any tedious Deviation) I hope
to gaine the Reader ample satisfaction.</p>
            <p>History tells us that the Witch <hi>Circe,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Sol,</hi>
and the Nimphe <hi>Persae,</hi> who dwelt not farre from <hi>Caietu,</hi> a
City of <hi>Campania,</hi> by her sorcerous Spells and Incantations,
changed divers of <hi>Vlisses</hi> his companions into Swine: if
she had such power over the whole, no wonder then if a
Witch in these dayes, by the helpe of her Father the Divell,
cannot disguise the face which is but a part. It hath beene
knowne also in our knowne Country, when a Gentlewoman
of good discent and quality hath brought an infant into the
World with a live Snake wrapt about the necke and body:
in memory of which, that Noble Family in the emblazon
of their Armes, give the Snake ever unto this day: which
accident is quite against nature, and therefore can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon nothing but Diabolicall Sorcery and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.
I could tell you of the like prodigious things done by
<hi>Medea, Micale, Erecto Magun, Dipsas, Aeriphala, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custa,
Guthurna, Canidia Neopolitana, Sagana, Vera, Folia,</hi>
and infinite others: but though I study brevity, give mee
leave to give thee this short Character.</p>
            <p>Their power is by the permission of the higher powers,
and instigated by the malice of the Divells, to transhape
men into beasts; make barren fields, blast Corne, unfructify
Trees, parch and wither Grasse and Hearbes; bring scabs
and diseases upon men, and murraine and rot upon Heards
and Flockes: effascinate the eyes, weaken the hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbe
the feete &amp;c. Now to prove that this Child was
bewitched in the wombe, there be these pregnant reasons
following.</p>
            <p>It is credibly reported, that this Burgers wife having
conceived, an old woman suspected for a Witch, came to
begge of her an Almes, but she being at the busied about
some necessary affaires gave her a short and neglectfull an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
at which she went away muttering to her selfe the
Divells <hi>pater noster,</hi> and was heard to say; <hi>As the Mother is


<pb facs="tcp:17986:5"/>
Hoggish, so  Swinish shall be the Child shee goeth withall:</hi>
which is a great probability that the infants deformity
came by the malitious Spells, and divelish murmurations of
this wicked woman; who after for the like, or worse
practises both upon men women and children, whom shee
had bewitched unto death, being brought within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the Law; and after to suffer at the stake: amongst
many other things confessed as much as I have before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
yet either out of her perverse obstinacy would not, or
else (the Divell forsaking her in extreamity, as he doth all
his other servants) in her deficiency of power, could not
uncharme her: yet by this means that which was before kept
so private, was now publickly discovered to the World;
insomuch that much confluence of people came to see the
progedy, which wearied the Father, and cast a blush upon
the cheekes of the good woman the mother: some desirous
to heare her speake, whose language was onely the Dutch
Hoggish Houghs, and the Piggs French Owee, Owee, for
other words she was not able to utter; which bred in some
pitty, in others laughter, according to their severall
dispositions.</p>
            <p>Others were importunate to see her feede, then milke
and the like was brought unto her in a silver Trough; to
which she stooped and eate, just as a Swine doth in his
swilling Tub; which the more mirth it bred in the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
increased in the Parents the more melancholy: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he bethought himselfe to finde out some meanes,
(if it were possible) either to mend or end his sorrowes.
And to that purpose, hearing of a famous Artist, who was
both a Mathematician, and an Astrologian (whose name
was <hi>Vandermast</hi>) and lived not farre from him; a man who
was suspected to have bin well verst in blacke and hidden
Arts<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to him he repaired, and when he had made knowne
his griefes by every circumstance; he desired of him some
present remedy, for which hee would bee no way
ingratefull.</p>
            <p>Who after some pause told him, that after some houres
attendance he would returne him an answer, the one way


<pb facs="tcp:17986:6"/>
or the other; wch gave him some smal satisfaction, though not
full to his expectation: but having waited his leasure, hee
returned according to the time prefixt, told him that hee
could wish him to marry her at any rate whatsoever; for
whilst she continued in the estate of a Virgin, there was no
hope of her recovery; but if then she received any helpe,
or he comfort, though both seemed beyond all hopes; yet
he advised him patiently to attend the successe, but howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
not to match her unto Clowne, Bore, or Pesant; but to
a gentleman at least. In which answer though he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
of nothing (being so mistericall and doubtfull,) yet
there was no reason for him to despaire of any thing: so
that having bountifully rewarded the Artist, hee repaired
backe to his owne house, and acquainted his wife with the
passage of the whole businesse; where they long consulted
betwixt themselves, what were best in this difficult case
to bee done.</p>
            <p>After much reasoning <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> they concluded to
put her into very rich and costly habit (but her face still
vaild and covered) and to give out that what gentleman of
fashion or quality soever, would take her to his bed after
loyall Matrimony, (for she was at this time betwixt sixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
and seventeene yeares of age, and therefore marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
should receive for a Dowry with her, forty thousand
pound, payed downe in Starling and Currant money.
<hi>This was a baite sufficient to make every Fish to bite at, for no
sooner was this publickely divulged, but there came Suitors of
all sorts; insomuch that his Gates were thronged as at an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry,
or rather as a Lottery, every one in hope to carry away the
great Prize of forty thousand pound; for it was not the person,
but the prize at which they aimed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thinkes with him selfe, so the body bee handsome,
though her countenance be never so course and ugly, all
are alike in the night; and in the day time, put her head
but in a blacke bagge, and what difference betwixt her
and another woman. Another comforteth him selfe thus:
<hi>That if shee cannot speake, shee cannot chide; and therefore
hee shall be sure not to have a scold to his wife.</hi> Another appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,


<pb facs="tcp:17986:6"/>
               <hi>That if shee feede but one wash and the like, shee will
not be very chargeable to him for her Dyet; and therefore hee
shall have a good bargaine by the match.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These and the like inducements were so farre preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
with them, that they came from divers places, and
Countries, to solicite her for marriage: some from <hi>Italy,</hi>
some from <hi>France,</hi> some from <hi>Scotland,</hi> some from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and every one of them howsoever debosht in their
meanes, and more studdying upon her meanes then the
maide, put all their Fortunes upon the hazard of an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
suite, to appeare like gentlemen; because otherwise
they could have no admittance into her company.</p>
            <p>But to give you better information, then by these suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,
or rather stupid conceits for her order of Diet; <hi>She
doth eate all those meates which commonly we doe feede on, and
doth digest it very naturally; onely shee doth feede in a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Trough, or Bole; which is alwayes carried with her
wheresoever shee doth remove: and if shee doth want any thing
that shee hath a mind unto, bee it Apparrell, or Dyet, she doth
write her mind; and by that meanes, (as wee are given to
understand, by those which have seene her) she hath all things
to her desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst some Sutors came a <hi>Scotch man</hi> being a Captiane,
who having hazarded the greatest part of a months pay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
one Suite of Cloaths, was desirous to see this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
and was received by the Parents; who thinking
him to be some great Leard in his Country, gave him gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
entertainement: she was brought unto him with her
face covered, and in an habit which might well have fuited
the greatest Lady in the Land; who admiring her feature
and proportion, was much inamoured of her person, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to see her face discovered, when hee beheld it; hee
would stay no other conference, but ran away without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer, saying; they must pardon him, for hee could
<hi>indure no Porke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next came a Sowce-man, borne in <hi>England</hi> having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodated
himselfe for the same adventure, and presuming
that loving Sowce so well, no Hogs-face could affright
him; he presently at the sight of her could endure her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany


<pb facs="tcp:17986:7"/>
no longer, and at his farewell, said, so long as I have
known <hi>Rumford,</hi> I never saw such a Hogsnout, but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
my stomack shall serve for any such dish, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
venter upon any raw, but I will be sure it shall be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
well boyled or rosted.</p>
            <p>A Taylor came, having borrowed (whether with leave,
or without I know not) a costly suite of one of his best cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers:
and he vowed notwithstanding, all impediments
whatsoever interdicting him, hee would enjoy her, and
marry her, and sleep with her close as Hogs in pease-straw,
but though hee liked her feature when her face was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
he gave back, and vowed he would not go through
stitch with any such businesse. I should but lose my selfe in
writing, and tyre the Reader in turning over many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
leaves of paper, to shew you here many severall
men and of sundry conditions, came in a kinde of jealousie
one of another, to purchase this masse or magazine of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
every one ambitious after the portion, but not one
amongst them amorous of the person, whose countenance
was so farre from seeming lovely to them, that it appeared
altogether lothsome, and so I will leave her in this exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
to acquaint you with a short story, that the carriage of
the one, may make the other appeare more probable, they
being of like affinity. My Authour is <hi>Iohn Gower,</hi> and thus
it hapned.</p>
            <p>A noble and warlike Knight, Cousin to the Emperour
<hi>Claudius,</hi> of a spirit undaunted, and honour unquestioned,
named <hi>Florentius,</hi> as he rid upon an adventure, was taken
prisoner by a Captain of a Castle, whose sonne hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
slaine in battell, willing they were to put him to
death, but they much feared the indignation and revenge
of the Emperour his Uncle: and hee being then in their
power, they held a consultation amongst themselves what
was best to be done, and where divers projects were laid:
the mother to this Captaine, and Grandmother; to <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
before by him slaine, said, That shee had a plot to make
him accessary to his owne death without any displeasure
from the Emperour or any of his noble Allies, nay, that he
himselfe should assent thereunto without the least taxation
of any injustice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17986:7"/>
And to that purpose, she sent for him out of prison, and
thus said: Though for the death of my Grand child, <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eus</hi>
both his Father and my selfe might take just venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of thee, since thy life is forfeited into our hands. Yet
upon condition, that thou wilt resolve me of one question,
which I shall propound thee: thou shalt have liberty for
three moneths, but if not in that space thou canst not give
a full solution of my demand, thou shalt here take thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
oath as thou art a Knight, to returne back again unto
this Castle, where thou art now our prisoner and vassall,
and yield thy selfe up to a voluntary death, freely acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us of the fact to thine Uncle the Emperour.</p>
            <p>This being concluded, as well by oath as obligation in
writing, sealed and subscribed, the question was, <hi>What thing
above all other, women most desire?</hi> Imagine him now free,
on horseback, and in his way to Court, where being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and demanding of the wisest and gravest Philosophers,
and others to be resolved in this point, and withall telling
them of his own danger, if it were not answered. Every
one were of severall opinions: one said Pleasure, another
Pride, some that they desired most to be praysed and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
so that in this diversity of censures, he was forc'd to
depart thence unsatisfied: now he whose honour was more
precious unto him then the preserving of a thousand lives,
resolved to yield up his body according to covenant, and
riding through a Forrest, some few leagues distant from the
Castle, pondring a thousand things in his perplexed head,
he casting his eye aside, spied an old withered and decrepit
Hag of the most ugly and lothsome aspect that ever his eyes
beheld, who stepping unto him, and taking his horse by
the bridle, said: <hi>Florens</hi> I know thee, and that thou art now
going to thy certain death, but be advised by me, and (upon
condition) I will save both thy life and honour: Blame
him not, if being now in his flourishing youth, he gave her
a willing care, and cheerfully, demanded of her what gift
she would have? or what taske impose him? who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered: That when hee had resolved the Beldam of
her question (by her means) and had gained his life and
liberty, hee should returne to that place where hee then


<pb facs="tcp:17986:8"/>
found her, and from thence beare her to his place of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and make her his wife.</p>
            <p>Which when he heard he was now in a double distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as preferring many deaths before such a loathsome and
unequall match: and so left her without reply. But better
considering with himselfe, that being so old she could not
live long; and being married, it was in his power to mew
her up from the sight of men: with other the like apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
(and life being sweet) he turned backe, and swore
by his Kinight-hood, he would doe all that she demanded:
which being agreed betwixt them, she told him, that when
the question was againe propounded: <hi>What thing above all
other, women most desire?</hi> he should answer, <hi>To have their
Wills, and the Soveraignty over their Husbands.</hi> Let us Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that by this he was acquit, though to the great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
both of the Father and the Grandam, and came
backe according to his Covenant, where he met with the
former Hagge, of whom my Author in his old English,
gives this description.</p>
            <q>
               <l>She was the loathedst wight</l>
               <l>That ever man cast on his Eye:</l>
               <l>Her Nose baas, her browes hye;</l>
               <l>Her Eyes small, and deepe set,</l>
               <l>Her Cheekes beene with teares wet,</l>
               <l>And rivling as an empty skinne,</l>
               <l>Hanging downe unto the Chin:</l>
               <l>Her Lips shrunken bin for age,</l>
               <l>There was no grace in her visage:</l>
               <l>Her Front was narrow, her lookes hore;</l>
               <l>She looketh forth as doth a More, &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In whose sight she was so odious, that now he repenteth
him that he had not suffered Death rather then to bee so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
disposed of. But shee still urging him upon his
Knightly promise, he was forc't in her torne and thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
habit to take her up behind him: but so ashamed of his
burthen, that he only travailed either through woods, or by
Owle-light, till at length hee came to his owne Castle,


<pb facs="tcp:17986:8"/>
where necessity (though much against his will) compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to discover her unto the Ladie his sister, and other
of his neare Allyes, who were all much astonished and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at his wretched fortune.</p>
            <p>But she still hastning on the match, the day of marriage
came, when the Ladyes striving to tricke her up in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest
habite and best ornaments they could devise, the more
they strived to beautifie her, the more ugly and deformed
she appeared. Briefly, married they were, and bed-time
came, heaven knowes to his small comfort, and lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
the Bride-chamber was prepared, and the rooms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Brides appoyntment stucke full of lights.
The doors are shut, to bed she goes, and urgeth him to make
haste, and doe the office of an husband: who was no sooner
laid by her side, with as much distance as was possible, shee
pluckt him by the arme, and desired him to reach a Light;
and if shee could receive no other favour at his hands, yet at
least once more to looke upon her, and she would then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
him of his promise.</p>
            <p>This seeming to be an easie condition, he takes a light, and
looking stedfastly upon her, he discovered a sweet yong La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of an incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom
to his imagination he never had in his whole life time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held:
at which strange sight being much extasied, he grew
as greatly Inamoured, insomuch, that he beganne to court
her, and offered to kisse her, &amp;c. But she modestly putting
him backe, said to him as followeth: <hi>Sir, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no other than I now seeme unto you; and of these two things
I give you free choise, whether I shall appeare to you thus as
you now see me, young, faire, and lovely in your bed, and all the
daytime, and abroad, of my former deformity: or thus beautifull
in the day, to the sight of your friends, but in your armes every
night of my former Age and Vglinesse: of these two things
I give you free choise of, which till you have resolv'd me, there
can be no other familiarity betwixt in: therfore without pause
give me a speedy answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This more then all the rest distracted him: For what was
her beauty to him in the night, if she appeared to all his


<pb facs="tcp:17986:9"/>
friends so loathsome by day? or what was her rare feature
to him, either abroad amongst his friends, or at board, if she
were so odious to him in bed? therefore he said unto her:
Sweet and delicate Lady, I am confounded in your questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nor know I what to answer; but into you owne hands
and choyse I give the full power and soveraignty to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of which you best please: At which words shee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
turned towards him, and said: <hi>Now Sir, you have
given me that which all women most desire, my Will, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty;
and know I am the Kings daughter of</hi> Sicily, <hi>who by
a wicked and sorcerous step-dame was thus inchanted, never
to returne to my pristine shape, till I was first married, and after
had received such power from my Husband <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> And now from
henceforth I shall be the same to you night and day, of that
youth and lively-hood which you now see mee; till Time and
Age breed new alteration, even to the last period of my life.</hi>
At which, how incredible his joy was, I leave to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the understanding Reader, who I hope will easily
conceive what affinity this story may have with the former.</p>
            <p>I should have spoken something of her residing in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>London,</hi> as of her being in <hi>Black-Friers</hi> or <hi>Covent-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
but I can say little: onely abundance of people doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to each place to enquire the truth: some have protested
they have seene her, by the helpe of their acquaintance, and
give this reason why she will not as yet be constantly in one
place, because the multitude is so great that doe resort thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they dare not be knowne of her abiding, least by
denying the sight of her, they that owe the house should have
it pulled downe about their eares. Her portion is very
large, it being 40000 pounds; she likewise goeth very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
in aparrell, and very courteous in her kind to all.
And whosoever shall in Pamphlet, or Ballad, write or sing
otherwise than is discoursed of in this small Tract, they erre
from truth: for what is here discovered, is according to
the best, and most approved intelligence.</p>
