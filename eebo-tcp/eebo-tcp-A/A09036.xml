            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of ragged ancestry sprang from the patchings of some paltry Poet; Whence learning how to rime vnreasonably, makes this the maine-Mast of his occupation. His choisest plots or grounds to worke vpon, are drawn most commonly from theeues and murderers, or such notorious malefactors, as puts him in great hope to purchase forty pence. His
<pb facs="tcp:20619:6"/>
highest ambition he aymes at, is, to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Times intelligencer,</hi> or <hi>Nuncius of Newes</hi> at the second hand. The Punckes late Ballad of the new Bridewell was his cheife Master-peece that purchast him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a coblers paire of boots ouer &amp; aboue his vsuall bargaining Hee spends most past of his time in's bed, partly for sauing charge of botching, but chiefly deuising what were best to write on, when no one cals on him for whats to pay: <hi>Omnia mea mecum, &amp;c.</hi> may very rightly be verified in him that hath no riches more then what he weares, and comes to him commonlie by deed of gift. The Alewife is inforst to trust him weekely, and that without all hope of hauing ought vnlesse some Pallad chance to be compos'd vpon some dismall or dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accident as may be sung to the tune of welladay.

so nimble, that if any witch bee by chance condemned, hee'l haue a ballad out in print before such time as she goes to Tyburne: wherein all her confession and the manner of her death shall be described by way of Prophesie, witnesse the famous witch of <hi>Edmonton,</hi> condemned at New-gate about foure yeares past. No Printer deales with him that loues his credit, but must be thereunto induc'd for want of worke, and then the Presse begins to sweat when mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous newes comes <hi>Trundling</hi> in the way; His greatest volume done in <hi>Folio</hi> is to bee purchast but for two brasse tokens, which either you may please to light Tobacco w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or sacrifice to <hi>A-iax</hi> for purgation. In briefe, the summe of all his practices is but to shift him sometime in cleane linnen, that he appeare not louzie to posteritie, and so I leaue him.</p>

Hees a sworne wellcomer of all sorts of Drunkards that sit and call for't at their costs and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rills. His Cullionship oft-times becomes a Creditor that either must be forst to trust his betters, or cheat his Master if they pay not for it. Your Puncke or Oyster-wench (excepted onely) may score it at all times vpon bare trust, which hees contented to take out in drudgery.

Hees naturally addicted to a blew tuckt Apron with a blacke pouch thereto appendant, the chiefest Ensigne of his occupation. His greatest prouidence (caring else for nought) is to haue store of of Bottles gainst the Spring, which stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their ranks like Muskateires, may soone discharge vpon the word Giue fire: Nothing affrights him like the Brewers Clarke whose comming with his Tallies proues more terrible then is a Sergeant to a younger brother. If once he come to draw but for himselfe, or may be trusted for some halfe a brewing, theres not a peasant on the earth so proud. Hence he aspiring, hopes to get a wife (no matter of what calling or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) that soon may purchase him a house for victualling: His last of Ladders steppe proues then an Host: and further comes to bee a common Baile for such as are his

daily benefactors, that vse to drinke and call in by the dozens. In briefe, had he but wit to his vnworthinesse, hee would become more knaue then could bee corrigible, and so continue till his last of breathing.</p>

If you will speake with him in sober sadnesse, your comming must bee early in a morning, he being soon after gone to drink a match. Porters &amp; watchmen are his home conductors, that either picke his pockets by the way, or will be sure of something ere they leaue him. If in his drunken rage he kills a man, hees the next day not onely sorry for it, but must be hang'd for further satisfaction being sober: and there's the cloze of it.</p>

His modest gesture shewes him what he is, without beholding to the booke of Heraldie.
