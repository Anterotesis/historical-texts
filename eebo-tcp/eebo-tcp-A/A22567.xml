            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Plant or Drugge called Tobacco scarce knowne to this</hi> Nation in former times, was in this Age first vsually brought into this Realme in small quantity, as Medicine, and so vsed, and by diuers taken as Medicine, but in processe of time, to satisfie the inordinate appetite of a great number of men and women it hath been brought in in great quantity, and taken for wantonnesse and excesse, prouoking them to drinking and other inconueniences, to the great impairing of their healths, and deprauing of their manners, so that the care which His Maiesty hath of his people hath enforced Him to thinke of some meanes for the preuenting of the euill consequence of this immoderate vse thereof. And albeit His Maiesties dearest father of blessed memorie had giuen directions therein, as well by Proclamation as otherwise, yet those waies tooke not so good effect as was desired, for that therein was no restraint of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that should sell Tobacco by retaile, nor care taken of the quality of those that should make such sale, but Uictuallers, Tauerners, Alehousekeepers, Tapsters, Chamberlaines, Hostlers and others, of the meanest condition haue promiscuously vsed to regrate the same as allurements to other naughtinesse, keeping therein no Assize, to the preiudice of the rest of His Maiesties louing Subiects. For repressing therefore of all such excesses and for preuenting of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inconuenience, Our Soueraigne Lord the King, by the aduice of the Lords and others of His Priuie Councell hath resolued to reduce the venting, selling and vttering of Tobacco into some good order, and that none but men of sufficiency, and such as shall bring certificate of their meetnesse, shall hereafter sell or vtter any Tobacco by retaile. And to that purpose His Maiestie hath lately caused Letters from His Lords, and others of His Priuie Councell to bee directed vnto the Iustices of Peace of the seuerall Counties of this Kingdome, and Dominion of Wales, and also vnto the Maiors, Bailiffes and other chiefe Officers of diuers Cities and Townes Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate; Commanding them to certifie in what Townes and places it may bee fit to suffer selling and retailing of Tobacco, and how many in each place were fit to bee licensed to vse that Trade. In answere of which Letters, Certificates haue beene made from diuers of the Iustices of Peace, and from the Maiors, Bailiffes, and other Magistrates of diuers Cities and Townes Corporate, who therein haue acknowledged the abuses that daily arise by the vngouerned selling and retailing of Tobacco, expressing their desire of reformation.</p>
            <p>Wherupon His Maiestie by like aduice of his Counsell hath caused other Letters to be directed to the Iustices and Conseruators of the Peace in seuerall Counties; thereby declaring in what Townes and places Tobacco shall be permitted to be sold or vttered by Retayle, and hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the said Iustices and Conseruators of the Peace, to cause the names of those Townes and places specified in those Letters, to be written and affixed in publique places where the Assises and Sessions of the peace shall be kept, in those Counties, to the end that all His people may take notice that other places are not admitted or allowed for selling or vttering of Tobacco by Retaile. And by Letters directed to the said Maiors, Bayliffes, and other head Officers of Cities and Townes, His Maiestie hath giuen notice vnto them of the names of those that are permitted there to sell or deliuer Tobacco in that manner, and hath Commanded them to giue publique notice in the said Cities and Townes, of the names of those persons that are so admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to sell or deliuer it.</p>
            <p>Now our said Souereigne Lord the King doth straightly prohibite all His people, that after the feast of <hi>Candlemas</hi> next comming after the date of these presents, none of them out of the said Cities or Townes so appointed as aforesaid, or within the said Cities, or Townes, no others but those named as aforesaid, and such as from time to time shall bee permitted in like manner, doe sell or deliuer any Tobacco by Retayle, and that none of them that are permitted or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this behalfe, keepe any Tauerne, Alehouse, or Uictualling, or otherwise sell any distilled or hot Waters, Wine, Ale, Beere, or Cyder in their houses, so long as they shall bee permitted to sell Tobacco by Retayle: And for that the necessities of these times require it, His Maiestie doth charge and command all His Subiects to obey these His Ordinances, vnder the paines to bee inflicted vpon contemners of the same, and of His Royall will and pleasure, being for the good of His people: All which His pleasure is shall bee obserued vntill Hee shall by His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or Letters of His Priuie Counsell make other publique signification of His pleasure herein. And Hee doth charge and command all Iustices of Peace, and all Maiors, Bayliffes, and head Officers of all His Cities and Townes within His said Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and all those who are permitted to sell Tobacco by Retaile, that they make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent enquirie of all those that shall presume to doe against this Command, and from time to time to make certificate of their names, and places of their residence, with the particular of their contempts, to the Lords of His Maiesties Priuie Councell.</p>
