            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>] Secondly, the double qualitie, as well internall and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall [<hi>salutes, healthes, wholesome Deliuerances:</hi>] as outward and accidentall, [<hi>magnificasti</hi>] <hi>deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> beseeming a <hi>Great God</hi> whome Saint <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> calleth <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The part extensiue, is personall and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue, the <hi>Person</hi> [<hi>Dauid</hi>] First, as an eminent person [<hi>a King.</hi>] Secondly, as a sacred person [<hi>Annointed</hi>] Thirdly, as a person appropriate vnto <hi>God, [his King, his Annointed]</hi> The sucession indefinite and infinite, [<hi>vnto his seed</hi>] the number

not defined [<hi>for euermore</hi>] the time not limited.</p>
            <p>And both these generall partes, hee deriueth from these two qualities which God, by a rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated speech challengeth vnto himselfe aboue all other attributes. Psalme 62.11. <hi>Power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and vnto thee, O Lorde, mercie,</hi> In the part Intensiue [<hi>great Deliuerances</hi>] there is Gods <hi>power,</hi> both <hi>Potentia virtutis,</hi> Ephes. 6.10. <hi>The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his might</hi> (for weakenes cannot make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie rescues) then <hi>Potentia claritatis,</hi> Coloss. 1.11. <hi>The power of his glorie,</hi> [<hi>Magnificasti</hi>] for <hi>Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances</hi> cannot be obscured.</p>
            <p>In the part Extensiue, there is Gods <hi>mercie</hi> [<hi>sheweth mercyes</hi>] First, that which is called, Luke, 1.78. <hi>Misericordia viscerum,</hi> his emboweled mercie, wherewith hee tenderly and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affected <hi>Dauid:</hi> For which cause, in the title of this Psalme, (as the Latines reade it) hee is called <hi>Puer Domini,</hi> the Lordes Darling, or tenderling, and so much himselfe confesseth 22. verse, <hi>Saluum me fecit quoniam voluit me,</hi> Because hee had a fauour vnto me. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which Diuines call, <hi>Misericordia facta,</hi> not onely affecting <hi>Dauid,</hi> but also acting and perfourming mercies vnto him (for so it is here, [<hi>Misericordiam faciens</hi>] dooing mercie vnto <hi>Dauid</hi>) Thirdly, that which the Scripture calleth <hi>Misericordia custodita,</hi> Exod. 34.7.

youth of all the Nobility, and the Chiefe of that Cittie in his tuition, drawing them into the fieldes a little without the Walles, vnder pretence for their recreation, betraide them all at once into the handes of <hi>Camillus:</hi> and yet herein there is a great <hi>disparison,</hi> for they were but children, but in this case olde and young, <hi>parents</hi> and <hi>progenie,</hi> all at once, should haue beene betrayed, they were aliue, and so might be eyther raunsomed or recouered, or if slaine yet they should haue seene their death: but here without ransom or recouery; or seeing who had hurt them (for so the letter boasts) a death sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and invisible: there but the <hi>sprowtes</hi> of one Cities <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> a small <hi>territorie:</hi> heere the <hi>stem</hi> and <hi>seede Royall,</hi> with the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> of this whole <hi>Ilands Gentry</hi> and <hi>Nobility.</hi>
