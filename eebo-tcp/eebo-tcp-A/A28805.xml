            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The great Genoeſe, a Ship of 40 Guns, 327 Turks and Moors, and 88 Chriſtian
Slaves on Board. On the 16th. and 17th. of September, 1681, as it was communicated

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS comes to give you an account of my good Fortune in
taking of the Two Lyons and Crown of <hi>Algier,</hi> commonly
known and called by the Name of <hi>The Great Genoeſe,</hi> being
a Ship of Fourty and more Guns; at preſent mounted but
with 36 and four Pederoes: having on Board 327 <hi>Turkes</hi> and
<hi>Moors,</hi> and 83 Chriſtian Slaves, Commanded by one <hi>Hodge Allij</hi> a <hi>Dane</hi>
Renegado, born at <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> with a Relation of our whole Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Cruiſing alone between <hi>Cape Spartel</hi> and <hi>Cape Trafeldegar,</hi> with the
WindEaſterly, on the 16th of <hi>September,</hi> about dawning of the day, we Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a <hi>Saitee</hi> into <hi>Barach,</hi> which belonged to <hi>France.</hi> My Chaſing the <hi>Saitee</hi>
proved very lucky, for in ſtanding off from the Land, gave me ſight of
this <hi>Algerine,</hi> which I have already mentioned to you above.</p>
            <p>At my firſt giving him Chaſe, he had an Engliſh Pink in a Tow, which
he immediately cut off, ſeeing me come ſo faſt upon him, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
my coming up with him ſo faſt, he hoiſted out his Boat, and
took the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> out of the ſaid Pink, I being diſtant from him
three Leagues, two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Slaves that were in the <hi>Turks</hi> Boat, got out of
her into the Pink, and ſeeing the <hi>Turks</hi> in a great diſorder, and fear upon
them, they hid themſelves in the Pinks Hold; by which means they
made their eſcape, I coming within Call of the Pink, and ſeeing two <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen</hi>
there, I gave them order to follow me, which they did for one
hour and a half, then the Pink lay by, and I ſaw no more of her.</p>
            <p>Betwixt one and two in the Afternoon, I came up along the <hi>Algerines</hi>
Side, and after we had fired our great and ſmall Shot into her, ſhe being
very nigh, I laid him on board before I fired another Gun, much to the
<hi>Turks</hi> diſadvantage, I being ſo far forward as his Bow, lying ſo till he
ſhot my weather Brace off, of my Fore-yard, and Fore-top-Sail, he having
the Wind upon the Quarter, forced me a head of him, but before he could
get clear of me, I had time to cut away his Sprit-Sail-Yard, which fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Bow, and ſtopped his way, and I laid him on board the other Bow,
but could not get croſs his Harſer, ſo as to hinder his Ships ſteeridge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I laid him on board twice after.</p>
            <p>I having by fortune a double proportion of Hand-Granadoes, threw
them in amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> which did them great damage, and gave us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of killing them without ſmall Shot.</p>
            <p>His laſt time of cleering himſelf of me, I ſhot his Mainmaſt down, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then about 6 in the Evening, notwithſtanding the loſs of his Main-maſt,
I found him make ſtout reſiſtance, he working his Ship ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Wind, I could not board him, but to my diſadvantage, we fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill within Piſtol Shot, till eight or nine in the Evening.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Algerine</hi> having in this time ſo much diſabled me in my Maſts and
Rigging, I was forced to fall a Stern to mend my Rigging, and bring new
Top-Sails to my Yards.</p>
            <p>The loſs of my men was ſo conſiderable, that I was forced to new quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, not having one man left on my Quarter-Deck, ſaving one or
two, but was killed or wounded, which gave the <hi>Algerine</hi> opportunity of
bringing another Fore-Sail and Fore-top-Sail to his Yard, he firing moſt
part of the time his Stern-Chaſe at me, until about twelve or one at night.</p>
            <p>When I got up with him again, and continued fighting each other very
cloſe, but did not think fit to board them, by reaſon of my Maſt being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much diſabled, we fighting before the Wind, it continuing ſtill Eaſterly.</p>
            <p>About nine in the morning, having taken a man from each Gun below,
where they could beſt ſpare them, to man thoſe Guns on our Quarter-Deck,
one of the Kings Cripples being Quartered there, to carry Powder
for that place, having three Carteridges of Powder in his hand,
went into the Round-Houſe to ſecure himſelf from the Shot, we not
knowing what was become of the man, till a great Shot from the Enemy
came into the Round-Houſe, and ſhot the three Carteridges of Powder
which he had by him, which took fire, and blew him but of the Round-Houſe
upon our Quarter-Deck, and with him all our Granadoes, which
were about ſeven or eight that were left, which Granadoes did kill and
wound every man that was by me, I eſcaped very narrowly among the
reſt, being hurt in the Neck by one of the Granado Shells.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the <hi>Algerine</hi>'s Fore-Maſt went by the Board, I being
ſo advantagiouſly placed on his Bow, that he immediately called for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>When we took Poſſeſſion of our Prize, we found the Captain wounded,
and five of his Under-Captains, he having in all ſeven, four of which being
<hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Hamborough</hi> Renegadoes, the other being Nephew to
<hi>Baba
Haſtan</hi> Governour of <hi>Algier,</hi> and an old Turk, called by the name of
<hi>Abram Rees,</hi> who was formerly Admiral of <hi>Algier,</hi> and came that Voyage
for his pleaſure; the other a <hi>Moor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chriſtians tell me, the Ship had certainly yielded when ſhe loſt her
Main-maſt, had it not been for that old Commander, <hi>Abram Rees,</hi> he
ſtill encouraging the <hi>Turks,</hi> telling them of his former Succeſs he hath had
againſt the Chriſtians, naming his fighting with 3 Dutchmen of War, and
another time his fighting Sir <hi>Richard Beach</hi> in the <hi>Hampſhiee,</hi> with ſeveral
other good Actions.</p>
            <p>Not having men to officiate thoſe works that were neceſſary to be done,
as you may judge, when I had but 140 Men and Boys ſerviciable on Board
when I began to engage, not having opportunity of manning my ſelf ſince
my engaging. The <hi>Golden-Horſe</hi> was a great means I judge of my having
ſo many men killed and wounded, which were in number, fifty five, of
which twenty one were killed out right, and ſeveral others mortally
wounded, which we do not expect to live, among thoſe killed, was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
my Brother, a Voluntier, the Boat-Swain, the Chief-Mate, the
Coxon.</p>
            <p>My two other Voluntiers, <hi>Mr. Row</hi> was blown up, but I Hope will dò
well, <hi>Mr. Woolfran Cornwall</hi> was ſhot in the Breſt, and afterward ſhot
through the upper part of his Body, but is ſtill alive, and in a fair way of
Recovery.</p>
