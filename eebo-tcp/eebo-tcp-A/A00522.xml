            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auinge alwaies wythdrawen my mynde from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſome conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in this ſo great a broyle both of min<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and ſtudies, I thought it good to be in quiet and at reſt vntill ſuch time as I might frely both in truth and conſcience do the ſaine, eſpecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe I knewe well enough that men both of excellent wit and learninge haue he therto pleaded &amp; defended this oure common cauſe mightelye, and with ſuche greate
<pb facs="tcp:12066:5"/>
force, as was ſufficient and able to breake the fearcenes of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. But this notwithſtandyng, their malapart and leude bragges haue at the length vanquiſhed and broken of thys my longe ſylence.</p>
            <p>They are now aſſembled at Trent wherevnto they do call verye arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly by a cercayne wryting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely to that ende ſet forth at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſe, all and euery of vs whiche do profeſſe the Goſpell of Chryſt: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thing truelye is not at all to be meruailed at, ſeing they (according to their aucthoritie which to them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues they do chaleng and vſurpe) do imperiouſly tryumph both ouer Kynges and Monarches. But yet they handle this their cauſe ſo craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely &amp; ſubtilly that vnleſſe their put poſes be preuented it is a great hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard, &amp; to be feared leſt there w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei begile ſuch as be ſimple. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:12066:5"/>
the time requireth that good men ſhoulde arme them ſelfes and ioyne their powers and force toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In thys armye or expedicion if I were aſſigned only to go with the cariage, truely I woulde wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly take it vpon me. But forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are ſet vpon and aſſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our enemies by ambuſſhes, I thinke it good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we fight aloofe, the whyche thinge I woulde the Chriſtian reader (to whom I now ſpeake) to vnderſtand leſt any man ſhould ſclaunderouſlye ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I did refuſe againe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> battaile which euen nowe I ſemed ſo haſtly to requyre.</p>
            <p>Our enemies haue choſen Trent as a place for theyr am buſhes, in my opinion truelye not much vnlike to the forkes or Gibettes of <hi>Caudis,</hi> wherinto whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romaine hoſtes had ron hedlong being entrapped by the pollicie of theyr enemies, thei
<pb facs="tcp:12066:6"/>
made amendes for theyr folye with theyr old accuſtomed manhod and proweſſe. Thoſe forkes of <hi>Caudis,</hi> thoſe Dennes I meane of Counci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les haue ſondrye tymes deceaued and endomagid oure menne. It is tyme therefore that wee ſhoulde at the length awake, and wyth wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome take head of and foreſee thoſe wyles whyche once or twyſe we haue alreadye felte. Yet notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandynge in the meane tyme ſuche as are ſimple muſt be taughte, why we ſeynge oure enemyes wyll not encounter wyth vs in playne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayle, oughte not to goo into their campes leſt we ſhoulde ſeme by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakynge oure ſtandinge to forſake alſo the ryghte of oure cauſe. If I therefore ſhall alſo take vpon me to teache this thinge, what teacher of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuſe or blame me but he muſte alſo accuſe and blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:12066:6"/>
of neglectynge and lettynge paſſe his owne office and dewety. For howe manye ſoeuer wee bee in nomber, we are called euerye one vnto this Councile, what meruaile is it then if I thinke that whyche we al and euery one of vs are equal lye carged with, to be alſo common to me aſwel as to the reſt of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the church, (that is to ſay) to wytneſſe and declare to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyan worlde that there can no iuſte and mete cauſes be founde for vs to go to this Councile, but rather that innumerable and great cauſes may be ſhewed to eſche we and fiye the ſame. For there is none ſo doltiſhe, who dothe not ſee, that there canne be no iuſt cauſe, why any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould haſſarde and caſt himſelfe into open peryll which is ioyned with the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the truth, the contumely of God &amp; the harme of his neighbour.
<pb facs="tcp:12066:7"/>
In a matter ſo playne and manifeſt, I neade not longe to ſtand aboute the profe thereof. The holye men of God do knowe that all Chryſtian actions, are chyefelye to be referred to thonely Glorye of GOD as to a marke, from the whiche if they go a wrye it muſt neades be that both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth muſte be in haſſarde and the healthe of the ſoule alſo in daunger and ieopardye. But here ſome may doubt whether our going to Trent (if we mynded to goo thither) doo bringe therewith theſe diſcomodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or not. I therefore haue taken in hande in this preſent Oration to proue that this iourney whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we ſhould take it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che God almighty of his clemency defende) ſhalbe not onelye ful of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril and daunger, but alſo contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſe and iniuriouſe both againſte Goddes truth, yea God him ſelfe,
<pb facs="tcp:12066:7"/>
and alſo oure neyghboure. And as touching the greatnes of the peril, truely I would ſay nothing therof, if it were ſuche a kinde of perill as had in it any profyt or deutie, for it is manifeſt that the holy Martyres of God when nede required haue willingly ſuffred euen deathe. But nowe wher there is a manifeſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger ioyned with a manifeſt impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the matter is not like. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therefore the perill thereof I wil breefely recite that which ſhall ſuffyſe. And here firſt of all I haue to ſpeake of the place appoynted for the Counſel, for the which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes haue long yea &amp; that earneſtly trauailed but all in vaine that ſome free Citie of Germanye ſhould be aſſigned. But ſeinge that they cannenot hetherto be gotten forth of the boundes of Italie, noo not to thoſe places which are ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:12066:8"/>
defended with thaucthoritie and faythfull promiſe both of Thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and alſo of all the Princes of Germany, who (I beſech you) ſhall cauſe vs to go to them which haue ſhewed ſo many lamentable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both of breach of fayth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of crueltie. But ſome peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will ſay, that thaucthoritie of the princes or of Themperour will cauſe theſe felowes to kepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues within their boundes. He is de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued truelye that ſo thinketh, for their is noo lykelyhode that they who hitherto haue made of kinges and Princes a ieſtinge ſtocke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wyll nowe do any thing at their requeſt or for their ſakes. But what ſaftye or truſt can there be repoſed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who be perſwaded that it is no ſin at al to kyll vs, who alſo although againſt their will they ſhoulde ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from doing vs open violence
<pb facs="tcp:12066:8"/>

This much ſhall ſuffiſe concerninge the place: Nowe let vs come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue gaged their faith in this matter, &amp; who wil ſeme to haue prouided for vs, &amp; warrented vs by publicke ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction or inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Dimmortal god with what &amp; howe vaine titles do they boſt them ſelues moſte am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biciouſlye abroad, A ſmall nomber of Byſhops, yea and amonge them ſome counterfaicte and diſguiſed, and yet al of them beynge the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Biſhop of Rome, and ſuche alſo as be accuſed of vs, both of forſaking of Religion and alſo of oppreſſyng and treadynge vnder fote y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, dare cal themſelues ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neral, holy &amp; Apoſtoloque, &amp; finally chaleng to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues al wholy ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:12066:9"/>
thinges whereof it is euidente they haue not one iote. But who wyll truſte them any whit at all, whyche ſtumble ſo ſhamefullye euen in the verye begynnynge of theyr ſafetye whyche they promyſe. Do not they the lyke (I beſeche you) as thoughe a certayne rable of moſte wycked raſkalles whoo were themſelues accuſed to be worthye to loſe theyr lyfe and goodes ſhould call Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure himſelfe and all the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Thempyre to a generall dyet and aſſemblye promiſing them a mooſte large ſafe conduicte and appoynte vnto him a daye to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to his playnte. If then the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a generall Councell cannot iuſtelye be attributed vnto a certen few perſons who be accuſed of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte religion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it not laweful alſo for them vnder the name of a general Councell to geue forth any
<pb facs="tcp:12066:9"/>
lawefull warrant of ſafetye. Now therefore it is not in queſtion of the forme of the warrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, but whither they haue ryghte or power to make any ſuche warraunte or not. For if ſome olde craftye foxe ſhoulde geue forthe pryuilegies were they neuer in ſo good a form, yet forſomuch as he had no power at all to graunte anye ſuche, the forme thereof muſte neades bee in daunger wyth the ryghte. It fauleth not therefore in conſideracion onelye what euerye one promiſeth, but with what right &amp; aucthoritie he promiſeth. I know well enoughe that they referre all their doinges to the Romyſhe By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe as chiefe and heade who is one all accordynge to the commen ſayinge. <hi>Vbi Papa, ibi vniuerfalis Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus.</hi> Where the Pope is, there is alſo the general Councell, but howe falſely and how wickedly this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe
<pb facs="tcp:12066:10"/>
Byſhop dothe vſurpe al theſe things it is ſo wel knowen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there neadeth no profe thereof. As for me trulye, wyth howe muche the more aucthorytye they forniſhe this their Byſhoppe and their Counciles, ſo muche the leſſe hope and confidence I haue in their promyſe. For if the Romiſhe Byſhoppe maye do what he liſte, and he onelye maye (by his hyghe power whyche is geuen to him) acquyte and ſette free Kynges and Emperours from theyr others promiſſes, and covenauntes, what ſhoulde let him not to vſe thys his righte in his owne cauſe, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and meaſure the rule of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe accordynge to his owne luſte. And who is hee that knoweth not that the Byſhoppes of Rome haue hitherto wyth theyr othes and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les mocked vs and that Scotfree. Moreouer that clauſe whyche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
<pb facs="tcp:12066:10"/>
the penaltye agaynſte the breakers of theyr ordynaunces ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be verye obſcure and full of doubtes and ambiguitie. What yf they (ſuche is theyr good wyll tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards vs) ſhal complaine then chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that we do hurt them when thei wyllynglye do wrong and Iniurie vs, who ſhall then ſpeake for vs, who ſhal take oure matter in hand, who ſhal defende oure cauſe in that place whyche is ſo noy ſome to oure menne wyth the Byſhoppe of Romes Garriſons. They beare the name of a generall Councile, and of Apoſtolique men, but yf anye man couvince them of a lye doubteles he ſhall be accuſed of breakinge and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the ſame. They catche to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues alone y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> title of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, but yf anye man ſhould take in hand to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſworne enemies of the Churche, or reproue theyr fylthy life
<pb facs="tcp:12066:11"/>
and conuerſacion he ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d faultye of treſpaſinge agaynſt their ſafeconduicte. Ther be many other thinges lyke to theeſe, whyche we cannot kepe in ſilence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doing greate harme, and whyche they on the other ſide cannot heare without great rage and madneſſe. For how meke and how gentle theſe fathers be, Fraunce witneſſeth. Englande beareth recorde, and this execrable bocherye ſo latelye executed vppon oure brethren at Vaſſye ſheweth forth a good teſtimonye. Theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Fathers I ſaye do ſo thirſte for our ſoule healthe, that they do euen therewyth ſuppe vp oure bloude al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo. This alſo is not to bee let paſſe, that that forme of promyſe whyche was laſt printed at <hi>Brixia,</hi> by what Inquiſitours lycence I cannot tell, doth muche vary and diſſent from that whych was printed at Veniſe.
<pb facs="tcp:12066:11"/>
For in that of <hi>Brixia,</hi> there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne addicion ioyned thereto enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Extenſio ad alias naciones,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay a thing touchyng other naci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whyche retracteth and calleth backe agayne all that a litle before was licenced to al nacions in como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea and whyche more is, in the ſelfe ſame addicion, all other nacions ar warraunted by the ſelfe ſame forme and the verye ſame wordes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whythe the Germaynes are, and yet this is added, that this fourme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth not but vnto ſuche onelye as wyl repente their erroures, and come home agayne into the boſome of the Churche whyche oughte to be open to al menne. Who that hath anye wyt in his head perceiueth not theſe gyles and deceyies. The ſelfe ſame forme whereby the people of Germanie are warraunted pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth indifferentelye and equallye to
<pb facs="tcp:12066:12"/>
alother nations, and yet no ſafety is graunted to thother nacions vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe they be mynded to retorne to the Romyſhe Churche. Therefore conſequently neither to the people of Germany vnleſſe they vnyte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfes to the Churche of Rome. For the publique promyſſe endeth with the forme wherein it is coutayned. And thus muche I thinke ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoken touchinge the perill &amp; daunger of the Iorney, for this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter requireth no lenger de batynge ſeyng that reſpect muſt be had not ſo much to the peryll and daunger, as to the truthe and the glorye of God.</p>
            <p>It remayneth therefore that I ſhoulde couſequenlye declare, that with this certaine and aſſured dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger, there is alſo ioyned a moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and plaine abiuring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the truth. And leaſt anye
<pb facs="tcp:12066:12"/>
man ſhould doubt hereof, let hym thinke and conſider, that al Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an actions ar to be referred to ther determinate endes. And that this is thend of Councels that the faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of doctryne and manners ſhuld be reformed and finallye peace and concord (reſeruing alwaies the rule of pietie) ſhoulde be reſtored in the Churche. Seing therefore the caſe ſtandeth thus, a Chriſtian manne ought to ioyne hym raſhely to no aſſembles, which he ſhal vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be occupied about anye matters repugnant vnto this ende. If then I ſhall nowe plainely declare that theſe fathers of Trent, are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together not to open &amp; make manifeſt the truth, but to hide and darken the ſame, not to reforme &amp; amend the church but to deforme &amp; deface y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, I haue alſoſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued that Chriſtian men cannot

wythoute committing an haynous cryme ioyne themſelues to ſuche. And here fyrſte of all thynges conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wyth me (I praye you) who is he that hath appoynted and called together theſe aſſemblyes and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, Truly the Biſhop of Rome, who in this buſines hathe vſed all ſtudye and diligence, and ſpared no labor nor coſte. And to what ende (I beſech you) doth he al theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges? To that ende (thinke you) to ouerthrowe or diminiſhe hym ſelfe or his power? Who ſo truely can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie him ſelfe to be perſwaded in this poynte, ſemeth to me to be madde and contrary to reaſonne. For it is notlykely that the Biſhop of Rome will wittingly and willinglye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth than this great preparation of Councels? Truely to ſhore vp to eſtablyſhe and as long as they can

by any meanes, to reſtore to his old dignitie and brauery, the Papacye which now meanaceth ruyne and decaye and hath a good whyle ſence begonne to fall thorough the great hewgines and monſtruous byggenes therof, and alſo to make the whole Chriſtian world ſubiect to their lawes and ſtatutes.</p>

But oure chefeſt controuerſy with our aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaryes whyche abuſe the woorde or name of the Churche, is about the certaynetye and aucthorytye of the Scripturs. For they whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue once preſumed to take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be vnperfecte, they do forthe wyth inferre that it is alſo vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and therefore they ſaye that it hathe neade not onelye to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed wyth tradicions, but alſo to be determined and eſtabliſhed by the Churche. We on thother ſide do teache that the holye Scryptures, the very word of God (I ſaye) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in wrytyng, doth perfect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and ſufficiently contayne in it ſelf al the chiefe poyntes of our ſalnacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therfore that this is thonlye cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne and infallible rule to examine

al doctrynes &amp; opinions. And thus it is playne and manifeſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what poynt this controuerſie dependeth. For the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is whether the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture be of greater perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; aucthoritie or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tradicions, by what name ſoeuer they cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they haue bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded &amp; limitted almoſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lyuely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Thapoſtles, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuſtome of the Church, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anſwers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> determinacions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers, but by what ryghte or wronge it is not now to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

hundrethes of yeres paſt haue done nothing well, nor from henceforth perchaunce can do any thinge well, ſo longe as they occupye and enioy this peſtilente See, If finallye the fathers them ſelfes, which be of the better ſort do ſende vs to the ſcryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the caſe ſtandeth thus as you ſee, yet theſe vnholye felowes are not aſhamed yet ſtil to ſai that ther controuerſy with vs is onelye tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng thinterpretation &amp; not thauc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thoritie or certentie of the Scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

awaye from theyr chefeſt bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke. For yf we muſt wholye reſt in thaucthoritie of the Scripture, then away with al other by waies and ſtartinge holes wherein they put al the whole ſtrength and ſome of their diſputation. But (you wyl ſay) the Scripture hath nede of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I agre therto. Againe, it maketh much to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter what ſenſe euery man frameth thereto. True it is in deade. But ſeing the Scripture doth interprete and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it ſelfe, we wil alſo vſe that rule of interpretation which it ſelfe hath heretofore taught vs, and we will not herevnto bryng any other thinge, then faith and loue ioyned with ſobre and ſyncere dexteritie. But I am gone further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, for to entreate hereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth both an other place and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo tyme, But this one thing I ſaye.
<pb facs="tcp:12066:22"/>
If theeſe felowes take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to bee of ſuche aucthoritie as they make a ſhew and countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of. Whye do they not leaue that to vs as an onelye rule, whye do they reſtrayne it wyth ſo manye impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and lettes, why do they call backe agayne with their craftie tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flynge, that whyche they did once graunte, fynallie why do they torne and chang themſelues into ſo many formes and ſhapes at once. For if they go about to bryng al the whole controuerſie to thinterpretacion of the Scripture onely, go to in Gods name, let vs haue equall iudges, let vs encountre together, and let it alſo be knowen whither parte doth folowe or refuſe thooſe lawes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretynge whyche we haue recey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued of Chriſt and his apoſtles. But ſeynge that hitherto we coulde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne no ſuch thing of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes,
<pb facs="tcp:12066:22"/>
it is manifeſte that they doe mocke vs wyth iouglyng wordes, &amp; haue ſome other ſecrete meaning then they ſeame openlye to ſhew. But this is no newe or vnacuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thyng, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clocke of truthe to go aboute to ſuppreſſe the truthe. This chaunceth hereof that Satan (who tranſformeth himſelfe often times into an Angel of lyghte) hath bene accuſtomed to ſet goodly &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryous titles before his wickednes. For yf all aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blyes whatſoeuer they be whiche are reckoned vnder the name of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciles, had neuer erred, nor cold at this daye erre, then moſt woorthelye and of moſte righte, the chefeſt iudgemente ought to conſiſt in Counciles, but now ſeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable name of a Councile may alſo fal vppon the Sinagoge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil, it ought not to be ſo. But becauſe in al matters, exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples be of great force
<pb facs="tcp:12066:23"/>
ſo that there be an equal and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpect to the thinges which be compared together, me ſemeth it ſhal not be beſydes our mattre &amp; purpoſe, if I ſhould ſet forth here be fore your eyes, a ſhewe and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Councell, wherof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>When Eaſter was at hand the cheefe Preeſtes, Scrybes and elders of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were gathered together into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Haule of the hygh Preeſt that was called Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, and they ſayd what ſhal we do, for thys man doth many myracles.

               <p>And ſo forth as foloweth in the texte of Thiſtorye.</p>
               <p>Here I praye the (Chriſtian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) fyrſt of all to conſyder well the fathers of this Councell. They be aſſembled together which excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both in aucthoritie and alſo in
<pb facs="tcp:12066:23"/>
opinion of holynes, &amp; vppon whoſe ſhoulders the Churche which was at that tyme did reſt euen as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe it had bene ſhored vp with pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.

But let vs come from the fathers vnto the forme it ſelfe, and conſider the proceſſe of the lawe (as they call it) Thoſe holy fathers woulde ſeme to do nothing vnaduiſedly or by vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. They cal a Councell, they laye their heades together, they pretend the ſafegard of theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trye, whiche they crye oute to be in daunger, vnleſſe thenterpriſes of Chriſt be quickely ſtopped, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12066:24"/>
they came to the pointe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they examine Chriſt of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Doctrine, the knowledge whereof they chalenged as proper to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfes. And becauſe the lawe of God forbiddeth that anye man ſhould be puniſhed by death vnloſſe he be fyrſte conuicted of ſome hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crime by ſufficient witneſſes, they take this charge alſo vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and thei be very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to take hede that they be not ſuſpected of anye man of breaking iuſtice, they geue libertie alſo to Chriſt (leſt any man ſhould ſclaunderouſlye ſay that he was condemned his cauſe beynge neuer hard) to anſwer in his owne behalfe, yea and more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, they compel him by wordes &amp; binde him with an othe ſo to do. Truely thys is a great libertie, &amp; ſuch a one as is wonte to get no ſmale aucthoritye to lawefull Councelis. At the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthe
<pb facs="tcp:12066:24"/>
after long and earneſt canua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng of the lawe, they fynd Chryſt gyltye of Hereſye, ſedicion, &amp; moſte haynous crimes and worthy to be puniſhed of the Ciuill Magiſtrate. Nowe if this bee not a forme of a Councile wel ſolemnized. I cannot tell truelye what other canne ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye theſe Lutherane heretikes. To go aboute to cal in queſtion thauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye and credyte of theſe Fathers, what other thynge is it then to ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe the Churche it ſelfe, the whiche truelye thou ſhalte neuer ſeparate well frome this ordinarye Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Byſhoppes whereunto it cleuethe vnſeparablye, vnleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture thou meane alſo vtterlie to ouerthrowe the ſame. But here let vs ſtaye awhyle and conſider more narowly thoſe which be aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in this Councel, Theſe holy fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers becauſe they were altogether
<pb facs="tcp:12066:25"/>
corrupt with auarice and ambicion were nothyng leſſe in deade then they ſeemed to bee they were taken for the highe prieſles of the truthe and religion, and yet they weare in deade the ſworne enemyes bothe of the truthe and alſo of religion. Thei thought it meete therefore to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto the deathe as manye as were agaynſte them. Chryſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which in his ſermons vnto the people did inuey againſt theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfaycte and cloked holynes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked theyr madneſſe and hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt himſelfe. What meruayle is it then if they whyche were iudges of his cauſe were found and proued to be his moſt cruell enemyes. And albeit they hadde iudged Chryſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthye of deathe yet becauſe they neaded the ciuil Magiſtrate to this matter thei vſe the forme of the lawe verye formallye and ſolemnly,
<pb facs="tcp:12066:25"/>
but they abuſe the law of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye to the lawe and they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw iuſtice vnder the color of the lawe. But libertie truely was farre from this Councile, for Chryſte did anſwere to his playnte beynge tied like a pryſoner. And althoughe thei did exhorte him to ſpeake, yet they wreſted his woordes very captiouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, and when he ſpake not to theyr fantaſye then they reuyled him and did alſo beate him. <hi>This is the ſome of theyr Councile.</hi>

Paule the apoſtle, rather then hee woulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit his cauſe to the Iewes who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knew to be his enemies thought it better to appeale to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudgment of Themperour. This exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple folow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed Athanaſius, Cirillus, &amp; Naziani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus, and wyth al diligence eſchew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the conuenticles of Heritykes. Therefore where ſo manye and ſoo greate difficultyes be, I cannot ſee what we haue to do at Trente, this one thinge excepte, that is to ſaye to offre agayne wyllyngelye to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes that thing for thobtayning and gettinge by force whereof wee haue beene at this great and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warre with them ſo long. For if the right of Calling Sinodes doe not pertayne to the Popes neither

by the lawe of God nor manne. No more trulye (although ſome tyme it had appertained) it is now to be per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted or graunted to them in their owne caſe beyng called vnto Iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, to be bothe Iudges and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We therfore which are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile, but to the dragges and filth of the Courte of Rome, wil neuer ſo behaue our ſelues, that we ſhall be ſayd by oure Obedience to haue deliuered and as it wer ſealed into their hands, that power which bothe the lawes of God and alſo of men haue cleane taken from them. But if the obedience of ſubiectes be limitted wyth the power and right of the Superioure, and yet ſuche as we oure ſelues are do cal forth Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Emperours to Counciles, by our preſence trulye to our power and as muche as in vs doth lye we ſhoulde arme the Pope alſo againſt Chriſtin Princes and thorough our

aſſemblyes we muſte vouchſaufe to terme this rable of mitred felowes by the name of Fathers, yea and that moſte holye or at the leſte wyſe moſte reuerende Fathers. For it is not mete that any man ſhould come to ſpeake his minde withoute ſome Preface of dignitye and honor, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye in their preſence whoſe pride and ambicion wil neuer be ſatiſiied. But with what countenaunce or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall wee ſpeake vnto them reuerentlye, to whome what honor or reuerence ſo euer we ſhewe, wee pull that all frome Chryſte and his Churche. I haue nowe proued (I thinke) ſufficientelye, that there bee no iuſte cauſes at all why we ſhould go to Trent but rather verye many and thoſe moſte wayghty occaſions to be agaynſte this Iorneye, and ſo conſequentlye that oure menne can by no meanes goe to this Councile withoute committinge a moſt hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

And albeit we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and eſchewe theeſe Romiſhe Sinagoges, we doe not alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abhorre and flie from all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blyes, but we acknowlege and confeſſe moſt playnely that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye excellynge others in Learning Godlynes and Iudgement be dew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye called to a lawful Councile, thei cannot refuſe this charge laid vpon them withoute incurringe the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous indignacion of God and alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſt diſpleaſure of al eſtates of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there may be a good ende of Counciles, it is alſo requiſite that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things tending to this ende ſhould be wel ſet in order. If therfore Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tian Prynces to whom this charge doth chiefeli pertaine, do ſettle their myndes earneſtelye to reforme the church, they wil ſet to their helping ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds al together, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councel may bein very deade Catholicke as it is in name termed. But it as the
