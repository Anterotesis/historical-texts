            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER from a Friend
concerning the ensuing
Cases.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving perused the Papers you sent me, I
can safely vouch them for genuine, and
not in the least Spurious, by that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
they wear of their Reverend Author; and
therefore you need not fear to bring them to the
Publique test, and let them look the Sun in the
face.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, their first Commission was but short,
and long since expired, they being designed only to
visit, and respectively satisfie some private Friends;
yet I cannot see what injury you will offer to
his sacred ashes, if, by renewing that, you send
them on a little farther Embassie for the common
good.</p>
            <p>Indeed the least remains of so matchless a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
so invincible an Advocate <hi>in Foro Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gico,</hi>
like the filings and fragments of Gold, ought
not to be lost; and pity the world was not worthy
many more of his learned Labours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100680:3"/>
But—<hi>Praestat de Carthagine racere quam pauca
dicere;</hi> far be it from me to pinion the wings of
his fame, with any rude Letters of Commendation;
or, by way of precarious Pedantry, to court any
man into a belief of his worth, since that were to
attempt <hi>Iliads</hi> after <hi>Homer,</hi> and spoil a piece
done already to the life by his own Pencil, the
works whereof do sufficiently <hi>praise him in the
gates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All I aim at is, to commend and promote your
pious intention, to give the World security, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
these Papers publique, that they shall never
hereafter stand in need of any other hand to snatch
them out of the fire, a doom (you say) once written
upon them.</p>
            <p>Nor do I less approve your ingenuous prudence in
determining to prefix no Name, it being as lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not to speak all the Truth sometimes, as to forbear
telling a Lie for advantage.</p>
            <p>'Tis (I confess) the mode of late to hang <hi>Jewels
of Gold</hi> in a <hi>Swines snout;</hi> I mean, to stamp every
impertinent Pamphlet with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some great Name, or
voluminous Title to make it vend the better <hi>(Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat
venales qui vult extrudere merces)</hi> at which
the gul'd Reader repenting his prodigality of time
and patience is forced to cry out all along, <hi>Beaucoup
de bruit, peu de fruit,</hi> and in the end sums up its
just character in a few words, <hi>Nil nisi magni no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis
umbra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yours is the only method to deal with wise
and rational men, who are not so easily taken
with Chaff, (the multitude or greatness of words
<pb facs="tcp:100680:3"/>
and names) as with the true weight and worth of
things.</p>
            <p>Yet let me tell you, that whoever is not a meer
stranger to your learned Authors former Tractates,
must needs spell his name in every page of this without
any other Monitor.</p>
            <p>I have no farther trouble to give you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless I
should bespeak your vigilance over the Press, which
by her dayly teeming and inexpertness, or (at least)
negligence of the Midwife is went of late to spoil
good births with monstrous deformities, and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable
<hi>Errata;</hi> so you will avoid a double guilt
contracted by some without fear or wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of abusing
your critical Reader on the one hand, and your most
judiciously exact Writer on the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (if that

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ours of <hi>Iuly</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> I yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<hi>Iuly</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> received.
In Answer to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
whereof (desiring that
my Services may withall be most
humbly presented to my very much
Honoured Lord) I return you what
my present thoughts are concerning
the particulars therein proposed. First,
For Marrying a Daughter to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>Papist</hi> (considered in <hi>Thesi,</hi> and
as to the point of Lawfulness only)
I am so far from thinking the thing
in it self to be simply, and <hi>toto genere,</hi>
unlawful; that I dare not condemn
the Marriage of a <hi>Christian</hi> with a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100680:5"/>
               <hi>Pagan</hi> (much less with any other
<hi>Christian</hi> of how different Perswasion
soever) as simply evil and unlawful,
inasmuch as there be Causes imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
wherein it may seem not only
Lawful but Expedient also, and (as
the exigence of Circumstances may
be supposed) little less then necessary
so to Intermarry. But since things
lawful in the General and in <hi>Thesi,</hi>
may become (by reason of their inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency)
unlawful <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi>
and <hi>in Hypothesi</hi> to particular persons;
and that the expediency or inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of any action to be done, is to
be measured by the Worthiness of the
end, the conjuncture of present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and the probability of
good or evill consequents and effects,
prudentially laid together, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one against another; I conceive it
altogether unsafe for a Conscientious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100680:5"/>
Person (especially in a business of so
great concernment, as the Marrying
of a Child) to proceed upon the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
lawfulness of the thing, without
due consideration of Circumstances,
and other requisits for the warranting
of particular Actions. Now as for
the Marriage of a Daughter with one
of so different Perswasion (in point of
Religion) as, that they cannot joyn
together in the same way of Gods
worship, which is the case of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and a Papist, it is very rare to find
such a concurrence of Circumstances,
as that a Man can thence be clearly
satisfied in his Judgment (without
just cause of doubting the contrary)
that it can be expedient to conclude
upon such a Marriage; and how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a thing it is to do any thing
with a <hi>doubting conscience,</hi> we may <hi>learn</hi>
from <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 13. For the <hi>evil consequents</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100680:6"/>
probably to ensue upon such Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
are so many and great, that
the conveniences which men may
promise to themselves from the same
(if they should answer expectation, as
seldom they do to the full) laid in an
equal ballance thereagainst, would
not turn the scale; and in one respect
the danger is greater to marry with a
Papist, then with one of a worse
Religion; for that the main principle
of his Religion, (as a <hi>Papist)</hi> is more
destructive of the comfort of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal
Society, then are the Principles
of most Heretiques; yea then those
of <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Atheists;</hi> for holding
that there is no Salvability but in the
Church; and that none is in the
Church, but such as acknowledge
Subjection to the Sea of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is
not possible, but that the Husband
must needs conclude his Wife to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100680:6"/>
in the <hi>state of Damnation,</hi> so long as
she continueth <hi>Protestant:</hi> whence
one of these two great inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will unavoidably follow; that
either he will use all endeavours, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
and artifices, to draw her to the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as indeed who can
blame him to bring his Wife into a
capacity of everlasting salvation?) the
restless importunity whereof (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the ill advantages they of
that party can make from the sad
Confusions that are amongst us in
these times) it will be very hard for
one of the weaker sex perpetually to
resist; or else in case she stand firm
in her Religion against all Assaults
and Attempts to the contrary, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he may be towards her in
outward carriage, he cannot but in
his inmost thoughts, pass judgment
upon her, as an obstinate and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100680:7"/>
Heretique, and (so living and
dying) an accursed and damned Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
These are sad things both; and
it is not conceiveable how a Woman
so matched should live with any
comfort, or ever hope to see a good
day, wherein she shall not either be
tempted from her Religion, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
for it; what assurance can she
have of his good affections towards
her, who is bound not to permit any
better opinion of her, then of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
and Castaway? It is possible
there may be so much good nature in
the Husband as to take off somewhat
from that rigidness, which otherwise
the Principles of his Religion would
bind him to, or so much discretion,
sweetness, and obligingness in the
Wives demeanour towards him, as
to preserve a good measure of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Affection between them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100680:7"/>
their different perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
This I say, is possible; and
where it happeneth so to be, it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
the condition of the Parties
so much the less uncomfortable; and
that is the utmost of the <hi>happiness,</hi> that
is to be hoped for from such Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages:
and I think there cannot be
produced many examples thereof;
yet even there, there cannot be that
cordial Affection, and fulness of
Complacency (wherein yet the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
happiness of Conjugal Society
consisteth) that would be, if the same
Parties (supposed to be of the same
Qualifications otherwise) were also of
the same Religion. I omit other
<hi>oeconomical</hi> differences, that may and
very frequently do (occasionally)
arise, betwixt Husband and Wife
from this difference in Religion, as
concerning the Entertainment of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100680:8"/>
Friends, the choice of Servants, the
education of Children (very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
things all) besides sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
perhaps of less moment; yet
such as are apt to breed Discontents
and Jealousies, and sometimes break
out into great Distempers in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
Such Marriages therefore I
should utterly disswade; especially
in the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty,</hi>
where there is choice enough
otherwise to be had of Persons of
equal Degree, Estate, and Education
of the same Religion to match with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
Kings and Princes for reasons of
State, and because there is little choice
of Persons of equal Dignity with
themselves, are therefore oftentimes
by a kind of Necessity, put upon such
Marriages; yet even there, where they
are certainly the most excusable, it
hath been observed that such Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100680:8"/>
have proved for the most part
unfortunate.</p>
            <p>The other Particular proposed in
your Letter is concerning the <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of a Daughter to one that Professeth
the Protestant Religion, but having had
Popish Parents, may be suspected (though
he deny it) to be that way inclined.</hi> The
resolution whereof (as of most other
<hi>Cases</hi> and <hi>Practical Questions)</hi> will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
very much upon the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Circumstances,</hi> whereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether a stanger, I am lesse
able to give Judgement in the Case
with any certainty; only in order
to the resolution of the Question,
these (to my understanding) seem to
be the most proper and important
Enquiries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Whether the Parents of the
young Person be living or no, one or
both? if both be dead, the <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100680:9"/>
from them (which in such <hi>Cases</hi>
are wont to prevail very much) are by
their Death clearly <hi>superseded;</hi> and
then the danger is by so much lesse:
but if either be living, there can be
little security of the Sons <hi>continuance</hi>
in the <hi>Protestants belief,</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his present profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
when he shall be <hi>assaulted</hi> with
the <hi>whole authority</hi> of them to whom
he oweth <hi>reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> With what degree of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi>
and with what kind of <hi>asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
he <hi>professeth</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>denieth</hi>
the <hi>other Religion;</hi> for although they
that out of <hi>design</hi> put on a counterfeit
vizor, use all the art they can to <hi>dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
it; yet very seldom can it be done
so <hi>cunningly, waringly,</hi> and <hi>constantly,</hi>
but that at some time or other, the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation</hi>
will unawares bewray it self
to the <hi>eye</hi> of a <hi>curious observer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100680:9"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What measure of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the young Person (who is
you say of <hi>great Abilities</hi> for his Age)
hath in the <hi>Fundamental Articles</hi> of the
<hi>Christian Religion;</hi> those I mean, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Romish Churches</hi> are
at <hi>agreement,</hi> for in <hi>those</hi> the <hi>substance</hi>
of <hi>Christianity</hi> consisteth; he that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understands those <hi>Catholique Truths</hi>
taught in the <hi>Catechisms</hi> of both
Churches, and concerning which all
<hi>Christendom</hi> (in a manner) are at a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
accord;</hi> and then will but suffer
himself to consider, that the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> doth not <hi>impose</hi> upon the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
and <hi>consciences</hi> of her <hi>Members,</hi>
any thing to be <hi>believed,</hi> or <hi>received,</hi> as
of <hi>necessity</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> then what is
<hi>truly Catholique,</hi> and by her Adversaries
confessed so to be; and consequently
that the <hi>difference</hi> betwixt <hi>her</hi> and the
<hi>Romish Party,</hi> is wholly about those
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100680:10"/>
               <hi>Additionals</hi> or <hi>Superstructures,</hi> which
they of the <hi>Roman faith</hi> require to be
<hi>believed,</hi> and <hi>received</hi> with like <hi>necessity</hi>
as the <hi>former;</hi> but appear to us of this
<hi>Church respectively,</hi> either <hi>evidently false,</hi>
or of <hi>doubtful truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or not of <hi>absolute
necessity</hi> to be <hi>believed;</hi> I say, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
well considereth this, may rest
<hi>satisfied</hi> in his <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi>
that the <hi>Faith taught</hi> and <hi>professed</hi> in
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is a <hi>plain</hi> and
<hi>safe way</hi> to lead a <hi>Christian Believer</hi> to
<hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> if he withal lead his
<hi>life</hi> and <hi>conversation</hi> answerable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>To the last particular in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
all the return I have to make is no
more, but an humble acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and sense of his <hi>Lordships</hi> noble
favours towards me, in entertaining
an opinion of me more suitable to his
own goodness and ingenuity, then to

my merit: I know not, nor desire to
know of any occasions likely to draw
me into those parts so distant from me
(being grown into years, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that render me very unfit for long
Journies) unless the business of my
<hi>Sons Marriage,</hi> which occasion'd my

that I will avoid it, unless there
be no other remedy: I shall not <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
decline</hi> any employment (within

my <hi>service</hi> may be any wayes <hi>useful</hi>
or but <hi>acceptable,</hi> to that <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

there will be little need of my

further <hi>endeavours,</hi> as to that particular

<hi>sufficiency</hi> and <hi>readiness</hi> in that kind is

            <head>The CASE of
UNLAWFUL LOVE.</head>
            <p>TWo Gentlemen who were very good
Friends, and both of them Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
used to converse together fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly;
one of these took a special liking
in the company and conversation of the
others Wife, and she answerably in his;
which afterwards proceeded to some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Love; which though ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,
and preserved without any viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Chastity, grew yet in the end to
this issue, that they mutually vowed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to other, that if happily either of
them should at any time be freed from the
Bond of Matrimony (either he by the
death of his Wife, or she by the death of
her Husband) that party so freed should
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100680:12"/>
continue afterwards unmarryed, and stay
for the other, till the other should be freed
also, though it were during life: Now so
it is, that this Gentlewomans Husband
died, and her affections and resolution so
altered, that gladly she would Marry, if
she might be released of the Engagement
of that Vow; or perswaded of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
or nullity thereof.</p>
            <p>Concerning the present Case, as it
is propounded, sundry Points are
needful to be resolved, that so we
give a right judgment <hi>de praeterito,</hi>
of what is already done for the time
past, in respect of the Gentlewomans
<hi>former promise,</hi> and sound direction
also <hi>de futuro,</hi> which is further to be
done for the time to come, in respect
of her present distresses.</p>
            <div n="1" type="point">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100680:12"/>
               <head>Point I.</head>
               <p>§. 1. First of all, It is considerable,
whether the promise made by the
Gentlewoman and her friend, were
properly a Vow or no? so it is called
in the proposal of the present <hi>Case,</hi>
and that agreeable to the common
use of speech with us here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who extend the word <hi>[Vow]</hi>
very far; neither shall I make scruple
in the ensuing <hi>Discourse,</hi> sometimes
to call it so; for <hi>Loquendum ut Vulgus.</hi>
But to speak properly, a <hi>Vow</hi> is a word
of a narrower extent then a <hi>Promise,</hi>
every <hi>Vow</hi> being indeed a <hi>Promise,</hi>
but not every <hi>Promise</hi> necessarily a
<hi>Vow;</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Votum soli Deo fit, sed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio potest fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri etiam Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini <hi>Aquit</hi> 2 2. q. 88. 5. ad. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Promises</hi> may be
made <hi>indifferently,</hi> either to
<hi>God</hi> or <hi>Men;</hi> but <hi>Promises</hi>
made to <hi>Men</hi> are no <hi>Vows:</hi>
wherefore it is usually inserted into

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100680:14"/>
for even as when a <hi>promise</hi> is made
unto God, whereunto for the more
<hi>solemnity,</hi> the <hi>presence</hi> of some men is
required as <hi>witnesses,</hi> such a <hi>Promise</hi> is
to be held for a <hi>Vow;</hi> because it is
made to God <hi>alone,</hi> although in the
<hi>presence</hi> of Men: So on the other side,
when a <hi>Promise</hi> is made unto <hi>some
Man,</hi> whereunto for the <hi>more assurance,</hi>
the <hi>presence</hi> of God is required as a
<hi>witness,</hi> such a <hi>Promise</hi> is not to be held
for a <hi>Vow,</hi> because it is made unto Man
<hi>alone,</hi> although in the <hi>presence</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Nay further, if the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
when she thus <hi>engaged</hi> her
self, did use these very words <hi>[I
VOW TO GOD]</hi> or words to
that effect, as we know is often done
in <hi>solemn Promises,</hi> between Man and
Man; yet neither is that sufficient to
make it properly a <hi>Vow;</hi> for to judge
rightly when Question is made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100680:14"/>
any particular <hi>promise,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a <hi>Vow</hi> yea or no; we are not
to be guided so much by the <hi>formes</hi> of
<hi>speech,</hi> (which are subject to change,
impropriety, and many defects) as by
the true intention and purpose of the
<hi>parties,</hi> especially the <hi>Promiser.</hi> Now
what was the whole <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
of these <hi>Parties,</hi> when they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
bound themselves in such sort,
as in the <hi>Case propounded</hi> is laid down,
no reasonable man can be ignorant;
even this and no other, to give as
good <hi>assurance</hi> as they could <hi>devise,</hi>
either to other, and to receive the like
<hi>assurance</hi> again, that the <hi>thing</hi> by them
<hi>agreed on</hi> and <hi>promised,</hi> should be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performed;</hi> and if either <hi>Oaths</hi> or
<hi>Protestations,</hi> were also <hi>used</hi> by way of
<hi>Confirmation,</hi> they are all in <hi>common
intendment</hi> to be taken as <hi>tending</hi> to the
<hi>self same purpose,</hi> without looking at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100680:15"/>
any further thing; and clearly where
the <hi>Promiser</hi> hath no intention to
<hi>bind</hi> himself to <hi>God,</hi> but to <hi>Man</hi> only,
the <hi>Promise</hi> so made is no <hi>Vow,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<hi>formality of words</hi> may be used
in the making of it.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Neither is the <hi>examination</hi> of
this Point a <hi>curiosity</hi> either in it <hi>self
fruitless,</hi> or <hi>impertinent</hi> to the <hi>Case in
hand;</hi> for albeit, in that which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be the very <hi>main point</hi> of all, <hi>viz.
the power of binding the Conscience,</hi> there
be no <hi>material difference</hi> between a
<hi>Vow</hi> and an <hi>ordinary Promise;</hi> a <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Promise</hi> no less <hi>binding</hi> unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
than a <hi>lawfull Vow;</hi> and an
<hi>unlawfull Vow</hi> no more <hi>binding</hi> than
an <hi>unlawfull Promise:</hi> yet there is
some <hi>difference</hi> between them, and
that of <hi>some importance too,</hi> in respect
of the <hi>relaxation</hi> of that <hi>Bond;</hi> for since
it belongeth to <hi>him</hi> to whom a <hi>bond</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:100680:15"/>
is made, to grant a <hi>release</hi> thereof: It
belongeth therefore to <hi>God alone</hi> to
<hi>release</hi> the <hi>obligation</hi> of a <hi>Vow;</hi> and no
man hath power so to do, because the
<hi>Vower</hi> by his <hi>Vow,</hi> bindeth himself to
<hi>God,</hi> not to <hi>Man:</hi> whereas the <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of a <hi>meer Promise,</hi> wherein the
<hi>Promiser</hi> bindeth himself but to <hi>some
Man,</hi> may be <hi>released</hi> by <hi>that Man;</hi> and
a <hi>release</hi> from him is to the <hi>conscience</hi> of
the <hi>Promiser</hi> a <hi>sufficient discharge</hi> from
the said <hi>obligation:</hi> which Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of what <hi>use</hi> it will be in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case,</hi> will in the due place further
appear. In the mean time we have
<hi>evidently proved,</hi> that this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>bound her self</hi> by <hi>Promise</hi> only, and
not by <hi>Vow.</hi>

there is a <hi>nullity</hi> in it still; and if it

               <p>§. 7. But after due pondering of the
<hi>matter,</hi> I rather think, that there was
not a <hi>nullity</hi> in the <hi>promise</hi> at the <hi>first,</hi>
neither (supposing it had been right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>qualified</hi> in other respects) was it
<hi>void</hi> upon this <hi>ground;</hi> because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she were not <hi>sui juris absolute,</hi>
it is sufficient yet, that she was so
<hi>quantum ad hoc.</hi> For a <hi>person</hi> that is
under the <hi>power</hi> of another, hath yet
<hi>power of himself,</hi> (and so is <hi>sui juris)</hi> to
<hi>dispose</hi> of all such things, as by the <hi>free
disposal</hi> whereof, the <hi>proper right</hi> of
him, under whose <hi>power</hi> he is, is no
way <hi>prejudiced;</hi> but in whatsoever
may be <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the <hi>other</hi> in any
of his <hi>Rights,</hi> he is <hi>juris alieni:</hi> neither
may <hi>dispose</hi> thereof without the <hi>others
consent;</hi> and if such a <hi>person</hi> shall make
a <hi>vow,</hi> or other <hi>promise</hi> concerning any
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100680:18"/>
of <hi>those things,</hi> wherein he is <hi>sui juris,</hi>
such <hi>vow</hi> or <hi>promise</hi> shall <hi>stand good,</hi>
and is not <hi>void</hi> (though possibly it
may be <hi>vitious</hi> in other respects) from
the <hi>inability</hi> of the <hi>person</hi> that <hi>maketh
it:</hi> As for example, if a <hi>Servant</hi> shall
<hi>promise</hi> to his <hi>own Father</hi> to <hi>work</hi> with
him a day or two in <hi>Harvest,</hi> this
<hi>promise</hi> unless his Master <hi>consent</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
shall be <hi>void,</hi> because the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
hath a <hi>right</hi> in the <hi>Servants work,</hi>
to which <hi>right</hi> it would be <hi>prejudicial</hi>
if the <hi>Servant</hi> should <hi>dispose</hi> thereof
after his own <hi>pleasure;</hi> but if such a
<hi>Servant</hi> shall <hi>promise</hi> unto his <hi>needy
Father</hi> to <hi>relieve</hi> him from time to
time with a <hi>third</hi> or <hi>fourth part</hi> of all
such <hi>wages</hi> as he shall receive for his
service, this <hi>promise</hi> shall be <hi>good of it
self;</hi> neither shall the <hi>Masters consent</hi>
be requisite to make it so, because the
<hi>Master</hi> hath no Right at at all in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100680:18"/>
the <hi>Servants wages;</hi> wherein to be
<hi>prejudiced</hi> by the <hi>Servants disposing</hi>
thereof according to his own mind:
Now forasmuch as the <hi>Husbands
right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> over the <hi>Wife ceaseth</hi>
together with his <hi>life,</hi> (as
the Apostle<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 2, 3.</note> expresly
teacheth) and so cannot be <hi>prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi>
by any <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Wife</hi> done after
his <hi>Decease;</hi> It is manifest that the
Wife is <hi>sui juris</hi> to make a <hi>vow</hi> or
<hi>promise</hi> during her Husbands <hi>life
time,</hi> concerning something to be
done after his <hi>decease,</hi> in case she
<hi>overlive</hi> him, because his <hi>right</hi> will
be <hi>expired</hi> before the <hi>performance</hi> of
the said <hi>vow</hi> or <hi>promise</hi> be due; as to
give instance in a Case not much
unlike to this in question; A Wife
<hi>estated</hi> upon her Marriage in a <hi>Ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
or <hi>Annuity</hi> for her life of an

her Husbands <hi>life time</hi> to one of her
<hi>younger Brothers,</hi> that hath but short
Means, to allow him thence forward
out of the said <hi>Estate, 10 l.</hi> yearly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his better Maintenance; this
<hi>promise</hi> is <hi>void</hi> unless the Husband
<hi>consent,</hi> because the <hi>performance</hi> thereof
would <hi>prejudice</hi> him in that <hi>right</hi>
which he hath during his own life in
the <hi>Revenue</hi> of all the <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities</hi>
estated upon the Wife in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;</hi>
but if such a Wife shall
<hi>promise</hi> to her said <hi>Brother</hi> to allow
him the said yearly sum of 10 <hi>l.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>decease</hi> of her Husband, in
case she <hi>survive</hi> him, this <hi>promise</hi> is
<hi>good,</hi> though made by the Wife in
her Husbands <hi>life time,</hi> and without
his <hi>consent,</hi> because the Husbands
<hi>right</hi> (being to cease before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

neither do I think, that there was a
<hi>nullity</hi> in it, in respect of the person,
to make it <hi>void</hi> that way; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied, but there was much
<hi>obliquity</hi> in it, in respect of the <hi>matter,</hi>
to make it otherwise <hi>utterly unlawful:</hi>
in which Point much need not be
said, because the <hi>truth</hi> thereof will
soon appear; for there was in it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
a <hi>threefold obliquity,</hi> and thereby
also a <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>three several Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi>
The <hi>first obliquity</hi> was in
respect of the <hi>unlawful affection</hi> from
which it <hi>proceeded;</hi> which being
<hi>placed</hi> upon another than the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and that in such a <hi>high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi>
as to produce a <hi>promise</hi> of this
<hi>kind,</hi> must needs be <hi>vitious,</hi> both for
the <hi>object</hi> and for the <hi>measure,</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100680:20"/>
such <hi>inordinate affection</hi> by the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of our Saviours<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
of the <hi>Law,</hi> is a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation</hi>
of the <hi>Chastity</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> and
so a <hi>breach</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
The <hi>Second obliquity</hi> was, the
want of that true <hi>conjugal love</hi> which
ought to be between <hi>Husband</hi> and
<hi>Wife,</hi> who ought to have a <hi>mutual</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 5. 18. Eccles. 9. 9.</note>
                  <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>delight</hi>

to be<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 5. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>satisfied</hi> at all
times with the <hi>Love, Comfort,</hi> and

<hi>Love</hi> if it had been so throughly <hi>rooted</hi>
and <hi>seated</hi> in the Gentlewomans <hi>heart,</hi>
as it ought to have been, would have
<hi>crushed</hi> all <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>unlawful affection</hi>
towards a Stranger in the <hi>shell,</hi> long
before they could <hi>grow</hi> to such <hi>strong
Resolutions,</hi> as by the making of this
<hi>vow</hi> it appeareth they did; for it is:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100680:21"/>
not to be imagined that such a <hi>vow</hi> as
this could be made, and really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be <hi>performed,</hi> but we must
needs suppose in the parties so <hi>vowing,</hi>
a kind of <hi>weariness</hi> at the least, if not
rather some <hi>inward loathing</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Yoak;</hi> which being contrary to
that <hi>honour</hi> thst Marryed persons <hi>owe</hi>
to their <hi>yoak fellows,</hi> is so a <hi>breach</hi> of
the <hi>Fifth Commandement,</hi> A <hi>Third
obliquity</hi> there was also as a <hi>breach</hi>
of the <hi>Tenth Commandement,</hi> against
those expresse words <hi>[Thou shalt not

and Woman being to <hi>content</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

availe the Gentlewoman in our

<hi>perform</hi> what they had <hi>promised</hi> either
to other, by joyning themselves in
<hi>Matrimony,</hi> and that without <hi>sin,</hi>
which is an argument that the <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
obliquity</hi> was only in the <hi>act of

this I answer, what in my opinion is

true, That if <hi>both</hi> the Parties were
now actually <hi>free</hi> from the <hi>Marriage

but were in <hi>conscience bound</hi> (unless
some other <hi>lawful impediment</hi> should
hinder) to <hi>joyn</hi> themselves together in
<hi>Matrimony,</hi> because none of the <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Obliquities,</hi> which made the
<hi>former act</hi> of <hi>promising unlawful,</hi> would
fall upon the after-<hi>act</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi>
to make it <hi>unlawful.</hi> But that <hi>Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is not direct to the Point in
hand, nor to the Case as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
for it may be observed
from the very <hi>from</hi> of the <hi>proposal,</hi>
that the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>promise,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Parties <hi>interchangeably</hi> bound
themselves, was not to <hi>Marry</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when they should be <hi>both free;</hi>
upon which <hi>false ground</hi> the Objection
runneth; that was indeed the <hi>thing</hi> they
aimed at therein; but the <hi>end</hi> is one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100680:24"/>
thing, and the <hi>matter</hi> another: but
the very <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>promise</hi> was,
the <hi>continuance</hi> of their <hi>mutual affection</hi>
either to other, with a <hi>resolution</hi> to
<hi>stay</hi> the one for the other, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party should happen to be <hi>free</hi>
from the <hi>bond</hi> of the <hi>present Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
till the other should be also <hi>free.</hi>
The continuance of which <hi>affection</hi>
and <hi>resolution,</hi> will upon examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be found subject to <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>some</hi>
of the <hi>three Obliquities</hi> aforesaid; and
therefore as such an <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi>
could not be <hi>entertained</hi> at the
first without <hi>sin;</hi> so neither can they
be now <hi>continued in</hi> without <hi>sin;</hi> for,
so long as they <hi>continue,</hi> the first of
the said <hi>Obliquities</hi> remaineth still,
both on his part and hers; the <hi>second</hi>
indeed by the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Husband</hi>
is <hi>ceased</hi> on her part, but <hi>remaineth</hi>
still on his; and the <hi>third</hi> contrarily
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100680:24"/>
being on his part <hi>ceased, remaineth</hi> still
on hers, as will evidently appear
to the understanding of any Man,
that shall take the pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it.</p>
               <p>§. 11. Yea, and it is further to be
considered, that the <hi>continuance</hi> of such
an <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>resolution</hi> may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expose as well the <hi>one</hi> as the <hi>other</hi>
to the <hi>assault</hi> of more strong and
dangerous <hi>temptations,</hi> now since the
<hi>Husbands death</hi> than before. The
<hi>danger</hi> on the Gentlemans part, this,
least by how much he is now by the
<hi>Husband death,</hi> put into a <hi>nearer possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
of enjoying his <hi>unlawful hopes,</hi>
he should grow into so much the
deeper <hi>loathing</hi> of his own <hi>bed,</hi> and
and so much the earnester longing
that, that which is now the <hi>only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle</hi>
to the fruition of his desires
were <hi>removed;</hi> of which thoughts,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100680:25"/>
who can tell how <hi>fearful</hi> the <hi>issues</hi>
might be? the <hi>slie Enemy</hi> being most
ready at all times, to <hi>practice</hi> upon the
<hi>corruption</hi> that is in the <hi>naughty heart</hi>
of Man; but especially having a
<hi>mighty advantage</hi> against him, when
he hath got his <hi>conscience</hi> as it were in
a <hi>snare,</hi> by the engagement of some
<hi>vow, promise,</hi> or <hi>setled resolution.</hi> And
then on the Gentlewomans part, the
<hi>danger,</hi> this, least having by her own
<hi>voluntary act</hi> debarr'd her self, of that
which is the only allowed <hi>remedy,</hi>
namely <hi>Marriage;</hi> she should by the
just judgement of God, be left to the
<hi>rage</hi> of the Disease of <hi>burning Lusts:</hi>
for upon what <hi>sound warrant</hi> can she
be <hi>confident,</hi> or with what <hi>Reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi>
that God should either <hi>preserve</hi>
her from, or <hi>assist</hi> her against <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in that kind, though she should
seek it of him with <hi>Fasting,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100680:25"/>
                  <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Tears,</hi> so long as she
tempceth Him by persisting in a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
obstinacy,</hi> against that means of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi>
which He hath appointed? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
where the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself
hath <hi>prevented</hi> the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Remedy</hi>
(as if the Husband should be <hi>long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi>
in a <hi>foraign Land,</hi> or <hi>held</hi> in <hi>close
Prison,</hi> or <hi>taken</hi> with a <hi>dead Palsie,</hi> or
some other <hi>bodily impotence,</hi> or the like)
there the Wife might comfortably
implore <hi>Gods assistance</hi> to preserve her
from being <hi>overcome</hi> by <hi>carnal tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and assuredly rest upon it by
<hi>faith,</hi> if she be not wanting to her self,
in putting to her own <hi>utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
because she hath a <hi>Promise</hi> to
rest upon for that purpose; and God
who is <hi>faithful</hi> in all his <hi>Promises,</hi> is
also <hi>faithful</hi> in this, of <hi>not suffering his
Servants to be tempted beyond their
strength:</hi> but for the Wife, by some
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100680:26"/>
                  <hi>inconsiderate act</hi> of her own, wherein
she <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>obstinately</hi> persisteth to
<hi>refuse</hi> the <hi>appointed means,</hi> and yet to
expect Gods <hi>assistance</hi> nevertheless, for
which she hath no <hi>Promise,</hi> is a fear,
full <hi>tempting</hi> of God; and it is but a
<hi>just thing</hi> with God, and she suffereth
it <hi>worthily</hi> for her <hi>presumption,</hi> if she be
<hi>left</hi> to her self, and so <hi>wrestle</hi> with the
<hi>temptation</hi> by her <hi>own strength,</hi> and so
be <hi>overcome</hi> thereby: For God who
hath after a sort <hi>tied</hi> himself by his
<hi>free</hi> and <hi>gracious Promise</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> us
in <hi>Via Regia,</hi> so long as we walk in
the ordinary known way that he hath
<hi>appointed</hi> for us, hath no where <hi>bound</hi>
himself to <hi>vouchsafe</hi> us the like power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
protection <hi>Extra viam Regiam,</hi>
if we <hi>refuse</hi> that <hi>high way,</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> in
<hi>by-paths</hi> of our own choosing, which
present <hi>dangers</hi> on both sides, and
the former Reasons laid together, do
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100680:26"/>
sufficiently prove, that the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is not at all <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>performe</hi>
her said <hi>unlawful Promise.</hi>

               <p>§. 12. Hitherto we have proceeded
in <hi>genere judiciali,</hi> by considering of
the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>validity, lawfulness</hi> and
<hi>obligation</hi> of the <hi>Promise</hi> for the <hi>time
past:</hi> Now we are to deal in <hi>genere

<hi>Christian wisdom</hi> is meetest to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
done, for the better both <hi>quieting</hi>
and <hi>regulating</hi> of the <hi>Conscience</hi> for the
<hi>time to come;</hi> wherein, submitting to
Men of <hi>better judgements,</hi> and <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
I give my advice as followeth,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Gentlewoman out
of the serious consideration of the
<hi>Promises,</hi> be brought to a through
feeling of the <hi>grievousness</hi> of those
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100680:27"/>
                  <hi>sins</hi> which she hath <hi>committed</hi> against
God, and wherein she hath so long
<hi>continued,</hi> that so she may not only be
<hi>humbled</hi> in his sight with true <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>remorse</hi> for the same,
proportionably to the greatness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
but also be provoked to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
measure of <hi>thankfulness</hi>
unto him, for his gratious goodness
in <hi>restraining</hi> her <hi>unlawful affections</hi>
from breaking out into <hi>actual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,</hi>
and <hi>preserving</hi> her when she
had run out so far in an <hi>evill way,</hi>
from rushing into more <hi>desperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities;</hi>
for, <hi>Erranti nullus terminus:</hi>
as a stone that tumbleth down a
steep hill; so Mans <hi>corruption</hi> when
it is once set on <hi>going,</hi> hath no <hi>stay</hi>
of self till it come to the bottom of
<hi>Hell,</hi> unless the Lord lay a <hi>stop</hi> in
the way: and it is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
a blessed act of Gods <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100680:27"/>
Providence,</hi> when we have
let loose the <hi>reins</hi> to our own <hi>lusts</hi> in
any kind, if they be <hi>bridled</hi> from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
headlong into tall <hi>excess</hi> of
<hi>wickedness; great sins</hi> require more
then <hi>ordinary Repentance,</hi> and <hi>great
mercies</hi> more then <hi>ordinary Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That having thus
<hi>humbled</hi> her self before God by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Contrition,</hi> she also make an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
free Confession</hi> of her said <hi>sins,</hi> to
him whom God hath delegated a
Ministerial Power to <hi>remit sins,</hi> that
she may receive <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
from his mouth; I mean the
<hi>Priest:</hi> and this I think meetest to
be done to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Diocess,</hi>
with one or more of his <hi>Presbytery,</hi>
such as he shall think good to take
to him to <hi>assist</hi> him; or else to some
<hi>other</hi> by <hi>his appointment:</hi> because the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100680:28"/>
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> is the <hi>chief Pastor,</hi> to whom
the <hi>care</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> most immediately
belongeth, within his <hi>own Diocess;</hi>
besides, that both the <hi>quality</hi> of the
<hi>person</hi> (if she be of <hi>eminent Place</hi> and
<hi>Rank)</hi> and the <hi>weightiness</hi> of the <hi>case,</hi>
make it so much the more proper
for his <hi>cognisance:</hi> But howsoever it
would be done to a Man of <hi>approved
wisdom,</hi> and such an one, as will be
both <hi>compassionate</hi> and <hi>secret,</hi> wherein
the more <hi>freely</hi> she shall make <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of her said <hi>sins,</hi> and the more
<hi>chearfully</hi> she shall subject her self to
perform such further <hi>acts,</hi> whether of
<hi>Humiliation</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> as the <hi>Bishop</hi>
or <hi>Priest</hi> shall advise to be done, in
testimony of her <hi>unfeigned Repentance,</hi>
the more <hi>sound comfort</hi> undoubtedly
with the <hi>sentence</hi> of <hi>Absolution</hi> bring
unto the <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100680:28"/>
§. 14. This done, then <hi>thirdly,</hi> that
she <hi>endeavour</hi> by all <hi>fair means,</hi> that
the Gentleman also her <hi>friend</hi> and
<hi>partner,</hi> in the aforesaid <hi>Promise,</hi> may
be brought to the like <hi>sight</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,</hi>
of the <hi>great sins</hi> that
were enwrapped in that <hi>act,</hi> and to a
<hi>true perswasion</hi> withal, that so long as
he <hi>continueth</hi> in the former <hi>unlawful
affection</hi> and <hi>resolution,</hi> he is not only
still <hi>under</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> of those <hi>sins,</hi> but
also in <hi>near danger</hi> (without Gods
great mercy preventing it) of falling
into <hi>other</hi> and <hi>greater sins;</hi> for which
purpose it will be expedient, that he
be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> dealt withal,
(yet with as much <hi>lenity</hi> as the <hi>state</hi> of
his <hi>Soul</hi> will suffer, and with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>secresie)</hi> and that by some such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
especially as he holdeth a <hi>reverend
opinion</hi> of both for <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
and to procure that this be done,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100680:29"/>
the Gentlewoman ought to take it
into her <hi>own</hi> especially <hi>care;</hi> which
it will concern her to do, not only
in <hi>Christian Charity</hi> for the <hi>good</hi> of
his <hi>Soul,</hi> but in <hi>Christian wisdom</hi> also
for her own future <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 15. For when he shall be once
throughly <hi>convinced</hi> in his <hi>judgement</hi>
and <hi>conscience,</hi> of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of
the <hi>Promise</hi> made between them, and
of the <hi>sinful inconveniences</hi> that attend
the <hi>continued purpose</hi> of <hi>fulfilling</hi> it,
there is a fair way open for that which
is <hi>next</hi> and <hi>fourthly</hi> to be done, <hi>viz.</hi>
That he be then earnestly moved for
his <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the said <hi>Promise</hi> to
the Gentlewoman, which (being it
was but a <hi>meer Promise,</hi> and no <hi>Vow,</hi>
as in the <hi>first Point</hi> hath already been
shewed) he hath in himself a <hi>full
power</hi> to make, and this also to be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100680:29"/>
done in the <hi>presence</hi> of such Persons,
as they shall make <hi>choice</hi> of betwixt
themselves to be <hi>witnesses</hi> of the said
<hi>Release;</hi> for although the <hi>Promise</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>utterly unlawful,</hi> hath no power
to <hi>bind,</hi> and so there needeth no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,</hi>
as of <hi>absolute necessity,</hi> in regard
of the thing it self; yet such <hi>Release</hi>
may be very <hi>behoofeful</hi> in regard of
the Gentlewomans <hi>person,</hi> and for the
<hi>quieting</hi> of her <hi>conscience,</hi> in case there
should remain any <hi>fears</hi> or <hi>scruples</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
least perhaps her <hi>promise</hi> should
<hi>still bind</hi> her; for as <hi>Satan</hi> laboureth
to <hi>benum</hi> the <hi>conscience</hi> with <hi>security</hi>
to make men <hi>bold</hi> to <hi>commit sins</hi>
without <hi>scruple,</hi> till he has <hi>drawn</hi>
them into the <hi>snare;</hi> so when he
seeth them <hi>offer</hi> to get <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>snare</hi>
again by <hi>Repentance,</hi> he is very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to inject <hi>needless Scruples</hi> and
<hi>Fears,</hi> if possibly he can, to hold them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100680:30"/>
in by means thereof; wherefore I
hold it very <hi>expedient</hi> that such a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease,</hi>
if it may be <hi>obtained,</hi> be not
<hi>neglected;</hi> for thereby the <hi>binding
power</hi> of the <hi>Promise,</hi> though we
should suppose it <hi>lawful,</hi> should be
quite taken away, so as there need
no scruple to remain: <hi>Abundans Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tela
non nocet,</hi> is a safe <hi>Aphorism;</hi> as
wary men when they <hi>pay monies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
seeing the <hi>Book crost,</hi> will crave
to have an <hi>Aquittance:</hi> So it may be
some <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>mind,</hi> to have a <hi>solemn Release</hi>
before <hi>witness,</hi> which say it should be
<hi>more then needeth,</hi> yet can do no <hi>harme</hi>
howsoever.</p>
               <p>§. 16. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
all the while <hi>before,</hi> and so ever
<hi>after</hi> that time only excepted, when
the <hi>Relaxation</hi> should be made, for
then it is requisite, she should be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100680:30"/>
personally present) carefully <hi>avoid</hi> the
<hi>company</hi> of that <hi>Gentleman,</hi> and <hi>he</hi>
likewise <hi>hers,</hi> so far as conveniently
may be; but at leastwise, by no means
<hi>converse together</hi> with any <hi>familiarity,</hi>
especially in <hi>private;</hi> least the former
<hi>unlawful affection</hi> should <hi>rekindle</hi> in
either Party, and so the <hi>disease</hi> after
some measure of <hi>cure</hi> grow to a <hi>re-laps,</hi>
which many times proves <hi>more
dangerous</hi> then the <hi>first malady;</hi> for
commonly when the <hi>unclean spirit</hi> is
<hi>ejected</hi> by <hi>Repentance,</hi> if once he make
himself <hi>master</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> again (as
he will attempt it, and without a
good watch haply effect it) he will
be sure at the <hi>re-entry,</hi> to come with
a <hi>new strength,</hi> and that <hi>sevenfold,</hi> to
what he had before, and <hi>needs must
the end of that man be worse then the
beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> she must therefore resolve
to shun all <hi>likely occasions</hi> of falling
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100680:31"/>
again into the same <hi>snare,</hi> so far as
the <hi>quality</hi> of her <hi>person</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi>
and the <hi>common affairs</hi> of <hi>life</hi> will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit:
And she had need also to use
her best <hi>care</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> (praying to
God dayly for Grace to strengthen
her thereunto) to <hi>withstand</hi> all <hi>wicked
temptations</hi> of the <hi>flesh</hi> that she be no
more <hi>foiled</hi> thereby, neither <hi>entangled</hi>
again in such <hi>sinful inconveniences,</hi> as
by Gods <hi>mercy</hi> she shall be now <hi>freed</hi>
from.</p>
               <p>§. 17. If in these <hi>Directions,</hi> I be
thought to <hi>deal</hi> with too much <hi>rigour</hi>
and <hi>strictness,</hi> it would be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that it's much better to put
the <hi>patient</hi> to a little more <hi>pain</hi> at the
first, then by <hi>skinning</hi> the <hi>wound</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to <hi>heal</hi> it <hi>deceitfully;</hi> and to suffer it
to <hi>rankle inward,</hi> which will breed a
great deal more <hi>grief</hi> at last.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:100680:31"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> that since all men (through
corrupt <hi>self-love,</hi> and privy <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi>
cleaving to our <hi>depraved nature)</hi> are
<hi>partial</hi> towards <hi>themselves,</hi> and apt to
deal more <hi>favourably</hi> with their <hi>own
sins,</hi> then they ought; it is therefore
safest for them (in their own Cases
especially) to encline to <hi>severity,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then <hi>indulgence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> that there may be a <hi>mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
used of the <hi>present Directions,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as the state of the <hi>Patient</hi>
(in the several variations thereof)
shall require; but that (for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>partiality)</hi> not to be permitted
to the <hi>sole liberty</hi> of the <hi>party himself,</hi>
but rather to be done by the <hi>advice</hi> of
a <hi>Ghostly Physitian,</hi> who if he be a
man of such <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi>
as is meet, will I doubt not allow a
greater <hi>indulgence</hi> in case he see it <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi>
then it could be <hi>safe</hi> for the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100680:32"/>
Party her self to take of her own
head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That in all this Discourse,
I take not upon me to write <hi>Edicts,</hi>
but to give my <hi>advice,</hi> that is to say, not
to prescribe to the <hi>judgment</hi> of others,
if any shall see cause to <hi>dissent,</hi> but to
deliver my <hi>own opinion</hi> (being reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
thereunto by a Reverend Friend)
with such a <hi>faithfulness</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> as
becometh me to do; and truly those
<hi>Parties</hi> whom it most <hi>concerneth,</hi> ought
not to <hi>blame me</hi> for it howsoever; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as there can be no cause to
<hi>suspect</hi> that I should be carryed with
any <hi>personal respects</hi> to be <hi>partial</hi> either
<hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> either of them; so God
is my <hi>witness</hi> whom I desire to <hi>serve,</hi> I
had not any <hi>intimation</hi> at all given me,
neither yet have so much as the <hi>least
conjecture</hi> in the World, who either of
them both might be.</p>

amidst so much <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>bloodshed</hi> on

lieth, and the rather for the <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

in general.</head>
               <p>1. MEns <hi>imployments</hi> are of two
sorts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>one</hi> of such as any man may
(without blame from <hi>others,</hi> or scruple
within himself) follow, meerly upon
his own <hi>score,</hi> if he find himself in
some measure <hi>able</hi> for it, and have a
<hi>mind</hi> thereunto; he hath a <hi>power</hi> in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100680:34"/>
himself (aud that <hi>jure proprio,</hi> by a
<hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>original right,</hi> without
any necessary <hi>derivation</hi> from others)
to <hi>dispose</hi> of himself, his time and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
in that way; for the exercise
of which <hi>power,</hi> there needeth no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
or positive <hi>warrant</hi> from any other
person, but it is presumed he is (as in
relation to <hi>others)</hi> sufficiently <hi>warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
thereunto in this, in that he is not
by any <hi>Superiour Authority,</hi> Divine or
Humane, <hi>forbidden</hi> so to do; and upon
this account it is, that Men <hi>betake</hi>
themselves, upon their <hi>own choice</hi> and
<hi>liking,</hi> to <hi>Husbandry, Merchandize,
Manual Occupations,</hi> the <hi>study of the
Law,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. But <hi>another sort</hi> of <hi>Imployments</hi>
there are, whereunto a man hath not
a <hi>just right</hi> primitively and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
neither may he <hi>lawfully exercise</hi> the
same meerly upon his <hi>own choice,</hi> but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100680:35"/>
it is necessary, that that <hi>power</hi> should
be <hi>derived</hi> upon <hi>him</hi> from some such
person or persons, as have <hi>sufficient
Authority</hi> to <hi>warrant</hi> him for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Such is the <hi>Imployment</hi> of a
<hi>Iudge,</hi> a <hi>Constable,</hi> an <hi>Arbitrator,</hi> &amp;c.
which are therefore said to be <hi>juris
delegati,</hi> because the <hi>right</hi> that any
man hath to such <hi>Imployments</hi> accrueth
unto him by virtue of that <hi>Authority</hi>
which he receiveth by <hi>Delegation</hi> or
<hi>Deputation</hi> from some <hi>other</hi> that hath
a <hi>right</hi> by <hi>Command, Election, Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or otherwise to <hi>Empower</hi> him
thereunto, whence are those usual
forms, <hi>Quo jure, Quo warranto? Who
made thee a Iudge? By what authority
dost thou those things?</hi> or, <hi>Who gave thee
this authority?</hi> A man may betake
himself to the <hi>Study,</hi> and so to the
<hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
but he may not take upon him
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100680:35"/>
to be a <hi>Iudge</hi> without <hi>Commission</hi> from
his <hi>Sovereign;</hi> so he may follow <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,</hi>
and <hi>Merchandry,</hi> upon his own
<hi>choice,</hi> but he may not do the Office
of a <hi>Constable,</hi> unless he be <hi>chosen</hi>
by the <hi>Neighbours;</hi> or of an <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator,</hi>
unless <hi>chosen</hi> by the <hi>Parties</hi>
thereunto.</p>
               <p>3. Now although as well the <hi>one
sort</hi> as the <hi>other,</hi> after a Man hath
<hi>addicted</hi> himself to the <hi>one,</hi> or is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi>
to the <hi>other,</hi> may not unfitly be
termed his <hi>Particular Calling,</hi> and the
<hi>latter</hi> perhaps with better <hi>propriety,</hi>
then the <hi>former,</hi> (for the word <hi>Calling</hi>
properly importeth the <hi>Action</hi> of some
other person) yet according to the
common Notion, which by custom
of speech among us, we have of these
terms <hi>[The General and the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Calling]</hi> the <hi>Imployments</hi> of the
<hi>former sort,</hi> are usually taken to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100680:36"/>
the <hi>Particular Calling</hi> of Men; and
those of the <hi>latter sort,</hi> will be found
(if well considered) to fall rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>General Calling,</hi> as branches
or parts thereof, inasmuch as the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
of such <hi>Imployments,</hi> is a part of
that <hi>moral duty,</hi> which all Men (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their several respective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations)
ought to perform to others,
being by them <hi>empowered</hi> thereunto,
upon the tie of <hi>Obedience, Contract,
Friendship,</hi> &amp;c. but for <hi>distinction sake,</hi>
as the <hi>Latins</hi> make a <hi>difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>vitae institutum</hi> and <hi>munus,</hi> we
may call those of the <hi>former sort,
Mans profession,</hi> and those of the
<hi>latter sort</hi> his <hi>Office;</hi> so a Man is by
<hi>Profession</hi> a <hi>Lawyer;</hi> by <hi>Office</hi> a <hi>Iudge;</hi>
by <hi>Profession</hi> a <hi>Husbandman;</hi> by <hi>Office</hi>
a <hi>Constable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. To bring this <hi>Discourse</hi> home to
the <hi>present business,</hi> we are next to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100680:36"/>
enquire, to whether <hi>sort</hi> of the <hi>two,</hi>
the <hi>Imployment</hi> of a <hi>Souldier</hi> doth more
<hi>properly appertain;</hi> that is, whether we
are to conceive of it as a <hi>Profession</hi>
which a man may at his <hi>own choice</hi>
fix upon, as his <hi>particular vocation;</hi> or
rather as an <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>service,</hi>
which he is to <hi>undergo,</hi> when by the
<hi>command</hi> of his <hi>Prince,</hi> he shall be
thereto <hi>appointed,</hi> and so to come ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under the notion of a <hi>General Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</hi>
To me it seemeth clearly to be
of the <hi>latter sort.</hi> For (1.) in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of St. <hi>Paul, 2 Tim. 2. 4. No man
that warreth, entangleth himself in the
affaires of this life, that he may please
him that hath chosen him to be a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier;</hi>
the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, applyed
to him that <hi>warreth</hi> with the <hi>note</hi> of
<hi>Universality</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>annexed,</hi>
seemeth to imply, as if he <hi>supposed</hi> that
no man might go to <hi>warr,</hi> unless he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100680:37"/>
were <hi>chosen</hi> for that <hi>service</hi> by some
other person that might Command
it. Nor do I see (2.) what good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
can be otherwise made of
that <hi>speech</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mat. 26.
57. <hi>All they that take the Sword, shall
perish with the Sword;</hi> or what should
be the <hi>crime</hi> there intended to be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
by this Phrase of <hi>taking the
Sword,</hi> if it be not <hi>this,</hi> for a man to
<hi>take</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> into his <hi>hand</hi> by his
<hi>own authority,</hi> before it be <hi>put</hi> into his
<hi>hand</hi> by that <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> whom
God hath immediately <hi>trusted</hi> with
the <hi>bearing</hi> and <hi>managing</hi> of it. Now
(3.) can that be said to be a <hi>Mans
Profession,</hi> or <hi>particular calling,</hi> which
Men of all Professions are (in <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
to their <hi>Governours,</hi> and for the
<hi>service</hi> of their <hi>Country) bound</hi> to <hi>perform</hi>
whensoever they shall be by <hi>Lawful
Authority, called</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100680:37"/>
5. If these <hi>premises</hi> will be <hi>granted,</hi>
it will soon appear, that the <hi>answer</hi> to
the <hi>Question proposed,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the former Letter (as it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
there in <hi>Terminis,</hi> and in <hi>Thesi,</hi>
abstractedly from the <hi>consideration</hi> of
the <hi>person</hi> in the said Letter <hi>characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
and those other <hi>circumstances</hi>
which may <hi>vary</hi> the <hi>Case)</hi> must be in
the <hi>Negative,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is not lawful
to be a Souldier, upon the same account
that men apply themselves to Trades, to
the practice of the Laws, and to other
(like) civil Imployments.</hi>

               <p>1. THe <hi>care</hi> that ought to be in
every Man that <hi>taketh</hi> upon

well assured that he hath a <hi>sufficient
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100680:38"/>

less requisite in a <hi>Souldier,</hi> then in any
other <hi>Officer;</hi> yea rather by so much
more requisite in <hi>him,</hi> then in most
of <hi>them,</hi> by how much the <hi>matter</hi> he
is conversant about, <hi>(viz, the Life of
Man)</hi> is of <hi>greater consequence,</hi> then
are the <hi>matters</hi> in which most of them
are employed; for the <hi>Souldier</hi> every
time he <hi>draweth</hi> his <hi>Sword</hi> in the <hi>field,</hi>
is by the very <hi>nature</hi> of his <hi>Imployment</hi>
supposed to do it either with a <hi>resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to <hi>lose</hi> his <hi>own,</hi> or to <hi>take away</hi>
his <hi>enemies Life;</hi> else he doth but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate,</hi>
and is <hi>unfaithful</hi> in the <hi>service</hi>
he has undertaken: In which <hi>service</hi>
if it be his fortune either to <hi>kill</hi> or to
be <hi>killed,</hi> he is actually and deeply
<hi>guilty;</hi> but if neither, yet that very
<hi>resolution</hi> maketh him <hi>intentionally
guilty</hi> of the Transgression of the sixth
Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not kill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100680:38"/>
in case he have no <hi>good right,</hi> so far to
dispose either of his <hi>own,</hi> or the <hi>others
life.</hi> It concerneth him therefore to
look well to that; both what <hi>power</hi>
belongeth to him, as a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and
by what <hi>Authority</hi> he claimeth the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
of such a <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Most certain it is, that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and originally the <hi>power</hi> to <hi>dispose</hi>
of Mans Life <hi>(Ius vitae &amp; necis)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth

of <hi>humane Society,</hi> (in the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

or the <hi>power of the Sword)</hi> it may
therefore be <hi>lawfully exercised</hi> by men;
but within that <hi>latitude,</hi> and in
<hi>order,</hi> as God hath communicated
it to them, but not farther nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>3. Now God hath not given to
any man, either <hi>Sovereign</hi> or <hi>Subject,</hi>
power over his own <hi>life,</hi> to <hi>destroy</hi> it
by his <hi>own voluntary act</hi> in any Case;

a <hi>power</hi> over his own <hi>life,</hi> which
God hath not allowed.</p>
               <p>4. Add hereunto the <hi>injustice,</hi> that
he thereby doth to his <hi>Sovereign</hi> and
<hi>Countrey.</hi> God hath given to his <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents</hi>
here on Earth, a <hi>right in,</hi> and
a <hi>power over</hi> the <hi>persons</hi> of all their

spend</hi> at their <hi>own pleasure,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>apparent wrong</hi> done their <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
interest; for as he that shall
<hi>kill</hi> a <hi>private person,</hi> is not only an <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender</hi>
against <hi>God,</hi> and against that
<hi>person,</hi> in depriving him of <hi>life;</hi> but
is also by the Interpretation of the
Laws, (according to the importance
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100680:40"/>
of the ancient form of Enditing) an <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender</hi>
against the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi>
of his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> in depriving him of
a <hi>Subject,</hi> and consequently of the
<hi>interest</hi> he had in his <hi>person,</hi> and of
the <hi>use</hi> he might have had of his
<hi>service:</hi> so he that is so <hi>prodigal</hi> of his
<hi>own life</hi> as to hazzard it upon the
<hi>Sword</hi> in <hi>fight,</hi> without his <hi>Sovereigns
Authority,</hi> if he <hi>perish,</hi> is not only
<hi>guilty</hi> of his being <hi>accessary</hi> to his <hi>own
destruction;</hi> but doth also an act in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
and prejudicial to his <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi>
at whose <hi>service</hi> and <hi>disposal</hi>
(under God) his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>person</hi> ought
to be.</p>
               <p>5 And as his <hi>presumption</hi> cannot
be <hi>excused,</hi> if he be <hi>slain</hi> upon that
account; so neither can he <hi>justifie</hi>
the <hi>killing</hi> of another (though an <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my)</hi>
in <hi>Battle,</hi> if he have no other
<hi>warrant</hi> for taking of <hi>Armes,</hi> then
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100680:40"/>
from <hi>himself;</hi> for <hi>Warr</hi> is a kind of
<hi>judicature,</hi> wherein the <hi>Prince</hi> that
<hi>wageth</hi> the <hi>Warr,</hi> is as the <hi>Iudge</hi> that
<hi>giveth sentence</hi> of <hi>death</hi> against the
<hi>Enemy,</hi> as a <hi>disturber</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> of
his <hi>Country,</hi> and all that <hi>engage</hi> in the
<hi>Warr</hi> under him, are but as so many
<hi>executioners</hi> of the <hi>sentence</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by him; and he that <hi>executeth</hi> the
<hi>sentence</hi> of <hi>death</hi> upon another, must
do it by some <hi>lawfull Authority,</hi> as well
as he that <hi>pronounceth</hi> the <hi>sentence;</hi> or
else he is a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> as well as <hi>This.</hi>
Now the <hi>Souldier</hi> that by <hi>fighting</hi> on
the <hi>one side,</hi> doth <hi>ipso facto</hi> declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those of the <hi>other side</hi> as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
if he so <hi>engage</hi> of his <hi>own mind</hi>
only, he doth indeed, upon the point,
take upon him the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Iudge,</hi>
being none, and so <hi>runneth</hi> before he
be <hi>sent:</hi> or if it shall be said in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
That he doth it not as a <hi>Iudge,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:100680:41"/>
but as the <hi>Executioner</hi> of the <hi>sentence</hi>
pronounced by that <hi>Prince</hi> into whose
<hi>service</hi> he hath put himself, and who
by the <hi>accepting</hi> of his <hi>service</hi> hath
sufficiently <hi>authorized</hi> him to do such
<hi>execution:</hi> Your Letter hath suggested
to me this ready Answer, <hi>That the
sentence pronounced by one that is not his
Lawful Sovereign, and by consequence,
whose judgment he is not warranted to
follow, is of no more validity</hi> (as in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him) <hi>then</hi> Sententia lata a non
judice, <hi>and therefore can be no warrant
to him to execute it.</hi> True it is, that with
<hi>licence</hi> from his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> he may <hi>serve</hi>
under another <hi>Prince,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
do such <hi>execution,</hi> as we now
speak of; because the <hi>Sovereign</hi> by so
<hi>licensing</hi> him, doth really referr him
over from <hi>himself</hi> to <hi>anothers judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and consequently <hi>warrant</hi> him
to follow the same, and so render him
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100680:41"/>
                  <hi>capable</hi> (upon the others acceptance) to
<hi>execute</hi> it. All this is true, but nothing
to our purpose, because it doth <hi>destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere
suppositum;</hi> for we now suppose
the Case of a <hi>Souldier</hi> putting himself
into <hi>service,</hi> under a <hi>Foreigner</hi> of his
<hi>own mind,</hi> and where <hi>himself thinketh

               <p>1. SIth the <hi>goodness</hi> or <hi>badness</hi> of
Mens <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>undertakings</hi>
dependeth very much upon the <hi>end</hi>
which they propose to themselves
therein; he that would desire to lead
a <hi>Souldiers life,</hi> must narrowly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
his own heart, what it is <hi>bona

<hi>chiefly</hi> induced him to that desire,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100680:42"/>
and what <hi>affinity</hi> there is between that
<hi>end,</hi> which he proposeth to himself, as
the <hi>main scope</hi> of his Intentions, and
that which is or ought to be the <hi>true
end</hi> of the thing it self; the <hi>true end</hi>
of the <hi>Warr,</hi> which only can warrant
it <hi>lawful,</hi> we all know is the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>preservation</hi> of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in
<hi>Peace,</hi> by repressing (or preventing)
all <hi>Seditions,</hi> or <hi>Hostile attempts</hi> to the
contrary; but as in other things it
often happeneth, according to that
saying <hi>[Finis non idem est artis &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificis]</hi>
so here many times the <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi>
hath another <hi>end</hi> to himself far
distant from that of <hi>Warr,</hi> and the
more <hi>distant</hi> ever the <hi>worse;</hi> as on the

2. Now the <hi>ends,</hi> which men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to follow the <hi>Warrs</hi> do usually
propose to themselves in so doing,
are especially one of these Three,
<hi>Lucre, Honour,</hi> or <hi>to do their Countrey
service;</hi> concerning which we are to
enquire severally, whether or no, and
how far forth, any of these may be
a <hi>sufficient inducement</hi> to a <hi>Christian,</hi> or
but <hi>morall man,</hi> to follow the <hi>Warrs,</hi>
as his <hi>particular Calling,</hi> or <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For <hi>Lucre</hi> first: He that hath
a <hi>warrant</hi> otherwise to imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as a <hi>Souldier,</hi> may doubtless
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
both <hi>receive pay</hi> and <hi>require</hi> it;
<hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> allowed the <hi>Souldiers</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 14. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
thought it not reasonable, that any
man should go to <hi>warfare</hi> at his <hi>own
charges,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 7. Nor so only, but
he may also, in putting himself upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100680:43"/>
that <hi>imployment</hi> (being called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto)
have an <hi>eye</hi> to his <hi>profit,</hi> and
an <hi>actual intention.</hi> (if moderate and
otherwise rightly qualified) of <hi>getting</hi>
himself a <hi>livelyhood,</hi> yea and of <hi>raising</hi>
himself a <hi>fortune</hi> (as we call it) by
his <hi>service</hi> therein; even as men in the
<hi>choice</hi> of other <hi>Professions,</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<hi>Offices,</hi> usually do and so may
do without sin; but to propose to
himself <hi>Lucre,</hi> as the <hi>main end</hi> and
<hi>scope</hi> of following the <hi>Warrs</hi> (as it is
evident by their actions, that very
many of our Common Souldiers do)
is one of the most <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
things in the World: so far is
it from being a <hi>sufficient inducement</hi> to
any man to make that his <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
How can it be imagined to be
consistent with that <hi>Charity, Iustice,</hi>
and <hi>Moderation,</hi> that should be in
every <hi>Christian</hi> to set up a <hi>Trade</hi> of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100680:43"/>
                  <hi>killing of Men</hi> for Money? The meer
<hi>Mercenary Souldier</hi> therefore, or a
<hi>Souldier</hi> of <hi>fortune</hi> (as we call him) I
finde every where inveigh'd against;
as one of the greatest <hi>Scourages</hi> or
<hi>Plagues</hi> of Mankind; for such men
never look at the <hi>Cause</hi> they engage
for, whether it be <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> but
at the <hi>pay</hi> and <hi>prey;</hi> and therefore
they take their best Markets, and care
not whom they <hi>undo, kill</hi> and <hi>oppress,</hi>
by <hi>Violence, Rapine, Murther,</hi> and
<hi>Plunder,</hi> so they may but <hi>enrich</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thereby, and can do it with
safety: Nor will they stick, if there
be an advantage to be made of it;
and that they can spy a fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
for it, either to <hi>betray</hi> their own
<hi>party,</hi> or to <hi>revolt</hi> to the <hi>other side,</hi> or
to do any other act, though never
so base and dishonest, <hi>Nulla fides
pietasque viris qui castra sequuntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:100680:44"/>
4. Next the <hi>intuition</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi>
and <hi>Glory</hi> to be acquired by <hi>worthy
Actions</hi> in the <hi>Warrs,</hi> may be not only
<hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>commendable</hi> also and <hi>useful</hi>
in a <hi>Souldier;</hi> and truly this of <hi>Glory</hi>
is a more <hi>noble end,</hi> of a higher pitch,
and more befitttng a Generous spirit
by much, then that of <hi>Lucre</hi> is; both
because Men of <hi>eminent Birth,</hi> and
<hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> are aptest to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it; whereas <hi>Gain</hi> worketh
most upon the <hi>lower sort</hi> of Men, and
also because it putteth Men upon
more worthy <hi>Enterprizes,</hi> and such as
may win <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation;</hi> and
<hi>restraineth them</hi> from those <hi>baser acts</hi> of
<hi>Injustice, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> to which
the <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>Gain</hi> usually prompteth
the <hi>mercenary</hi> Man; but yet as to the
warranting of the <hi>Souldier</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that his <hi>Profession,</hi> (which is the
Point now in hand) this of <hi>Glory</hi> is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100680:44"/>
of no <hi>importance,</hi> then was that of
<hi>Gain;</hi> for the <hi>right end</hi> of <hi>Warr</hi> being
a <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>honourable Peace,</hi> there is
something common to both (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequential
to the <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>Glory;</hi> as
well as of <hi>Gain)</hi> so <hi>inconsistent</hi> with
that <hi>end,</hi> that it setteth them at an
<hi>equal,</hi> or not much <hi>unequal distance</hi>
therefrom: For as he that aimeth to
<hi>gain</hi> by the Warrs, cannot but desire
the <hi>continuance</hi> of Warr, that so his
<hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>gain</hi> may continue; so he that
aimeth to get himself <hi>Glory</hi> by the
Warrs, cannot but desire the <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
of Warr, that so the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>encreasing</hi> his <hi>Glory</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue;
for there is a <hi>Dropsie</hi> of <hi>vain-glory</hi>
in the <hi>Ambitious,</hi> as well as of
<hi>Avarice</hi> in the <hi>Covetous,</hi> as <hi>thirsty</hi> and
<hi>unsatiable</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> as in the <hi>other;</hi>
whence it cometh to pass, that both
the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> use their <hi>utmost
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100680:45"/>
wits</hi> and <hi>endeavours</hi> to find occasions
to <hi>lengthen</hi> the Warrs, and to <hi>obstruct</hi>
and <hi>retard</hi> (so much as lieth in them)
the <hi>advices</hi> of <hi>Peace:</hi> Nay, let me add
moreover, that in this respect at least
<hi>(viz.</hi> as to the effectual hindring of
Peace) that of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> is
much the more <hi>dangerous end</hi> of the
two; because this <hi>humour</hi> is aptest to
<hi>seize</hi> upon the <hi>greatest persons,</hi> and
such as by <hi>priviledge</hi> of their <hi>birth,
eminency</hi> of their <hi>places, activeness</hi> of
their <hi>spirits, glory</hi> of their <hi>former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or other like advantages, bear a
great <hi>sway</hi> in <hi>Counsels,</hi> and are of some
<hi>authority</hi> in the <hi>Armies:</hi> whereas the
<hi>Peasantry,</hi> in whom most of the other
<hi>humour</hi> (that of base <hi>Lucre)</hi> aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
have neither the <hi>wit</hi> nor the
<hi>power</hi> ordinarily to do much harm.
It hath therefore been a constant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in all times and places, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100680:45"/>
the <hi>embroyling</hi> most <hi>Common-wealths</hi> in
Warrs, in the mean time, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>ruin</hi> in the end, hath grown
from the <hi>restlessness</hi> of some <hi>ambitious
spirits,</hi> and their immoderate <hi>thirst</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Patriam tamen obruit olim</l>
                  <l>Gloria paucorum, &amp; laudis tituli<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>

                  <bibl>Juvenal Sat. 10.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>5. So that if there be any possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of finding a person <hi>capable</hi> to take
upon him the <hi>imployment</hi> of a <hi>Souldier,</hi>
as his proper <hi>Profession,</hi> it must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those that propose to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the <hi>same end</hi> therein, that is, or
ought to be the <hi>end of Warr;</hi> that is
to say, those that after an impartial
search of their own hearts, can truly
say (and not pretend it only) <hi>That
their chiefest aim in applying themselves
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100680:46"/>
to the Warrs, is to do their King and
Country service, in procuring or preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Peace thereof:</hi> which no man
can truly say, but he that preferreth
the <hi>publick Good,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of his
<hi>Country,</hi> before all <hi>private interests.</hi>
The tryal whereof is, if he take up
Armes with this <hi>Resolution,</hi> and by his
after carriage make it <hi>good,</hi> not to do
any <hi>act,</hi> or enterprise any thing for
his <hi>own benefit, glory,</hi> or <hi>safety</hi> that
may hinder; nor to refuse any <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
or <hi>hazzard,</hi> that may probably
promote the <hi>obtaining</hi> of that <hi>end,</hi>
which Qualification supposed, I
deny not but that a Man may find
<hi>warrant</hi> to go on in the way of a
<hi>Souldier</hi> as his proper <hi>Profession,</hi> and
that in two Cases.</p>
               <p>6. First, that which (in the nature
of the <hi>(Imployment</hi> it self) is rather an
<hi>Office</hi> then a <hi>Profession</hi> (such as we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100680:46"/>
have already shewen the <hi>Soulders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi>
to be) may yet become to
the person so imployed, as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Profession,</hi> if he shall be <hi>appointed</hi>
thereunto by <hi>lawful Authority;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it be done with a <hi>declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
whether expresly or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
declared) of continuing him
for <hi>life,</hi> or for any <hi>long space</hi> in the
same; and that the said <hi>imployment</hi>
during such his <hi>continuance</hi> therein,
shall require his <hi>personal attendance,</hi>
either constantly or for the most part:
As for example, a <hi>Lawyer</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Practice, is by his <hi>Sovereign</hi>
called to be a <hi>Iudge</hi> of either Bench,
or a <hi>Baron</hi> of the Exchequer, the
<hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Iudge</hi> is now become his
<hi>Profession,</hi> or <hi>particular Vocation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is supposed that he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that <hi>Office;</hi> and the <hi>executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of that <hi>Office</hi> will require his <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:100680:47"/>
thereupon, in the yearly
<hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Circuits:</hi> but if the <hi>King</hi>
shall appoint a <hi>Serjeant</hi> or <hi>Counsellor</hi>
at the Law, by his particular <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
to ride this <hi>Summers Circuit,</hi>
into such and such Countries, and
there to <hi>execute</hi> the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Iudge,</hi>
the Party so <hi>constituted</hi> and <hi>appointed</hi>
hath by virtue of that <hi>Commission,</hi> full
power to do the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Iudge</hi> in that
<hi>Circuit,</hi> and is to be received and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with the title of <hi>Lord,</hi> and all
other testimonies of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi>
in as much ample manner as
other <hi>Iudges</hi> in their <hi>Circuits</hi> are;
yet doth he not thereby come to be
<hi>denominated</hi> a <hi>Iudge,</hi> as if that were
his proper <hi>Profession,</hi> or ordinary
<hi>Calling,</hi> as in the former Case; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is <hi>impowered</hi> to <hi>execute</hi> the
<hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Iudge,</hi> but during the time
of that <hi>Circuit</hi> only: Nor is his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100680:47"/>
                  <hi>attendance</hi> upon that <hi>Office</hi> any longer
required, or so much as allowed him.
In like manner, if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
shall make choice of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Quality to be <hi>Governour</hi> of
<hi>Dover Castle,</hi> or of <hi>Barwick,</hi> that <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
then is as his <hi>Profession</hi> or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Calling;</hi> because it is to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
he is to continue in that <hi>imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and to <hi>attend</hi> the same, untill
the <hi>Kings pleasure</hi> be further known
therein: but if the <hi>King</hi> upon some
suddain <hi>Insurrection</hi> and <hi>Invasion</hi>
should raise an Army, and make
choice of some person of like Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to have the <hi>Conduct</hi> thereof, for
the <hi>Suppressing</hi> or <hi>Repelling</hi> such <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
or <hi>Invasion,</hi> his <hi>Imployment</hi>
in that service being but <hi>temporary</hi>
and to <hi>determine,</hi> as soon as the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
were ended, should not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then in <hi>curtesie,</hi> denominate
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100680:48"/>
him a <hi>General;</hi> or at least not be
<hi>esteemed</hi> as his permanent <hi>profession,</hi>
but only as a <hi>transient Office:</hi> This is
one Case.</p>
               <p>7. The other Case (which is more
pertinent to the business of these
Letters) is of such as desire to <hi>imploy
themselves</hi> in the exercise of Armes in
<hi>Foreign Service,</hi> that they may attain
to such knowledge or experience in
the <hi>Art Military,</hi> as might the better
enable them to do their <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Country Service,</hi> whensoever there
should be need thereof; for since the
<hi>Manegery</hi> of Warr, is long since
grown into an <hi>Art,</hi> and that not to
be learned from <hi>Books,</hi> or from <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
study;</hi> but to be acquired by
much <hi>practice,</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
observation:</hi> and the rather, for
that the particular <hi>Rules</hi> of that <hi>Art,</hi>
do not stand at such a certain <hi>stay,</hi> as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100680:48"/>
those of most other <hi>Arts</hi> do, but are
dayly <hi>altered</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> by <hi>new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions:</hi>
It is very necessary for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>State</hi> to be well provided of a
good number of such persons of their
<hi>own Nation,</hi> as should be <hi>expert</hi> and
<hi>skilful</hi> in that <hi>Art;</hi> least they should
be <hi>forced,</hi> if an <hi>unexpected Warr</hi> should
happen, to call in <hi>Foreigners</hi> for <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,</hi>
which is both <hi>dishonourable</hi>
and <hi>dangerous:</hi> the necessity hereof
too well appeareth by the <hi>evill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi>
of the <hi>neglect</hi> of it in <hi>this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in these <hi>latter times,</hi> especially in
the <hi>Reigns</hi> of the <hi>two last Kings,</hi> by
reason of the <hi>long Peace;</hi> and (which
commonly breedeth out of it, as the
<hi>rust</hi> and <hi>canker</hi> thereof) <hi>tenderness</hi> of
<hi>Education,</hi> and <hi>voluptuous living.</hi> The
<hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the
generality of them, had so much <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated</hi>
from the <hi>Martial Prowess</hi> of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100680:49"/>
their <hi>Ancestors</hi> renowned in all <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,</hi>
that in the beginning of these
<hi>unnatural Warrs,</hi> there were very few
to be found of our own <hi>Nobility</hi> and
<hi>Gentry,</hi> fit to have <hi>command</hi> in an
<hi>Army,</hi> or that knew any thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Warr;</hi> insomuch as
<hi>use</hi> was made on both sides of <hi>Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Men,</hi> and most of them <hi>Scots,</hi>
who being for the most part bred up
abroad (in <hi>France</hi> especially, a place
of much action) had learned <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
more then our <hi>English</hi> had in such
matters, by which <hi>advantage</hi> they had
so wound themselves into the <hi>chief
places</hi> of <hi>Command,</hi> and had such an
<hi>influence</hi> into the <hi>Councils</hi> of both
sides, that the <hi>Warr</hi> was in a manner
<hi>wholy ordered</hi> by their <hi>directions,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the great power that <hi>Ruthen, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,
King, Meldram,</hi> &amp;c. had in the
Armies on either side.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100680:49"/>
8. The <hi>weightiness</hi> then of <hi>Princes
Affairs,</hi> upon all <hi>emergent occasions</hi>
rendring it <hi>necessary</hi> for them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have <hi>power</hi> to <hi>command</hi> their
<hi>Subjects</hi> of whatsoever Rank or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to serve as <hi>Souldiers</hi> in their
Warrs; but also to provide aforehand
for a <hi>supply</hi> of <hi>able men,</hi> both for <hi>places</hi>
of <hi>Command,</hi> and to execute other
parts of that <hi>service,</hi> which cannot be
done, unless a considerable number
of persons be <hi>trained up</hi> in the <hi>exercise</hi>
of <hi>Armes,</hi> and <hi>bred Souldiers:</hi> It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<hi>necessary,</hi> that some persons
be, either by their Authority <hi>appointed,</hi>
or at least by their permission <hi>allowed,</hi>
to addict themselves to a <hi>Military
course of life,</hi> as their proper <hi>Profession</hi>
and <hi>Calling,</hi> which <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
from their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
warrant to their <hi>conscience</hi> the
<hi>choice</hi> of that <hi>Profession;</hi> supposing (as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100680:50"/>
now we do) that the <hi>intention</hi> be <hi>right,</hi>
the person <hi>meetly qualified,</hi> and all other
<hi>Cautions</hi> in respect of the <hi>matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
circumstances</hi> and otherwise duly
observed.</p>
               <p>9. The <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>learning</hi> this <hi>Art</hi>
granted, there may sometimes follow
a further necessity, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>learning</hi> it
<hi>abroad,</hi> and after it is learned, of <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising</hi>

to be in a <hi>setled Peace</hi> and <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
under the <hi>Government</hi> of a <hi>lawful

and of what little avail to the attaining

(as in the way of <hi>Reply</hi> to some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of your <hi>Answer</hi> to his first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
to this purpose; Suppose <hi>two great

have had <hi>long Warrs</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

side,</hi> then the <hi>other,</hi> if in case a <hi>third

to <hi>Establish</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Christendome,</hi>
after other <hi>offers</hi> and <hi>mediations</hi> for
that purpose made in vain, might
lawfully <hi>joyn</hi> in <hi>Armes</hi> with the <hi>one
party</hi> to force the <hi>other</hi> to <hi>Peace,</hi> why
a <hi>private person</hi> might not as lawfully
(having the same intention) enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Armes</hi> for the same purpose; and
the reason of <hi>demand</hi> thereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> is (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to other Princes and States)
but as one <hi>private man</hi> to <hi>another;</hi> for
being called to the <hi>Regiment</hi> of his <hi>own
people</hi> only, he is but as a <hi>private man</hi> in
<hi>Aliena Republica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But that there is a great <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
between a <hi>Sovereign Prince</hi> and
a <hi>private person</hi> in this <hi>affair,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied; insomuch that I find
in the very same <hi>passage</hi> (put in as it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100680:52"/>
were by way of <hi>Objection) three</hi> very
considerable <hi>differences.</hi> First, That
<hi>Princes</hi> may, and sometimes are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
by <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> for the
<hi>defence</hi> of their <hi>Allies</hi> to take up <hi>Armes,</hi>
which cannot be the <hi>case</hi> of <hi>private
Men.</hi> Secondly, That <hi>Princes</hi> may see
cause to set in for their <hi>own safety</hi> and
<hi>interest,</hi> least the <hi>prevailing party</hi> might
grow <hi>too Potent,</hi> and so themselves
might be <hi>oppressed</hi> by him. Thirdly,
there is a greater probability in a
<hi>Prince</hi> of compassing that Noble and
Glorious end, <hi>The Peace of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
then can be in a <hi>private Man.</hi>
All these <hi>differences</hi> are allowed there
as true; but yet <hi>excepted</hi> against, as
not contributing any thing to the
<hi>justice</hi> of the <hi>cause</hi> which is here the
Question.</p>
               <p>3. If these do not, yet a <hi>Fourth diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
there is, that will (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100680:52"/>
manifestly contribute thereunto,
to wit, that <hi>Ius Belli,</hi> is <hi>Penes Principem
solam:</hi> in the business of Warr, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
have a <hi>judicial, private Men</hi> an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive
power</hi> only; and he that hath
no <hi>power</hi> but to <hi>execute</hi> the <hi>sentence</hi> of
a <hi>Iudge,</hi> is bound to waite the <hi>Iudges
sentence</hi> before he offer to act; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he shall <hi>act</hi> beyond his <hi>lawful
power,</hi> which is <hi>unjust:</hi> Not but that
a <hi>Prince</hi> if he raise a Warr where he
ought not, is <hi>unjust</hi> too; even as a
<hi>Iudge</hi> is <hi>unjust,</hi> which pronounceth a
<hi>wrong sentence:</hi> but herein is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between them for taking up
of Armes. The <hi>Prince</hi> having <hi>jus
agendi</hi> in that behalf, may do it <hi>just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and he may do it <hi>unjustly;</hi> yet
where he doth it <hi>unjustly,</hi> doth but
<hi>abuti jure suo:</hi> but the <hi>private person,</hi>
not having <hi>jus agendi,</hi> in that respect
cannot (without the <hi>Authority</hi> of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100680:53"/>
the <hi>Sovereign)</hi> do it otherwise then
<hi>unjustly;</hi> because in so doing, he doth
without leave <hi>uti jure alieno,</hi> which
is alwayes <hi>unjust.</hi> It is one thing for
a Man to <hi>use</hi> (whether well or ill) a
<hi>power</hi> that of right belongeth <hi>to him,</hi>
and another to <hi>assume</hi> a <hi>power</hi> that of
right belongeth <hi>not to him;</hi> the <hi>one</hi>
is not <hi>unjust,</hi> unless he <hi>abuse</hi> his
Power; the <hi>other is</hi> if he <hi>use</hi> it at
all.</p>
               <p>4. Neither perhaps will the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
alledged to the contrary <hi>(viz.</hi> that
a <hi>Prince</hi> in point of <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>power</hi>
is in <hi>Aliena republica</hi> but as a <hi>private
person)</hi> bear so much weight as is
laid upon it, if one Point be well
considered, which I think will prove
a <hi>truth,</hi> though it be very tenderly
handled; otherwise it may prove very
<hi>dangerous,</hi> both because it may seem
a <hi>Paradox</hi> to those that have been
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100680:53"/>
little conversant in <hi>publique Affairs;</hi>
as also, and especially, because it may,
by racking it too high, be easily <hi>wrested</hi>
to a <hi>mischievous construction,</hi> for the
Patronage of any <hi>Tyrannical action;</hi>
the point is this, that <hi>Iustitia politica;</hi>
and <hi>Iustitia privata,</hi> have not in all
the same adequate measure. <hi>Princes</hi>
are bound to be <hi>just,</hi> as well as the
<hi>meanest private men</hi> are, and obliged to
keep <hi>faith</hi> both with <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
every whit as <hi>exactly</hi> and <hi>punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
without <hi>equivocation, reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
or other <hi>eluding devices,</hi> as they;
of all this no man doubteth: but it
is not therefore necessary, that the
<hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> whereby the <hi>Councils</hi>
and <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> in
their mutual Relations are to be
measured, should be precisely <hi>the
same</hi> with those which measure the
<hi>dealings</hi> of Private men one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:100680:54"/>
5. And the reason of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is evident; private Mens <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi>
may be <hi>decided,</hi> and their
<hi>Injuries repressed</hi> or <hi>punished,</hi> by the
<hi>positive Laws</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> whereof
they are Members; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>subject</hi> to be ordered in all their
<hi>dealings</hi> by those <hi>Laws;</hi> which <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Laws</hi> (together with the <hi>Law</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Law,</hi>
which are common to all Men)
are the <hi>adequate Rule,</hi> whereby the
<hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>private persons,</hi> and of
their <hi>actions</hi> is to be measured; but
since <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any such <hi>positive Laws</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to them both, as may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
their <hi>Differences</hi> and <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies;</hi>
The great necessity of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs,</hi> hath (for the good
of Mankind in the preservation of
Peace) introduced by the <hi>common
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100680:54"/>
consent</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> another <hi>Law</hi> of
larger extent, that which we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
call <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> or the <hi>Law
of Nations</hi> (whereof that which
we also call the <hi>Law of Armes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> is
one special part) by which the <hi>Law
of Nations</hi> (together with the <hi>Law
of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Law</hi> as
aforesaid) the <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>States,</hi> and of their <hi>Actions,</hi> is as by
the proper and adequate <hi>Rule</hi> thereof
to be <hi>measured.</hi> Whence it cometh
to pass, that sundry things are by
the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Politique Iustice</hi> allowed
as <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>just</hi> between <hi>Princes,</hi>
which between <hi>private men,</hi> would
by the <hi>rules</hi> of meer <hi>moral Iustice,</hi> be
condemned (and that deservedly too)
as <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>unlawful:</hi> There are
sundry <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> some arts and
simulations for maintaining <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
abroad,</hi> for concealing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100680:55"/>
                  <hi>Councils at home,</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of <hi>Embassadors</hi> and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of <hi>Embassies,</hi> in making <hi>Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi>
and <hi>Confederacies,</hi> but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the persuance and effects of
Warr, which seem much to swerve
from the ordinary Precepts of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Iustice;</hi> which yet <hi>(fide integrâ
&amp; citra dolum malum)</hi> are by the
consent of <hi>Nations</hi> allowed to be
used, and so must be, or else there
could be no <hi>secure living</hi> in the
World in any <hi>Society;</hi> that saying of
his <hi>Atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater
&amp; aequi,</hi> had somewhat of truth and
reason in it.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reasonableness</hi> of
what hath been said will appear
(omitting many other) in these few
Instances. <hi>First,</hi> When a <hi>Town</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the <hi>Enemy,</hi> by the <hi>Law of
Nations,</hi> the <hi>spoil</hi> thereof falleth to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100680:55"/>
the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> which if he give to
the <hi>Souldiery</hi> to plunder (as usually
is done) every <hi>Souldier</hi> thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a <hi>just Right</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> in
that which he can lay his hand on
first, and take into his Possession.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> It may sometimes concern
a <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State</hi> in point of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
or <hi>Safety</hi> to <hi>vindicate</hi> himself
by <hi>Warr,</hi> for some <hi>wrong</hi> offered to
his <hi>Merchants,</hi> or for some <hi>Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
or <hi>Incivilities</hi> done to his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi>
(for even these, in case <hi>Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
be <hi>demanded,</hi> and <hi>denyed,</hi> have
been ever held <hi>just causes</hi> of <hi>Warr;</hi>
as <hi>Amphitruo</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> rendereth that
as a sufficient reason of his Warr,
<hi>Nimis ferociter legatos nostros incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant)</hi>
in this case it is by the <hi>Law
of Nations</hi> allowed him, not only to
<hi>fight</hi> against the <hi>Prince</hi> himself, who
yet only did the <hi>wrong,</hi> but to <hi>wast</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:100680:56"/>
his <hi>Country, fire</hi> his <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Villae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and <hi>spoile</hi> thousands of his <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Subjects</hi> of their <hi>fortunes</hi> and <hi>lives</hi>
in persuance of his <hi>just revenge;</hi> but
if a <hi>private Gentleman</hi> wronged by his
<hi>Neighbour</hi> should in like manner, in
<hi>revenge</hi> of that <hi>wrong, beat</hi> his <hi>Servants,
vex</hi> his <hi>Tenants,</hi> and seek his or their
<hi>undoing,</hi> the <hi>act</hi> were palpably most
<hi>unchristian</hi> and <hi>unjust. Thirdly,</hi> Since
<hi>potent Princes,</hi> have for the most part,
great <hi>Ambitions</hi> (and <hi>Ambition</hi> is a
boundless <hi>lust)</hi> it behoveth a <hi>Prince</hi>
for his <hi>own safety,</hi> to have a watchful
eye over the <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Designs</hi> of a
<hi>potent Neighbour,</hi> almost as much as
of a <hi>declared Enemy;</hi> and therefore
<hi>wise Princes</hi> have been ever carefull
by all <hi>just means</hi> to ballance their
<hi>neighbour Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> as near
as they could; in such a proportion
as might <hi>hinder</hi> the too much <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growth</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:100680:56"/>
of any one above the rest:
In order whereunto it hath been held
<hi>lawful</hi> for a <hi>Prince,</hi> laying aside the
consideration of the <hi>cause,</hi> to <hi>joyn</hi> in
<hi>Armes</hi> with the <hi>weaker,</hi> for his <hi>assistance</hi>
against his <hi>Potent Adversary,</hi> who else
were likely in a short time to <hi>swallow</hi>
him up, whereby he should become
<hi>formidable</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> as well to
<hi>himself,</hi> as to the <hi>other</hi> his <hi>neighbour
Princes</hi> and <hi>States;</hi> upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
alone, were there no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
besides, it would be as <hi>just</hi> for
all <hi>Christian Princes</hi> to compose their
<hi>own quarrels,</hi> and to <hi>aid</hi> the <hi>Venetian,</hi>
and <hi>Hungarian, Persian</hi> or <hi>Tartar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Turk,</hi> as it is <hi>expedient</hi> and
<hi>honourable</hi> for them so to do: but
what is thus allowed <hi>just</hi> in the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
of <hi>Warr</hi> between <hi>Princes;</hi> if in
a <hi>wager</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> a <hi>private person,</hi> should
attempt the like, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>assist</hi> with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100680:57"/>
his <hi>purse</hi> and <hi>pains,</hi> a <hi>Poor man</hi> against
a <hi>Rich,</hi> without considering the <hi>equity</hi>
of the <hi>cause;</hi> the <hi>act</hi> were (as in the
former Instance) palpably <hi>unjust</hi> and
<hi>unchristian:</hi> Instances might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
many more to the same effect,
were it needful: but these I think suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evidence the <hi>truth</hi> of what
I undertook to shew in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>7. There are also sundry other <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
considerable concerning the
<hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>person,</hi> which may
render the same <hi>undertaking unlawful</hi>
to <hi>one,</hi> which yet may be <hi>lawful</hi> for
<hi>another,</hi> or more or less <hi>expedient</hi> or
<hi>inexpedient</hi> for <hi>one</hi> then for <hi>another,</hi>
supposing both <hi>private persons</hi> and
<hi>Subjects;</hi> as namely, whether he be a
<hi>person</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> or a <hi>man</hi>
of <hi>ordinary rank</hi> and <hi>fortune;</hi> whether
a <hi>single man</hi> or <hi>Married?</hi> if <hi>Married;</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:100680:57"/>
whether he have the <hi>consent</hi> of his
<hi>Wife</hi> or no? and whether such <hi>consent</hi>
were a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>rational consent</hi> in the
<hi>Wife,</hi> arising from a Judgment <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi>
of the <hi>fitness</hi> of the <hi>undertaking,</hi>
or rather <hi>wrung</hi> from her by the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi>
of the <hi>Husband,</hi> and her <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility</hi>
in <hi>yielding</hi> to the <hi>potency</hi> of his
<hi>desires</hi> therein? whether the <hi>necessity</hi>
of his <hi>domestical Affairs,</hi> and <hi>Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Relations</hi> will brook his <hi>absence,</hi>
for so long a time, as must be spent
in that <hi>Imployment;</hi> or will not rather
require his <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>care,</hi> for the
<hi>menagery</hi> thereof in the mean time?
and an hundred other like <hi>doubts</hi> and
<hi>difficulties</hi> meet to be taken into <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,</hi>
and <hi>unprejudicately</hi> weighed,
against those other <hi>probabilities</hi> and
<hi>inducements,</hi> which at first <hi>kindled</hi> and
after <hi>fomented</hi> his <hi>desires,</hi> before he
<hi>imbarque</hi> himself in that <hi>Imployment:</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:100680:58"/>
and yet when all is done, it were <hi>safer</hi>
for him (in my opinion) to <hi>forbear</hi>
then to <hi>proceed</hi> in his <hi>intentions,</hi> unless
he shall be assured, that he hath the
<hi>free allowance</hi> of his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
either <hi>expressed</hi> (which would
be the clearest <hi>warrant</hi> for his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science)</hi>
or at leastwise upon very

            <head>The CASE of
SCANDAL.</head>
            <p>1. IN judging of <hi>Cases of Scandal,</hi>
we are not so much to look at
the <hi>event</hi> what that is, or may be;
as at the <hi>cause</hi> whence it cometh;
for sometimes there is given <hi>just cause</hi>
of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and yet no <hi>Scandal</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
because it is not <hi>taken:</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Scandal</hi> is <hi>taken,</hi> and yet no
<hi>just cause given;</hi> and sometimes there
is both <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Scandal given,</hi> and
<hi>Scandal</hi> thereat <hi>taken:</hi> but no man
is concerned in any <hi>Scandal,</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
to another, by occasion of any
thing <hi>done</hi> by him; neither is <hi>charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
with it, farther then he is <hi>guilty</hi>
of having <hi>given</hi> it: If then we <hi>give
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100680:59"/>
Scandal</hi> to others, and they <hi>take</hi> it
not, we are to bear a share in the
<hi>blame</hi> as well as <hi>they,</hi> and that a
<hi>deeper share</hi> too, <hi>(Vae homini, Wo
to the Man by whom the Offence
cometh,</hi> Matth. VIII. 7.) but if they
<hi>take Offence,</hi> when we <hi>give</hi> none,
it is a thing we cannot <hi>help,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole <hi>blame</hi> must lie upon
them; wherefore if at any time any

how far forth the <hi>danger</hi> thereof <hi>may</hi>
or <hi>may not oblige us</hi> to the <hi>doing</hi> or
<hi>not doing</hi> any thing <hi>proposed,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
will come on much the <hi>easier;</hi>
if we shall but rightly understand,
What it is to <hi>give Scandal,</hi> or how
many wayes a Man may become
<hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Scandalizing another</hi> by his
<hi>example.</hi> The wayes (as I conceive) are
but these <hi>four.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:100680:59"/>
2. The <hi>first</hi> is when a Man doth
something before another Man,
which is in it self <hi>evill, unlawfull,</hi>
and <hi>sinfull;</hi> in which <hi>Case</hi> neither
the <hi>intention</hi> of him that <hi>doth it,</hi> nor
the <hi>event,</hi> as to him that <hi>seeth it
done,</hi> is of any <hi>consideration;</hi> for
it mattereth not whether the <hi>doer</hi>
had an <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> the <hi>other</hi>
into <hi>sin</hi> thereby or not: neither
doth it matter, whether the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
were thereby <hi>induced</hi> to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
sin</hi> or not: the <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of the <hi>action</hi> being <hi>evill</hi> and
<hi>done</hi> before <hi>others,</hi> is sufficient to
render the <hi>doer guilty</hi> of having <hi>given
Scandal,</hi> though he had neither any
<hi>intention</hi> himself so to do; nor were
any other person <hi>actually Scandalized</hi>
thereby; because whatsoever is in it
self, and in its own nature <hi>evill,</hi> is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100680:60"/>
also of it self and in its own nature
<hi>Scandalous,</hi> and of <hi>evill example.</hi> Thus
did <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> the Sons of
<hi>Eli,</hi> give <hi>Scandal</hi> by their <hi>wretched
prophaness</hi> and <hi>greediness</hi> about the
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and their <hi>vile</hi>
and <hi>shameless</hi> abusing the <hi>Women,
1 Sam. II.</hi> 17, 22. And so did <hi>David</hi>
also give great <hi>Scandal</hi> in the <hi>matter</hi>
of <hi>Uriah, 2 Sam. xii.</hi> 14. Here the <hi>Rule</hi>
is, <hi>Do nothing that is evill, for fear of
giving Scandal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>second way</hi> is, when a Man
doth something before another, with
a <hi>direct intention</hi> and <hi>formal purpose</hi>
of <hi>drawing</hi> him thereby to <hi>commit
sin;</hi> in which <hi>Case,</hi> neither the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the <hi>action,</hi> nor the <hi>event</hi> is of
any <hi>consideration;</hi> for it maketh no
<hi>difference</hi> (as to the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>giving
Scandal)</hi> whether any Man be <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100680:60"/>
enticed</hi> thereby to <hi>commit sin,</hi>
or not; neither doth it make any
<hi>difference,</hi> whether the thing <hi>done</hi>
were in it self <hi>unlawful</hi> or not, so as
it had but an <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>evill;</hi>
and from thence an <hi>aptitude</hi> to <hi>draw</hi>
another to do that (by <hi>imitation)</hi>
which should be <hi>really</hi> and <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secally
evill,</hi> the <hi>wicked intention</hi> alone
(whatsoever the <hi>effect</hi> should be, or
<hi>means</hi> soever should be <hi>used</hi> to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi>
it) sufficeth to induce the <hi>guilt</hi>
of <hi>giving Scandal</hi> upon the <hi>doer:</hi>
This was <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s sin, in setting
up the <hi>Calves</hi> with a <hi>formal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
and <hi>intention</hi> thereby (for his
own <hi>secular</hi> and <hi>ambitious</hi> ends) to
<hi>corrupt</hi> the <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and
to draw the <hi>people</hi> to an <hi>Idolatrous
worship,</hi> for which cause he is so
often <hi>stigmatized</hi> with it; as with
a note of <hi>Infamy,</hi> to stick by him
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100680:61"/>
whilest the <hi>world lasteth,</hi> being scarce
ever mentioned but with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>Ierohoam the son of Nebat
that made Israel to sin.</hi> Here the <hi>Rule</hi>
is, <hi>Do nothing (good or evil) with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to give Scandal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>third way</hi> is, when a
Man doth something before another,
which in it self is not <hi>evil,</hi> but <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi>
and so according to the <hi>Rule</hi>
of <hi>Christian Liberty, lawful</hi> for him
to <hi>do,</hi> or not to <hi>do,</hi> as he shall see
<hi>cause</hi> (yea, and perhaps otherwise
<hi>commodious</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> for him to
<hi>do)</hi> yet whereat he probably <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth</hi>
the other will <hi>take Scandal,</hi>
and be occasioned thereby to do
<hi>evil.</hi> In such Case if the thing to be
done, be not in some degree (at
least prudentially) <hi>necessary</hi> for him
to <hi>do;</hi> but that he might, without
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100680:61"/>
               <hi>great inconvenience</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> to
<hi>himself,</hi> and any <hi>third person,</hi> leave
it <hi>undone,</hi> he is bound in <hi>Charity</hi>
and <hi>Compassion</hi> to his <hi>Brothers Soul,</hi>
(for whom Christ dyed) and for the
avoiding of <hi>Scandal</hi> to <hi>abridge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the <hi>exercise</hi> of his <hi>Christian
Liberty</hi> for that time so farr, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suffer some <hi>inconvenience</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by the not <hi>doing</hi> of it, then by
<hi>doing</hi> of it to cause his <hi>Brother</hi> to
<hi>offend;</hi> the very Case which is so
often, and so largely, and so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
insisted upon by St. <hi>Paul,
Romans</hi> xiv. 13,—21. &amp; xv. 1,—3.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 7,—13. &amp; ix. 12, 22. &amp;
x. 23,—33. Here the <hi>Rule</hi> is, <hi>Do</hi>
nothing that may be reasonably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
whereat it is like Scandal will
be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100680:62"/>
5. The <hi>Last way</hi> is, when a
Man doth something before another,
which is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the exegencies of present
circumstances <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc)</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>behoofeful,</hi> and in some sort (pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially)
<hi>necessary</hi> for him to do;
but foreseeth in the <hi>beholder</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
to make an <hi>ill use</hi> of it, and
to take encouragement thereby to
<hi>commit sin;</hi> if there be not withall
a great care had to <hi>prevent,</hi> as much
as is possible, the <hi>Scandal</hi> that might
be <hi>taken</hi> thereat: for <hi>Qui non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet
peccare, cum potest jubet.</hi> In
such case the bare <hi>neglect</hi> of his
<hi>Brother,</hi> and not using his utmost
endeavour to prevent the <hi>evil</hi> that
might ensue, maketh him <hi>guilty;</hi>
upon which Consideration stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>equity</hi> of the <hi>Iudicial Law</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100680:62"/>
given to the <hi>Iews,</hi> Exod xxi. 33,
34. which ordereth that in case a
Man dig a <hi>Pit</hi> or <hi>Well</hi> for the use,
of his <hi>Family,</hi> and (looking no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then his own Conveniency)
put no <hi>cover</hi> on it, but leave it <hi>open,</hi>
whereby it happeneth his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Beast to <hi>fall</hi> therein and <hi>perish,</hi>
the <hi>owner</hi> of the <hi>Pit</hi> is to make it
<hi>good,</hi> in as much as he was the
<hi>occasioner</hi> of that <hi>loss</hi> unto his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which he might and ought
to have <hi>prevented:</hi> In this last Case
the thing is not (for the danger of
the <hi>Scandal)</hi> to be <hi>left undone,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it (as we now do) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>behoofeful</hi> to be done; but
the <hi>action</hi> is to be ordered, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by us, for the manner of
<hi>doing,</hi> and in all Respects and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
thereunto belonging,
with so much <hi>clearness, tenderness,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:100680:63"/>
and <hi>moderation,</hi> and <hi>wisdome,</hi> that so
many as are willing to take notice
of it, may be <hi>satisfied</hi> that there
was on our part a reason of <hi>just ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
that the thing should be done;
and that such persons as would be
willing to make <hi>use</hi> of our <hi>example,</hi>
without the like <hi>necessity,</hi> may do
it upon their own <hi>score,</hi> and not
be able to <hi>vouch</hi> our <hi>practice</hi> for
their <hi>excuse;</hi> even as the <hi>Iew</hi> that
stood in need to <hi>sink</hi> a <hi>pit</hi> for the
service of his House and Grounds,
was-not (for fear his Neighbours
Beasts should fall into it and be
Drowned) bound by the <hi>Law,</hi> to
forbear the <hi>making</hi> of it, but only
to provide a sufficient <hi>Cover</hi> for
it, when he had made it. Here
the <hi>Rule</hi> is, <hi>Order the doing of
that, which may not well be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
in such sort, that no Scandal
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100680:63"/>
may, through your default, be taken
thereat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. I do not readily remember
any <hi>doubt</hi> that can occurr about the
reason of <hi>Scandal,</hi> which may not be
brought within the compass of these
<hi>four Rules;</hi> and then the right apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some or other of these <hi>Rules,</hi> will
give some furtherance towards the
<hi>resolution</hi> of these <hi>doubts.</hi>

            <head>As to the Case proposed.</head>
            <p>1. I am clearly of opinion, that the
taking of <hi>Bonds</hi> in the <hi>Kings
Name,</hi> to the <hi>meer behoof,</hi> and for
the <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>private persons,</hi> when
there was such <hi>Debt</hi> really due to
the <hi>King,</hi> was a <hi>fraudulent</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
act</hi> from the beginning; for
though it were not <hi>actually forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and so might perhaps be <hi>valid</hi>
enough in <hi>foro externo,</hi> till the issuing
out of the Kings <hi>Proclamation</hi> in that
behalf; yet was it in <hi>point</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
unlawful before, as being a
<hi>crafty course:</hi> so <hi>refused</hi> by the King
himself, and <hi>guilty</hi> of a <hi>double injustice,</hi>
the <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> as an <hi>abuse</hi> to his
<hi>Prerogative;</hi> the <hi>other</hi> to the <hi>Subject,</hi>
as tending to their <hi>appression,</hi> as by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100680:66"/>
the <hi>Proclamation</hi> is recited, and that
therefore</p>
            <p>2. Neither might the <hi>Merchant,</hi>
whiles he <hi>lived,</hi> nor ought his <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,</hi>
now he is <hi>dead,</hi> to make <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
of the <hi>Kings Name</hi> used in
that <hi>Bond;</hi> nor might <hi>be</hi> then, nor
may <hi>they</hi> now, by virtue of the Kings
<hi>Prerogative,</hi> or under the <hi>colour</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for the <hi>recovery</hi> of the said <hi>Debt,</hi>
use any way to the <hi>prejudice</hi> or <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>
of the <hi>Obligee,</hi> or of any <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser</hi>
from him, other then such, as
he or they might have used, in
case the <hi>Bond</hi> had been taken in the
<hi>Obligee's</hi> own Name, and not in the
Kings.</p>
            <p>3. If any <hi>Proceedings</hi> have been
made already, in pursuit of the <hi>Debt,</hi>
due upon the said <hi>Bond,</hi> upon no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100680:66"/>
other ground or colour, then the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi>
aforesaid, whereby the said
<hi>A. B.</hi> cometh to be <hi>endammaged</hi> or
<hi>prejudiced</hi> more, then otherwise he
should have been; that the <hi>Executors</hi>
ought to make him some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>satisfaction</hi> for the same, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
perhaps not to the <hi>full</hi> of what
he hath <hi>suffered,</hi> or would <hi>demand;</hi>
yet in such a <hi>proportion,</hi> as to the
judgment of <hi>indifferent persons</hi> (in a
case wherein <hi>both parties,</hi> if they must
do what is <hi>fitting</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> are sure to

themselves.</p>
            <p>4. Whereof although, through the
<hi>corrupt partiality,</hi> that is in most, I
may truly say, all men <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi>
I do not apprehend any great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
(for neither part <hi>would,</hi> and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100680:67"/>
yet both <hi>must</hi> be <hi>losers)</hi> yet I should
advise that <hi>tryal</hi> were made thereof
in the <hi>first place;</hi> as the most kindly
<hi>Christian way</hi> of growing to <hi>peace,</hi>
if <hi>parties</hi> will be perswaded to <hi>meet</hi>
about it, and can be made <hi>Masters</hi>
of their own <hi>passions</hi> when they are
<hi>met;</hi> and surely <hi>matters</hi> might easily
be brought to a <hi>handsom conclusion,</hi>
if both <hi>parties,</hi> but especially the
<hi>Executors,</hi> who seem to have the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
in <hi>Law,</hi> would not stand too
much upon whatsoever <hi>advantage</hi>
they may <hi>seem</hi> to have, but (as in
<hi>conscience</hi> they ought) submit both
<hi>that,</hi> and all other <hi>circumstances</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the <hi>business,</hi> and indeed
their <hi>whole mutual demands,</hi> to the
final determination of that <hi>transcendent

            <p>5. But <hi>lastly,</hi> in case no such <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
can be made (either by <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
