            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

perſuading and provoking people to pray for Kings and all in Authority under him, that we may live under them a peaceable and quiet life in all Godlineſs and honeſty: So that I bleſs the living God, I have no regret in my Conſcience, for having firſt or laſt driven in a way of Preaching or Praying any, either Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or Diſloyal deſigns; nor am I Conſcious to my ſelf, that any thing hath been performed by me to the imbaſſing of the Spirits of his Majeſties Subjects or debauching them, or drawing them from their Duty and Allegience, knowing how my Commiſſion runs, and what of the Counſel of the moſt high God is held forth in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 17.

When I had preached over the whole Chapter to that Verſe, and had ingaged to the verſe and preached one Sermon upon it, and had a more numerous multitude of Auditors, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and others then ordinary, upon the account of the Argument, which the Text led me unto: After I had preached that Sermon, which was at ſeven of the clock in the morning of the Lords-Day, according to my ordinary courſe that very day there was ſome diſturbance in the City, and it is known what was performed by them, and what after proceeding there was on the part of the Powers then in being; ingaged I then was to the proſecution of the Text the next Lords day: it was apprehended that it was no way ſafe for me to proceed in the diſcourſe, but that it was my wiſeſt courſe, either wholy to wave it, or at leaſt to intermitt the proſecution of it for a time. I diſputed the matter within my ſelf, commended my cauſe to God in a way of Prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I judged thus; that if I ſhould baulke my Text which I had handled in part, and was falln

upon in courſe, having preached upon the whole foregoing part of the Chapter; I ſhould do great diſſervice to my Lord and Maſter, and caſt the whole Congregation under diſappointment, which would expect to hear what I had further to ſay upon the point, and it would turn to my prejudice ſo to do. I brake, by the help of grace, the force of the temptation, proceeded in my courſe, gave ſome tollerable ſatisfaction to my Auditors, had ſome good approbation of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and all was well, very well, I had peace, the people profit; but this by way of digreſſion.</p>
            <p>For the apprehenſion and opinion concerning a more glorious State of the Church here on earth, I own it and conceive, that the Scriptures alleadged with multitudes more, give abundant ground for it: For the opinion concerning the Thouſand Years, and the perſonal reign of Chriſt, I know it hath great patronage from lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly men: Others are of a different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and judg it to be more proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the fore alleadged Scriptures of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eſtate in the world to come, In the heaven of glory I mean. Whatever the difference between them be, and however the interpretation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, I wiſh there may be no litigant ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned and godly concerning it, knowing that it is <hi>Melius dubitare de occultis quàm li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigare de incertis,</hi> as was the ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, and whatever our expectations be, whether of a more glorious eſtate here on earth, or of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eſtate of glory in heaven, let you and me ſet

of, and preparation for; But though this preſent day be not (the day of Judgment,) yet it is a day of Judgment? and many Preludiums there are both in Scripture and in the courſe of Providence which we may look upon, as antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of that Great and Terrible day. We have ſomthing ſignified to ſuch a purpoſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 3, 4, 5. <hi>verſes. Our God ſhall come, and ſhall not keep ſilence: a fire ſhall devoure before him, and it ſhall be very tempeſtious round about him. He ſhall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judg his people. Gather my Saints together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: thoſe that have made a Covenant with me, by Sacrifice.</hi> Where the Lord calls upon the ſons of men from one end of the earth to the other, and makes a general citation of them to gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, he himſelf being upon a ſolemn appearance with devouring fire.

            <p>We have theſe latter years had an account of many terrible Apparitions and Prodigies, and other ſtupendious acts of providence which have cauſed much amazment and amuzment for the

There is Miſtery Chriſt, Miſtery Goſpel, Miſtery <hi>Zion,</hi> Miſtery Godlineſs, Miſtery Sin, Miſtery <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo is th Miſtery Providence; that God that hath his way in the Sanctuary, hath his way in the Sea, and his paths in the great Deeps, and his footſteps are not known, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77. the ſcriptures have their <gap reason="foreign">

It was, <hi>dolor in Oculis,</hi> in the ſtudy of which, his eyes were made to water his head and heart to ake again.</p>
            <p>And perceiving how apt he was to run upon dangerous miſtakes, he calls himſelf a <hi>Behemoth,</hi> a foul beaſt and acknowledging his Ignorance and folly, recovers himſelf and ſees it to be his beſt courſe to draw neer to God, and ſo he did, and found the benefit and comfort of it to his dying day. The ſword of Warr hath lately been drawn and hath done great Execution, much Proteſtant blood hath been ſhed, when it will be quiet and fall a ſleep again, after its awakening who can tell? The terrible ſword of Peſtilence is alſo now awakened, and it is acting its part according to the Commiſſion granted unto it; how high this may riſe, how farr it may reach, how long it may continue, and what may ſucceed and come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, who can tell? Theſe things are laid up in

ſtore with God and ſealed among his Treaſures to whom Vengance and Recompences belong, who will make the feet of his Enemies ſlide in due time, for the day of their Calamity is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſte, <hi>t.</hi> 32. <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35. As touching the Peſtilential Contagion now amongſt us, it hath a very formidable aſpect, and begins to open its mouth wide and to devoure on every ſide; many are poſſeſſed with fear and trembling, to think what will become of them, and are ready to cry out with <hi>Balaam, Wo and alas, who ſhall live when God doth this?</hi> and well may ſinners in <hi>Zion</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid and fearfullneſs ſurprize the hypocrite in heart, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 33. And ſuch as are of guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences as not being able to dwell with devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire and with everlaſting burnings. Its a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming thing for ſuch to let fall their ſpirits, to come down from their grandeur, to turn in upon their own hearts and humble themſelves under the mighty hand of God, who though fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be not in him, yet if any will ſet himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he will be ſure to finde that God is more then his match, and will be as a devouring flame to a buſh of dry thorns and ſtubble, and will in a moment burn them up; Its their wiſeſt courſe to make peace with God and take hold of his ſtrength, and they ſhall make peace with him as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 27. 4, 5. Its not for any to turn Quiritants and Plaintiffs againſt God, who is ſufficiently able to ſhew cauſe for what he doth, and give a reaſon of all his actings
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63830:21"/>
though he be not bound to do it. Nor is it fit to ſay unto him (what doeſt thou,) its proper for us all to put our mouths in the duſt; and now that his hand is lifted up to ſee it, ſubmitt to it and learn righteouſneſs by it, knowing that they that will not ſee it ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed for their envy at the people, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>And that they that will not fear with a fear of duty, ſhall fear with a fear of puniſhment in a judicial way, and if men will deal proudly againſt God, he will be found to be above them, yea in the very things wherein they do deal proudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Its holy Counſel and never more proper for men to take then at this day, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> gives us in the 3. of his <hi>Lamentations</hi> 40, &amp;c. Wherefore doth the living man complain; a man for the puniſhment of his ſin every word hath its weight, and is emphatically argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; Its man and not God, and ſhall man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt God, its a living man and that ſpeaks Gods patience and forbearance; he might have ſtruck him dead and ſent him to hell, but he lives, and is it fitting that he ſhould complain, and not rather magnifie Gods patience and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſay its of the Lords mercies that we are not utterly conſumed. Its a man for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſin, that which he ſuffers under and complains of, is of his own procuring, he eats the bread of his own bakeing, drinks the drink of his own brewing, reaps the harveſt of his own ſeed; nay, nay, it is not for the living man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but as the counſel is there given to ſearch

and try his ways and turn to the Lord his God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be humbly inquiring into the Reaſon, into the very Reaſon why God is fallen out with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> that have been good friends ſo long? Why he hath taken his Rod into his hand and gives us ſuch heavy blows, that he fetches blood from us and ſtrikes us dead? And indeed let this be our buſineſs at this day, to know and find out the Proper Reaſon of this preſent Plague. To find out the cauſes of a Diſeaſe we count hath a great tendency to the Cure, but who and where is the wiſe man that may underſtand this? and who is it to whom the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken, that he may declare it for what the Land is Plagued and in a way to periſh, and to become as a wilderneſs that none paſſeth through, they are <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>If ſuch a courſe be not taken and vigerouſly proſecuted without partiality, and an ingenuous acknowledgment made, that to all other our ſins we have added theſe or theſe till we find out the <hi>Jonah</hi> that makes the ſeas tempeſtuous, the <hi>Achan</hi> that troubles the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of our Preachers have been performing ſomthing to ſuch a purpoſe, improving the Scriptures, and giving account from them what particular ſins have formerly provoked God to ſend the Plague upon a people, this is ſomthing to the purpoſe: But what if there be ſome or other abomination committed in the Land, which lyes heavy on it, and the cry of it is heard in the eares of the Lord of Hoſtes, that till it be found ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

We have ſomwhat of Juſtification hereof at this day, among our ſelves the ſword of Peſtilence (as I ſaid before,) is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and the terrible God is cauſing his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to manifeſt it ſelf: the great men of the earth do reckon it to their honour to appear very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and dreadfull, and to raiſe up and cauſe their terrour to be known in their Dominions, and to thoſe that are under their Government. We finde in <hi>Ezekiel chap.</hi> 32.

God can carry and act as men do, excepting their ſinfull actings; as in the 18. <hi>Pſalm, With the mercifull thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf mercifull, with the upright thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf upright, with the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure, with the meek thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf meek, with the humble thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf humble; But with the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward, and with the terrible thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf terrible.</hi> The Lord carries at this day as if he had ſeen and heard ſomthing; I referr to that expreſſion in <hi>Zechariah chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 8. when the Lord ſpeaks by the Prophet thus, <hi>I will encamp about my houſe, &amp;c. for now have I ſeen with mine eyes.</hi> Surely God hath ſeen ſomwhat that is not very gratefull to him, for it is now more then the burthen of the word of the Lord; no, Its the burden of the wrath and judgment of the Lord, not in the denunciation of it, but in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: I have ſignified in part already, what is the proper work for us all in ſuch a day, and I am now turnd upon the ſame point again; And what if it be as of old, according to what the Prophet <hi>Eſaiah</hi> ſpeaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

offended, and as for others be they who they will that are curious, captious, and critical, if any ſuch ſhould come to the view hereof. If they be not pleaſed I paſſe not nor ſhall I be diſpleaſed; I am at a point, I'le trouble them as little as I can, and it may be never more in this kind: If you and the reſt to whom this is intended, accept and reap any benefit by what I have performed for your ſake in a paraenetical and perſwaſory way, it is enough for me, I have my ayme. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work beſides other is to pray, but for what? That God would remove his heavy ſtroake, true; but with all, that he would ſanctifie it, and do us much good by it, knowing that Covenant afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Judgments ſanctified, are better much better then common mercies: Pray that God would purge away our Droſſe, and take away our Tinn, what there is of droſſe in point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Diſcipline and Worſhip, and Morals; and in our own hearts, that he would purge all this away: Pray that the Plaiſter may lye on till in ſome meaſure it hath eaten out proud excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Fruit of Judgments is better then freedom from them. There are it ſeems ſome hopes at the preſent, while I am Writing, that the ſtrength of the ſtorm is over; that there will be a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement this week, and ſo for the future: And its ſaid, that our buſie Aſtrologers, who I wiſh do not make too bold with God encourage this hope. I would ſay as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks concerning the veſſels of the Temple, when <hi>Hananiah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Azur</hi> the Prophet which was in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> ſpake
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63830:33"/>
unto him in the houſe of the Lord, in the preſence of all 'the people ſaying; <hi>I have broken the yoak of the King of</hi> Babylon, <hi>and in two fall years will I bring again to this place all the veſſels of the Lords houſe that</hi> Nebuchadnezar <hi>King of</hi> Babylon <hi>took away from this place, and carried them to</hi> Babylon &amp;c. <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hananiah</hi> in the preſence of the Prieſts and in the preſence of all the people, even the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Amen, the Lord do ſo, the Lord perform the word which thou haſt propheſied, Jer.</hi> 27. So would I ſay upon ſuch ſuggeſtions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an abatement &amp; Ceſſation of the judgment upon us, even ſo Amen, the Lord perform this word. But ſee well to it, how, and upon what termes we and the Plague part, it may prove <hi>max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ima Dei ira</hi> the greateſt wrath of God, for God not to be angry, that is, not to make manifeſt his anger.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63830:33"/>
ſtroak under which we lye. There is a monthly Faſt appointed by His Majeſties Authority, and it is well that ſuch a courſe is taken, in order to the removal of the Judgment which is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us. Faſting and Praying is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expedient for ſuch a purpoſe of Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, and therefore it ſhould be of mans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Gods; but let us take heed that our faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be ſuch as God requires, not a faſting for Strife and Debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs. Is it ſuch a Faſt ſaith the Lord, <hi>that I have choſen a day for a man to afflict his ſoul, is it to bow down his head as a Bulruſh, wilt thou call this a faſt, an acceptable day to the Lord.</hi> Let there be a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves in a due poſture and know that it well becomes us to appear before God, with earth upon our heads, with ropes about our necks, with ſackcloath upon our Loyns, and ſo to lie in the duſt before him. And for the publick Preachers in whoſe hands is the management of the work, I would beſeech them to look to two or three things; Firſt, that they would cry aloud and not ſpare; that they would lift up their Voices like Trumpets and ſhew the 'Inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> their tranſgreſſions, and wherein they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; that they would drive impartially, ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none; that they would lift up a Standard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Athieſme which threatneth to invade the Nation as a Flood; That they would not give ſtones inſtead of bread; that they would not fall upon that falacie in Logick, to put <hi>Non cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam pro cauſa,</hi> touching the Peſtilence; That
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63830:34"/>
they would not be like the Prophets of Old, who ſaw vaine and fooliſh things for the people, not diſcovering their Iniquity to turn away their Captivity, but ſeeking for them falſe burthens, and cauſes of Baniſhment and of Deſtruction and of deſolation as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 14. But that they would make it their main deſign to promote the power of Godlineſs and a real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, according to the word of God and example of the beſt reformed Churches, and that Primitive Diſcipline, which as the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> expreſſes, it were much to be wiſhed that it were Reſtored, might come in Power. The Long Parliament were driving ſomething to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but could not bring about their deſign. Oh that now Magiſtrates and Miniſters would unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſet themſelves, to ſee if they can perform better then they did, So as that the people of the Nation may be brought to worſhip God <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nohu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero,</hi> with one ſhoulder, then ſhall we not need to be forced by Acts of Parliament <hi>to come to Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Thoſe whom they call Phanaticks, will then flee as Doves to their windows, flock as ſheep to their foulds, come by ſhoals (that to be ſure) you will not be able to keep them out. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that the great God calls upon all men every where to Repent;</hi> Oh that that might be our work, and that we might ſecond our Humiliation with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reformation, that we may put away the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of our hearts and hands, that we may ſpit out the ſweet morſels which we have rowl'd ſo long under our tongue, and held ſo faſt between
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63830:34"/>
our teeth, that we would each of us ſtudy our own iniquity and quit it; and let the Preachers themſelves look to it, that they be lively exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof, then may we Faſt and Pray with hope and confidence, that God will hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and appeare for our help. And would not thoſe who are lookt upon as Fanaticks, would not they comply with others in this cauſe. There are of them that though they have not felt the Laſhing of the Scorpions, have not had the ſower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt looks, the ſevereſt frowns, and ſharpeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, yet have had none of the friendlieſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; yet even thoſe are free in their ſpirits to comply with the Cauſe of Humiliation; and I hope that the people of the Nation will not think that they have wiſhed evil to them, or deſired the woful day. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was forbidden to pray for the people of his time, and he was ſomtimes in deep and dreadfull imprecations againſt them, whether out of paſſion and perturbation of ſpirit by means of deep provocations from them, or prompeed thereunto by divine inſtinct, I diſpute not, but theſe can &amp; do deprecate with others the preſent Judgments; and can ſay with <hi>Samuel,</hi> God forbid that we ſhould ſin in ceaſing to pray for you. We are and count it our duty to be deeply ſenſible as of Gods diſhonour, ſo of the Nations preſent Calamity and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>We are fellow Country-men, we are fellow Subjects, in the Nations Peace, we have had Peace; but may we not queſtion, whether other of our brethren deſire or care for our Prayers, but

               <hi>hope to do the work themſelves without our help; even ſo ſay we,</hi> So there be but found a <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtand in the Gap, an <hi>Aaron</hi> with his Cenſer in his hand to ſtand between the living and the dead it matters not, ſo there be a man to turn away the wrath of God, let him be who he will we will rejoyce.</p>
            <p>My dear Friends I purpoſed a ſhorter come off then thus, not to draw out a Line to this length, but ſo it proves and I make proof of your patience; and if your patience be not quite ſpent, I will add ſome few words more, and we will cloſe up all. I told you before of the Earl of <hi>Marleboroughs</hi> letter, I have yet further to ſignifie to you, that I lately met with another paper bearing Mr. <hi>Richard Baxters</hi> name, a large ſheet woven by him not to be a winding ſheet for mens bodyes, but rather a ſpiritual winding ſheet for their ſouls, to wind them into God and into heaven, if you will you may reckon it to be a Penitential ſheet, woven and wrought to winde poor ſouls into Faith and Repentance, and ſo to Glory: Since that ſheet I have met with other papers of his, which referr partly to the Godly, partly to the wicked, to one and other principally, with reſpect unto this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Peſtilence; in all which he expreſſes much of the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh: Good man of a Piouſly publick ſpirit, wiſhing well to all, hurt to none if he could help it, would have none to Periſh but all to come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſo to Glory, having it ſeems a ſtrong confidence (as well he may) be the numbers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great, of Perſons that get the Poſſeſſion of

the Kingdome before himſelf, he ſhall not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in the leaſt, as to his own intereſt therein; and I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe thus much to you, that thoſe ſweet and ſavory Papers of his, which like ſo many Boxes of Precious Ointment broken open, have filled the City and Country with ſuch an Odoriferous and Fragrant ſmell, as hath much refreſht the noſtrills of many, gave me the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to appear in this way, and with him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the ſame deſign of promoting ſome bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, refreſhment, and comfort, eſpecially to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Viſited with the Peſtilence; yet withal hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eye to others that they might be prepared for it, and corroborated againſt the fears of it, rolling themſelves upon God in the way of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confidence; and this is that which with your patience I would apply my ſelf unto: Firſt of all, I would perſwade you, and all my Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Friends, not to be over-fearful of the Plague; it is good to have an awe upon our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and a trembling frame of heart in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Father, when the Rod is in his hand, and he exerciſing his ſeverity upon thoſe that are in his great Family; but be not too much of a diſpondent ſpirit, as too many are who fear and fly: I ſhall not now diſpute the caſe concerning removing into the Country, how farr it may be lawfull, how farr not; who may be allowed to provide for their ſafety that way who not; others have performed that, and for my part I have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and friendly thoughts concerning ſuch as do, onely I would have them to conſider, that

there is no flying from God; ſo <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or whether ſhall I fly from thy preſence; if I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, behòld thou art there; if I take the wings of the morning, &amp; dwell in the uttermoſt parts in the Sea, even there ſhall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me; if I ſay, ſurely the darkneſs ſhall cover me: even the night ſhall be light about me.</hi> We are further to know that theſe Arrows of Peſtilence are guided by a divine hand, and are not ſent out at a venture at random as the <hi>Syrians</hi> were and <hi>Jehus,</hi> which were directed to <hi>Ahabs</hi> breſt, and <hi>Jehorams</hi> back; they are levelled in wiſdome and judgment, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Counſel of God, he ſmites whom he pleaſes, he ſpares whom he pleaſes, and both the <hi>Numerus numerans</hi> and the <hi>Numeras numeratus</hi> are with him; It is good therefore to rolle our ſelves upon God, and to truſt him with our lives, and ſouls, and all our concernments, not fearing the fear of wicked men, but ſanctifying the Lord God in our hearts, &amp; making him our fear. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plague, it is in it ſelf and in the nature of it a formidable diſeaſe, as might be manifeſted in ſundry reſpects, as I ſaid, but it is ordered by a divine hand, you may be infected with it, it may be not; if it be ſo you may recover, its not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary you ſhould dy, it proves not mortal to all; its thought by many of the learned, that King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick of that Diſeaſe, and yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and lived many years after, and we have proof of it at this very day, by means uſed; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

You have bodies, but do you not conſider that you have ſouls that are infinitely more to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued then your bodyes, the loſſe whereof, the whole world will not countervail; you live a natural life, but do not you know that there is a ſpiritual life which is infinitely better, look to live that life; you eat and drink daily for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there is a ſpiritual meat and drink provided, which your ſouls have as much need of, as your bodyes have of the Periſhing food, oh make out after that; You are carefull to cloath your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and ſhall your fouls be naked; You prize and ſtudy to keep and maintain your outward liberty, ſpiritual liberty is far better, and will you pleaſe your ſelves in ſpiritual bondage to ſin and the Devil, oh make out after this ſpiritual liberty, knowing that if the Son ſhall make you free, you ſhall be free indeed; You are carefull to maintain your bodily health, and is it good that you ſhould have ſick ſouls; let me aske you, will you love darkneſſe rather then light, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather then health, bondage rather then liberty, death rather then life, your diſeaſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

it may be mine as well as yours, ſee to it that you live before you dye, that you live the life of Grace, before you dye the death of Nature, and then it matters not when, where, how, by what Diſeaſe you dye; you ſhall not dye to dye, but dye to live again, and live to dye no more, but live in the un-interrupted Viſion and intermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fruition of him who is the King Eternal, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, Inviſible, the onely wiſe God, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the Life, the I am, the infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the All in All.

            <p>It may be ſaid firſt, That for all my time paſt, I have been quiet, and appeared little in a way of Printing; How comes it to paſſe that now I appeare?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Its true, I have appeared little, very ittle in this way; two or three things have paſſed

My Reverend Brethren can give me my price, and ſo can I of myſelf: its low by agreement on all hands; onely I have this to ſay for my ſelf, I am of a ſelf-diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit and diſpoſition; and cannot put forth my ſelf amongſt my betters, as ſome can; I think I have been a little diſadvantaged upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts but it matters not: And if I be a foole in thus expreſſing my ſelf; I ſay, as <hi>Paul, Beare with me a little in my folly:</hi> and indeed, bear with me.

And though I am farr, very farr ſhort of their Parts and Abilities, yet I may compare with them for years, being now an aged man, and why may I not be permitted to ſuggeſt ſomwhat to them in a way of Counſel and Adviſe. <hi>Job</hi> would not deſpiſe the Counſel of a Servant; If it be ſaid I plead the cauſe of meekneſſe, and earneſtly preſſe it, but diſcover a ſharp and tart Spirit, &amp;c.

And who would not be zealous, very zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when Athieſme and Prophaneſs do ſo Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly break in upon us as a Flood? When there is ſo much diſhonour done to God, ſuch indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities offered to Chriſt and his Grace, ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Malignity and deſperate Oppoſition, made and manifeſted againſt the power of Godlineſſe. Once more it may be ſaid, I appear too friendly to Fanaticks; I ſay, there are, that are ſo called,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63830:43"/>
that are not ſo indeed: I would the definition of ſuch a one, were genuinly and properly draw up and given out according to truth, and let them wear the Coat, that it beſt fits; Let me ever be a Cordial friend to ſuch as fear God, honour the King, minde real godlineſſe, and ſtudy to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the power of it, walk circumſpectly; labour to keep Faith and a good Conſcience, and their Garments of holy Profeſſion, cloſe about them, clean upon them, not being ſpotted by the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that make it their daily care, to walk with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> did, to approve themſelves to Chriſt, to keep clear of ſin, and cloſs to the ways of holineſs; making it their deſign when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall be found to ſhame and diſhonour, they may be found to praiſe and glory, in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and ſuch as theſe the world will hate, Maligne, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, and judge the ſcum off-ſcouring of men, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> and his companions were accounted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13.

Thus I ſay the World will count them, and it cannot do no otherwiſe, blinde, beſotted World as it is. But it matters not, God will love them, Chriſt will own them and honour them, their Conſciences will befriend them, and if God love, it matters not who hate; if Chriſt be for us, it matters not who be againſt us; if the Scriptures be on our ſide, it matters not who riſe up in oppoſition; if Conſcience be a friend, we need not paſſe, though the World be our enemy,
