            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, it is poſſible that you would maruel that I ſhould write this booke called the <hi>Art of ſhooting in great Ordnance</hi> for two great cauſes: the one is this, firſt for that I haue not ſeene (to moſt peoples iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) ſo great experience in theſe affayres, whereby you may thinke that I haue not knowledge ſufficient to be a teacher in theſe matters. And the ſecond cauſe is this: for that my order of teaching is contrary vnto all that haue taken vpon them to be teachers, or inſtructers in theſe matters or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires before time. Therefore for to ſhew vnto you the cauſe that hath moued me to write this rude volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, is this, for that we Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men haue not beene counted but of late daies to become good Gunners, and the principall point that hath cauſed Engliſh men to be counted good Gunners, hath been, for that they are hardie or without fear about their ordnance: but for the knowledg in it, other nations and countries haue taſted better therof, as the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, French and Spaniardes, for that Engliſh men haue had but little inſtructions but that they haue learned of the Doutchmen or Flemings in the time of King Henry the eight. And the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe that Engliſh men are thought to be good Gunners, is this: for that they are handſome about their Ordnance in ſhips, on the Sea, &amp;c. And furthermore, I doe thinke it good to ſhewe vnto you three great cauſes beſides diuers other ſmall cauſes, that the thing that hath letted or hindred Engliſh men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cunning in the ſhooting of great Ordinance, although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers prooues haue beene made at ſundrie times, and Ordnance hath beene had into the fielde, both in maiſter Bromefields time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he was Liefetena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Ordnance, &amp; at diuers times ſince, and yet thoſe prooues that haue beene made then were no proofes, but to cauſe thoſe Gunners that did ſee the experience of thoſe profes, to committe a further errour as touching the ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:9934:4"/>
in great Ordnance, and the reaſon therof is this: the firſt &amp; principal cauſe is, that they did make their proofe with a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, and ſo it ought to be, that is to ſay, the fourth parte of a Circle deuided into 90. equall partes, which ſome ſimple Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will call a Triangle, but there is no inſtrument ſo called, but onely a Quadrant: and the original of the making thereof is the fourth part of a Circle deuided into 90. equall partes, what forme ſo euer that it hath. And now the principal vſe of the quadrant, is to know what any peece will caſt at the mount of euerie De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ſo from degree vnto degree, vnto the beſt of the Rander. And the cauſe that hath made the Gunners to commit error by the mounting of the peeces by the degree of the Quadrant, hath beene this, although that it be true that ſuch a peece will caſt the ſhot ſo many ſcores at the mount of ſo many degrees, and yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they haue made proofe therof, they haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it meere falſe, &amp; yet the thing moſt true, although ſomtime the ſhot hath flien a great deale further, and ſometime much ſhorter, which cauſes were no other thing but the highnes or the lownes of the ground, for that there is ſeldome any ground that you ſhall find leuell, but it will be higher or lower then the ground that the peece ſtandeth vpon, as I doe more at large declare in the thirtenth chapter of the booke, and yet in the time of ſeruice there is no vſing of the Quadrant but in ſome caſes, and then take a great large one, for in a ſmall you may ſoone commit errour. And furthermore I doe know diuers that will haue inſtruments, and yet be vtterlie voide of the vſes of them, for it is the reaſon of the perſon in the doing of any thing, and not the inſtrumentes, for in the doing of any thing, if the perſon doth not conſider of all thinges with him and againſt him, he or they be apt to commit errour, &amp;c. The ſecond great cauſe is this, in the vſing to giue leuell with a rule ſet out in inche partes: but vnto this they cannot order it, nor giue it no Method to know what any peece wil doe at any number of inches aduantage, for the peeces doe differ in caſting, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their lengths, as I doe further ſhew in the booke. Wherefore the vſe of the inche rule according as they doe vſe it, is to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:9934:4"/>
purpoſe, but onely to ſeeke out what numbers of inches will reach the marke, and that being knowne, then to keepe the length of the marke with that peece. And the neceſſarieſt thing that this kind of giuing of leuell in the time of ſeruice (as being in a Caſtell, Forte, or Towne, or ſuch like, the Gunner hauing charge of any peece,) is to beate al thoſe markes that be apte to doe any ſeruice at, and to know how manie inches will reach any marke, &amp;c. but to become a cunning Gunner, he ſhall neuer be, although he ſhould ſhoote 100. ſhottes euerie day through a yeere, for that he neuer doth know by that meanes the diſtance of any marke, but in euerie peece he muſt make a new proofe, if that the peece be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or chaunged from that place. Wherefore I haue made a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhewing how many inches, and what part of an inch will make a degree, and ſo vnto ten degrees whereby you may make a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode to hit the length of the marke in anie peece at the firſt ſhot, as it doth appeare in the eight chapter of the booke, if ſo be that there were a true and exact table of proportion, of the caſting of the peece at the mount of euerie degree, but I haue not had ſo greate proofe but that I may bee deceiued, for I haue no other proofe but at my owne charges, and my abilitie is able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make any proofe in thoſe cauſes. The third great cauſe is this, I do know few Gunners, yea none at all in reſpect, that hath anie capacitie, to know the distance vnto anie marke aſſigned if that the marke be ſuch that they can not come vnto it directly by land, and yet there be verie true and exact wayes to know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vnto anie marke aſſigned, howſoeuer the thing is, if that it may be ſeene by Geometrie perſpectiue: and the lacke therof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gunners is the principalleſt point that doth deceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that theſe three things doe vtterly deceiue moſt men: the firſt is this, the height or lownes of the ground: the ſecond the length of the peece: and the third not knowing the diſtance vnto the marke: for their reaſon in theſe cauſes that they doe ſuppoſe, can doe nothing, that is to ſay, to finde the diſtance vnto anie marke aſſigned, by looking vpon the ground, and that neuer can ſhew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the diſtance vnto the marke but yet muſt be knowen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:9934:5"/>
by the Scale or croſſe ſtaffe, or elſe it muſt be knowen by the lines of Poſition, which is ſhewed in a booke of mine that is extant in Print, called the <hi>Treaſure for Trauelers,</hi> and alſo in a booke ſet forth by maſter <hi>Thomas Digges</hi> called <hi>Pantometria,</hi> wher in thoſe two bookes you ſhall finde meanes and waies both how to finde the true diſtance vnto the marke, and alſo how much that the marke is hier ground or lower ground, then the place that you are vpon, and alſo the length of the line Hipothenuſall, whether it bee vppe the hill or downe the hill, which is verie neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and profitable for all them that will vſe to ſhoote in great Ordnance, for to know, as all Gunners, Captaines, and Leaders of men, &amp;c. And now friendly Reader, it is poſſible that ſome people will diſlike of me, for that I haue written this booke: ſome of them for that they doe thinke that they haue better knowledge in thoſe matters then I, and other ſome perhaps may be offended, for that they would not haue the thing knowen but amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and otherſome poſſible will be offended with me that are Gunners, that are altogether without any knowledg in thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that wold not haue their ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce knowen. So by theſe meanes I am aſſured that I ſhal purchaſe a great number of enemies, as I do know that I haue alreadie cauſed ſundry people to enuie me, as ſome Sea men do miſlike of me for writing of my booke called <hi>the Regiment for the Sea,</hi> and otherſome of late are offended with me for the writing and ſetting forth of my booke called <hi>the Treaſure for Trauelers,</hi> but notwithſtanding, I doe ſee that it is needfull to be knowen vnto a number of them that be Gunners, waying and conſidering with my ſelfe what a number there bee, that will take vpon them to be Gunners, yea and that maiſter Gunners, that are not ſufficient nor capable in thoſe cauſes, but are in reſpect altogether ignorant, ſtanding vpon no other thing but their antiquitie, that they haue ſerued as Gunners ſo long time. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> doe thinke it very neceſſarie for them to haue ſome good inſtructions: but as farre as I can ſee, euerie man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth curteſie to doe the common wealth of our Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande any good therein, and as far as I can perceiue that no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:9934:5"/>
may better pleaſure the common wealth in the time of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, either by Sea or Land, then may good Gunners againſt the face of our enimies: for the Realme of England hath a great number of enimies: for as we haue ſeene by daily experience, that the Queenes progenitours aforetime were neuer long without warres, yet we haue a moſt gratious and louing Prince raigning ouer vs, which doth alw aies ſtudie for peace and tranquillitie: God graunt of his mercie that ſhe may liue long and raigne ouer vs. Amen. Yet nothwithſtanding, it is good for vs to ſtudie in the time of peace, how to defend our ſelues in the time of warres &amp; troubles, as generally we prouide in harueſt for to liue in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And for that cauſe haue I written this little treatiſe, not to the intent to teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, but to giue inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be of the ſimpleſt ſorte, &amp;c. Wherfore (Gentle Reader) beare with my rudenes, for that I am ſo bold to be the firſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man that put foorth any booke as touching theſe cauſes, and it is poſſible that there be a number would looke that I ſhoulde haue giuen them place, for that they are more worthy and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller in theſe cauſes, thinking that I am to ſimple, for they doe not conſider how that God doth giue his giftes, as we ſee daily he giueth vnto one man riches, and another man pouertie, and one man to be a ruler, and an other to be inferior, one man wiſe &amp; prudent, and an other ignorant, one man beautifull, and an other deformed, one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a tall ſtature, &amp; an other of a low ſtature, one man ſtrong and luſtie, and an other weake &amp; lame: although that they be of one conſanguinitie, linitie or kindred, ſuch is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous workes of God. Wherefore men are not to be meaſured by elles, but vy vertue, for God is not partiall in his giftes, for hee hath ſhed his moſt precious blood for the redemption of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſo that afore him all are one, for we are all his creatures and the ſheepe of his paſture, and the workes of his handes, ſo he is our God, and we are his people, ſo that we keepe his holy will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, but fleſh and blood is ſo fraile, that we can doe no good of our ſelues, for God worketh the will and deed in all his creatures, for by his holy ſpirit he doth giue ſundry gifts &amp; al for
<pb facs="tcp:9934:6"/>
the profite both of our ſoules &amp; bodies, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to one is giuen through the ſpirite the vtterance of wiſedome, to an other the vtterance of knowledge, by that ſame ſpirite to an other faith, by that ſame ſpirite to another the gifte of healing, by that ſame ſpirite to another profeſſing, to an other iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to diſcerne ſpirits, to another diuers tongues, to an other the interpretations of tongues, and al thoſe doth the ſpirite of God worke and diſtribute vnto euery man according vnto his moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will and pleaſure. Then what a vaine generation of people be we to ſtriue againſt the wil &amp; pleaſure of God, as who ſhould ſay that God is bound to be ruled by the wil and pleaſure of man. But what ſpeciall gifte ſoeuer God doth giue vnto man, let them giue him thanks therfore, and looke that they doe not abuſe the ſame gift, for if that they doe, it will be a ſnare to take them in, and ſo be an example vnto the whole world. For as ſoone as our heart is lifted vp with vanities, then entreth the Diuel, &amp; he cauſeth a man to fall and decline from God, thinking with our ſelues, that the gift that God hath giuen vnto vs commeth of our ſelues. For as ſome do think that haue riches, that they haue it by their own induſtry, and ſome doing diuers other thinges, thinke that it commeth of themſelues, with diuers other ſpeciall gifts that god giueth vnto man, therefore whenſoeuer God doth giue any ſpeciall gift to any perſon, then let him giue him thankes therfore, vſing it to the lawd, praiſe, glorie, and honor of God, &amp; to the profite of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the common wealth of his Natiue countrie, for great is the wickednes of the people vpon the face of the earth, as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this in theſe our dayes, that the Biſhop of Rome with all his adherents, doth daily practiſe how and by what meanes to bring this our noble realme of England to vtter confuſion, therfore it is very meete and neceſſarie for vs to deuiſe how to preuent them, and then there is no doubt if that we doe our good will and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but the liuing God wil deliuer vs from the hands and ſnares of ſuch wicked Antichriſtes, that do ſeeke the blood of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſeruants of God. Wherfore it is very meet for vs that be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chriſtians and true ſubiectes to our prince and Countrie, to
<pb facs="tcp:9934:6"/>
arme our ſelues firſt with faith, ſecondly with manly courage, and thirdly with armor for our back, for let vs be aſſured without Gods mightie prouidence vnto the contrarie, that as ſoone as they haue vs at any aduantage, that then let vs looke for no other matter, but that they will giue the attempt, for ſuch is the wickednes of the malicious Papiſts, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome of them are thoſe that ſhould or ought to be good ſubiects vnto their Prince and natiue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try. Wherfore I beſeech the liuing God to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found ſuch wicked Impes that ſhould ſeeke the deſtruction of their Prince, and eſpecially a vertuous, mercifull, and a godly Prince, and ſecondly the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their natiue Realme and countrie, yea euen the nurce to them and their forefathers that hath yeelded vnto them all kind of foode and neceſſaries. What greater wickednes can there be in men? and they themſelues are bound by the lawes of God and alſo by the lawes of nature, to defend their Prince and Countrie: for we nor they haue no iuſt quarell to fight by the lawes of God, but onely to defend our Prince and countrie and the liberties therof. Therefore it is meet for vs to cal vnto God for mercie and grace, and then there is no doubt but that he wil deliuer vs, &amp; turne all their wicked deuiſes vnto their own deſtruction, euen as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that make a pitte for other and fall into it themſelues. Wherefore it is meet for al them that are Noble men and Magiſtrates, &amp; ſuch as are in authoritie, to cheriſh and maintayne al thoſe that are good and vertuous ſubiectes and good members in the common wealth, and contrariwiſe, it is very neceſſary and conuenient to puniſh all wicked doers, and ſuch as doe annoy and hurt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, hauing no regard, neither for loue nor fauour, nor hatred or malice, neither for bribes nor friends, but to rewarde euery man according vnto their deſertes: for as it is ſin to ſuffer vice vnpuniſhed, ſo in like manner it is as euill to ſee Vertue not revvarded, cheriſhed nor mainteyned.</p>

            <head>¶ Conſiderations to be had in ſhooting of Ordinance.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenne principall things are to be conſidered in the ſhooting of Ordnance, to keep the length of the marke, or to make a perfit ſhotte at any marke aſſigned, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the diſtance of the marke, and knowing what ſuch a peece wil do at ſuch an aduantage in mounting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The goodneſſe or badneſſe of the pouder.</p>
            <p>THe good pouder driueth the ſhotte further than the marke, the badde pouder ſhooteth ſhort of the marke: therefore you muſt vſe diſcretion in lading of the peece, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the pouder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The lading of the peece.</p>
            <p>IF you doe giue the peece more than hir dutie, you doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſhoote the marke: if you do giue hir leſſe than hir duty, you ſhoote ſhort of the mark: you muſt therefore giue the peece hir dutie and no more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The winde, and eſpecially to be mounted at much aduantage.</p>
            <p>THe winde with you, cauſeth you to ouerſhoote y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marke, according vnto the hardneſſe. The winde againſt you, maketh you ſhoote ſhort of the marke according vnto the hardneſſe. The winde one the ſide, the peece caſteth beſide the marke: therefore you muſt weather the marke, according vnto the hardneſſe of the winde, and the diſtance vnto the marke.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of the ſhotte.</p>
            <p>THe ſhotte too bigge or too high, it putteth the peece in daunger: for you muſt driue the wodde and ſhoote home vnto the pouder in the pecce, for if the ſhotte doe reſt any thing ſhort, it will breake the peece (or elſe it is a chaunce) in the vacant place betweene the pouder and the ſhotte. The ſhotte too low or ſmall, it will be too ſhorte of the marke, &amp; alſo it will not do his execution according vnto the peece and the pouder, and it may chance to ſwarue in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9934:8"/>
out of peece, the therefore the ſhotte muſt be fitte for the peece</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of the wadde or the pouder rammed in too hard or too looſe.</p>
            <p>THe pouder rammed in too hard, and the wadde alſo, and eſpecially the pouder being badde, or els not drye, it wil be long before the peece goe off, and alſo halfe the force of the pouder will be decayed, before the ſhotte bee deliuered, for that it bloweth out of the tutchhole, and alſo the peece will tremble before ſhee goe off, &amp; that may cauſe the ſhotte to flee awrye from the marke, for that the peece is remoued from hir leuell: and alſo it will heate the peece, and make the peece daungerous to ſhoote in preſently afterwards.</p>
            <p>The pouder too looſe, and not well put vp with the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer head, and alſo the wadde too ſlacke in like manner, will make the ſhotte to come ſhort of the marke by the meanes of the looſeneſſe: you muſt therefore put vp the pouder with the rammer head ſomewhat cloſe, and the wadde to go cloſe in, and driue it home vnto the pouder, but beate it not in too hard.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Of the ſtanding of the peece.</p>
            <p>THe peece ſtanding ſo that it maye or doth recoyle vnto the lower ground, that is to ſay, that the grounde bee lower at the tayle of the peece, than it is where the wheeles ſtand, it ouerſhooteth the marke, for that in the deliuerance of the ſhotte, the breech goeth downewards, and the mouth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and the peece is apte to recoyle downe the hill: and if that the ground be higher behind the peece then it is before the peece, then it may happen to ſhoote ſhorte: but that is but a chaunce, for that is not ſo apte to recoyle agaynſt a hill, as it will do downe the hill.</p>
            <p>And if it doth happen ſo, that the one wheele dothe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyle faſter than the other wheele, then the peece will ſhoote awrye from the marke, or if any thing doe lette or ſtay the wheele, it may ſhoote awrye, for the deliuerance of the ſhotte
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9934:8"/>
cauſeth the recoyle of the peece, which is nothing elſe, but the ſuddayne thruſting or the putting out of the ayre whiche is in the mouth of the peece.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Of ſhooting towards a hill or valley with a Quadrant.</p>
            <p>IF you ſhoote towardes a hill, you ſhoote ſhorte in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing leuell with a Quadrant. If you ſhoote towardes a valley, you do ouerſhoot y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marke, as in the thirteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you ſhall ſe the reaſon therof. If vppon a leuell ground, you ſhall keepe the length of the marke by the degrees of the Quadrante, otherwiſe not.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If you giue leuell with an ynche rule, you ſhall ſhoote at no certaynetie, but in ſuch a peece as you doe knowe wel, for that it doth varie according vnto the length of the peece: as for example this, if you haue three Culuerings, the one is the ordinarie length, that is, twelue foote long: the other is more then the ordinarie length by two foote, that is, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene foote longe: and the thirde is ſhorter than the ordinarie length by two foote, that is, but tenne foote longe: nowe if you doe ſhoote at any marke, and doe knowe the diſtance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the marke, and alſo doe knowe, that a Culuering moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at ſo manye ynches vantage, wyll reach the marke, and admitte that it wyll reache the marke at twelue ynches va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nowe in the ſhorter peece, it ouerſhooteth the marke, and in the longer peece it ſhooteth ſhorte of the marke, and in that peece that hathe the ordinarie length, you ſhall keepe the length of the marke: and the cauſe thereof is this: In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peece that is but tenne foote longe, the twelue ynches van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage commeth neere vnto ſyxe degrees wyth the Quadrante in the mounting: and in the peece of twelue foote long, the twelue inches commeth not to fiue degrees in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Quadrant, and in the peece of foureteene foot long, it commeth but vnto foure degrees in the mounting with the Quadra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as in the eyght Chapter you may plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:9934:9"/>
9. It is to be conſidered what diſpart your pecce muſt haue, if you doe giue leuell with an ynche rule at any aduantage, and alſo, if you doe ſhoote at any marke within the right line or poynt plancke, as in the fourth Chapter it is ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. You muſt conſider whether the peece be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bored, as it is declared how you ſhall know it in the ſecond Chapter: and how to ſhoote with a peece that is not truely bored, you ſhall ſee by the eleuenth Chapter.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt concerning Powder, for that it is the chiefeſt matter as touching the ſhooting in Ordinance. According to ſome Authours, the firſt deuice of the making thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne in <hi>Germany,</hi> by a Monke named <hi>Bertholdus Schwartus,</hi> neere about the yeare of oure Lorde. 1380. and ſince that time it hath bine put in practiſe from time to time, and from age to age, both by the learned Mathematicians, and alſo by the beſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſianes, beſides a number of other common people, as well by them that haue bine ſeruetours, in martial affayres, as all other, ſo that of the making of the peter, and alſo of the pouder, hath bin made great proofe vnto the vttermoſt, as touching the force of pouder, ſo that it is not vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now in theſe dayes, what quantitie of euery ſeuerall ſortes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes doth make the ſtrongeſt ſortes of pouder, beſides the perfit-refining of the ſalte peter, &amp; alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thorough working of the receiptes in the making of the pouder, ſo that it is now come to paſſe in theſe dayes, that the making of the pouder, and alſo the making of the ſaltpeter, is become (in reſpect) a common thing amongſt a number of people, as it is made commonly in many partes in <hi>Germanie</hi> by the Boures or huſbandmen, and alſo by the women: wherefore it were but ſuperfluous to ſay any thinge therein, conſidering how well the making thereof is knowen vnto a number of people, and therefore the principalleſt thinge in the ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ordinance, is to knowe the goodneſſe or the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9934:10"/>
of the pouder, and that is knowen after the common order, that is, by three kinde of meanes, firſt by the taſting of the tongue, knowing by the ſharpneſſe thereof, whether that there be ſufficient of the maiſter or peter or not: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it is knowen by the coulour, for the good pouder hath ſomewhat a blewiſh coulour, and if it be Sarpentine pouder, then the pouder will be as fine as ſande, and as ſoft as floure, and that ſignifyeth, that it is well wrought, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it will be harſhe in your hande, and clammiſh, and looke with a darkiſh blacke coulour, and that ſignifyeth that it is wel wrought, and the maiſter not refyned: and the third &amp; principall is knowen by the burning, for if it be verie good pouder, then in the burning, the fire wil be gone in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye at a verie ſuddayne, &amp; wyll giue a ſnap or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne puffe, &amp; nothing remaining afterwardes, but a white moke on that place whereas it was burned: but badde pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the burning fireth not ſo quickely, but fireth as dothe a fire worke, very ſlowly, makyng ſome hiſſing, and after the burning, there wyll remaine certayne burreles or knottes that wyll conſume vnto moyſture, and be darkiſhe, and that ſygnifieth that the peter or mayſter was not well refyned, neyther the pouder well wrought: And after the burning of ſome kinde of pouder, there wyll remayne certayne whyte burrles, or knottes (as before is rehearſed) that will remaine hard, and not conſume after the burning, and that ſygni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth, that the pouder dothe lacke of the maiſter or peter. And alſo here is one principall thinge to bee noted, that when pouder is drye, then the force of it in reſpecte, is as it were double, or a quarter ſtronger, than when it is moyſte and darkiſhe, whether the pouder bee goode or badde. And alſo that pouder that is verie good and well made, yet maye happen to become moyſte, as manye times by carriage too and fro in rayny weather, and alſo by laying it in ſome moiſt places, the caſke beeyng not very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9934:10"/>
cloſe and tyght, that the pouder may growe dankiſhe.</p>
               <p>And alſo thoſe kinde of pouders that the peter or maiſter is not well refyned, but left full of ſalte, although that the pouder bee neuer ſo drye when it is layd vp, yet it will giue agayne in rayny &amp; heather, and become moyſt, how drye ſoeuer the place be that it is layde vp in. Wherefore there are a number of thinges to bee conſidered in pouder, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſhooting in great Ordinance, in a number of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: for men of reaſon maye know by the burning, coulour, taſtyng, and the handling of pouder, which is good, &amp; which is badde: but to ſay iuſtly how much the one ſorte of pouder is ſtronger or weaker than another ſorte of pouder is, that is harde to knowe, although he be the maker of the pouder, and hath wayed out perticularly the receiptes of the pouder: and the meanes thereof commeth to paſſe, as this, by the working thereof, and by the meanes of the drying thereof, and by the moiſting or giuing of it againe, and eſpecially if the pouder haue bin long made: ſo that it is a hard matter if a man haue of ſundry ſortes of pouder, to ſay iuſtly that thus much in weyghte of this ſorte of pouder, will doe as muche, that is to ſay, to bee equall in force, as ſo much in weyghte of that ſorte of pouder, vntill that it be putte in proofe in the ſhooting it in Ordinance.

And all thoſe peeces that haue three hundred weight in mettall, vnto one pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d weight of ſhot, doe require as muche Sarpentine pouder as the ſhotte wayeth, and one ninth parte more. And all thoſe peeces y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue vnder two hundred weight of mettall, and more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one hundred and a halfe, may haue as much Sarpentine pouder as the ſhot weieth, lacking one ninth part. And all thoſe peeces that haue one hundred &amp; a halfe of mettall or there about, vnto one pound weight of the ſhotte, muſt lack 2/9 partes of pouder that the ſhotte waieth. And all thoſe peeces that haue but little more than one hundred, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one hundred &amp; a halfe, muſt lacke 3/9 partes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weight of the pouder that the ſhot waieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is but ⅔ parts. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the making of Ladels for anye peece or peeces of Ordnaunce, this thing muſt be noted. Firſt, take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the ſhot for the peece y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you do make the Ladel for, and then diuide, or put the compaſſe of the ſhotte into. 5.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9934:12"/>
equall parts, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cut the plate of the Ladel in breadth of three of thoſe fiue partes, and put the other ⅖ partes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and then bende the plate for the breadth of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, according vnto the compaſſe of the ſhotte, ſo that it may goe eaſily into the mouth of the peece: for ⅗ partes is for to hold the pouder, to the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to put it into the peece, and the ⅖ parts be put away, to be open to turne the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the peece. And now furthermore, for the lenght of the plate of the ladell, heere is one thinge to be noted, that euery nine balles or ſhot being layde cloſe together, and the plate being bent, and cut off that breeadth before rehearſed, and the plate in length to be cut off, that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ynches that the nine ſhottes dothe reache, and that plate being equally filled with Sarpentine pouder, wyll holde the iuſt weyghte in pouder that the ſhotte weyeth. Therefore for the length of the plate of the Ladell, thus you muſt vſe it as followeth. For to make a Ladell for a double Canon, and the peece weying generally more or leſſe. 7000. or. 8000. and the ſhott weying within little more or leſſe. 64. pounde, that is, but little more than one hundred of mettall, vnto one pounde weyght of the ſhot, therfore this peece may lack ⅓ part of the weyght in pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the ſhot weyeth: therefore they muſt cut the plate of the Ladell but. 3. times the length of the ſhot, in ynches and partes of ynches, and this Ladel twice equally filled, ſhall be the dutie of the peece. Then for to make a Ladel for a Demy Canon, as the peece in mettall weyeth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more or leſſe. 5000 or. 5700. and the ſhotte weyeth more or leſſe. 34. pounde, whiche is about an hundred and a halfe of mettall, vnto one pounde weighte of the ſhotte, therefore you muſt cutte the plate of the Ladell three ſhots or balles and a halfe high, or. 4. ſhots or balles high. In ynches and partes of ynches, according vnto the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the peece with the mettall, and the Ladell twice
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9934:13"/>
equally filled, to be the dutie of the peece. And for to make a ladell for a double Culuering, thoſe peeces being double fortified with mettall, and the peece waying ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally more or leſſe foure thouſande, or foure thouſande eyght hundred, and the ſhotte waying more or leſſe 17. pounds, that is, about three hundred weight of mettall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one pounde weight of ſhotte. Therefore you muſt cut the plate of the ladell in length about the height of fiue ſhotte or balles, in ynches and partes: this ladell being twice equally filled, ſhall be the dutie of the peece. And in like manner the demy Culuering, and Falco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and Falc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konets, be double fortifyed with metall: therefore you muſt mak their ladell in length fiue ſhottes or balles, in ynches or partes, and that ladell twice equally filled, ſhal be the dutie of the peece. And furthermore, ſome Sakars and Minions haue but two hundred weigth of mettall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one pounde weight of the ſhotte: therefore you muſt cut the plate of the ladell in length but of foure ſhottes or balles &amp; a halfe high: and that ladell twice equally filled, ſhall be the dutie of the peece. And furthermore, now of late yeares, they haue deuiſed a more ſtronger ſorte of pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not without good cauſe why, for the baſe pouder is not ſo good, if that it ſhould come vnto ſeruice, as corne pouder, or any other pouder is, that hath receipt ynough, and well wrought: for the baſe pouder dothe heate and ſtreyne the peece more than the good pouder doth: for if it be rammed in hard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe it is not ſo quicke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it lyeth and bloweth in the breech of the peece, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can take fire, ſo by that meanes it heateth and ſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the peece, and halfe of the force of the pouder is gone, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhotte be deliuered: and then they muſt vſe bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for to ſaue the peece. Nowe whereas they ſhoote good pouder, or cornepouder, they take much leſſe pouder, and it ſendeth the ſhotte quicker awaye, and it dothe not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9934:13"/>
heate the peece ſo faſt: for this we doe ſee by common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that a little heat by long continuance, doth heat more than a great heat by little continuance. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, in the ſhooting of good pouder, they ſhall not ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo often vnto their enemies. And eſpecially, the pouder woulde be put in cartredges, for in mine opinion, it is a greate deale better, for to charge a peace in time of ſeruice with a Cartredge, than with a Ladell, for diuers conſiderations, as I doe more at large declarein the ſixth Chapter. And furthermore, for to charge a peece w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder, or any other good pouder, for the moſt parte, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of two pounde will goe as farre as three pound of Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine pouder. As for example: that double Culuering that requireth eyghtee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e pounde of Serpentine pouder, twelue pounde of reaſonable corne pouder will ſerue, according to the goodnes of the making of the pouder. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, vpon good conſiderations, for diuers cauſes, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for the Queenes Nauie, they haue deuiſed to make their Ordnaunce ſhorter than the accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo by that meanes they are lighter than the peeces before time made, and yet as ſeruiceable as the longer in ſome points, ſhooting that weight in pouder, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhotte that the heauier doth, in all poyntes as the other: for that mettall that is taken from the length of the peece, hurteth not the fortifiyng of the peece. And as for the making of the Cartredges for any peece, it is eaſie ynough to be done: for the compaſſe of the ſhotte, and the length of the Ladel, ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nowe to diſparte your peece, do this, take a ſtring, ſuch a one as will not ſtretch, then gird your peece about hir tayle or great ende, in the very biggeſt place of the peece, then meaſure the line iuſtly how many ynches the peece was in the compaſſe, and then looke howe many. 22. ynches there be in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe, take ſo many. 7. ynches for the Dyametre, highte, or thicknes of the circle, for in al circles being perfect round, as timber, ſtone, or any other mettall, looke howe many. 22. ynches there be in the circumference or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, ſo many times. 7. there is in the Diametre or height, then the height or thicknes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breech of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peece beeyng knowen, looke how many ynches and partes of an ynche it commeth vnto, then lay that vnto the mouth of the peece, and looke howe muche of that doth remayne ouer, then take halfe of that for your diſpart. But ſome doe vſe to gird them (as afore is ſaide) and do put that into three equall partes, but that is not the exacte way, although it dothe goe ſomewhat neere the matter. Some alſo wyll take a priming yron, and put it into the tutchhole, and then lay it vnto the mouth of the peece, and looke what it commeth vnto more than the meaſure, they will take that for their diſpart: but that maye deceiue them, as it is generally falſe.

laye that croſſe the tayle of the peece then take a plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of lead vpon a line or a ſtring.

For this you muſt conſider, that he that can by arte lay the hollow of the peece right againſt the marke, muſt needes hit it, ſo that it be not farther than the peece doth caſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the right line, for he that ſhall giue leuell to a peece without diſparting, ſhall ſhoote a great deale ouer the marke, bycauſe that the ſide of the peece is contrarie vnto the core or hollowneſſe of the ſame: for the mettall of the tayle of the peece, is a great deale thicker than the mouth.

and ſo take the height of the tayle of the peece, then meaſure it with your rule and looke what it is more at the tayle, than it is at the mouth, take halfe that for your diſparte, and doing (as before is ſaid) there is no tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way, ſo that your Calapar compaſſes be large ynough to reach it.

And if you ſhoote by the degrees in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, then the highneſſe or lowneſſe of the ground ſhall cauſe them to erre, as I doe ſhew in the thirteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

And although they haue named degrees in their bookes, yet it appeareth vnto me that they haue not knowledge what a degree ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, for that they haue named a Quadrant, a Triangle and other food and fooliſh by names. Wherefore they that haue written thoſe bookes that the Gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners haue amongſt them, were vtterly vnlearned in any manner of ſcience, which were in the beginning, in the time of King Henry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eight, made by Flemmings: for in the wars in thoſe daies the King ſent ouer into Flaunders, and thoſe parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, to haue Gunners to ſerue him in the warres, &amp; the Gunners haue no other bookes, but ſuch as were written
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9934:18"/>
by them: wherefore I do thinke it good to ſhew vnto you what a degree is.</p>
               <p>A degree is a parte or deuiſion of a whole circle into 360. equall parts, as the the auncient fathers aforetime haue taught, and eſpecially in Aſtronomy. And it is very profitable for Gunners to knowe the vſe of them. The Quadrant that they doe occupie, is the fourth part of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, deuided into 90. equall parts, according vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth part of the Heauens, for the zeneth or pricke in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens (ouer the Crowne of your head, downe to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon) is deuided into 90. equall partes, according vnto the Quadrant. As for example: If there were a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar line let downe out of the Heauens vnto the earth, then ſhould the earth be a right line, and make a ſquare angle vnto the furtheſt parte of the Horizon that you can ſee, and ſo paſſe vnto the Heauens, as doth the Quadrant: and then the beſt of the Rander is 45. of theſe deuiſions, called degrees (as ſome mens opinion hath been) and that is half 90. and the ſaid. 45. degrees be the beſt of the Rander in ſome caſes, and that is with the winde, but otherwiſe, it is not, as it is further declared in the 5.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Urthermore, any peece of Ordnaunce being truly diſparted, as is declared in the fourth Chapter, they may know at al times how for to ſhoote iuſt vnto the mark, eſpecially within point blank, &amp; point blanke, is the direct fleeing of the ſhot, without any deſcending from the mouth of the peece vnto the mark, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of the peece to ſtand directly with the Horizon, ſo that it be vpon a plaine and leuell ground, as far as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peece may caſt, hytting any thing that ſtandeth directly as hygh as the mouth of the peece, laying the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe or concauitie of the peece againſt the thing that you doe ſhoote at &amp;c. And to ſhoote at anye marke vppon the right line, you ſhall doe it by this meanes: your peece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truely diſparted, and the diſpart ſette vppon the mouth of the peece, bringe the middle of the tayle of the peece to the toppe of your diſparte vppon the mouth of the peece, and the marke that you doe ſhoote at, all three vppon one right line, by the ſight of one of your eyes, and then foreſeeing that the peece ſtandeth vppon a leuell grounde, and the one wheele to bee as nimble as the other, this doone, there is no doubte but you may ſhoote as neere the marke with a Cannon as with a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabus, or Caliuer. This is moſt certaine. Therefore it is very neceſſary to know how far any peece wil conuey the ſhot vpon the right line, &amp; that is ſomewhat hard to do, for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9934:19"/>
there is ſeldome any grounde, but is higher in one place than in another, and then if the peece ſhould bee layd cloſe vnto the ground, it woulde graze before that it were at the end of the right line, and then if the peece be in her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the ſhotte will not graze before that it were deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as much as the height of the carriage. And for to ſet vp any thing certaine at the end of the right line, it were too tedious, therefore in my opinion, this is one of the beſt wayes, in the finding what diſtance any peece conuayeth or driueth the ſhotte vppon the right line or any degree of the Rander, as thus: Repaire vnto a very leuell ground, as a plaine marriſh, that is iuſt water leuell, and then to finde the right line or point blanke, rayſe a butte or banke in that plaine grounde, and then ſette vppe a marke the iuſt height of the peece that lyeth in the carriage, and take a quadrant, with a rule faſt thereunto, and put the rule into the mouth of the peece, and coyne the breech of the peece vp and downe, vntill the plummet hang at the corner of the Quadrant, and then ſhall the Concauitie of the peece, lye right with the Horyzon, neyther higher nor lower: then ſhoote off the peece againſt the butte: if the ſhotte bee vnder the marke, it is more then the right line, then you muſt bringe the peece neerer vnto the butte, banke or marke: but if it be the iuſt height of the marke, then remooue the peece farther off from the marke, and ſo remoouing the peece for wardes and backwardes, you ſhal finde the true right line of the peece. By this order, you may trye the true right line of all manner of peeces of Ordnaunce. And whereas the opinion of diuers Gunners is, the one contrarie vnto the other, ſome holding an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the longer peece doth ouerſhoote the ſhorter, and ſome that the ſhorte doth ouerſhoote the longer: the troth is, that the longer peece doth ſhoote further than the ſhorter, although that in the mounting of a long
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9934:19"/>
peece and a ſhorte with an ynche rule, the ſhorte peece dothe ouerſhoote the longer, although bothe ſhoote one ſhotte, and one ſorte and weyght of pouder, as you maye perceyue in the nexte Chapter following, and alſo in the beginning of the Booke in the eyght conſideration. &amp;c. Furthermore, to knowe what anye peece of Ordnaunce wyll doe at the mounte of euery degree, and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of grounde the ſhott dothe flye, doe thys, the grounde beyng playne and leuell (as before is rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) place the peece in thys manner: you muſte make a hole in the grounde, to the intent to make a platteforme, to ſet the peece vpon, in ſuch order, that the tronchions of the peece being in hir cariage, be iuſte in heigth leuell with the grounde, neyther higher nor lower: then take your Quadrant, and the rule faſtned thereto, and put the rule into the mouth of the peece, and ſo mount the peece vnto one degree, ſhooting off the ſame, and ſeeing the firſte graſe, meaſure the diſtance of grounde, and note or marke that: then in like manner mount the peece vnto two degrees, and ſo vnto three degrees, and ſo forth from degree to degree, vntill the peece bee mounted vnto the beſt compaſſe of the Rander. Thus ſhall you know what any peece will doe at the mount of euery degree. &amp;c. But if you ſhoulde make youre proofe vppon ſuche grounde as is not leuell, then your proofe ſhoulde be erronious, for that the Quadrant ſheweth by the degree, howe muche it is higher than the Horizon, for if the ſhotte doe not finde grounde in his deſcending, equall with the heigth of the peece, the ſhotte fleeth further than it ſhoulde do. And alſo if the ground be higher than the place that the peece doth ſtand vpon, then the ſhot will be ſtayde the ſooner, by the meanes of the heigth of the ground, as I do more at large declare in the. 13. Chapter following. And for your better inſtruction of the mounting of the peece, I haue made this figure following.</p>

hange at what degree you pleaſe towardes the myddle lyne of the Quadrant <hi>E,</hi> then the mouth of the peece <hi>B</hi> and <hi>C</hi> wyll goe vpwardes. &amp;c. Nowe ſhall followe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the proofe that I haue made, but yet not to my contentation, neyther in reſpect to no purpoſe) the argumente of the proportion of the mountyng of euerye degree vnto the beſt of the Randare, according vnto the proofe that I haue made. Looke howe muche grounde the peece conueyeth the ſhotte from the ryghte lyne, vnto the mountyng of fyue degrees, that is as muche grounde as the ryghte lyne, and two nynth parts more, and from the mountyng of fyue degrees vnto tenne degrees the ſhotte is conueyed as muche grounde as the ryghte lyne, and 1/9 parte more, and from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of tenne degrees vnto fifteene degrees, the ſhotte is conueyed as muche grounde as the ryghte lyne iuſte. And from the mounting of fifteene degrees vnto the mountyng of twentye degrees, the ſhotte is conueyed halfe as muche grounde as the ryghte lyne iuſt: and from the mountyng of anye peece from twentye degrees vnto the beſt of the Randare, the ſhotte is conueyed in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute ⅔ partes of the ryghte lyne, and that is in a faire calme daye, and then two and fortie degrees is the beſte of the Randare, and wyth the wynde fyue and forty is the beſt of the Randare, and agaynſte the wynde, as the wynde is in bigneſſe, that is, one and fortye, or fortye, or nyne and thirty, or eyght and thirtie, or ſeauen and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, or ſyxe and thirtye degrees, the wynde beeyng alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther the ruler therof. Therfore it is but a folly to make accoumpte thereof, neyther is there any ſeruice aboue the mountyng of any peece of Ordnaunce, aboue. 20. degrees, excepte it be a morter peece, and the ſhotte is conueyed off grounde from the mouthe of the peece vnto the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng or fallyng of the ſhotte, to the beſte compaſſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9934:21"/>
of the Rander, aboute fiue times and a halfe as muche grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as the right line, being (as before is declared) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little vnder or ouer, according as the winde bloweth more or leſſe, againſt the winde, or with the winde, and ſo forth. But here is one principall thinge to be conſidered, and that is this, that you do alwayes charge the peece w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iuſt one weighte, and one ſorte and kinde of pouder, for otherwayes, in the doyinge thereof, you may committe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure, as before is declared in the firſte Chapter. As touching the knowing the goodneſſe of Pouder, for that it chanceth many times that they haue not always one ſort of Pouder, neyther alwayes of one mans making but of ſundry mens making, and ſo by that meanes, ſome Pouder is better than ſome is: therefore it is a harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for to know certainely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus much in weight of thys pouder, is equall vnto the force of ſo muche in weighte of that ſort of Pouder: wherefore in mine opinion, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or little boxe that is deuiſed to proue the force of the Pouder is verye neceſſarie to be vſed, for by it you maye iuſtly know which ſorte of Pouder is ſtronger or weaker in force than the other, by waying alike ſome ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of eache ſorte, and ſo putting the pouder into the engine or boxe, and burning it, firſte the one ſorte, and then the other ſorte, and looke whiche ſorte of Pouder doth blowe, or lift the lidde of the boxe higheſt, that is the ſtronger ſorte of pouder, and you ſhall knowe by howe muche, by the teeth or notches that doe ſtay the lidde of the engine or boxe, and ſo by that engine or boxe, you may fitte the force of the pouder, that is to ſay, if that you doe occupye ſo muche pouder with anye peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. And for that you woulde keepe that length of the marke at ſuche an aduantage in mounting, if you haue no more of that ſorte of pouder, but that the pouder that you haue is eyther ſtronger or weaker, then do thus: wey
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9934:21"/>
out ſome ſmal quantitie, as the weight of a grote or ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, more or leſſe at youre diſcretion, as the engine or boxe is, and firſte burne that ſorte of pouder in the boxe that you do knowe the force of it alreadie, and then looke vnto what teeth or notch that the lidde of the engine or boxe is lifted vp vnto, and then wey out of the other ſorte of pouder the like weighte, and ſo burne that in the boxe or engine, and if it dothe blowe or lifte the lydde hygher than it was before, then it is a ſtronger forte of pouder, if not ſo high, then it is a weaker ſorte of pouder: and by the number of notches, you ſhall know how much. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it be a ſtarger ſorte of Pouder than that you haue occupyed alreadie, then weye out a leſſer weyghte of the ſame, and burne that in the boxe or engine, and ſo doing, both by the weying and burning of it in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or boxe, vntill that it lifte or blowe the lidde of the engine, vnto the iuſte heygth that it was with the firſte ſorte of Pouder: but if the firſte ſorte of Pouder did blow or lifte the lydde higher than the other, then wey out more in weyghte than the firſte, and ſo by the weying and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it in the engine, vntyll the lydde be lyfted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the iuſt heygth that it was before, ſo by that meanes you ſhall knowe iuſtely howe muche weyghte of one ſorte of Pouder ſhall be equall with the force of that ſorte of Pouder, and ſo by this meanes, although you change the ſortes of your Pouder neuer ſo often, yet you may ſo fitte the peece by the weyghte of youre Pouder, that the peece of Ordnaunce ſhall keepe one length at the marke. Hauing this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, both in the lading and the wad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding, to be in ſuch order, that is to ſay, to keepe a methode in the doing thereof, neyther to putte in the pouder too harde, neyther too looſe, neyther the wadde to goe in too looſe, neyther to be too much too harde, but reaſonable.

And now to vſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the handling of the rule, to make a perfite ſhot doe this: prepare your rule, and lette it be well deuided into ynches, halfe ynches, and quarters of ynches, and halfe quarters of ynches, and then lette there bee a ſlitte in the middle of the rule, and in the ſlitte, lette there bee made in braſſe or latine a ſighte, that it maye bee moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vppe and downe at youre pleaſure, and then the rule is finiſhed.

of ynches it is, and to recken that as parte of the mounting of the peece by the degrees. Nowe the diſtance of grounde beeing knowen vnto the marke, and alſo to knowe howe many ynches, and partes of an ynche wyll make the number of degrees, the accoumpte of the diſpart beying made, or elſe the diſpart being ſet vpon the mouth of the peece, then ſet the rule vpon the breech of the ſame perfectly vpright, in ſuch order, as the toppe of the rule bee not nearer vnto the mouth, than that place of the breech of the peece that the rule doth ſtand vppon, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the peece haue much aduantage, or little, ſo that the toppe of the rule muſt not hang backwards or forwards, but alwayes at on proportion from the mouth of the peece: that beeing done, turne the peece right vnto the marke, and then koyne the breech of the peece vppe and downe, vntill the middle of the mouth of the peece, or elſe the toppe of the diſparte, and the marke bee ſeene through the ſight, in the ſlitte of the rule, iuſt at the number of yn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and parts of an ynche, that will anſwere vnto ſo ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y degrees, as the Table in this Chapter going before doth ſhew.

As for example, ſuppoſe that I doe ſhoote in a Saker that conueyeth or driueth the ſhot vpon the right line or point blancke. 26. ſkore, and the marke that I doe ſhoote at is 40. ſkore from the peece, then I haue eyther made proofe by the order preſcribed in the. 7.

And furthermore, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte bee not ſette vppon the mouth of the peece, then you muſte make accoumpte thereof, for that the peece dothe mount himſelfe one ynche and a halfe, therefore you muſte giue the peece but. 2. ynches &amp; a half aduantage, to reach the marke.

the aduantage in the mounting, as the diſparte commeth vnto, and that is one ynch and a halfe. Therfore, you muſt ſet the ſight in the ſlitte, but vpon ſixteene ynches and a halfe, and ſo doing (as before is ſaid) the ſhot ſhall haue a good length at the mark.

All thoſe peeces that be ſhotte at the mounting of anye degree aboue poynte blancke, and vnder the beſte of of the Randare, hath. 4. manner of courſes in hys dryuyng or flying, by the vyolence of the blaſt of the pouder, before the ſhotte come to the ground, ſo that the peece be ſhot againſt a leuelled grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

that is to ſay, further aboue the earth circularly. The third courſe is for a certayn ſpace or quantitie at the higheſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the earth. And the fourth courſe is, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth downewards circularly towards the earth, and ſo ſtouping more and more, till it commeth downe to the ground: as for example this: If any peece that is ſhotte at the beſt of the Randar, that is to ſay, at 45. degrees, and alſo at the mounting of thirtie degrees, and alſo at the mounting of fifteene degrees, and A ſignifieth the right line, and <hi>B</hi> the ſecond courſe in flying of the ſhot circular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpwardes, and <hi>C</hi> ſheweth the vppermoſt courſe for fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the fartheſt diſtance from the earth, and <hi>D</hi> ſheweth the circular falling or comming downewards, or the ſtou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piuꝭ or falling more circularly, than any of the other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or falling of the ſhotte, and the more neerer vnto the ground, the more circularly the compaſſe is made, as this figure doth ſhew.</p>

And this is generall for euer, looke howe muche that the mettall is thicker vppon the one ſide at the tayle of the peece than it is at the mouth of the peece, then looke howe manye times that the length of the peece is vnto the marke, ſo many times the thickneſſe of the mettall is thicker at the breech of the peece, than it is at the mouth, ſo many times the quantitie ſhall the ſhott flye ouer the marke, if ſo bee that the peece be ſhotte without diſparting, and the mark within poynt blanke, or the righte line of the peece: as for example thus, by a peece of Ordnaunce, that the mettall of the breech of the peece is thicker by three ynches on the one ſide, than it is at the mouth of the peece, and the peece is iuſt tenn foote longe, and the marke is iuſt twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye ſkore from the peece. Nowe the peece being tenne foote long, there is iuſt ſixe times the whole length of the peece in euery ſkore, for that a ſkore is ſixtie foote, and ſixe times tenne is ſixtie foote, then the mettall of the breech of the peece, being three ynchs thicker than it is at the mouth of the peece, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peece ſhall caſt ouer the marke at the ende of euerye ſkore eyghteene ynches, for that the peece ſhooteth three ynches ouer the marke at euerye tyme the length of the peece, and then ſyxe tymes three ynches, maketh eyghteen ynches: ſo then it muſt needes

be ſayde, that at the ende of twentie ſkore, the peece muſt needes caſte twentie tymes eyghteene ynches ouer the marke, and twenty times eyghteene ynches, maketh three hundered and ſixtie ynches, and that containeth thyrtye foote, ſo that I doe conclude, that the peece whiche is but tenne foote long, and the mettall three ynches thicker on the one ſide at the breeche of the peece than it is at the mouth, and the marke twenty ſkore from the peece, thys peece being ſhorte wythout anye diſparting, being ſhotte agaynſt an vpright wall, then bringing the middle of the mouth of the peece, and the myddle of the tayle of the peece, and the marke, all three vppon one righte lyne, and then the ſhotte ſhall hytte the wall iuſte thyrtie foot right ouer the marke, and this ſhall be true without anye faile.

of the peece the mettall may bee thicker on the one ſide, than it is on the other, and then that peece wyll neuer ſhoote righte vpon the marke: and alſo, this peece is very daungerous to ſhoote in for feare of breaking. And this is generally for euer. Looke at that ſide that the mettall is moſt thickeſt at the breech, from that ſidewardes the pece doth caſt, and then righte againſt the thickeſt parte of the peece, there is the thinneſt ſide of the mettall, ſo that the mettall be perfit rounde on the outſide of the peece, and alſo the hollowe &amp; concauitie wythin the peece, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the thickeſt ſide of the mettall of the peece, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that ſide the peece caſteth.

Then if the thickeſt part of the mettall by. 2. ynches be vnder the peece, that is to ſay, that at the tutchhole, the mettall is at the thinneſt, when you doe ſette vp youre true diſparte vppon the mouthe of the peece, rebate one ynche of the lengthe of the diſparte, or elſe the peece will caſte the ſhotte vnder the marke, for that the thickeſt ſide of the mettall is downewardes.

Firſt, when they doe knowe the diſtance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9934:31"/>
vnto the marke, and the marke more than that the peece will reache vpon the right line, then mount the peece ſo many degrees, till that the peece be able to reache the marke, then take your Quadrant, and looke through the two ſight of the Quadrant, the plummet hanging at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, till you may ſee the marke iuſtly vppon the hyll, winking with one of your eyes, then looke vpon what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and place the plummet line doth hang vpon, then mounte the peece ſo many degrees more as that doeth come vnto, for the height of the hill, then that beeing done you ſhall make a perfecte ſhotte: as for example this: by a marke that ſtood vpon the ſide of an hill, and by Geometrie perſpectiue, the diſtance is founde to bee ſixtie ſkore from the peece, and now the peece is a Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſuch a one as ſhooteth thirtie ſkore vppon the right line or point blancke. Now the marke is thirtie ſkore more then the peece can reach vppon the right line, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt mount the peece, till it be able to reach the marke, and that is, at the mount of foure degrees, as it doth appeare by the examining of the ſeauenth Chapter, and there you ſhall finde it to appeare to be at the mounte of foure degrees: nowe that being knowen, take your Quadrant, and take the number of degrees that the hill is in height, higher then the ground that you ſtand vpon, and that is done (as before is declared) and then you finde that the marke is fiue degrees higher than the grounde that your peece lyeth vpon, then adde that number vnto the other, and that maketh in all nine degrees iuſt, for that the peece is mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted foure degrees for to reach the marke, and fiue degrees for the height of the marke, whiche is higher grounde than that the peece doth lye vpon, then laying the peece right vppon the marke, there is no doubt but that you muſt needes make a perfite ſhotte, and to lay the peece right vpon the mark, the peece being mouu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9934:32"/>
(as before is ſaid) then take a plummet of leade vpon a ſmall line or ſtring, and lette that be holden vp at the breech, at the very end of the peece, euen at the very mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the tayle of the peece, then ſtand directly behind the peece, and wind the peece, till you doe ſee the midle of the mouth of the peece, and the marke, all three vpon one right line, by the ſight of your eye, winking with one of your eyes, and there is no doubt, but your peece doth lye right vpon your marke, and ſo forth. And nowe in like manner, if you doe mak a ſhotte towards a valley, and the marke more then the peece will reach vppon the righte line, then knowing the diſtance vnto the marke mounte the peece, till it be able to reach the marke, then turne your Quadrant, that the ſight go downewards, the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met hanging at libertie, then you may ſee how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the ground is lower, then the ground that the peece doth lye vpon, and rebate ſo many degrees as that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber commeth vnto, and laying the peece right vpon the marke, there is no doubt but you ſhall make a perfite ſhotte, as by an example with that peece and at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before rehearſed, to a marke in a valley, the ground being lower at the marke you ſhoote at by three degrees, then that ground that the peece doth lye vpon: now you muſt mount the peece foure degrees to reach the marke, and then you muſt rebate three of thoſe degrees for the lowneſſe of the marke, and then you may conclude, that the peece being mounted but one degree, it doth ſhoote that diſtance that it did at nine degrees. And the reaſon thereof is moſt manifeſt, for that the one is vp the hill, and the other downe the hill. And furthermore, with that peece, and at that diſtance before ſpoken of, and alſo at that number of degrees downe the hill that the other was vp the hil, that was at fiue degrees, &amp; now foure degrees will reach the marke vpon a plaine leuell ground, but for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9934:32"/>
that it is downe the hill, you muſt rebate fiue degrees. Wherefore you may conclude, that the peece muſt bee le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled with the Quadrant, one degree vnder the poynt blaucke, that is to ſaye, lower then the Horizon by one degree, for that the deepeneſſe of the valley is the cauſe thereof. Wherefore in mine opinion, it is better for Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to vſe to giue leuell with an ynch rule, as I do afore declare in the eight Chapter, for I doe know, that this is the cauſe that hath deceiued a greate number that are meanly ſeene in thoſe matters, and for lacke of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thoſe cauſes that may happen or chaunce, hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged many that would haue been wel ſeene in thoſe matters.</p>

cleane, without any kinde of droſſe falling into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And furthermore, it is good for the Gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners to view their peeces, and for to know their perfect diſpart, and marke it vpon the peece, or elſe in ſome Booke or Table, and name euery peece what it is, and where ſhe doth lye in the ſhip, and name how many ynches, and half ynches and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ynches the diſpart commeth vnto, and then in time of ſeruice, although that you haue no time to ſet vppe your diſparte you may conſider of it, and doe it well ynough. And furthermore, if that you were driuen to make a ſhot vpon a ſoddayne, and knowe not what diſparte woulde ſerue the peece, yet this you may doe, and ſpeede well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: firſt looke all alongſt by the ſide of the peece as neere as you may at the middle of the breech of the peece, vnto the middle of the mouth of the peece, and ſo by the ſight of your eye, lay it right againſt the marke, and then koyne vp the tayle of your peece faſt, for that giueth the peece the true height of the marke: then take the nexte ſight aloft vpon the peece, from the breech of the peece, vnto the mouth, and ſo laye the peece right vppon the marke. But you would iudge by the ſight of your eye, that the peece lye a great deale, vnder the marke: for that the mettall of the peece is a greate deale thicker then the mettall of the mouth of the peece, and therefore the ſight of the ſide of the peece, giueth her the true height of the marke, and then laying the peece right with the Ship that you doe meane to ſhoote at, looking well to youre Steeradge. Nowe furthermore, if the Sea be wrought or growen, &amp; the Shippes do both heaue and ſet, then if you would make a perfect ſhot, do this: Firſt chooſe your peece between the Lauflau, and the mayne Maſt, vpon the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Orloppe, if the Shippe may keepe the porte open, and for this cauſe you ſhal do it, for that the ſhip doth leaſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour there: for any Shippe that doth heaue, and ſet neuer
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9934:34"/>
ſo ſore, doth hang as though ſhe were vppon an Ariltree, there labouring leaſt, except ſhe doth ſeel or roule. But if any Ship hang any thing by the wind, it will not lightly ſeel or roule. Then if you doe make a ſhotte at another Shippe, you muſt bee ſure to haue a good helme-man, that can ſtirre ſteadie, taking ſome marke of a Cloude that is aboue by the Horizon or by the ſhadowe of the Sunne, or by your ſtanding ſtill, take ſome marke of the other ſhippe through ſome hole, or any ſuch other like. Then he that giueth leuell, muſt obſerue this: firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what diſparte his peece muſt haue, then laye the peece directly with that parte of the Shippe that he doth meane to ſhoote at: then if the Shippe bee vnder the lee ſide of your Shippe, ſhoote your peece in the comming downe of the Gayle, and the beginning of the other Ship to riſe vpon the Sea, as neere as you can, for this cauſe, for when the other ſhippe is aloft vpon the Sea, and ſhee vnder your Lee, the Gayle maketh her for to head, and then it is likeſt to doe much good.</p>
               <p>Now furthermore, if that the Shippe you doe ſhoote at haue the weather gage of you, then your peece that you doe ſhoote at her, muſt needes bee on the weather ſide of the Shippe: then giue fire vnto the peece in the righting of both the Shipps.

And furthermore, if you ſhoote when the other Shippe is alofte on the toppe of the Sea, you haue a bigger marke than when ſhe is in the trough of the Sea. Therefore there is no better time for to giue
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9934:34"/>
fire, then when ſhee is beginning to riſe vpon the Sea, that is, when you ſee her in the trough of the Sea: and you muſt vſe that according vnto the diſtance betweene two Shippes, for you muſt conſider, that the ſhotte muſt haue a time for to come to the ſhippe, for no man can deſcribe the thing ſo well, as hee that doth ſee the thing apparante before his eyes, for his reaſon in thoſe cauſes muſt helpe him, and the principalleſt thing is that, that hee that is at the Helme muſt bee ſure to ſtirre ſteadye, and bee ruled by him that giueth the leuell, and hee that giueth fire, muſt bee nimble, and readye at a ſuddayne. And alſo hee that is at the Helme, muſt bee nimble and ſteady, that is, to putte roomer, when that the other Shippe dothe putte roome, and for to loofe, when that the other Shippe doeth plye his loofe. And it is good for the Gunner to koyne the mouth of his peece, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with the loweſt, rather then any thing with the hygheſt, for if that the ſhotte flyeth ouer the Shippe, then it dothe no good, but if that it commeth ſhorte of the Shipoe, it will graze in the water and riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and ſpeede well ynough, ſo that it bee not too muche too ſhorte of the Shippe, for too muche too ſhorte dothe kill the ſhotte in the Sea and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye if that the diſtance bee anye thing farre off. And furthermore, for the Sea fight, if the one doe meane to lay the other aboorde, then they doe call vp their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, eyther for to enter or to defend: and firſt, if that they doe meane for to enter (as you may knowe) that hee will preaſe to laye you aboorde, then marke where that you doe ſee anye Scottles for to come vppe at, as they will ſtande neere there aboutes, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente for to bee readie, for to come vppe vnder the Scottles: there giue leuell with your Fowlers, or Slinges, or Baſes, for there you ſhall bee ſure to doe

And furthermore, marke where his men haue moſt recourſe, there diſcharge your Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Baſes. And furthermore, for the annoyance of your enemie, if that at the boording that the Sippes lye, therefore you may take away their ſteeradge with one of your great peeces that is to ſhoote at his Rother, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore at his mayne maſt, and ſo foorth. Thus muche haue I ſaid as touching Sea Gunners, for that I doe know they do meddle with no other fightes, and therefore it is meete for him to ſeeke as much as in him lyeth, for to annoy the enemie with fireworkes and Ordnaunce &amp;c. And furthermore, if the Shippe doth ſeell or rowle, then the beſt place of the ſhip for to make a ſhotte, is out of the head or ſterne. And furthermore, for to make a ſhot out of a Galley, and eſpecially the Cannon that lyeth in the Caſe, or Prow, he that giueth fire, muſt be ruled by him that is at the helme, becauſe he can neyther koyne her vp nor downe, for that ſhe lyeth in the caſe, for he that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, muſt giue leuell. And furthermore, the Cannon that lyeth in the caſe, can not lightly ſhoote a ſhippe vnder wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither betweene the wind and the water, where that it is not on the Sea, and eſpecially if the Ship be at hand, for that ſhe lyeth leuell, for looke how high, that the peece is aboue the Sea, ſo high ſhall the ſhotte hitte any thing aboue the water, as farre as the peece can caſt vppon the right line. And for to make a ſhotte out of a Galley vnto a Shippe, for to ſtrike him vnder the water, or betweene the wind and the water. Firſt waight the Sippe lying in the trough of the Sea, when ſhe doth begin to riſe vppon
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9934:35"/>
the Sea, and then in lyke manner, when you do ſee that the Galleys head doth beginne to deſcende, then giue fire vnto the peece, and you ſhall make a perfite ſhotte. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if the Galley be in fight with another Shyppe in a calme, then the Shyppe will ſkant waue or ſtirre, and then the Galley may play off and on at hir pleaſure: and then to make a ſhotte at hande, is ſome matter, for in a calme, the Shyppes doe neither ryſe nor fall, but a little, in compariſon of any thing to the purpoſe: neyther dothe the Galleys head either heaue nor ſet to any purpoſe, if the Shippe be at hand, to the intent or purpoſe to ſhoote a Shippe vnder the watter. Therefore when you meane to ſtrike a Shippe vnder the water with a Galley, and dare not lay them aboorde, then koyle your Cabels forwards, with the trimming forwarde of your waightie geare into the Galleys head, ſo lowe, till it ſhall ſerue your turne, by bringing alſo your men forwardes: then by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Steeradge with your Ores, or with your Helme, you may ſhoote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what part of the Shippe you will, and ſo ſhoote hir vnder water at your pleaſure.</p>

               <p>And furthermore, the cauſe thereof groweth by this meanes, for in the doubling the thickneſſe of the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of the peece, it doth but increaſe as a platforme, or ſuperficiall, that is, for double meaſure, to be foure times the quantitie.

A laſt of Pouder is 24 hundred weight, caſke and all, and euerye hundred weight to contayne. 112. pound, ſo that you may make your accompte, that you haue 24. hundred pounde of Pouder in euery laſt, and ſo is allowed 12 pound in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery 100. weight, for the caſke, which is in al allowed for the caſke of a laſt of Powder, 288. pound. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And firſt this: the biggeſt ſortes of double Cannons doe occupie at one ſhotte. 46. pound of Sarpentine Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and you haue. 2. charges in. 100 of pouder, and eight pounde remayneth ouer, ſo that you haue 52. ſhottes of Pouder, in a laſt of pouder, and 8. pound remayneth ouer. And if that it be ſuch a double Cannon, as doth occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie but 40. pound of Serpentine Pouder, then you haue 2 ſhots and a halfe of Pouder in euery. 100. weight of Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is iuſt. 60. ſhottes in a laſt of Pouder. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And alſo, thoſe Demy Cannons that doe ſhoote. 24. pound of Serpentine Pouder at one ſhot, they ſhall haue foure ſhottes in a hundred weight of Pouder, and foure pound remayneth ouer, and that is a hundred ſhottes, in a laſt of pouder iuſt &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And alſo thoſe Culuerings that doe ſhoote eyghtteene pound of Sarpentine Pouder at one ſhotte, then there is fiue ſhootes in a hundred weighte of Pouder, and then there remayneth ouer tenne pound, ſo that there is a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

thirty three ſhottes in a Laſt of Pouder, &amp; ſixe pound remaineth ouer. And furthermore, thoſe Demy Culurings that doe ſhoote eleuen pound of Serpintine Pouder at one ſhotte, then there is nine ſhottes in a hundred weight of Pouder, and one pound remaineth ouer, ſo that there is two hundred and eighteene ſhottes in a laſt of Pouder. &amp;c. And alſo for thoſe Sakers that doe ſhoote ſixe pounde and a halfe of Serpentine Pouder at a ſhotte, then there is fifteen ſhottes in a hundred weight, &amp; two or three pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d remaineth, ſo that there is. 369 ſhottes in a laſt of pouder.

you may knowe howe much Pouder they will ſpende in one day: as this firſt (as before is rehearſed.)

And here is one thing to be noted, as touching the grazing of the ſhotte, whether it be vpon the water or the land, looke by what proportion the ſhotte doth ſtrike or hitte the ground or water, by that proportion the ſhotte ſhall riſe againe, although that it flyeth not ſo farre in that proportion, as long as the ſhotte hath force or drifte in his flying, that is to ſay, if the ſhott do ſtrike or hitte any thing glauncingly that then it ſhall glance in that proportion from you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and if do ſtrike or hitte anye thing directly, then it ſhall be driuen directly backe agayne, if it doe not enter or ſticke faſt in the thing that it hitteth, euen like the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of the Sunne, or anye other thing in the water or glaſſe, or ſuch other like.

               <figure/>
               <p>And furthermore, if you doe mount the peece at much aduantage, then it will not graze at all, if it do graze, then it will be made in this manner.</p>

               <p>And furthermore, if you doe ſhoote at any Shippe vpon the water, and you do ſhoote in that peece that do lye ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high, and the ſhippe or marke neere hand, ſo that you muſt giue your leuell downewards, then if you doe giue your leuell ſhorte of the ſhippe, the ſhot will flye ouer the Shippe, by the meanes of the direct hitting of the water, for that the ſhot doth glaunce from the water, by that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that it doth hitte the water, as by this example.</p>

And now when that the nighte was come, and the ſame very darke, and the mornyng very foggy, or that they could not ſee the walles of the Towne, yet they bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the walles of the Towne as perfitely all the night, and as well as though it had bin by day, for euery time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
