            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Namelye sythe it is ryghte manifest to all men that euen thapostles themselues lacked that whych was chyfe and the hyghest poynt of al, where as notwith standynge, they were the corner stones and the roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of foundacion, yea and the beste and the most ex cellent part of christendome. No man yet thynketh that thapostles were vtterly and all together infide les. For they beleued the thynges that were wrytten in the law and in the prophetes, albeit they had not yet the full perfection of fayth. Fayth was in them and it was not in them. Fayth therfore is a thynge whych alwayes groweth bygger and bygger accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the parable of the mustarde sede. So the Apostles were not vtterly voyde and destitute of fayth for they had a parte of it. For it is wyth fayth as it is wyth a man that is sycke and begynneth by lytle and lytle to crepe vp &amp; waxe stronge. The lord than expresseth and declareth to hys apostles where in they beleued not and what they wanted, whyche doubtles was that they perfytly beleued not his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.

Certes, to beleue the resurrection of Christ is nothynge els than to beleue we haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciler before God whych is Christ whych maketh vs at one wyth God the father and iustifyeth vs in hys syght. For what so euer is in man of hys owne nature and byrth wythout regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but synne and death whereby he heapeth vpon hymselfe gods vengeaunce.

Hereof it commeth that betwene God and man is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enmitie neyther can they be frendes or agre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

By him only our prayer is allowed before God. By hym onely we be herde and get the fauoure &amp; grace of the father. Thys is now to beleue vpon Christes resurrection yf as it is recited we beleue that Christ hath borne vpon hym aswell our synnes as the syn nes of the hole worlde &amp; hath drowned in hymselfe the one and the other and also the yre of the father wherby we be reconciled to God and made ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse before hym.

Thus truly, yf Christe rose not from death to lyfe, it foloweth, that synne &amp; death dyd swalowe hym vp and kylled hym. After that we could not ryd our selues out of our synnes, Iesus Christ toke them vpon hym to treade vnder hys fete death and hell, and to be made Lorde ouer them. Now yf he rose not agayne, than surely he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame not synne, but was ouercome of synne.</p>
                  <p>And yf he rose not agayne, he redemed vs not, and so we be yet in our synnes. Furthermore in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th to the Romaynes he sayeth thus.

And therfore the Lorde sayeth. He that beleueth not shalbe damned. He sayeth not, he that is not baptised. For baptisme wythout fayth is nothynge worth, but it is lyke to a paper that hathe a seale hangynge to it and hath no wrytynge in it.

Albeit thys interpretation is honest and a mater of trouth that such as beleue shall worke these feates, yet it is not the ryght sense and meanynge of thys text. This than is the meanynge. Where a christian man hath fayth, he shall haue power to worke these sygnes and they shal folow hym, as Christ hymselfe<note place="margin">Io. xiiij.</note> sayeth in an other place: Uerely verely I saye vnto you, he that beleueth in me the workes that I do he shal do, yea and he shal do greater then they be. For the christen man hath the same power wyth Christe, Christ is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie, he is sette in the same goodes wyth Christ. Furthermore Christ gaue them power agaynst wycked spirites to cast them out &amp; to heale al maner of syckenesses as it is redde in the tenth of Matheu.

a christen man is, the power to worke these sygnes &amp; myracles is not taken awaye, as by many exemples it hath ben proued.

This feast whych they call Pentecost, began in thys wyse. Whan God shulde leade the Israelites out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nyght before he ordeyned Passeouer which we call Ester to be solemnised, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that

euery yeare about that tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daye shulde be kepte holydaye for a memory of theyr departure out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypte. And from that daye afterwarde for the space of fyfty dayes they walked in the wyldernes, tyll at last they came to the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sinay, where by Moses the lawe was gyuen them of God. For thys cause they kept that solempne holydaye whyche we call in Greke Pentecost that is to saye the fyftye daye and in Englysh Wytsonday. Now therfore fyfty dayes from Ester beynge accomplyshed and the memory of the lawe whych god had promulgate to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the mounte Sinay fulfylled: the holy goost came and gaue an other lawe. Nowe therfore, thys day is celebrate of vs not because of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde facte but because of the newe, I meane, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghost. So we declare a certayne difference betwene oure Pentceoste, and the Iues Pentecost. Fyrste the Iues kept this daye, bycause the lawe wrytten was then gyuen vnto them. But we oughte to celebrate oure Pentecoste bycause the lawe of God was then spiritually delyuered vnto vs. For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge hereof, Saynte Paule is to be broughte<note place="margin">ij. co. iij and iiij.</note> forth whiche also putteth the same difference, wher he speaketh of two maner prechynges. And as there be two maner preachynges, so be there two sortes of people. First was the lawe wryten, which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded and comprised in lettres and therfore it is called the lawe of the lettre, bycause it remayneth in lettres and entreth not in the brest, neyther do any workes folowe it saue hypocritical and constreyned workes, and therfore the people also remayne styll but lyterall and fleshly. And bycause it was compry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:25338:73"/>
onlye in lettres and was all togyther in deade wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, it kylled and made a dead people, for the hart was dead bycause it dyd not of the owne accorde the commaundement of god. For yf euery man shuld be lefte to his owne wyll to do what hym lusteth wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feare of punyshement there shulde be founde none but wolde rather be fre and louse from the law then bounde therto. For thus he naturally thinketh. Lo God wyll surely punyshe me, yea and dryue me into hel, onles I kepe his commaundementes. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature feleth it selfe vnwyllynge, and to do them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no maner loue or delectation, wherfore man is forth wyth made enemye to god by reason of the penaltye when he fealeth hymselfe a synner, and that he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not ryghtly before God, so that he wold rather that there were no God.

But thou wylt aske wherby he bryngeth to passe &amp; what thynge he vseth thus to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and renue the hart? Surely by that he sheweth and preacheth of Iesus Christ (as Christ hymselfe in the .xv. chap. of Ihon sayeth) whan the comforter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth whome I shall sende you from my father I meane the spirite of trouth whych procedeth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father he shal beare wytnes of me. Nowe oftentymes ye haue herde that the gospel or Euangel is the thynge whych god suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth to be preached in the worlde and to be tolde to euery man that is to wyt that none can be iustifyed by the dedes of the lawe but rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a worse thinge come therby, and therfore he sente downe hys moost deare sonne to dye and to shede hys bloud for vs by cause we of our owne powers coulde not rubbe out the spotte of synne nor be delyuered from it. But to the preachynge hereof another thynge yet is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, euen the holy goost whome God must sende. He printeth in the harte thys sermon and preachyng to make it fixed and roted in it, for it is moost sure and certayne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christe hath done all thys geare, he hath

Then the harte is nomore waywarde nor croked in the meditacion of God, it thynketh not to be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen downe to hell of hym, as before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge of the holy goost it thought, when it felte no goodnes no loue no fydelitie, but styll a pace the wrathe and indignacion of God. Now therfore whyle the holy goost prynteth into the christen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s harte howe he hath God hys mercyfull and graciouse Lorde, it is a pleasure for hym for Gods sake boldly to execute and suffre any maner of thynge.

the holy goost. Now what we shall do in it, we shall knowe further in the gospell. Thus sayeth Christ</p>
                  <q>Yf a man loue me he woll kepe my saynge, and my father shall loue hym.</q>
                  <p>Lo good people here ye maye se (as I haue often tymes preached vnto you) that the frute of fayth is<note place="margin">Charite is the frute of fayth.</note> charitie, whych thynge can not be denyed. For chari tie or loue perfourmeth and doeth euen of the owne accorde all that euer scripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. And thys doth saynt Paule declare Gal. v. He that loueth his neyghboure hath fulfylled the lawe. Wherfore they that haue not fayth and charitie, do not fulfyll the lawe, albeit they seme in outwarde appearaunce to perfourme all the workes of the lawe. The worde whych Christ preacheth he sayeth is not hys worde but hys fathers worde declarynge herby y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothyng ought to be added nor taken awaye from it. And these thynges (sayeth Christe) concernynge aswell your loue towardes me, as the kepynge of my word haue I spoken vnto you, beynge yet present &amp; dwel lynge amonges you. But that same comforter of whome I haue made so muche mencion vnto you, I meane the holy goost, whose feate and offyce shal be to sanctifye &amp; lyghten you vnto all trouth, which holy goost my father shall sende in my name that is to saye for my cause, he shall teach you altogether &amp; shall put you in remembraunce of all that euer ye<note place="margin">A que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> haue herde of me.

<pb n="lvij" facs="tcp:25338:75"/>
for they vnderstode neyther Christes glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion by the crosse nor yet hys raygne or kyngdome. Wherfore they neded the holy goostes teachynge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☜</note> is to saye, hys sanctifyenge and makynge the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges lyuely in them whych they had lerned of Christ For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> disciples were as yet but <hi>(litera)</hi> they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not the thynges that were of the spirite of God, and therfore they neded the holy goost to quycken them, accordynge to the sayenge of saynt Paule.</p>
                  <p>The letter sleeth, but the spirite quickeneth. Ye may not then vnderstande by thys worde (teach) that the<note place="margin">docebit</note> holy goost shal set abroch a new doctrine that Christ had not taught before, but ye must vnderstande by it that the holy goost shall interprete the doctrine al ready taught by Christ and declare it to the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnderstandynge. And therfore Christ expouneth hymselfe and sayeth he shall put you in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al the thynges that I haue shewed you.

And furthermore we saye agaynst the wycked Ana baptistes that the baptisme of children is not vayne but necessarye to saluacion.

And therfore in all hast they sent these two Apostles Peter and Iohn to confirme and strengthen theyr faith. Here we be taught what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of true &amp; good Apostles, yea of all good Christen men is. For we ought in lykewyse to be carefull for oure brethren y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they maye be broughte to the perfeyte knowlege of gods worde.

But they do cleane contrary, they rather plucke me from the Gospell, then allure them vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Seconde, ye shall note, that before the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christe, when as yet the Iues and Gentyles were not ioyned togyther by all one fayth, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels<note place="margin">Math. x</note> were forbydden to entre into the cyties of the Samaritanes.

                  <p>Thyrdly, in this historye ye shall marke, that the Samaritanes receyued forthwyth the holy ghoste assone as they beleued and were baptized.

And therfore the Apostles eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that purpose sent Peter and Iohan, whiche prayed for them that they myght receyue the holy Ghoste.

Howe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this be? Chryste hym selfe sayeth, he that beleueth &amp; is baptysed shall be saued.

He woll not playe the crabbe fysh whych wolde haue taught her doughter to go streyght, but wold not leade her the waye her selfe and teach her by her exemple how to go, as it is in Esopes fables.

Thys prouerbe or parable nakedly and vnap plyed spake Iesus to hys disciples. But they vnder stode not what thynges they were whyche he spake vnto them, and no maruayle.
