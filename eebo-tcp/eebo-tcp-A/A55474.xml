            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It seemed good unto mee, having had clear understanding and knowledg of that high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Ministration, in which hee lived and died, (and therefore <hi>holding my self obliged</hi>) to bear my Testimony concerning this Authour. Know then, my first Acquaintance with him was in the Year 1663, (the Memory of which shall ever be pretious to mee, because of those great and spiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as <hi>to the Information of my Iudgment</hi> about som deep and weighty Points of Divinitie: which none could answer that I could meet with, nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy my searching Mind in those Things, like this holy Man of God, who had profound Abilitie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in the holy Anointing: (for <hi>which I so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence him</hi>) and I affirm, that since my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him <hi>till the Time of his Death,</hi> he was evermore imployed and busied in an internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Life: the Spirit in him still searching the deep and hidden Mysteries of the Kingdom. And truly hee was not only a <hi>Seeker,</hi> but a success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Finder</hi> of that rich Pearl of the Gospel. And albeit his mortal Part is now expired, in which he enjoyed great Inspiration and Prospect of that Light-world, into which he now is entred, <hi>having put off only the weak and less honourable Bodie,</hi> and put on Immortalitie and Glorie, which in his sick and languishing Bed he gave <hi>great Assurance</hi> of. And although hee had such a foresight and taste of the Powers of the invisibl World, with all the Glorie which is expected in this latter Age to break forth, <hi>yet he was brought into a great Resignation</hi> in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Mind to give up his Right, <hi>as to what hee might here have enjoyed yet</hi> in the Body of Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For sure I am I knew none that had a more deep seeing and prophetical Spirit than hee had But <hi>when</hi> that the Symptoms of a dying State came upon him, he <hi>then,</hi> most patiently and cheerfully,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101649:4"/>
acquiesced in the Will of God his Father. The Truth of which I shall give you in one remarkable Passage amongst many more that fell from him in the Time of his Sickness: which is this. Some few Daies before his Departure, perceiving Death's Approach, and being in som Agonies, hee called and commanded to have mee sent for, judging the Time of his Departure might be at hand: being come to him, he said, <hi>Friend, I have this to desire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And after some Words which then I spake to him, hee further said to me, <hi>I would not have you dismayed, though I leave you in the Work that we have bin travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in together: for do not think my being tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And doubt not but God will raise up that good Spirit, that hath bin a guiding Light in and to me, in some others, that shall assist and go forward with you, for the finishing of that great Mysterie which we have mutually rejoiced in. But be you stedfast, abiding in the Faith thereof, according to what hath been made known b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the Spirit of our Lord and Saviour touching these Things.</hi> And so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>with a desire</hi> to speak with his <hi>trusty and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Friend</hi> Dr. <hi>Ed. Hr.</hi> concerning the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Writings</hi> which his Mind was much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: who also <hi>declared his Mind,</hi> some small Time after, <hi>in my hearing,</hi> to the Doctor <hi>concerning them</hi>; as leaving them <hi>in trust with no other; though some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101649:5"/>
Breach of his Will did after happen, which will be sad indeed, should the same not he repaired, that so his Will mai be fullfilltd concerning his Writings so left in trust.</hi> After he had thus delivered his Mind, his animal Spirits grew hourly faint and weak, yet as he was able, many refreshing Speeches and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sentences came still from him, both to his near Relations and other Friends <hi>then</hi> about him, who performed their dutiful and Christian Part to him: for which they received his Blessing, and had his Praiers to God in their behalf. Much more might be recited, but I shall forbear further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and refer the Inquirer to those living Testators, to whom this Author was sufficiently known. It may now be <hi>expected</hi> that we should <hi>give some more Satisfaction</hi> as <hi>to the Life of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> how he carried it as <hi>to all holy Deportment,</hi> both towards God and towards Man. For as his Light was great and eminent, so his Life is answerably to be measured. I shall not affirm it to be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as nothing of defect could be found therein; he was a Man that might be subject to Passions and Infirmities, as <hi>Elias</hi> was: yet this I can boldly, and as truly say on his behalf, since the Time of my acquaintance, <hi>he groaned and travailed hard in himself after the Birth of Perfection, forward pressed he towards the Mark of the Resurrection, which was still in his Eye, daily preaching it to himself and others; being of late Years</hi> more than ordinary <hi>in Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and daily Dyings to all things, that came in as the Effect of the Fall. And indeed for the later Years of his Life he took up so much with God, as he cared to be very little known among Men,</hi> (alwaies excepting his dear Friend Dr. <hi>Ed. Hr.</hi> whom he would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be without at home, even when most reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) <hi>I say, he cared not to be known in the World; as a Preludium to his not long staying among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101649:5"/>
thereof.</hi> For thus far I made my Observation upon him, that <hi>I often saw the Spirit of his Mind translated, and was gone up,</hi> beforehand as it were, <hi>to prepare a Mansion for his Soul,</hi> which then groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be set loose from <hi>so unagreeable a Bodie</hi>: yet as little so (by <hi>reason of its habituated heavenly Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and sometimes extraordinary Exertion and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation</hi>), as a mortal Bodie could lightly be. <hi>Hence it was that he so often let fall this Expression,</hi>
                     <q>Olr! how little do I care to live, without I might come to put on the Bodie of the Resurrection, by and in which I might do the Will of God in this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er World with as great Libertie, Alacritie and Constancie, as Mount <hi>Sion's</hi> Saints now in Glorie.</q>
Thus in grand Soul-Introversion, and Body-Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he spent <hi>this later part of his Daies,</hi> delighting much (as the Dr. <hi>E. H.</hi> and several more know) in an abstracted Life, and coveted Solitude, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from his publick Ministery, wherein he had formerly exercised himself, but <hi>of late, after the Example of the holy Apostle</hi> Paul, <hi>he retired</hi> to a little convenient Place of his own; yet not refusing any that would come for spiritual Direction and Counsel, freely giving, as he had freely received from the Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the Time of this his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude he writ more, <hi>as much more,</hi> as what is now brought forth into publick View: wherein are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and mystical Truths that were opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the pure central Light that rose from the morning-Star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Spirit, which had great Libertie of access to, and Abilitie of diving into the infinite Ocean of divine Mysteries, through the favourable Guift of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bountiful Lord, the Almighty God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being so greatly good, let not thine Eye, O <hi>Reader,</hi> be evil: nor let any one stumble or be offended at either the Author or matter, Method or Expression; but give place to that pure Light, which gave him such an Understanding and Sight. If the Meat be too strong for thee, thou hast liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to refuse, and maist set it by, till thou art grown stronger in Spirit: it was the Author's Iudgment not to impose, he left that for the Lord alone, to dispose the Mind for reception. But doubtless it is prepared as a living Portion for such as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after spiritual Dainties and heavenly Mysteries. Let me therefore beseech you to be censureless, till the Day of the Lord cometh, without Clouds, to arise in the Heart of your Earth, so as to clear up all doubtful matters of this kind; observing the Doctrine of that <hi>large spirited Apostle; which is,</hi> To abide in that Spirit <hi>of Love,</hi> which can hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and bear all things, and cover and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what we mai not yet perfectly understand or reach, as not being happily come to that clear inspection of things; <hi>thereby to be so imboldned</hi> as to pass Iudgment with an infallibility thereon, but rather give room and grant Christian Liberty to and for the various Gifts and Operations of the Spirit in each one. For, sure I am, it is that which will secure us in the Peace of God, which passeth Understanding, which will guard our Hearts from the evil of Controversies, which this Author did study to avoid, though of sufficient Learning and Ability to manage them, yet of late Time kept himself from all such Ingagements, <hi>quietly resting</hi> under the droppings (or rather <hi>Pourings</hi>) of the

holy Anointing. Of which I shall give you some particular, as the ground-work of this <hi>Subject</hi> here <hi>treated</hi> of, <hi>being the Knowledg of God out of Nature, and yet to be known in the Globe of eternal Nature.</hi> This you must know he came to understand by his Spirit, being caught up into the still Eternitie for <hi>several Daies together</hi>; which in some Part of his Writings he giveth an hint of: and so from what he in the still Eternitie saw and heard, he wrote (<hi>behold who can the Copy,</hi> and <hi>then,</hi> but not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Surely, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he was as another <hi>Moses in som sort,</hi> taken up into the Mount with God, as a Friend and Favourite of the most High; where he did see, hear and learn these so deep and excellent things, which are, <hi>by great Care, and no less Conscience,</hi> brought forth to Light.

                     <p>THE subject of this Chapter is, What God is in the primary and original being of himself, before the Globe of Eternity did exist.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> If you ask me, What this God is, that was before the Globe of Eternity was brought into mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, That by God in this place I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Spirit of Eternity himself, as he is an Eternal Unity and Simplicity. But what this Eternal Unity and Simplicity of himself is, who can tell but himself, it being unknowable to any besides himself. For no creature can comprehend an infinite, unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and incomprehensible Creator: therefore none can know what the Spirit of Eternity is, out of the Globe of Eternity, but himself alone. The first mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of himself is in the Globe of Eternity, there he first becomes knowable to Intellectual creatures: but without and beyond it, he is as a Nothing to all created understandings, being hid and wrapt up in his own unsearchable Mystery. Wherefore we conclude, That God considered, as existing before the Globe of Eternity, is absolutely unknowable to all Creatures; and this leads me to the second Head or Particular which is handled in the next following Chapter.</p>

                     <p>IF you ask me what God is, as he exists in the Globe of Eternity, without and before Eternal Nature's Principle? I must, before I come to give you a more particular Answer to this Query advise you, that the knowledge of God as he exists in the Globe of Eternity, without eternal Nature, is a very deep and Mystical Knowledge, though it is true with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that in the Globe of Eternity God is much more Knowable, than without it in the solitary abstracted Being of himself, for so he is altogether unknowable and incomprehensible.

                     <p>The nature of the Holy Trinity considered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as they exist in the Globe of Eternity, without and before eternal Nature, is a very great Mystery.

                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is God the Father?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> God the Father is the first original beginning of the Trinity: were there no beginning, there could be no end; were there no first number, there could be no second or third in the Trinity. God the Father therefore is the Eternal beginning of the Holy Trinity. God the Father must be either from himself, that is from his own Divine Essence, or else from the Eternal World, or Eternal Nature's Essence; but neither of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101649:65"/>
them were yet existent; wherefore we must conclude that except the Father had taken his Beginning from his own Eternal Unity, he could not have been the first beginning of the Trinity.</p>
                     <p>In the second place, I say that God the Father, is the Eternal Generator of the Son, or word who is the second person in the Holy Trinity.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is God the Son?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> God the Son is the Second number of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, were there no Son, there would be no Father. He is the Center and Heart of the Trinity. He is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of the Father before the Eternal World, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature were in being. He is the only begotten Son of the Father, and is co-eternal, co-essential, and co-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with him. He is the essential Word of the Father. He is the delight of the Father, and his well beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>What is the Holy Ghost?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> He is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> third and compleating <hi>number</hi> of the Trinity. He is an out-flowing breath, life, or power, which proceeds from the Father through the Son, and doth execute the will of the Father. This out-flowing life and acting power proceeds from the Divine Essence of the Father and the Son, and therefore is co-eternal, co-essential and co-equal with the Father and Son.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>Why is not the Holy Ghost said to be begotten of, but to proceed from the Father?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Holy Ghost were begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the Son could not have been the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Father, and so the Father would have had more Sons then one; neither would there have been a distinction between the Son and the Holy Ghost. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghost is not said to be generated of the Father, but to proceed from the Father and Son, as an out-flowing breath of Life and Power. The Holy Ghost doth compleat the Trinity, and make up the <hi>number</hi> three, so as nothing can be added thereto, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101649:66"/>
diminished: the Father cannot be without the Son, nor the Son without the Father, nor the Holy Ghost without both Father and Son.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>How is the Vnity in Trinity distinguished in the Eternal World?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I have told you before that the Trinity is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishable by their Names, Number, Order, and by their relative properties, but not by their <hi>Natures,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they have but one Nature and Essence; in which oneness of their Nature their Eternal <hi>Vnity</hi> doth consist. Therefore they that would <hi>distinguish</hi> the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> in the Eternal World, <hi>otherwise</hi> than before expressed, do <hi>run</hi> into great <hi>confusion.</hi> The Father is an Eternal <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and so is the Son and Spirit; the Son is <hi>pure Deity,</hi> and so is the Father and Spirit: the Holy Ghost is an <hi>Eternal Liberty</hi> and so is the Father and Son. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>these</hi> are no <hi>distinguishing properties</hi> of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the <hi>Eternal World. Some</hi> do thus distinguish the Trinity, they say the Father is <hi>Light,</hi> the Son <hi>Life,</hi> and the Holy Ghost <hi>Love:</hi> but these cannot be the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing characters of the Trinity, because the Father is Light, Life and Love, and so likewise the Son and Holy Ghost. <hi>Others</hi> would have the Father to be <hi>Light,</hi> the Son <hi>Love,</hi> and the Holy Ghost <hi>Power,</hi> but all these belong to every one of the Trinity, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the distinguishing characters of them. <hi>Others again</hi> would have the Father <hi>Fire,</hi> the Son <hi>Light,</hi> and the Holy Ghost <hi>Air:</hi> but <hi>these</hi> are <hi>elements</hi> which are rooted in Eternal Nature's Principle, and are <hi>not to be found</hi> in the Globe of Eternity. <hi>Others</hi> distinguish the Father by the <hi>severity</hi> of Divine Iustice, the Son by <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercifulness</hi>; whereas <hi>in the Eternal World</hi> there is <hi>no severity</hi> of vindictive Iustice <hi>known, nor</hi> any thing of <hi>anger</hi> or <hi>wrath; becaus</hi> the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> stands <hi>wholly</hi> in the Unity of <hi>Love. The only distinction of the Holy Trinity in the Eternal World is this,</hi> That the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> manifesteth himself as a wonderful all-seeing <hi>Eye:</hi>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101649:66"/>
the <hi>Son</hi> manifests himself as the <hi>Center of the Eye,</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> of the Father; and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as an <hi>out-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power</hi> proceeding from the Father's <hi>Eye,</hi> and the Son's <hi>Heart,</hi> effecting whatsoever the will of the Father in the Eye, through the Love-essence, seated in the Heart of the Son, would have done. And <hi>thus</hi> the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trinity</hi> do <hi>manifest</hi> themselves <hi>distinctly</hi> in the <hi>Eternal World, though</hi> they <hi>all</hi> stand in the <hi>Eternal Vnity,</hi> and are <hi>not only</hi> three <hi>Denominations,</hi> as will be clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the third Chapter of this following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to speak of the other particular in the Mystery of the Holy Trinity, <hi>viz. Trinity in Vnity.</hi> This <hi>Mystery</hi> I will endeavor to open, <hi>as I have seen it with the Eye of my enlightned mind,</hi> and shew how the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> do subsist as <hi>one</hi> in <hi>one only</hi> ground, or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>You will say if three do subsist in one only es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that seems to make a Quaternity and not a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> This is an ill drawn consequence and a meer mistake which may easily be rectified thus. The one only ground or essence in which the Holy Trinity do subsist, is the Eternal Unity; and this Eternal Unity in the Father, and the Son, and Holy Ghost, subsists in the Father's Unity: so that the Holy Trinity is one with the Eternal Unity, from whence they flow forth: and as they have their beginning from the Unity, so they end in the same. The Holy Scripture teacheth us this fundamental truth, that the Holy Trinity are one, and yet three in that oneness, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.</hi> They are all one in the Eternal Unity, the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, and the Holy Ghost in the Father and Son; so that one cannot be without the other, and are but one ever blessed God, though distinguished
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101649:67"/>
in their goings forth, and the manifestations of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be asked what the Nature of the Holy Trinity is? I answer, it is pure Unity, and pure Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is pure Deity; and this is the Nature of the Father, Son and Spirit, they are all Unity and pure Deity. And as they have but one undivided Nature, so they have but one Eye, one Understanding, one Will. But if any one inquire further what this Eternal Unity and Deity is which is the Nature of the Holy Trinity? I answer, that none knows this, but the unsearchable Trinity. Neither is it any further knowable by Angels or Men, but that it is, what it is.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding that we say, that <hi>the Vnity is unknowable in it self</hi> to Angels and Men; <hi>yet it may be known, forasmuch as it relates to the Trinity, and as it is the one ground in which they subsist; and in this respect we say,</hi> that the Eternal Unity, is a <hi>most simple Essence</hi> free from all duality and contrariety. <hi>It is most true</hi> that <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety may consist with Vnity,</hi> but <hi>contrariety destroys its nature,</hi> which admits of no mixture whatsoever. <hi>Now if the Nature of the Trinity be Eternal Vnity and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, free from all contrariety and mixture, it follows that Light and Darkness, Love and Anger cannot be in the Holy Trinity, as they exist in the Globe of Eternity; because these contrarieties would necessarily destroy the Nature of Vnity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you will say that God is styled in Scripture, a God that is angry, and a consuming fire, and in other places he is said to be Light and Love, which implies that there is a mixture of contrarieties in the Essence of the Holy Trinity.</p>
                     <p>I answer, that these Scriptures speak of God as he hath introduced himself into apostatized and impure Nature's essence after the fall, whereas I in this place speak of God as he exists in the Eternal World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eternal Nature was divided by the fall; and in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101649:67"/>
this state the Holy Trinity is nothing but Eternal Unity, free from any contrariety or mixture whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Nature of the Trinity, if well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, manifests clearly h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w Father, Son and Spirit are distinct, and yet are but one Eternal Unity. And thus much concerning the Trinity in Unity.</p>
                     <p>Now I will further treat of the Nature of the Holy Trinity. The Triune God, considered in himself in the Globe of Eternity, is pure Deity; which pure Dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y is the highest purity, clarity and brightness of glory beyond all imagination. This high purity of the Trinity is free from all impurity and imperfection whatsoever: and in this high purity consists the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and holiness of God. This bright purity is the Nature of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e Trinity in the Globe of Eternity, which they equally partake of; for as the Father is all purity, so is the Son and Spirit, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> from <hi>this purity of their Nature are called the Holy Trinity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed to a further opening of the Nature of the Trinity. God is said to be Good, and the one only Good, the chiefest Good wherein Eternal Bliss and happiness doth consist; in which ground of Eternal Goodness the Father, Son and Spirit are all one. The Father is <hi>all Goodness, and so likewise is the Son and Spirit; and consequently Good and Evil cannot be in God</hi>; for so there would be a mixture of contrary natures in the Divine Essence, which as hath been said, is all Eternal Goodness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Evil of sin cannot be in God,</hi> because sin is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; now no imperfection can be found in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence which is perfection it self.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither is the evil of punishment to be found in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> for if the Nature of God be all Goodness, Mercy, Pity and Compassion, where shall severity, fierceness or bitterness be found? Or any vindicative Iustice?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101649:68"/>
From whence proceeds the evil of punishment? I say, <hi>none of these are to be found in the Nature of the Holy Trinity, as they subsist in the Globe of Eternity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you ask me further, what the Nature of the Holy Trinity is? I answer, That <hi>the Holy Trinity are i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and entire in themselves, rejoycing from Eternity to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their own Eternal fulness, compleatness and absolute Perfection.</hi> They wanted not the Eternal World, nor the Essences of Eternal Nature, nor the Angelical Creation, for they were compleat in their own enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without them. Wherefore <hi>the Eternal World and Eternal Nature were not created out of necessity, as if the Holy Trinity had stood in need of them</hi>; for they were compleatly perfect and happy before they were, and would continue so, if they were no more.</p>
                     <p>To finish this particular concerning the Nature of the Holy Trinity, I shall add these few lines, for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explanation of what the Nature of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is. I have formerly told you that the Essence of the Trinity is Eternal Unity, which Eternal Unity is pure Deity, and now come to tell you, <hi>That this Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Nature, is nothing else but Love:</hi> in which Love the Holy Trinity stand united, and are nothing else but <hi>Divine Love.</hi> And therefore in the Eternal World, in pure Eternal Nature, and in the Angelical World, there is no other manifestation but that of <hi>Love</hi>: because the Holy Trinity who manifest themselves in these Worlds Principles are themselves nothing but <hi>Love.</hi> Thus we see that the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have exalted the <hi>Love</hi>; to be the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the ending Essence of all Essences. We cannot ascend higher than this <hi>Love,</hi> because there is no Essence above, before, or beyond it. For as in Number we cannot pass beyond an Unity, which is first of Numbers; so neither can we, when we speak of Essences, go beyond the <hi>Love-Essence</hi>; which is all in all in the Eternal World, which is the first and the beginning of all Worlds. Oh wonderful, unsearchable and incomprehensible <hi>Love</hi>! Who can find out thy originality? Who can declare thy Generation? Thou wast before all, and wilt be the last of all: and blessed, yea thrice blessed are they who have found thee and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101649:69"/>
thee! We conclude then that <hi>the Nature of the Holy Trinity consists in the Divine Vnity of the Love-Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall conclude this Chapter with this Proposition, That <hi>the Trinity in Vnion with the Eternal World is the first Principle of all Principles:</hi> for there is none before it or beyond it. <hi>This Eternal World</hi> or Globe of Eternity is <hi>enclosed in its own circumference,</hi> and <hi>is therefore called a Principle,</hi> according to the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Principle given hereafter in its proper place more fully.</p>

                     <p>THIS <hi>Eternal World</hi> was called <hi>the Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> at the time when I was taken up to have a view of it.

                     <p>
                        <hi>In this Outward Court</hi> I took notice of <hi>two things,</hi> the first was the <hi>Globe</hi> or circumf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>As concerning the <hi>Globe</hi> it self, we are to take notice that it is <hi>the first and highest of all</hi>; not created by God, but <hi>generated</hi> out of himself: as also that it is <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101649:69"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the second thing which is the <hi>Eye</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the <hi>Center</hi> of this <hi>Globe,</hi> we must know that it represents the <hi>Spirit of Eternity,</hi> which is <hi>God</hi> himself, who is not only the <hi>efficient,</hi> but also the <hi>material, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and final cause of the Globe,</hi> in the Center of which he manifests himself as an <hi>Eye: which essential Eye of</hi> God, <hi>looking into it</hi> self, <hi>and finding nothing besides it</hi> self, <hi>by dilating it</hi> self, <hi>gives a beginning and end to it</hi> self; <hi>which beginning and end entring into, and joyning with one another, do constitute and form the Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                     </p>
                     <p>But if any ask why this <hi>first emanation</hi> of the Spirit of Eternity, was formed into a <hi>round figure,</hi> rather than into any other? I answer, because a round is the <hi>most simple, perfect and comprehensive</hi> of all <hi>Figures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most proper for him who is Simplicity and Perfection it self, and the wonderful all-comprehending All.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have already told you that the <hi>final Cause</hi> of this Globe, is <hi>God himself</hi>; but to speak more particularly concerning the <hi>ends</hi> God proposed to himself in the <hi>Generation of this Globe.</hi>

                        </gap> doth contain seven several Principles, Globes or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of which we shall give you an account here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                     <p>If any one ask, what if it should please God to make more Worlds or Principles than those already brought forth, where would he find room for them?</p>
                     <p>I answer, that the Globe of Eternity is of sufficient Capa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ity to contain not only those Worlds already
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101649:70"/>
formed, but also those that may be formed hereafter: for since the Circumference of this Globe is nothing else but a dilatation of the Eye of Eternity, who can put bounds to the same? Or conclude that the Spirit of Eternity cannot at pleasure further dilate the same to those dimensions, which may be correspondent to his purpose and design?</p>
                     <p>The immense comprehensiveness of this Globe of Eternity doth yet further appear, in that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, <hi>quo ad nos,</hi> the incomprehensible Spirit of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it self, which is far more than its comprehending all Principles and Worlds whatsoever. But you'l say, if the Spirit of Eternity be incomprehensible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, how can it be contained and comprehended by the Globe of Eternity? To which I answer, that such a being is truly and properly said to be incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, which cannot be comprehended or contained by any thing but it self; when we say that God is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, we do not mean that he is not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of and by himself, but only that nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself can comprehend him: now the Spirit of Eternity doth comprehend it self in the Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becaus (as hath been said) the Globe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the dilatation of the Eye.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Property, This Globe of Eternity though it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain several Globes, yet is distinct from them all, and all the Globes contained in it, are distinct from it, and from one another, without any mixture or confusion.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Property, This Globe of Eternity is an Abyssal Globe (for so it was named to me, and the Eye in the Center of it, the Abyssal Eye) that is of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable depth, without bottom or ground; for the Abyssal Eye looking downwards into it self, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but it self, did set a bound to it self. For as God looking upwards with his Eye, found no beginning of himself, and therefore put a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his own heights; so when he looked down
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101649:71"/>
he put an end to his own depth, and by the dilatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Eye put bounds and limits to his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the outward Court of the glorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the King of Kings, whose heighth, depth and breadth is proportion'd and suitable to the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Majesty that resides in it.

                     <p>I now come to speak of the second Particular, <hi>viz. Concerning the Eye placed in the Center of the Globe of Eternity, called by God himself, the Abyssal Eye of Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> This Eye is the Seat of the Spirit of Eternity, which Spirit of Eternity is God himself, as he subsists in his own pure simple abstracted Essence, before his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101649:71"/>
introducing of himself into the principle of Eternal Nature. It is the Name which God gave to himself, those other Names which are made mention of in Scripture, do for the most part express God only as he stands related to the Creature, but this Name <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Eternity,</hi> expresseth only his relation to the Globe of Eternity, of which he is the former, by immediate Emanation from himself.</p>
                     <p>If you ask me, why did the Spirit of Eternity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce himself into the Eye?</p>
                     <p>I answer, it was for manifestation of himself, as hath been said already.</p>
                     <p>But if you ask me further, why was the Eye just placed in the Center of the Globe of Eternity?</p>
                     <p>I answer, that thereby it might appear, that the Spirit in the Eye, was the generator of the Globe of Eternity; for the natural formation of a Globe or Sphear is by the Center's dilating and expanding of it self: a circumference being nothing else, but a center dilated, or a central emanation bounded by it self.</p>
                     <p>For the further illustration of the Nature of this Eye, I will present you with these following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. This Abyssal Eye is but one, not two or more, even as every Circle or Sphear hath but one Center, and as the beginning of all numbers is an Unity not two, three, &amp;c. and so it must needs be, because it is the manifestation of the Spirit of Eternity, who is the most perfect and absolute Unity and Simplicity: For as there not two Gods, that is two Eternal Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but one only; so there is but one Eye, in and by which the one God, who is the Spirit of Eternity, doth manifest himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. This Abyssal Eye, is the first Being of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, none before it nor beyond it; for it is nothing else but the first manifestation of the Spirit of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, therefore nothing can be before it, even as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101649:72"/>
nothing is, or can be before the Spirit of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. This Abyssal Eye is distinguishable from the Globe of Eternity, because as hath been said, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Eternity in the Abyssal Eye is the generator o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p n="4">IV. This Abyssal Eye, is Gods all-seeing and all-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eye: it is the Wonder-Eye of God, which search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all things and from which nothing is hid. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hings before they come to pass. For I do not in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which the forementioned places of Scripture do not determine.</p>
                     <p>My second ground, why I cannot fully come over to this assertion, is, because this way of knowing all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hins at one single act, is altogether unintelligible to Creatures as Creatures, and consequently can be of no service or use to them.</p>
                     <p>In the third place it seems most probable to me, since it hath pleased God to introduce his Eye into the Globe of Eternity (which Globe is the Glass of his Wisdom) that God hath set this miroir before his Eye, that in it he might see all things as they come to be represented there, which representation being suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive, his seeing and knowing of them must needs be such also.</p>

                        </gap> we speak not here according to Nature in a figure, but according to the Spirit above Nature in the Divine Character T. Again, he saith expresly that this Eye of the Abyss did form it self into a Globe, and so gave a beginning and end to himself; of which you may see more in the fourth and fifth p. of his fourty Questions. From which words of his it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101649:73"/>
that his Spirit had been taken up into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court of the Abyssal Globe of Eternity.</p>
                     <p>But in the second place, like as the Abyssal Eye by contracting it self into the Center, and shutting up it self, doth constitute the outward Court; so the same Eye opened, and dilating it self throughout the whole Globe makes the inward Court or Holy Place. In the first the Deity hides it self; in this second place, the Deity manifests the Mystery wherein he had wrap'd up himself in the first or outward Court. So that as long as the Eye is shut, the whole Globe of Eternity is the outward Court; but as soon as the said Eye is opened, it is no more the outward but inward Court: for the Deity manifesting himself makes the outward Court to disappear, and instead thereof presents the inward. Wherefore no Spirit can pass at will from the outward Court to the inward, but must wait the opening of the Eye; which as it makes the inward Court, so it can only give an entrance into it, and a sight of all the wonders, heights and depths of the Deity, which by the opening of the said Eye are presented to the Spirit of the mind.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>But you'l ask me what are these deep Mysteries which are made known and manifested by the opening of the Eye of Eternity?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> In answer to which I shall give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of some particulars which, by the opening of the said Eye, were presented to the intellectual sight of my Spirit: not that they were presented all at once, but at several distinct openings, every opening of the Eye presenting a new Mystery concerning the Deity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first Mystery discovered at the opening of the Abyssal Eye, is, the Mystery of the Being and existence of God in himself, before Eternal Nature or any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were; and herein these three particulars are opened,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101649:74"/>First, That God is the Spirit of Eternity, filling the Globe of Eternity with himself, that is, with power. For the further illustration of which we are to know that though God hath several Names given him in the Scripture, yet the most, if not all of them, speak his relation to Eternal Nature, as he hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced himself into it, and clothed himself with it; but this Name the Spirit of Eternity expresseth him only with regard to his solitary and abstracted Being, as he exists in the Globe of Eternity, without any relation to Eternal Nature.</p>
                     <p>Now as God by the opening of the Eye discovers himself to be the Spirit of Eternity, existing in, and filling the Globe of Eternity; so likewise this Spirit of Eternity is manifested to be All-power, Universal Power, and pure act, as the School-men term it, filling the whole and every part of the Globe of Eternity. Here is also discovered that this Spirit of Eternity, as it is All-power, so it is one undivided Power, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Unity without any separation, distinction or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. So as from this manifestation we may define the Spirit of Eternity to be the one total and Universal Power which fills the Globe of Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second particular is this, That the Spirit of Eternity is not only Essential and Substantial in it self, but also the Primary Essence of all Essences, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all Substances. That the Spirit of Eternity is Essential appears, becaus it is all Power, now there can be no power but what is Essential; Power implying Essence in the notion of it, for we cannot conceive of Power without Essence, nor of Essence without Power. It appears also that this Spirit of Eternity is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Essence of all other Essences, because the opening of the Eye discovers this Spirit to be the first Essence, not only in order of time, but also by nature and way of caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lity or efficiency; nothing being above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, or before it. Moreover, as was said before, this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101649:74"/>
Spirit is discovered to be an All-power, a total and universal Power; that is, a Power including and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all Powers, and from whence, as from a fruitful womb, all Powers whatsoever are derived and do proceed; now if this Spirit of Eternity be the Power of all Powers, it must by consequence be the Essence of all Essences, because, as was just now hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the one cannot be without the other. No Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can be without Essence, nor Essence without Power.</p>
                     <p>But you'l say, if the Spirit of Eternity be the first beginning of all things, and the Essence of all Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then it will follow that God is the beginning as well of evil Essences as of Good?</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, first, That when we say that the Spirit of Eternity is the first beginning and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of all Essences, it must be restrained to good Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, actions and motions, which do proceed from the Spirit of Eternity and not those that are evil.</p>
                     <p>In the second place, when we say the Spirit of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is the Essence of all Essences, it must be thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that from the Spirit of Eternity doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the first Eternal beginning of all Essences in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to himself, that is, in relation to the Abyssal Eye, which is himself and from himself; and in relation to his Abyssal Globe, which is himself and from himself: now nothing can be in God but that which is God, and therefore contrary to all evil; for there is no evil originally in himself: therefore they are wholly out that would draw Good and Evil from Gods Eternal beginning of himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> When indeed the opening of the Eye doth only manifest what is shut up in the Eye of the Abyss, and manifesteth nothing that is without the Abyss. Now there being nothing but God himself manifested in the Abyss of Eternity, and no evil Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence being to be found in him, therefore it must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Eye of Eternity doth only manifest God
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101649:75"/>
to be the original of all good Essences and not of evil; becaus the Eye of Eternity cannot manifest that which is not, it being plain that no evil can be in God. Therefore when we say that all Essences proceed from God, it must be restrained to all such Essences as do immediately proceed from God, even such as God is the immediate Author of, and those are only all good Essences; for whatsoever doth immediately proceed from God, the highest Good, must needs be good and no ways evil.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third particular, which the opening of the Eye manifesteth, concerning the Being an existence of God, is this; That the Spirit of Eternity is the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Essence of all Essences; that is, that the Spirit of Eternity is not only the first of all Essences, but also that he subsisteth in and from himself, and oweth his existence to none but himself, as being the only origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of self.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have done with the first Mystery which is discovered to the Spirit of the mind, by the opening of the Eye of the Abyss, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mystery o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> God's being and existence, that he is the only true God and Father of all, who is above all, before all, through all, and in all.</p>
                     <p>The second Mystery which is discovered by the opening of the Eye of the Abyss, is, the Mystery of the Holy Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> how the Eternal Unity brings forth the sacred Trinity, co-eternal, co-essential, co-equal with himself? The Eternal Unity is the Father, who brings forth his Son and Spirit out of himself. Were there no Eternal Unity, there coud be no Trinity; if there were no first, there could be no second or third; were there no Father, there could be no Son or Spirit; and thus you see that the Holy Trinity proceeds from the Eternal Unity.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, how doth this agree with what you said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Spirit of Eternity is an
<pb facs="tcp:101649:75"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:101649:76"/>
                        <figure/>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:101649:76"/>
Eternal Unity, and an indivisible power, without duality, diversity and contrariety; whereas now you say that this Eternal Unity hath diversified it self into a Trinity?</p>
                     <p>I answer, that the opening of the Eye of the Abyss doth reconcile this seeming contradiction: for at the disclosing of the Eye, the Spirit of the mind clearly sees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat the Holy Trinity is one with the Eternal Unity; becaus they are one in another and proceed one from another, and do not exist severally in distinction from, or without one another: for thus the indissoluble band of God's Eternal Unity would be broken and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisibility taken away. But here it appears that the Eternal Unity abides indivisible, notwithstanding that the Holy Trinity proceeds from it; becaus they subsist one in another, the Son and Spirit subsisting in the Eternal Unity of the Father.</p>
                     <p>Further we must know that though Unity doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lude all manner of Contrariety, yet it may consist with Harmonious variety: now the Father is not contrary to the Son and Spirit, nor they to the Father, but their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ariety is harmonized in Unity.</p>
                     <p>Again though Eternal Unity cannot consist with an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bsolute distinction, division and separation, such as is between things which subsist independently of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nother; yet it may consist with such a distinction, as is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound in things which are one in another and cannot be without one another, as being united in the root of Unity.</p>
                     <p>For the illustration of which look upon the figure in the Margent, the round Circle

Thus the Birth of the Holy Trinity is manifested, in the opening of the Eye, to be a Trinity in Unity: the Eye is in the Heart, and the Heart is the Eye's Center, and the Spirit is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Spirit from the Eye and Heart; and thus they are one in another, in one Essence, undivided and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable: the Father is one with the Son, and the Son with the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Union of them both, and abides one with them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We must not think that the Holy Trinity are three distinct origanical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for so they must be three distinct Gods; but we must keep to the Scripture expression, which tells us, <hi>There are Three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, Word and Spirit, and these Three are one.</hi> 1 Iohn 5.7.

                     <p>We next come to speak of the Locality or <hi>Vbi</hi> of the Holy Trinity, which according to the foregoing figure, is in the midst or Center of the Abyssal Globe: When the Eye is closed or shut up, then neither the Eye of the Father, nor the Son's Heart, the Glory of the Eye, nor the breathing forth of the Spirit from both is to be seen, but are all shut up in the Eye; but when the Eye opens, then the Heart of the Son, and the Holy Ghost are seen; so that when the Eye of the Unity in the Center opens, then the blessed Trinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes visible in the midst of the Abyssal Globe, being otherwise shut up and concealed in the Eternal Unity of themselves. Thus the Trinity is hid in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Unity of it self, and from that Unity they proceed and become visible in the opening of the Eye.

Neither do I in this speaking oppose or disparage the Holy Scriptures; if my subject were to speak of the Fall, and the Redemption of sinners by Christ, then I should not be wanting to confirm my writing from Scripture; but as long as I am writing of the solitary being of God in the Globe of Eternity, the Spirit of God in the Eye must be my Guide and Witness in stead of the Scripture.

Words or Images, manifest or discover these Attributes to us, but themselves only are the manifesters and revealers of themselves; and the Spirit of God alone hath the Key to unlock the Eye, at the opening of which they are clearly and lively manifested. So that this writing can do no more but point you to the place, where they may be intellectually seen and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. We proceed now to the fourth opening of the Abyssal Eye.</p>
                     <p>The fourth opening of the Abyssal Eye, discovers and manifests the Eternal faculties of the Godhead, <hi>viz.</hi> his Intellect, Will and Divine Senses, under which are comprehended his Wisdom, Praescience and Omniscience, all which faculties subsist in God, and are inseperable from him, and are himself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot manifest himself in the Abyssal Globe without them.</p>
                     <p>But you will say that these faculties, as likewise the Senses of Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling and Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are only attributed to God to comply with our weakness, and to make him intelligible to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, not that there are any such faculties or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in God, but only by way of Analogy and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, That all the forementioned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and senses are most really and truly in God, even far more really than they are or can be in any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for in him they are originally and in truth, and in the Creature only by way of participation, and by way of Analogy and resemblance. So that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, Will, Wisdom, Hearing, Seeing, &amp;c. are in God Primarily, Essentially, and by way of Eminence; and in the Creature only derivatively, and by way of resemblance, as the Copy resembleth and expresseth its original.</p>

                     <p>But you will further object, That by attributing these Faculties and Senses to God we seem to espous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To take away this objection, I shall declare to yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the opinion of the Anthropomorphites, by which it will appear how far I am from asserting their Errors in this writing.</p>
                     <p>First, It is to be noted, that the Anthropomorphites attributed these Faculties to God, more Humane, after the manner of Men, that is according as they are in Men, and thereby framed God after the Image of a Man: but we attribute these Faculties and Senses to God after a Divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

as he is a Spirit, and is such a perfect Unity in himself, that all his Faculties and Senses, are one with himself, and with one another, as hath been before declared.</p>
                     <p>All these Faculties and Senses forementioned are seated in the Center of the Eye, even as the Eye is seated in the midst of the Abyssal Globe; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly when the Eye is shut up they are hid, and are manifested when it opens and displays it self, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be Essential Powers, and Faculties subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Eye, being one with it, and therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely inseperable from it.</p>
                     <p>We now proceed to a further consideration of the Nature of this Eye; concerning which our first asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, That the Abyssal Eye is the Head-Eye of the Spirit of Eternity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not that God is to be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to have an Organical Head like Men; but it is therefore called God's Head Eye, becaus in this Eye is the seat of the Head-Powers of the Deity, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and Will, and the senses of Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting and Feeling; which by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of what is in the Deity, are all seated in the Head of Man and other inferiour Creatures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides as the Head in Man governs all the Members, by reason of the Intellect and Will seated there, which are the ruling Powers of Man: so the Eye and ruling Powers in the Eye, do rule and govern throughout the whole Deity.</p>
                     <p>The second thing which I assert concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Eye is,</p>
                     <p>That this governing Abyssal Eye is God's Face; for when this Eye doth open fully upon us, then it is that we see God, Face to Face, that is, clearly as he is in his own Essence, and without any vail or covering whatsoever. When this Eye beam's forth its brightness upon the Spirit of the Mind, then God's Face is said to shine upon us; and again the shutting of the Eye is that

                     <p>If you inquire of me, why the Heart was generated out of the Eye?</p>
                     <p>I answer, That the Eye did therefore generate the Heart, that it might have a place to dwell and rest in; a subject in which it might rule and govern, and a medium through which it might conveigh the Spirit of Life.</p>
                     <p>But you'l say to which of the Trinity doth this Heart belong?</p>
                     <p>I answer, It is the Heart of the total Godhead; for as the Trinity hath but one Eye, so likewise they have but one Heart between them. Yet notwithstanding when we speak of the Trinity with distinction, the Heart is attributed to the second Number of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as being the manifestation of the Son of God.</p>

                     <p n="2">II. The second Particular discovered is, What this Eternal Heart of God is, and its Nature and Office in the Holy Trinity. The opening of the Eye manifests this Heart to be the Essential Heart of God, generated by himself, out of himself, and for himself; and therefore is himself, as being co-essential, and co-equal with him; all pure Deity, all Holy, all Pure, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But more especially the opening of the Eye doth discover, this Heart of God to be of a flowing Nature like to the Sea, without bottom or bounds; it is like a spring in a Fountain, and bubbling Well which can
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101649:82"/>
never be drawn dry; it is in a perpetual motion, and in this motion there is a perpetual communication of it self, from it self, through it self, to it self; and this out-flowing of the Heart, is nothing else but the original Divine Purity, Righteousness and Holiness. This Heart of God is the overflowing Sea of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which flows from himself, that is, from his own original Purity, Righteousness and Holyness, and flows into, and fills the whole Eternal Abyss, with its fulness: it is so immense in its flowings forth, that the deep Abyss of the Eternal Globe would not be able to contain it, but that the Spirit of the Eye, by his Omnipotency sets bounds and limits to the out-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his own Divine Nature. The out-goings of the Deity, are deeper than the Abyss, and broader than the Abyss, but the Spirit of Eternity saith to the out-flowing of his own Ocean Deity, thus far go, and no further, be ye bounded within the Circumference of the Abyss. And this out-flowing Ocean of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is, by the opening of the Eye, manifested to be a clear, transparent mist or vapor, filling the whole Deep of the Abyssal Globe. This sight from the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Abyssal Eye, is a lively, spriteful, rejoycing, triumphing and amazing sight, and cannot be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in dead words or letters, neither can any Idea, form or likeness fully represent it, as it discovers it self by the opening of the Eye. O ye seekers of the Divine Mysteries, when your Spirits are let in, to a sight of this Divine Mist, then you will understand what this pen hath written.</p>
                     <p>Having spoke something concerning the Nature of this Heart of the Deity, come we now to speak of the function o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> office of this Heart in the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first office of the Heart is this, To be the fixed center and fountain of the out-going, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Ocean of the Deity. Hence this Heart is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101649:83"/>
an ever rising, bubling, spring of living waters, which fails not: becaus the fulness of the Deity is continually flowing and streaming forth from this Heart, and returning to the same again. This Heart is a golden pipe of conveiance by which the fulness of the Deity is conveyed from it self, through it self, to it self, and there is fixed as a center or middle point in the midst of the Holy Trinity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second office of this Heart of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is, to be the Center, Fountain, and Treasury of Life in the Deity: for as the Heart is the Fountain of Life in Man, and all other living Creatures; even so is this Heart of the Holy Trinity, the Spring and Center of the Essential Life of the Godhead.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third and last office of this Essential Heart of God is, to bear the express Image and likeness of the whole Deity: for as this Heart is the Center and Spring from whence the Divine Nature continually streameth forth, and to which it returneth again; and as it is the seat and Center of Life to the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so it must needs be the express Image and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of the whole Godhead: for God's Life flows from this his Essential Heart, and his Divine Nature flows from his Life, through his Heart; and his Image being nothing else but an outward expression of his Life and Nature, therefore the Image of the Total Deity must needs be impressed upon the Essential Heart of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The third Particular discovered concerning the Heart of God, by the opening of the Eye of the Abyss, is the manifestation of all that which is shut up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> contained and comprehended in it; and they are there, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nature of God, his Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and his Essential affections.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the first place therefore, the opening of the Eye shews, that the Divine Nature is contained in this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101649:83"/>
Essential Heart of God; which Divine Nature is a perfect Unity and Simplicity, without the least mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of contrariety: for though the Scriptures and other Divine writers speak of Love and Anger in God, yet we must not think that they speak of God as he exists in the Globe of Eternity, for there he is nothing but a perfect Unity, without any duality or contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatsoever; but they attribute these opposite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God, as he hath introduced himself into the divided properties of fallen Nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for in them he is angry and fierce against sin and ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> thing that is opposite to his own Holy, Pure, Divine Nature, which is the most perfect Unity and Simplicity. The Nature of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d as it is a most perfect Unity, so it is also unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and unchangeable; becaus that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly one cannot be subject to any change or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which always proceeds from Duality and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. Having thus declared that the Divine Nature is a perfect unchangeable Unity and Simplicity, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving elsewhere told you that this Divine Nature, from the opening of the Eye is manifested in the form of a clear transparent mist; if you should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urther inquire of me, what this Divine Nature is? I must tell you, that this Divine Nature is nothing else but Love. And accordingly the Scripture tells us, <hi>That God is Love, and that he that lives in Love, lives in God, and God in him.</hi> And this Love is seated in the Essential Heart of God, from thence it stream's forth, and thither it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again: and therefore it is called God's flaming Heart, becaus the Essential Love doth continually burn and flame in it. This Eternal Love, which is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Nature of God, is a most pure Virgin, it is Love without lusting or desire; it wills and acts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in the Will of God, and is guided by the Eye in all its out goings. What pen can express the high purity of this Eternal Love? It is the Eternal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, being free from all things, it is a meer passive
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101649:84"/>
nothing. The Essential Love of God is said to be meerly passive in relation to its own motion, for it acts not but is acted only by and from the Spirit of the Holy Trinity. It cannot mingle with any thing of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contrary to it self, and indeed with nothing but with its own purity: neither can any thing touch it, for then its Virginity and Purity might be defiled. In this consists the High Liberty of Love's Nature, it is free from all things, and all things free from it; it toucheth nothing, neither doth any thing touch it. No wonder that St. <hi>Paul</hi> cries out concerning this Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Love of God, <hi>O the heighth, depth, breadth and length of the Love of God, which passeth knowledge</hi>! For its dimensions are equal to the Abyssal Globe, this Love being the fulness of God, which filleth it throughout. I have declar'd to you the Mystery of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is nothing else but Eternal Love; but if you should further persist to enquire of me, what this Eternal Love is? I must tell you, that it is as a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nothing to us, becaus it is beyond all humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and knowledge, and we can only say of it, that it is, what it is; an Angel's Tongue being not able to express what this Eternal Love is.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, how can this Love be termed the unchangeable Nature of God, when we are told from the Scriptures, that God is angry, and fierce against sin and evil?</p>
                     <p>For answer to this, I must only put you in mind of what I said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that when I say, that Eternal Love is God's unchangeable Nature, I speak of God, as he exists in himself in the Globe of Eternity, before Eternal Nature; but when Anger and Severity are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God, then the Divine Nature is considered as cloath'd upon with the properties of Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but we speak of God here in his own primary abstracted Being, which is nothing else but Eternal unchangeable Love.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:101649:84"/>2. In the next place, the opening of the Eye shews that the Image of God is contained, and shut up in his Heart; for since the Divine Nature doth continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow from, and return again to this Essential Heart of God as its Center, and Spring; and since the Image of God is nothing else but the expression and manifestation of his Nature, therefore this Image must needs be impressed on the Heart of God, which is the very Center of his Divine Nature. And therefore this Heart of God is called the face of God, becaus it is the true and living expression and representation of God, the Essential Image and likeness of the total Deity.</p>
                     <p>But you will object, that the Scriptures of Truth tell us, that God hath no Image.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, that indeed God hath no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical outward Image resembling that of Angels or Men; and thus the Scripture is to be understood when it tells us that God hath no Image. But the Scripture doth not contradict God's having an Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inward form or Image, according to which Image we are told, in the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t God created Man. <hi>Let us create Man in our own Image, and after our own likeness.</hi> If we ask what this Image of God is, and wherein it doth consist? The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> will tell us, that it consists <hi>in knowledge, righteousness and true Holyness</hi>; and to comprehend all this in one word, this Essential living Image of God, is nothing else but Eternal Love; this is God's Nature, this is his Image, and this is All in All in the Deity, considered in his solitary and abstracted being, before the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of himself into the properties of Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now from this Eternal Love do flow and beam forth all those Eternal excellencies and virtues, which together with the Love do compleat this Divine Image; such are the Wisdom, Righteousness, Holyness and Goodness of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101649:85"/>Now that the Image of God doth consist in these, the Scripture will inform us, if we compare <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 10. with <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.24. so that we see that God's Image doth not consist in his infinity, immensity and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence; but in his Divine Virtues proceeding from Eternal Love, <hi>viz.</hi> Wisdom, Righteousnes, and true Holyness.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third and last thing, which the opening of the Eye discovers to be hid and contained in the Heart of God, are the Divine Affections and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p>But you will object, and tell me that God hath no Affections nor Passions, as being immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in his unchangeable Nature of Love?</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, in the first place, that it is true God hath no Passions or Affections like to those which are in Men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There are no evil, and unordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in God.</p>
                     <p>But in the third place, I say God hath Divine and Godlike affections, such as become the Deity, and are suitable to the perfection of his Nature.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, God hath such affections, as are always in Harmony and Unity, without any contrariety or opposing of each other.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, God's affections are at the greatest distance from all weakness and imperfection whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>In the sixt and last place, God's Affections and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions do all flow from his essential Heart of Love, and are all rooted and centred in the same.</p>
                     <p>These Affections contained in the Heart of God, are chiefly these three, Love, Ioy and Delight: For God eternally Loves himself, rejoyceth in himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in himself; neither can God any more cease to Love himself, or to rejoyce and delight in himself than he can cease to be; therefore these are the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and inseperable affections of the Divine Being.</p>

The fourth and last Particular, which the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eye discovers concerning the Heart, are God's Divine Qualities, Virtues and Excellencies; which do all proceed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om the Heart of God, as from their Source and Center; and they are these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> his Love, Purity, Truth, Faithfulness, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness, Goodness, Perfection, Righteousness and Holyness. These are the Essential inseparable Virtues and Perfections of the Divine Nature; for they proceed from himself, subsist in himself, and are himself, and from the opening of the Eye are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to be such. Neither doth this variety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in God in the least destroy, or take away his most absolute Unity and Simplicity; becaus they all proceed from one root, and stand all united in the same, as one, which root is Love; in which all the Excellencies and Perfections of the Divine Nature stand Harmoniz'd in Unity, and are but as one Virtue and Perfection.</p>
                     <p>Having thus treated of the several Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Heart of God, I shall next proceed to a view of some particulars which are not contained in God's original Essence; and that from a hint of the Spirit, which said expresly to me, search diligently, what is not to be found in the original Essence of God: I did accordingly, and I found, that no pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy, nor vindictive Iustice, nor Wrath, nor Death, nor Curse, neither any Anguish, Sorrow, Darkness, Evil, or Elements, were to be found in the solitary abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Essence of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>I say, first, no pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>doning Grace or Mercy; becaus there was nothing besides himself, and consequently no Object which stood in need of Pardon or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.</p>
                     <p>No vindictive Iustice; becaus no object capable of punishment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:101649:86"/>No Anger nor Wrath; for God could not be Angry with himself; for so contrariety and enmity would be found in the bosom, and Center of Eternal Unity and Simplicity.</p>
                     <p>No Death; for the Deity is a living God, yea life it self, and the Author of it, wheresoever it is.</p>
                     <p>No Anguish nor Sorrow; becaus God is the Highest and Chiefest Good, and consequently must needs be All-triumphing joy, All-delight, All-pleasure.</p>
                     <p>No Darkness; becaus God is all Light, Light it self, and the Source and Center of it.</p>
                     <p>No Elements; becaus the Deity is the most perfect and absolute Unity and Simplicity without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or composition whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>But you will object, that I seem to reject Gods vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Iustice, and to deny his Anger against Sin and Sinners.</p>
                     <p>I answer not at all; for I do not simply deny God's vindictive Iustice and Wrath, but only say, that none of these are to be found in the solitary and primary Being of the Deity, and are only attributed to him, forasmuch as he hath introduced himself into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Eternal Nature. And thus much shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to have spoken concerning the Discovery and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation, which the opening of the Eye gives of the essential Heart of God.</p>
                     <p>But in the next place, as the opening of the Eye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it self and the Heart, so it likewise manifests the Deity of the Holy Ghost to be the exit or outgoing emanat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the first place, I say that those <hi>Images and Figures</hi> which the opening of the Eye Manifests <hi>are not Shadows</hi> and Empty representations, <hi>but</hi> Reall and Substantial ones, they are <hi>not</hi> only figures <hi>of</hi> Heavenly things, <hi>but</hi> the Heavenly things themselves.</p>

For though in Eternal Nature, in the Darkness the Eye of the Father appear dark, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible; and contrary, in the Light, shining pleasant and full of Love; yet the <hi>Eye is not changed by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus we see that the Eye by its opening of it self doth clearly discover to us, that <hi>the one only true God, who is the Spirit of Eternity, hath brought forth himself into a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and End, into matter and form, into Corporeity and Figure,</hi> (in <hi>the sense as hath been before expressed, else it may seem harsh to common Philosophers,</hi>) who without the

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the first of these, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> and titles which were expresly given to this third Court by the Spirit of God, they are these following: it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Still Eternity, and that by reason of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Rest, Silence and Stilnenss which Eternally dwells in this third Court; for as the outward Court was called the Globe of Eternity, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court the deep Abysse or Abyssal Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101649:89"/>
so the third Place of Purity is called the still E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, because nothing but Eternal Rest, Silence and Stilness is to be perceived by those who live in this most Holy Place. This Holy Place is not the Trinity but distinct from it, and is the still Eternity in which the holy simplified Spirits live. It was also called the Chamber of State, the presence Chamber of the Spirit of Eternity, the King of Kings, where his unexpressibly glorious Majesty is to be seen. Besides it was called the Rock of wonders, with reference to those wonders which do appear in it, of which we shall speak in the third particular.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second particular is what the <hi>Nature</hi> and condition of this place is, and this is hinted to us in the Name which is given to it by the Spirt of God; for Names ought to express the Nature of the thing which they signifie, and the whole excellency of Names con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this: Now we cannot imagine but that those Names by which the Holy Spirit doth call any thing have all the excellence and truth which a Name is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and consequently must very properly and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly express the Nature of the thing, named; the name of this third Place you have heard is the still Eternity, and consequently have reason to conclude that the Essentiall difference of this Place is the Majestick silence and awful stillness with which it is continually filled. This is such a stillness as surpasseth, not only all expressions, but likewise all thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and because of this Majestick silence, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressibly awful stillness this most Holy Place is also called the Presence-Chamber of the Deity; this superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural silence and stillness being the ornament, state and pompe of it, to which all the Glory and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of Monarchs here is but as a shadow or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third particular is the <hi>Wonders</hi> which are to be seen in this place, in respect of which, as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101649:89"/>
before, it was called the Rock of wonders; and these wonders are five in number, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>first wonder</hi> which manifests its self in this Rock of wonders is the <hi>Spirit of Eternity,</hi> or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Unity, which doth fill the total deep Abysse with it self, that is, with all Power. Here the <hi>Spirit of Eternity</hi> discovers its self to be the first and original Power, the Power of all Powers, yea All-power it self. And this manifestation of the <hi>Spirit of Eternitie's</hi> being All-power, is more full, magnificent and glorious in <hi>the stil Eternity</hi> than in the inward or outward Court, where the Deity doth also discover himself to be All-sufficient and Omnipotent, but not in that Sovereignty and Majesty with which he appears to the Eye of the Mind in this his presence-Chamber. Here the Glory of the All-power of the Deity is seen Nakedly, openly and without a veile, eye to eye, and face to face; the sight of which doth cause ravishing Extasies, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible Ioys, and transporting admiration to fill the heart of the beholder; it being a sight so glorious as no words can express, nor no thoughts represent to the mind, as being beyond all comprehension.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>second wonder</hi> in this Rock of wonders, the still Eternity, is the Holy and ever blessed Trinity, Father Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>First then say, I that this <hi>Power</hi> of the Father is no personal power, for nothing of personality is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>still Eternity,</hi> only a Uniform, Universal diffusive Power in the appearance of the greatest bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness fills it throughout.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither is this Power of the Fathers any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Image resembling that of Angels or men, having distinction of parts and members, for nothing of this kind can be found in the Eternal Unity of the Father's All-power. And thus much shall suffice to have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning the <hi>Father,</hi> who is <hi>the First</hi> in the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> We now proceed to the second, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of the Father.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Son</hi> is an <hi>Essential power immediately generated by the Father, out of his own divine Essence</hi>: and therefore he is co-essential and co-equal with the Father. For the <hi>Son's power</hi> dilateth and co-extendeth it self in, with and through the Father's power, to the utmost bounds and limits of the <hi>still Eternity,</hi> and filleth the deep Abysse with his own <hi>Power's,</hi> in the Father's Power, as being co-essentiall and co-equall with the Father. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain this <hi>Power of the Son</hi> is also the <hi>co-eternal</hi> with the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101649:90"/>
Father: for though the Father may be said to be before the Son in order of Nature, forasmuch as he is the generator of the Son, yet <hi>we cannot say</hi> that <hi>the Father is before the Son as to priority of time,</hi> for the Son exists from all Eternity at once, and together with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore is the Eternal Son of the Father. If you would further know what this <hi>generated Power</hi> of the Son is, I say it <hi>is an Eternal Vnity,</hi> and <hi>pure Deity</hi> even <hi>as the Father's Power is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for the further opening of <hi>what the Son of God is,</hi> you may take notice of these <hi>following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the <hi>first</hi> place the <hi>Son of God is</hi> the <hi>first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> of the Father; He is the first born of all Beings, as being that Essentiall word, Co-eternal with the Father, <hi>by whom the Father made all things, and without whom nothing was made. By him were all things created whether they be in Heaven, or on Earth, whether visible or invisible, whether Thrones or Dominions, Principalities or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must needs be before them all, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the first begotten of the Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> this <hi>Son of God is the only begotten</hi> Son of the Father: all other Sons whether Angels or men receive their filiation or sonship from this only begotten Son of the Father, and are called Sons forasmuch as they part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke of, and are centred in this only begotten Son: they are Sons in and because of this only begotten Son, and beloved in the only beloved of the Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this <hi>Son is the Co-essentiall Son of the Father, of the same essence and nature with the Father:</hi> now the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Father is Purity, Holiness, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Meekness, Love, Goodness and Perfection, and such is the Son's <hi>nature also,</hi> and therefore the Son is called the <hi>Brightness of his Father's Glory, and the expresse Image of his subsistence:</hi> But <hi>the Image of the Father is no organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Image,</hi> but <hi>consists in Light, Life and Love:</hi> The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101649:91"/>
Father is all <hi>Light,</hi> and in him is no darkness at all; he is all <hi>Life,</hi> and in him is no Death; he is all <hi>Love,</hi> and in him is no <hi>Wrath</hi>; and the Son being the co-essential Son of the Father, must also be all Light, all Life and all Love. Thus the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father; <hi>Neither is the Nature of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son distinguishable in the still Eternity,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Father is not severe and wrathfull, and that of the Son, sweet, milde and gentle, for <hi>this is no way consistent with the one simple nature of the Deity.</hi> The Father is all Light, Life and Love in the <hi>Son's Nature,</hi> and the Son is all Light, Life and Love in the <hi>Father's Nature:</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Father flows from himself, ar the Fountain-head and spring, into the Son, and from the Son again into the Father; and therefore the <hi>Son</hi> is called the <hi>Heart of the Father; because he is the fixed Seat of the Father's Light, Life and Love.</hi> Thus we see that <hi>neither Angels nor Saints are in this degree codeisied and consubstantiated with the Father,</hi> for he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the <hi>still Eternity</hi> with the Light, Life and Love of his Essentiall Deity in co-equality with the Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this <hi>Son, is the well beloved Son of the Father,</hi> the Son of his Loves, in whom he is fully well pleased satisfied and delighted. And indeed how can it be otherwise? since he is one being and one nature with the Father, the very Heart of the Father, and his expresse Image; when he is the Beauty, Brightness and Excellence of his Father's Glory, and exalted to an equality of honour and dominion with the Father, as sitting in the same Throne with the Father, and possessing the kingdome with him. This is the Son whom the Father will have honoured and worshiped as himself, and to whom the Father hath committed all Iudgment, neither can the one be worshiped without the other, they subsisting in each other. This is the Son who is exalted by the Father to be Heir of all things.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>fifth</hi> place this <hi>Son is the Essential Christ of God.</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:101649:91"/>
I would not have you stumble at this Expression, I might indeed haue omitted it, but for the matters sake: for you must take notice that I speak here of the Holy Trinity, as they exist without Nature, and in this state the Son of God cannot properly be called the Christ that is, the Anointed; because thus considered he is not Anointed to any office, for it is after his entring into the properties of Nature, that he is Anointed to be the Mediator: yet bear with me for using this word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, because I do it only for this end to give you a more clear and distinct knowledge of what the Son of God is as he exists before Nature, as well as what he is in the properties of <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you'l ask of me, why I speak of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of, and before <hi>Nature,</hi> and particularly, why I speak of the <hi>Essential Christ of God as existing before Nature?</hi> I answer that my speaking of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and particularly of the second person, who is the Christ of God, as he exists before <hi>Nature,</hi> is only in order to give you a more distinct knowledge of the Son and Christ of God <hi>in Nature,</hi> and to enable you to distinguish between his being out of Nature, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence in the properties of Nature.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Essentiall Christ is one with the Father,</hi> it is who is the same yesterday, to day and forever, even before all time and before <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> and he is the Co-creation with the Father: He is the Word, Wisdome, Power, the Light, Life, Love, the Heart, Reighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Purity, Brigtness, Excellency and Glory of the Father in the Father: for we must not conceive of him as a distinct Person from the Father, because that would destroy the High Unity and Simplicity of Divine Nature, which admits of no composition, or division: nor on the other side must we conceive the Son of God to be only a distinct denomination, for we see that in <hi>the still Eternity,</hi> there is a distinct repersentation of the Son, from that of the Father, and the Holy Ghost:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101649:92"/>
For the Son is represented in the Image of an Heart, the Father of an Eye, and the Holy Spirit in the stream or emanation which issueth from both.</p>
                     <p>But you will say, is then this Christ the Son of God the Redeemer, Saviour, Iustifier and <hi>Reconciler of Mankind</hi>? I answer, that <hi>to speak properly, the Son of God, as he exists out of and before Eternal Nature, is not a Redeemer, Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. and that <hi>because</hi> in this state he hath no relation to any Creature whatsoever; and therefore as long as there was nothing for to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed or saved, he could not properly be called a Redeemer or Saviour.</p>
                     <p>But you'l say this essentiall Christ, the Eternal Son of the Father, is <hi>not the Christian's Christ,</hi> in whom they trust for Redemption, Salvation and Glorification?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I grant that <hi>properly he is not,</hi> first because the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> who, as was said before, is the <hi>out-flowing</hi> power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Father and the Son. It may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the Father's power, in that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers power is the original, primary, fountain-power of the Trinity, without which no Trinity had ever been; whereas the power of the Holy Ghost <hi>is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating</hi> and finishing <hi>Power</hi> which makes the Blessed Trinity perfect and compleat. And it differs from the Son's power, forasmuch as that is <hi>a power begotten</hi> and generated out of the Divine Essence of the Father, but the <hi>Power</hi> of the Holy Ghost is <hi>only a proceeding</hi> out going power, not from the Father only, but from the Father and the Son: it proceeds from the Father <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> as being the fountain-spring of it, and proceeds <hi>Derivatively</hi> through the Son, and for so much as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable from Father and Son; though indeed it be Co-essential, Co-equal and Co-eternal with the Father and the Son; for the Holy Trinity are centred and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the most perfect Unity.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>first</hi> place, I say that the Holy Ghost is <hi>Co-essential</hi> with the Father and the Son, that is, of the same Nature and Essence, being all pure Deity, even as the Father and Son is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> this proceeding power of the Holy Ghost is <hi>Co-equal</hi> with the Father and the Son, for even as the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101649:93"/>
power of the Father and the Son is dilated from the Center to the Circumference of the Abyssal Globe, so likewise is the out-going power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, the power of the Holy Ghost is <hi>Co-eternal</hi> with the Father and the Son, for the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity exist from all Eternity at once, and altogether; and as the Father never was without the Son, nor the Son without the Father, so likewise the Father and Son were never without the Holy Ghost proceeding from them.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, this <hi>out-going power of the Holy Ghost</hi> was manifested to be a bodily power, I do not mean that it appeared as an organical and visible body, capable of division into parts, but as <hi>a body of power fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole circumference of the still Eternity.</hi> Hence it is that this all filling power of the Holy Ghost is called the <hi>Temple and Tabernacle-body</hi> of the Holy Ghost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus as the Father dwelleth in the Son, and the Son in the Father, so both Father and Son dwell in this Body of power of the Holy Ghost, as in a Temple or Tabernacle.</p>
                     <p>But you will object, that here I seem to contradict what I said before, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Abyssal Globe of the still Eternity was the body of Corporeity of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, whereas here I make the all-filling Power of the Holy Ghost to be the Temple-body of the Deity.</p>
                     <p>To which I answer, that <hi>I do not attribute two distinct bodies to the Deity,</hi> for these are as a wheel within a wheel, and as an inward skin covered with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: in like manner the <hi>outward cover</hi> or body of the Trinity is the Abyssal Globe of the still Eternity, but the <hi>inward</hi> covering or Corpor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ity is the all-filling power of the Holy Ghost, and <hi>both make up one Divine Corporeity,</hi> which is the place and Temple of the Holy Trinity. And this is one of those wonders which are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101649:94"/>
manifested in this Rock of wonder's <hi>viz.</hi> that the all-filling power of the Holy Ghost is the <hi>innermost Temple</hi> and Tabernacle-body wherein the Father, Son and Spirit have their mutuall Co-habitation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>last</hi> property of the out-flowing power of the Holy Ghost is this, it is <hi>an Essentiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power,</hi> insomuch as nothing can be effected or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without it. It is by <hi>this acting power</hi> of the Holy Ghost, that Eternal Nature and her forms were brought forth, it is this Power brought all things, all worlds, into act, according to the will of the Father; so that <hi>this Divine body of power,</hi> is the united acting power of the whole Trinity. The Father operates from himself, as being the beginning of power, through the heart of his Son, with and by the acting power of the Holy Ghost; the Son operates from the Father, in himself, by the effecting power of the Holy Ghost, The Holy Ghost worketh from the Father, through the Son, with and by his own effecting power: Thus the Holy Trinity act harmoniously from through and by one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in this Ghostly body of power, which fills all in the still Eternity. <hi>This body</hi> of power is <hi>a most Spiritual,</hi> divine, refined Body, which <hi>nothing can shut out, neither can any thing keep it in:</hi> it is far more refined and subtle then any personal organical body whatsoever of Angels or men; and it is so <hi>infinitely powerful,</hi> that if it were in Hell, <hi>Hell would not be able to keep it,</hi> but it would raise it self thence to Glory, the omnipotency of the Holy Trinity being lodged in it.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have spoken of the Unity in Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> how the Eternal Unity and simplicity manifests it self in Trinity; I shall now come to speak something briefly of the Trinity in Unity, and shew you how the blessed Trinity, as they pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> it. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hint's both these mysteries to us, 1 Iohn 5. 7. <hi>There are three which bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101649:94"/>
and these three are one</hi>: as if he had said, these three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Son and Spirit proceed from one Eternal Unity, and yet they are three distinguishable powers, so as one is not the other from Eternity to Eternity, and can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be confounded together.</p>
                     <p>For first they are distinguished by their names Father Son and Spirit, and this distniction of Names doth necessarily imply some distinction of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are distinguished according to order, the Father first, the Son next, the Holy Spirit last of all.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly by number, as one, two, three, and are therefore well called the Holy number three.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place the Apostle distinguisheth them by their relative properties of Father, Son, and the outgoing Spirit of power.</p>
                     <p>Now after he hath spoke of their distinction, he tells us that notwithstanding all this, these three are one, that is, that they are all centred, and rooted in one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Unity and Simplicity, which is <hi>the pure Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>ial Nature of the Deity.</hi> And indeed if the Holy Trinity were not thus centred in the most perfect Unity, they would be three distinct Deities, which is contrary to the Christian faith and divine Revelation. No, <hi>the Holy Trinity have but one Divine Nature, one Eye, one Heart, one Body of power between them, for to dwell in.</hi> And thus much shall suffice to have spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the second wonder, which is to be seen in the still Eternity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity: though no words are able to express the Majesty and transparent Clarity of this Sight as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it self in the still Eternity, where the Trinity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:101649:95"/>The <hi>Third Wonder</hi> which was presented to my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual sight was <hi>God's Wisdom,</hi> concerning whom I shall speak under these three heads.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>First I shall speak of the Birth and Nativity of the Wisdom of God.</item>
                        <item>Secondly of its Nature.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly and lastly of its office.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. First then, as to the Birth and Nativity of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we are are to know that it spring's and flows from God's Eternal Eye, as from its Eternal root and original, and here it is fixed as in its proper seat and center; for it is by this Wisdom, that all all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and motions of the Deity are most wisely Ordered, conducted and governed, for it proceeds from and is seated in the same Eye with his desiring mind, and willing will, these three are in one another and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate through one another, and make up but one inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, indivisible power. I say they <hi>all three exist i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> the Eye as one power, yet distinguishable, and without the least disorder or confusion</hi>; the first is the wisdom, then the mind, and next the will; for as the wisdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Eye, so the mind proceeds from the wisdom, and the will from the mind. And thus much for the birth and Nativity of Wisdome.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I come now in the next place to speak of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head, <hi>viz.</hi> what the <hi>Nature of the Wisdom is</hi>: I say then, that the Divine Wisdom is a flowing, moving power, a moving motion immediately proceeding from God's Eternal Eye. God's Wisdom is a bright ray, or glance issuing from the Eye of Eternity: therefore she is termed the brightness or Clarity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and a pure breath or efflux from the Majesty of the Almighty. We can say nothing of her but that <hi>She is the brightness and glance of the Eye of Eternity</hi>;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101649:95"/>
who as she proceeds from the Eye, so she is moved by, and only by the same; for she is a meer passive bright shining virtue, that swiftly passeth through and pierceth all things, by reason of her high purity and subtilty, which can be compared to nothing better, than to a lustrous shining glance, being perfectly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and moving only according to the motion of the Eye of the Father, which makes her more swift and piercing than any thing whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>But for a further illustration of the Nature of God's Wisdom, I shall a little enlarge my self upon these following Particulars, which are so many Essentiall properties of the said Wisdom.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>I. In the first place this <hi>Wisdom is Co-essential with the Holy Trinity</hi>: Because as hath been said it proceeds from the Trinity, as an outgoing ray, glance or brightness; now nothing doth immediately proceed from God, but <hi>what is of the same nature and Essence with him,</hi> and consequently what can this <hi>bright shining glance</hi> from the Eye of the Majesty be else, but pure Deity, as proceeding from, and fixed in the Eye of Eternity.</item>
                        <item>II. The second Essential property of this <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> is this, that she <hi>is Co-eternal</hi> with the ever-blessed Trinity. <hi>God was never without his wisdom, nor the Eye of Eternity without this glance and bright ray which proceedeth from it</hi>; for else God could not have been an All-wise and All-knowing God. Therefore <hi>according to order of time the Divine wisdom, is Co-eternal with the Holy Trinity,</hi> though in order of Nature and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Holy Trinity are before <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a passive effiux from the ever-blessed Trinity.</hi> Wherefore you are <hi>not</hi> to imagine that the wisdom of God, as she is Co-essential and Co-eternal, <hi>is also Co-equal</hi> with the holy Trinity, <hi>because</hi> as was said before,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101649:96"/>
                           <hi>she is perfectly passive,</hi> and moves not her self, but as the Eye is moved, whereas the Blessed Trinity is all Act, all acting power; <hi>she is indeed said to be a Co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator with the Trinity,</hi> but <hi>yet so as that she moves not, except she be moved,</hi> nor acts except she be acted: <hi>thus far indeed</hi> she may be said in some sense to be <hi>Co-equal</hi> with the Trinity, <hi>forasmuch as she fills with her glance and brightness the whole still Eternity</hi>; but this cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a proper co-equality, because she is wholly passive, and depending of the Trinity. Besides <hi>she is clearly distinguishable from the Eye,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of the Eye,</hi> as being only a brightness, Glance or ray pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it, and is consequently inferior, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the Blessed Trinity.</item>
                        <item>III. The third and last Essentiall property of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom,</hi> is her <hi>Virgin Purity,</hi> which <hi>consists in this, that she is free from all desire, will and motion of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> own.</hi> She desire's and wills nothing, but as the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind, and will, desires and wills in her; she moves not, but as she is moved, and acts not, but as <hi>she</hi> is <hi>acted</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Eternity</hi>; for she is nothing but a bright passive glance from the Eye of Eternity. She is <hi>an Eternal stillness in her self.</hi> She is not the Majesty it self, nor the Eye, but <hi>she is only the beauty, glory, brightness, lustre and glance of the Majesty in the Eye, and that such a transparent clarity and brightness as is without all spot or blemish.</hi> And in a word, She is nothing but perfect, absolute purity, she is a thousand times brighter, and purer than the Sun, and fairer than the Moon, and indeed nothing can be compared to the Excellence of that her Virgin-purity.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But <hi>her pure virginity doth</hi> not only <hi>consist</hi> in this, that she is free from all manner of spot, blemish or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but <hi>especially in this,</hi> that <hi>her bright glance is from all Eternity fixed upon the flaming heart of God's love, which is the Center of the Holy Trinity.</hi> This <hi>flaming
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101649:96"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eart of Love is the sole Object</hi> to which her regard is fastned continually: she receives nothing into her self but this divine Love, from the heart of God. She es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouseth her self to nothing, inclineth her self to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but only to this essential Love, the Word of God, fixed in the Heart of the Deity. Thus <hi>the Holy Trinity have their delight with wisdom, and again the whole joy and delight of wisdom is the flaming Love of the blessed Trinity.</hi> She is exalted above all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of her beauty and immaculate purity; she is the highest purity; <hi>she is purity and virginity in the abstract. She cannot be touched by sin, evil or self,</hi> because she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mix with, nor incline to any thing, but only the essential Love of God. <hi>She is free from all essences whatsoever, being nothing else but the unspotted mirrour of the glory and excellency of God:</hi> and thus we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to you what that pure Virginity is, which is one of the essential properties of God's wisdom.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I now proceed to the third and last head, <hi>viz. What the office of Wisdom is in the still Eternity.</hi> I find that Wisdom dischargeth these two offices, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. She is a revealer of the Mysteries, and hidden wonders of the Deity.</item>
                        <item>2. She is an enlightner of the still Eternity.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>First, As for the first of these, Scripture and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation assure us, That <hi>Wisdom is the revealer and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fester of the unsearchable secrets of God:</hi> she is the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Key of the Eternal Eye, by which all the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Trinity are unlocked. As <hi>the office of the Holy Ghost is to effect and create all things,</hi> so the office of <hi>Wisdom</hi> is to manifest and reveal all things. <hi>She never brings forth any thing, and upon that account also, is called a pure Virgin,</hi> but only discovers and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests whatsoever the Holy Trinity, by their effecting-creating-power, are pleas'd to bring forth. This <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the companion of the Eye of Eternity,</hi> by her out
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101649:97"/>
going glance, revealing the wonders contained in it: She is as an <hi>Handmaid</hi> waiting upon the Holy Trinity, to declare, publish and make known their counsels, secrets and wonders.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The other office of Wisdom is to give Light to the deep Abyss of the still Eternity. <hi>It is Wisdom's bright glance which is the day and light of this most holy mansion,</hi> not a created Light, but <hi>a pure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, in that sence as God is called a Light in whom is no darkness at all,</hi> and no otherwise.</p>
                     <p>But you will object, That <hi>the Holy Scriptures and Divine Philosophers seem to give a different account con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Wisdom than I have here given?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I answer, That I easily grant that the Scriptures of Truth, and holy enlightned Men, have spoken concerning Wisdom after another manner, than here I have done; and the reason of it is plain, for <hi>they speak of Wisdom after the production of Eternal Nature, as Wisdom is introduced into the seven forms of Eternal Nature</hi>: whereas <hi>I speak of Wisdom's existence with the Holy Trinity, in the still Eternity, before ever Eternal Nature was brought forth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth Wonder</hi> (which my Spirit was made to take notice of) <hi>in the still Eternity was the Seven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of God which stand before the Throne of the Holy Trinity.</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth oft make mention of these in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> but he speaks of them there, as they were seen by him on mount <hi>Zion,</hi> in the <hi>New Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> after their being introduced into the working properties of pure Nature; whereas <hi>I treat of them here, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>First, I shall speak of their Number; in the second place, of their Birth and Originality; thirdly, of their Nature; fourthly, of their Office; and fifthly and lastly, of their place in the still Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the first, <hi>viz. their Number,</hi> which is <hi>Seven</hi>; for so they were named to me, the Seven Spirits of God. They do indeed subsist one in another, and through another, and <hi>appear but as one power, yet they are seven in number</hi>; even seven distinguishable powers flowing from, and rooted in the Unity of the Trinity. They were not distinguished to me by their several Names, but only by their Number: <hi>though,</hi> I know, <hi>that as they are in Eternal Nature, they enjoy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. As to <hi>their Birth and Originality,</hi> they spring and proceed from the Temple-body of the Holy Ghost, as well as they have their subsistence in the same: for as <hi>Wisdom</hi> is a beam or glance proceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Eye, and subsisting in the same; so <hi>these seven Spirits,</hi> or <hi>seven lustrous Powers</hi> proceed from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Body of the Spirit, as from their source and original, and subsist in the same, as in their true ground.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third perticular I am to speak to, is the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of these seven Spirits,</hi> which I shall endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you in these following Propositions.</p>

                              <item>1. In the first place, their office and function is <hi>to wait upon the Majesty of the Trinity, in the still Eternity,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101649:98"/>
in the Holiest of all.</hi> They are waiters and attenders on the Majesty of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in the Presence-Chamber of the still Eternity; where these glorious waiters make a great part of the pomp, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <item>2. <hi>Another</hi> office and function of these seven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is <hi>to execute and perform the will of the Holy-Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> whatsoever the blessed Trinity will have done, these can, and do effect in a moment: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too hard, or difficult for them: so that these are the high Princes and officers of the supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, always attending in the most Holy Place, the Presence-Chamber of the Deity, to effect and execute the will and pleasure of the blessed Trinity. <hi>These are those miraculous powers continually assisting before the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Majesty, who have manifested and effected their mighty works of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              <item>3. In the third place, the office of these seven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is <hi>to be the high Princely Councelors of the Divine Majesty:</hi> all the secrets of the Holy Trinity are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them, all their purpose and will is made known to them, for the Holy Trinity doth nothing without them: for they perform and execute all the will and purpose of the Deity.</item>
                              <item>4. In the fourth and last place, their function is this, <hi>they are the high Favourites, Friends and Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the supreme Majesty</hi>; for they are not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in his presence in the most Holy Place, but they are admitted to his most secret, bosom-councels, they are <hi>exalted to a degree next to the Holy Trinity,</hi> which argues the high favour the supreme Majesty hath for them.</item>

Having thus declared to you the office and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of these seven Spirits, I come now to speak of the fifth and last Particular which I was to open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, <hi>viz. the place they have in the still Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> concerning which we are to know, that they are placed <hi>next to the supreme Majesty of the Holy Trinity,</hi> and therefore <hi>are said always to stand before the glorious Majesty of God in the most Holy Place,</hi> not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward Court, but in the Holiest of all, <hi>which is the presence Chamber of the Deity,</hi> where the highest Pomp, Glory and Magnificence of God is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. Here they behold the supreme Majesty, Face to Face, and Eye to Eye; that is, <hi>most clearly</hi> without any veil or similitude whatsoever.</item>

                     <p>I shall now briefly shew you what <hi>these Spirits are not:</hi> they are <hi>no personal Spirits,</hi> as the Angels are, who appear in organical bodies: they are pure simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Spirits, without composition, they resemble the supreme Unity and Simplicity of the Deity, from which they do immediately proceed. Neither can it be otherwise, <hi>for that in the still Eternity nothing but what is pure Spirit and Power is to be found.</hi> It is true St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> represents them as burning Lamps, but he <hi>speaks of them there, not as they exist in the still Eternity</hi>; but as they appear in the properties of pure Nature, where they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You must not think that the Deity is solitary or unatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, except only by those seven Spirits before mentioned, for there are an innumerable number of pure simplified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> that stand ready in all humble resigned obedience, to execute the will, and perform the good pleasure of the Father of Spirits. <hi>As to their number they are ten

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ssential qualifications, properties, and adjuncts</hi>; the explication of which may afford a fuller and clearer understanding of their <hi>Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>In the first place then,</hi> I say, That <hi>these Inhabitants of the still Eternity are most highly simplified Spirits</hi>; which simplicity of theirs consists in this, that they

did immediately proceed from the most simple and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Essence of the Deity; and were not brought forth out of Eternal Nature's Principle as all other Creatures were, which therefore want much of the simplicity and unity of these pure Spirits. <hi>And again,</hi> these Spirits are justly said to be simplified Spirits, in that they have no Souls, or any personal organical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity; but are <hi>meer, pure Spirits,</hi> that is, <hi>nothing but Spirit, all Spirit.</hi> Yet I do not deny but these Spirits <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These <hi>Inhabitants are Intellectual Spirits, that is,</hi> they were endued with understanding and will; for otherwise they could not have resembled the Father of Spirits, neither could they have been capable of knowing, loving and obeying him, and consequently would have been unmeet for the company of the Holy Trinity, in the still Eternity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. These <hi>Spirits are endued with the Spiritual senses,</hi> of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling, whereby they are inabled to discern the object of the still Eternity.

                     <p n="6">6.

In the next place, These <hi>simplified Spirits as to their Number are innumerable</hi> as to us, <hi>though not to the Holy Trinity, to whom their number is exactly known, and who calls them all by their Names.</hi> This innumerable number of Spirits, proceeded (as I told you before) from the overflowing stream of Love's Eternal Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; for when the Father and Spirit moved in the Heart-essence of Love, then the Heart of the Son's Deity opened it self; and then the Love-essence shut up in the Heart, did flow forth as a stream from the Heart-center; out of which essentially the Holy Ghost, in Conjunction with Wisdom, formed this numberless number of simplified Spirits. And this <hi>infinite fulness of the Divine Love might have sufficed to the production of many more of these Spirits, than were brought forth</hi>; therefore <hi>the out-flowings</hi> of this ocean Sea, <hi>what shall I say,</hi> of Eternal Love, <hi>were bounded by God's Will and Wisdom, who brings forth all things in Number, Weight and Measure</hi>; and so were these Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits also produced according to the will and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Holy Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the ninth place, We may consider the <hi>place or Vbi of these Spirits, which is no other than the most Holy Place, the still Eternity; the Heaven of Heavens, differing from the Angelical and all other Heavens,</hi> in that they were brought forth out of Eternal Nature, but this was before, and stands without Eternal Nature: and is <hi>the most Holy Place, and Presence-chamber of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in its own pure abstracted Essence.</hi> But to speak somewhat more particular concerning the place of

<figure/>
that the Eye of Eternity is greater, and these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many lesser Eyes encompassing it round.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you see it represented in the figure which is in the Margin: where the <hi>Great Spot in the midst</hi> deciphers the Eye of Eternity appearing <hi>like the black or sight of an Eye</hi>; and the <hi>lesser spots round about it</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Inhabitants of the still Eternity, exactly resembling the Eye of Eternity, <hi>with this only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi> that they are less than it.

                     <p>Having thus spoken concerning these qualifications and adjuncts of these pure Spirits, I should now draw to a conclusion of this Subject, but becaus some, it may be, will be curious to know <hi>what the manner of living and employment of these Spirits in the still Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is.</hi>

                     <figure/> The Explication of this Figure.</head>
                  <p>THIS Circle represents the Principle of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature, which is the Subject of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>The Black spot in the midst of the Circle, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents God's Eternal Eye, and type's out the Trinity in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101649:115"/>
their Eternal Unity, who have placed themselves in the midst of Eternal Nature's Principle, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and governing of it. And also the Holy Trinity's introducing of themselves into Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The wide space within the Circle type's forth the Chaos or the Abyssal nothing; the ground of all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences and yet no Essence to be seen in it.</p>
                  <p>Now because I have in the foregoing discourse oft made mention of the word <hi>Principle.</hi> without having any where declar'd what I meant by it, I think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this place to give you the signification of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense in which I take it.</p>
                  <p>And in the first place, I shall tell you negatively, in what sense it is not in this place taken by me. By the word <hi>Principle,</hi> I do not understand the first constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beginnings of things, whereof they consist, and from whence they take their Being, in the same sense, in which the four Elements by some, and Salt, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Mercury, by others, are called the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all things.</p>
                  <p>But by a <hi>Principle,</hi> I mean an Original Source, and Fountain-Essence, formed by an Agent, into a Sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Circumference, by which it is distinguished from all others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To explain this definition a little, I say, in the first place, that a <hi>Principle</hi> is an Original and Fountain-Essence: for it is not every Essence doth make a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> but such an one only, as is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fruitful Mother of all the Essences conteined within its own Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Kingdom, and affords them being and sustenance from its own Bowels.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the second place, it is said to be formed by an Agent, becaus a <hi>Principle</hi> of it self is Passive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered without the Active Spirit in the Center, which is the Mover of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:101649:115"/>3. In the third place, you have the form and figure of a <hi>Principle,</hi> a Sphaerical Circumference, which is the common form of all Principles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the last place, you have the end, why a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> is formed into a Sphaerical enclosure, <hi>viz.</hi> that thereby it might be distinguished from all other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Worlds and Centers: for all these are the same with me in this place, and therefore many times one of these is put for the other.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given you the Definition of a <hi>Principle</hi> in general, I shall now subjoyn the particular definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> in these words:

                           <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> is a <hi>Principle</hi> created by God out of the Abyssal Chaos, containing the seven operative powers, for the production of all things.</item>
                        <item>The Genus or general Notion of this definition is the word <hi>Principle,</hi> which but just now we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to you.</item>
                        <item>The difference of this definition contains the four Causes of <hi>Eternal Nature, viz.</hi> the efficient, material, formal and final.</item>
                        <item>The efficient Cause, which is God, is expressed in these words of the definition, created by God.</item>

                        <item>The formal Cause are the seven operative Powers, which the definition tells you, that <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> doth contain.</item>
                        <item>The final Cause of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> is, that it might be the fruitful Mother of all things: which the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expresseth in these words, <hi>for the production of all things.</hi>

                     <head>The Third Head, (Which makes the third Part of this Discourse) What Eternal Nature is.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. THE subject of this Part is concerning Eternal Nature's Essence, it is a most noble Subject to look into. I acknowledge that none could lay a deeper ground, as to this Subject, than divine <hi>Behme</hi> hath done; <hi>yet I find withal that he hath brought it forth something obscurely, so that he is understood by few, and misunderstood by most: This hath moved me to search into the Nature of this Subject for my own private satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the innate light of my own intellect, and the inward discoveries of the Triune Deity to the Spirit of my Soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Third Part I shall confine my discourse to these two general Heads;
<list>
                           <item>The <hi>First,</hi> What Eternal Nature is in its first origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal purity?</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I begin with the first of these.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Quest. <hi>What is Eternal Nature's Essence, in its first original, birth and being, as it came out of Wisdom's hand?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Eternal Nature was a pure Essence, and then called pure Nature, being free from sin and evil and all mixture of imperfection: she was then all fair, clear, spotless, faultless and sinless. Now for <hi>the manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101649:116"/>
of this great mystery of Eternal Nature,</hi> what it is, I will open it <hi>in the original Causes of it,</hi> viz. the efficient, material, formal and final.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Concerning <hi>the efficient Cause of Eternal Nature. Who can be the Author and Creator of Eternal Nature, but the Triune Deity?</hi> The Father, Son and Spirit must be the Creator of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> not the Father with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Son and Spirit, nor the Son without the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Spirit, nor the Spirit without the Father and Son, but the <hi>Triune Deity in joynt Co-operation.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Triune Deity</hi> in the Globe of Eternity, subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own pure Deity, must be before Eternal Nature by way of <hi>efficiency,</hi> as the <hi>Cause</hi> is before the <hi>Effect,</hi> and are distinct as the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect.</hi> God therefore is not Eternal Nature, nor Eternal Nature God, because Eternal Nature is formed by God, as the <hi>efficient.</hi> And thus we see that <hi>God</hi> can subsist <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nature,</hi> but Eternal Nature's Essence cannot subsist without the <hi>Triune Deity</hi>: God comprehends <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> but <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> cannot comprehend him, who as being the <hi>efficient cause of Eternal Nature,</hi> is higher essenced in his own <hi>Eternal Vnity and Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now that <hi>God</hi> is the Creator of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> Scripture teacheth us, when it tells us, That <hi>by the Word all things were created, and that without him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was made that was made.</hi> Now if the <hi>Triune Deity</hi> was the Creator of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> he must needs in order of Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if any should ask me what is above, before and beyond <hi>Eternal Nature's Essence?</hi> I can only reply the <hi>Triune Deity,</hi> in the <hi>Globe of Eternity,</hi> who is the <hi>efficient Cause of Eternal Nature,</hi> and here we must st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>k of the <hi>efficient Cause of Eternal Nature,</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi> and will briefly declare
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101649:117"/>
how <hi>God</hi> doth not only create <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> by way of <hi>efficiency,</hi> but also that he creates it out of and from himself by way of <hi>Essentiality.</hi> Thus the Divine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy instructs us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 36. <hi>Of him, and from him and to him are all things.</hi> That is, all things proceed essentially from him; and <hi>if all,</hi> then <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature</hi> must proceed materially and essentially out of God's Essence; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>To us there is but one God, by whom are all things,</hi> efficiently, <hi>and of whom are all things,</hi> essentially. Neither can it be otherwise, for when <hi>God</hi> was to create <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> there was nothing besides <hi>Himself</hi> out of, or from which he might create it; wherefore it follows that <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> must proceed <hi>essentially</hi> and substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>God.</hi> And indeed <hi>God</hi> could not be the first original Essence of all Essences, if there were any Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence which was not created out of <hi>God's Essence.</hi> Wherefore we must conclude that <hi>Eternal Nature's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence did proceed from God's Essence by way of essentiality, as well as by that of efficiency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. But the <hi>Great mystery lye's here,</hi> to know how <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> doth proceed from <hi>God's Essence,</hi> and what <hi>God's Essence</hi> is, from whence <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> doth proceed: Now to this, I say, that <hi>Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proceeds from God's Abyssal Essence, generated out of himself</hi>; for as was said before, there was no other Essence to generate it from. You will say, what is this <hi>Abyssal Essence,</hi> which is the original ground of all Essences? I answer, <hi>It is an immens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101649:117"/>
in every created Essence; they work inseparably, one doth not work without the other. But <hi>the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is yet in the manner</hi> how God doth generate this <hi>Abyssal Essence</hi> out of himself; to <hi>clear this, you must know, that in God there is an Eternal Will,</hi> and this Eternal desiring Will looketh into himself, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but himself, doth make a beginning and end to himself; and so the beginning entring into the end, and the end into the beginning of himself, there is formed out of himself this round <hi>Abyssal Globe.</hi> Thus you see, that <hi>the Will of God is the beginning and end of this Abyssal Essence.</hi> The <hi>materiality</hi> also of this <hi>Abyss</hi> is generated out of himself, <hi>becaus</hi> there was nothing besides himself to generate himself from, therefore the Eternal desiring Will must generate this <hi>Abyssal Essence</hi> out of it self. Last of all, you see the <hi>form or figure</hi> that God's Eternal Will formed this Abyss into,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>even into a Circle or Globe, and the manner how, viz.</hi> that the desiring Will looking into it self, and finding nothing but himself, doth put an end to himself; and so the <hi>beginning closing with the end there is formed ae Round or Globe.</hi> Thus you se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the highest ground that we can have of this <hi>Abyssal Essence, viz.</hi> the desiring Will of God, which Will is the first and last cause of all things, from which free, efficacious Will, God doth style himself the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End of all things; the Scripture teaching us, that <hi>from this Will, by this Will, and for this Will all things were created.</hi> And thus much shall suffice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>beginning of God's Abyssal Essence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Now we will proceed to consider <hi>the Nature of this Abyssal Essence,</hi> which, as was hinted before, is a deep, immense, boundless, empty space, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the <hi>Abyssal Essence,</hi> or <hi>ground, without ground.</hi> When, I say, this <hi>Abyssal Essence</hi> is <hi>without bounds,</hi> I do not mean in relation to God, by whose

Will it is bounded and comprehended, but <hi>in relation to our Spirits.</hi> In this empty, immense space there is nothing to be seen, no darkness, no fire, no light, no creature, but is indeed an <hi>unsearchable deep</hi> without any Essence, though indeed it <hi>be the ground of all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and that from whence Eternal Nature's Essence doth proceed.</hi> And though the Spirit of the Creature sees no Essence in it, yet God's Eye sees all things in it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it is the original ground of all Essences, yet is no visible Essence to be seen in it. This Abyssal Essence generated out of God, to be the ground of all Essences, is called by Mystical Writers the <hi>Divine Chaos,</hi> and the original Essence of all Essences, from whence all created Essences, Principles and Centers do proceed. Thus I have brought you to the <hi>first original of all Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, under the Triune Deity, which is this Abyssal ground or Essence; with respect to which Abyss, God calls himself the First and the Last of all Essences.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Subject <hi>Behme</hi> speaks thus, in his deep wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; <hi>If the Spirit of the Soul could come into the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nothing, then he would come into that Original ground, whence Eternal Nature and all Creatures did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</hi> He also term's this Eternal Nothing, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Stilness, becaus as no Essence is to be seen in it, though it be the ground of all Essences; so there is no life, no motion, no working source to be found in it, but an Eternal Stilness, though indeed it be the ground whence all life, motion and working power doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. This Divine <hi>Behme</hi> well understood, therefore he saith, <hi>If the Spirit of the Soul could sink down into this Eternal N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To recollect briefly what hath been said; I have told you that this Abyssal Essence is an immense, empty space, where no Essence is to be seen by us. Secondly, I have told you that it is the original ground of all Essences. Thirdly, That it is an Eternal stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Fourthly, That it had its birth from the will of God. Fifthly, I have declared also the manner of its formation into a Globe, by the desiring of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>une Deity. Sixthly, I have too manifested to you, that it is the original ground whence Eternal Nature's Essence doth proceed. Seventhly, That this <hi>Abyssal Essence</hi> is God's <hi>Divine Chaos, wherein God's Eternal Eye doth see all things lye hid, yet without Essence. All</hi> Eternal Essences, Centers, Principles, Worlds, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Colours, and whole Eternal Nature with her seven working Powers are <hi>hid therein,</hi> and <hi>from hence</hi> are <hi>brought forth</hi> by the Wisdom of God.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. If your searching mind do not rest satisfied with this, but be still enquiring what the Nature of this Abyssal Essence is; I say further, that <hi>this Abys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Essence, is an Eternal Essence generated out of God's Essence</hi>; that is, <hi>out of himself, by himself and for the good pleasure of himself, and is himself.</hi> But if you will ask further, what <hi>this Essence is,</hi> which is thus genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of himself? I can give no other answer, but that it is, <hi>what it is; and further than this none but the Triune Deity can tell.</hi> But I can tell you <hi>the end why</hi> God brought it out of himself, even that <hi>it might be the original ground of all Essences, this was the end why</hi> the Holy Trinity introduced themselves into this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Beginning. <hi>God</hi> indeed is without any beginning, but the <hi>Will of the Trinity hath been pleased to generate it self into a Beginning, which is the Abyssal Essence, the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a very great difference; the <hi>Triune Deity</hi> doth see that all things lye hid in his Divine Chaos, but without Essence: but in Eternal Nature's Ground he sees all things essentially, and that he hath actually all sufficiency of materials and instruments to bring forth all things from Eternal Nature's Ground.

                              <head>What the Nature of this Eternal Element of Water is.</head>
                              <p>The <hi>Eternal Element of Water</hi> is a Meek, Mild, Soft, Gentle Essence: for as the <hi>Fire-essence</hi> is the ground of Fierceness, so the <hi>Water</hi> is the ground of Meekness:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101649:122"/>
and this will appear, if we consider the <hi>essential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of it: The <hi>first</hi> of which is Meekness, the <hi>next</hi> Sweetness, <hi>then</hi> Softness, Mildness, Gentleness, Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Refreshingness, Sincking down, Heaviness: so that we see from these <hi>properties</hi> that the <hi>Water</hi> must needs be a Meek and Mild Essence: and this <hi>Meek Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is the Ground of Eternal Light,</hi> it is the <hi>Womb of the Meek Light, from whence springs</hi> Pleasantness, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulness, Ioyfulness and Gladness.</p>
                              <p>All which <hi>properties</hi> are in one another inseparably and make up but one <hi>Meek Essence,</hi> as the several <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of the <hi>Fire</hi> make up one <hi>fierce Essence:</hi> which Meek Essence we may call the <hi>Meek Water-Essence,</hi> the Meek <hi>Light</hi>-Essence, or the Meek <hi>Love-fire-Essence.</hi> This Essence Divine <hi>Behme</hi> makes to be the fifth form of Eternal Nature, <hi>and so it is.</hi> But I would have you further to consider <hi>the end of its production,</hi> which is to mitigate and allay the fierceness of the <hi>Fire-Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and to be its Antagonist: So to the fierce, fiery, harsh, darkness, the <hi>Water</hi> opposeth its meek, soft, gentle and pleasant <hi>Light</hi>; to the bitterness and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of the <hi>Fire,</hi> it opposeth its sweetness and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness; to the anguish, wrathfulness and devouring property of the <hi>Fire,</hi> it opposeth the joyfulness of its <hi>Love-fire-Essence</hi>; and to the Mounting elevation of the <hi>Fire,</hi> it opposeth its ponderosity and sinking down.</p>
                              <p>Here you see that the Beauty, Excellence and Strength of the <hi>Water</hi> consists in its Meekness, Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101649:123"/>
neither can their contrariety hinder or oppose the Art and Power of Wisdom.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>The Art of Wisdom</hi> appears not only in mixing them, but <hi>in reducing them to a harmony</hi> and equal temperament, she doth proportion them to an equality in Number, Weight and Measure.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wisdom's Art</hi> appears <hi>in that</hi> being thus proportionally tempered together, <hi>they qualifie act and move in and through</hi> one another, and that <hi>in the greatest</hi> harmony and friendship, as the members of one body: the fierceness of the fire is mitigated and allayed by the Water, the harsh astringency of the Darkness, is dissolv'd in the meekness of the Light, and so of the rest.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>Wisdom's Art</hi> appears, in this, that in the harmonizing of these four Eternal Elements, <hi>she hath made all their contrary properties to be useful one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: The Harsh Darkness is serviceable to the Meek Light, for Darkness is the subject through which Light displays it self; were there no Darkness, there would be no Light: the fierceness of the Fire, gives strength to the Meek Water-Essence, and meekness of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter allays the fierceness of the Fire: so Air is very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Fire to keep it from being suffocated; and the Earth is useful to them all, becaus it gives them a Body to act and move in: We may yet <hi>further consider the usefulness</hi> of the Elements to one another, <hi>as they stand harmonized and tempered together by the Hand of Wisdom.</hi> The Fire gives Life, Mobility and Strength to the Meek Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101649:124"/>
and are useful to one another; the Darkness is as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the Light, and the Fire as the Water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>they are all good, their contrarieties</hi> being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monized, and reconciled <hi>by the skilful hand of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Wisdom.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, <hi>Wisdom's Art</hi> appears <hi>in that,</hi> in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the <hi>Eternal Elements, she makes them qualifie</hi> and serve one another <hi>in triumphing joyfulness,</hi> and to rejoyce in each other's qualifying: for though these <hi>Eternal Elements are not understanding Spirits,</hi> yet they have an innate hunger in themselves (which is their intrinsecal form) which makes them desire each other: thus the Fire-Essence hunger's after the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Water, as its dayly food, wherewith its ravenous fierceness may be satisfied and allayed; and again the Water hunger's after the Fire, as its Life, Strength and Motion. The astringent Darkness hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's after the Meek Light, and the Light after the Darkness, that it may shine through it, and subsist in it. And from <hi>this inbred Hunger it is that they rejoyce to qualifie one with another</hi>; it is as <hi>their sport and past time</hi> to penetrate one through another, and to be sometimes above and sometimes under another in <hi>this wrestling wheel of Nature. For you must know that all these quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyng powers of Nature have sensibility and mobility in themselves,</hi> whereby they can feel and taste one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's properties, and are sensible of the pleasure and satisfaction they receive one from another, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually awakens the hunger in every property, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie one with another. So the Fire is sensible that the Meek Water doth allay its fierceness, and therefore it doth hunger after it; the anguishing Darkness is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the amiable pleasantness of the Light is a refreshment to it; and thus each property feels and taste's the other's goodness, and this makes them still to hunger after one another, and to penetrate one another with all triumphing Ioyfulness.

                           <p>Ninethly, <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> was brought forth, that <hi>the Eternal Vnity of the Deity might be display'd in variety, diversity and multiplicity.</hi>

                              <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, that all these perfections are all one in the Deity and make up but one most simple Essence, for else God would be divided in himself, and could not be the supreme Unity and Simplicity, as before hath been proved at large.</p>
                           <p>But by the Elements and working forms of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> this Unity displays and as it were dissolves and dilates it self into an infinite variety and diversity of Creations, according to the purpose of his Will.</p>
                           <p>Tenthly, A <hi>tenth</hi> end was, that <hi>the still Divine Essence by entring into the contrariety of Eternal Nature might bring forth the Glory of the Majesty, and triumphing and exulting joy,</hi> which were not to be found in the <hi>still Eternity,</hi> before the working properties of <hi>Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> were brought forth.</p>
                           <p>Eleventhly, <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> was brought forth, that <hi>it might be the true Primum Mobile,</hi> or the first <hi>source and spring of all motion and action.</hi> For this end it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Trinity</hi> to produce this <hi>Eternal turning wheel,</hi> and indissoluble band of the seven forms of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>: for in the <hi>still Eternity</hi> there is <hi>nothing but stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> quiet and rest: and <hi>that such</hi> as passeth all the thought and conceptions of Man; and that Spirit only knows it, who hath been taken up into it.</p>
                           <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> was produced, that <hi>the one single Essence of the Holy Trinity might be manifested in distinction,</hi> according <hi>to the distinct Essences and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Eternal Nature.</hi> Thus the Father is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in Fire, the Son in Water, the Holy Ghost in Air.

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>answer is obvious,</hi> for I do not say that <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> is the first Essence, but the <hi>first created <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Object. <hi>But you will object again, that God himself is the Essence of all Essences, and the original Cause and first matter of all things, which I own to be true but with distinction.</hi>

                                 </gap>id not immediately proceed from God, will appear by these following reasons.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>First, If all creatures had immediately proceeded from God, they must all have been a perfect Unity, without all duality, diversity, or contrariety; becaus God's Essence from which they immediately procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was such: But we find that <hi>all created Essences are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Object. <hi>You'l say, evil is not in God, therefore it must be in Eternal Nature?</hi>

                              <hi>Sol.</hi> Yet the inconsequence of this argument doth appear, in that it may be so easily retorted, for say I, <hi>becaus</hi> evil is not in God, therefore neither can it be in Eternal Nature, which was created by him; for such as the cause is, such must the effect be: no evil is in the Cause of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> therefore neither can there be any evil in Eternal Nature, which is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                           <p>Quest. <hi>But you'l question further, if evil be not in God, nor in Eternal Nature, where then will you place it? What will you make the ground and source of evil?</hi>

                              <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, that <hi>the mutability of the Creature is the Cause of evil.</hi> For though all things be created good by God, yet they are not immutably so; but may become evil. <hi>But we will speak no further of this matter, becaus</hi> this is not the proper place to speak of the original of evil and sin, for we are here only a treating of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> as it came out of God's hand, and before any Creatures were created or brought forth out of it.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101649:131"/>
who were not born again,</hi> from having a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of them. <hi>Iacob Behme,</hi> whensoever he <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes evil</hi> to <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> considers it, <hi>in its fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Object. <hi>But you will say that Darkness is an evil Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: but say I, how can that be evil, which is the cause of the Light?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> For Darkness is the root of the Fire, and from the Fire proceeds the Light, so that if there were no Darkness, there would be no Light; wherefore Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is no evil Essence.</p>
                           <p>Neither is the bitterness and sting of the Anguish evil in it self, <hi>becaus</hi> they are the cause of the triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy. Nor the Fire though it be a fierce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Essence, <hi>becaus</hi> its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ierceness and wrathfulness is the strength of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>: and when these qualities of the Fire come to be penetrated by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are changed, and become the cause of pleasure and triumphing joy. Therefore you see that <hi>Fire as it was originally in Eternal Nature is no evil Essence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Neither can it be said that the contrariety which is found in the forms and properties of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> makes them to be evil; <hi>becaus</hi> all the six forms of Nature are united and harmonized in the seventh, where no strife contrariety or opposition is to be found, nor any thing from whence they might with truth be denominated evil. In this harmony and agreement of all the essential forms of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> doth the essential and intrinsecal goodness of <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> consist. This was the <hi>beautiful garment</hi> wherewith she was arayed when first she came out of the hand of her great and wise Creator: <hi>for</hi> the Darkness was not at odds with the Light, nor the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101649:131"/>

                           <p>We will now take into consideration the <hi>Nature of this Fire,</hi> and whence <hi>it burns and flames continually,</hi> without ever being extinguished.

                              <hi>In the third place,</hi> God brings forth the <hi>Water-es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> being the <hi>root of the fifth form, viz.</hi> the <hi>Light-essence.</hi> This <hi>Water</hi> is the food of the Fire, whereby its eager hunger is allayed, and its painful attraction stilled, and the effects of its Sulphureous, Mercurial and Salnitrous properties, palliated and concealed. This <hi>Water-spirit is placed at the bottom of the Fire-root,</hi> where the Fire finds its own Eternal refreshment in it self, and needs not to seek it elsewhere: yet the <hi>Fire-sperit</hi> cannot reach it by flying upwards, but by sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>down deep</hi> into his own root. Thus God brings down the pride of the Fire, by placing its food and refreshment in the deeps below it. No sooner had the <hi>Fire-spirit</hi> by sinking down into its own root, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd its fierce hunger, and quenched its dry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable thirst in the <hi>Water-essence,</hi> but it became as transported with joy, and said, <hi>O Blessed Element!</hi> How camest thou to be so near me, even in my very root and center and I not aware of thee? <hi>Behold!</hi> I
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101649:133"/>
have drunk deep of thy fountain and am satisfied: I have tasted thy sweetness, and am refreshed. <hi>O come and mingle</hi> thy softness and meekness with my strength and fierceness, that my anguishing hunger and painful thirst may no more be felt by me, but be swallowed up in satisfaction and delight! <hi>Thus you see</hi> how the <hi>fire,</hi> by sinking down into its own root, mingles with the <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> raising it self penetrates the <hi>Fire,</hi> by which means the hunger and thirst of the Fire are mitigated and asswaged; not that they are quite taken away, but the attraction being more moderate, the thirst and hunger, which before were painful and anguishing, now become pleasing and delightful.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101649:136"/>
it be otherwise? Since the God of Love, Peace, and Unity could not be the Author of contrariety in <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature's Essence,</hi> out of which he was to bring forth his whole Host of Creatures; And thus much concerning the <hi>perfection of Eternal Nature's Essence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="10">10. <hi>Ans.</hi> In the tenth place, <hi>Eternal Nature's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is a Blessed and Happy Essence</hi>; I do not mean that she is the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> the most High and Soveraign happiness, for that <hi>is only to be found in the Divine Essence</hi>; but that she is so far happy and blessed as a created Essence is capable of being. <hi>This happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Eternal Nature consists in this, that she is free from all contrariety, strife, misery and anguish,</hi> as hath been but even now declared at large.</p>
                           <p>Neither indeed could it be otherwise, except we will make <hi>God to be the Author of contrariety,</hi> Misery, Pain and Death, which is <hi>directly contrary to his Nature, and to what the Holy Scriptures testifie concerning him</hi>; No, <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> as she came out of the Hand of her great Creator was all Beautiful, all Spotless, all Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; no Strife, Misery, or Death to be found in any borders of her Dominion.

                           <p>Now since it hath been declared before, that the Perfection, Happiness and triumphant joyfulness of Eternal Nature is chiefly placed in her sixth and last active form (the seventh being only as the body, or hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer, That <hi>the Holy Trinity created Eternal Nature to be a Palace for them to dwell in</hi>; now as in a <hi>Royal Palace</hi> we must pass through many rooms and <hi>apartments,</hi> before we come to the <hi>Presence-chamber</hi> of the Prince; so in <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> the <hi>forms of darkness</hi> must be pass'd through and after these the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> before we can come to the <hi>Love-fire,</hi> which the Holy Trinity hath chosen for his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence-chamber,</hi> out of all the <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi> God will not have his Creatures to rush in of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain into his all-glorious presence, and therefore hath so ordered it that many doors must be passed by them, and many locks opened, before they can come to <hi>His Presence, whom to see and know is Eternal bliss and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</hi> Wherefore thrice happy is the man, who by walking this path of pure Nature, hath pass'd the Gates of Darkness, Bitterness and Anguish, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them the Gate of the <hi>Fierce-fire,</hi> and at length through <hi>Water, Light</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> hath made his way to the <hi>Love-fire-essence</hi>; where he meets with Eternal Rest, Liberty and triumphant Ioy, as being come to that point where the end hath found the beginning, and where the beginning and the end are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether never to be parted again for ever.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 11. <hi>The Principle of Eternal Nature, is a Passive Principle</hi>; the <hi>Active power</hi> of it being derived <hi>from the Holy Trinity,</hi> who have introduced themselves to act and work in the same, and to bring forth Creatures out of it. She is indeed the <hi>Mother of all beings,</hi> but as a Woman cannot bring forth without a Man; so Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature would have continued barren for ever, without the Active power of the Deity had impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, to the end she might be <hi>the fruitful Mother of all things.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>

                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 12. <hi>The Principle of Eternal Nature is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and subordinated Principle,</hi> as appears, <hi>becaus</hi> she is created by God, and therefore cannot be co-equal with the Deity, no more than the Creature can be with the Creator: she is placed below the <hi>Globe of Eternity,</hi> is influenced from the same, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it: therefore must needs be a <hi>subjected and subordinated Principle.</hi> We may hence gather the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of that Athiehical Principle which makes All-mighty Matter to be the Cause of all things; <hi>for</hi> we see here clearly that <hi>Eternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ature,</hi> the <hi>matter of all things, is wholly Passive and subordinate to the will and power of her Great Creator,</hi> in whose Hand she is as clay in the Hand of the Potter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> 13. In the last place if it be asked, <hi>what kind of Principle Eternal Nature is?</hi> I answer, that <hi>it is an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and serviceable Principle,</hi> and that <hi>becaus</hi> it fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer's to all those ends for which it was created by God: but more especially the usefulness thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in these following particulars.</p>
                           <p>First, Becaus the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> is as it were <hi>the body of the Holy Trinity</hi> wherein they live, act and move; as the Soul doth in our Bodies, and is therefore called the <hi>Eternal Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Eternal pure substantiality:</hi> for <hi>without this Principle of pure Nature, the Holy Trinity is all pure Deity, without any covering whatsoever</hi>; whereas in this <hi>Principle,</hi> the Deity is cloathed upon with <hi>Eternal Humanity,</hi>; which <hi>conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Deity with Humanity is the greatest mystery, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>xt to that of the Holy Trinity</hi>; by means of which the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> convey their pure Deity, which is all Life, Power and Virtue through the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, The usefulness of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ernal Nature's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> appears, in that it is become <hi>the Palace and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101649:137"/>
of the Holy Trinity. God's first and most glorious Palace is the still Eternity,</hi> or the <hi>Eternal World</hi> which he generated out of himself, that it might be the first and most proper <hi>habitation</hi> for himself; but his <hi>second Palace, or dwelling place is the Principle of Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, In the third place, the usefulness of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature's Principle</hi> appears, in that it is <hi>God's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi> wherein the great and wonderful Potter hath laid up not only a sufficiency of <hi>Materials,</hi> but also of <hi>Tools</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> for all Creations. Here is <hi>the great and Vniversal treasury of that Clay</hi> of which all things are made; and here is the <hi>Eternal turning wheel</hi> with which they are framed and fashioned.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>Eternal Nature's Principle is the Wardrobe of the Deity,</hi> where all the variety of vestures and cloathing, wherewith the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> are pleased at any time to cover themselves, are laid up. All <hi>the forms of Eternal Nature,</hi> Darkness, Fire, Light, Water, &amp;c. <hi>are but so many vehicles, or rather vestures of the Deity, wherewith he vaileth his pure-naked essential Glory.</hi> Wherefore he is also termed <hi>a God that hideth himself,</hi> even his pure Deity with and under the <hi>forms of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, In the fifth place, the usefulness of <hi>Eternal Nature's Principle</hi> appears, in that it is the <hi>Conduit-pipe through which the golden oil and water of Life, together with the Divine Virtue of the Heavenly Tincture, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veied to the Creature.</hi> Pure Nature's Principle is the <hi>silver-pipe</hi> through which the <hi>Golden oil of the Holy Tincture,</hi> which flows from the Union of <hi>Fire and Light,</hi> is conveied, and is the <hi>mean</hi> by which the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> with the wonders of Eternity, come to be manifested, felt, tasted and enjoyed; and therefore must needs be a very useful and necessary Principle.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, In the sixth and last place, <hi>Eternal Nature's Principle is the field wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Holy Trinity:</hi> it is the <hi>Cabinet</hi> wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Iewel of wonder,</hi> viz. <hi>the Deity in pure Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity:</hi> whosoever it is that finds this <hi>Pearl</hi> doth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, find <hi>all the wonders</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi> The <hi>

                                 </gap>earl</hi> indeed is one thing and the <hi>field,</hi> or rich <hi>Cabinet</hi> another, yet is <hi>both field and Cabinet very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep and conceal the precious stone of Eternal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which is fast locked up in this <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and lye's <hi>deep buried</hi> in this <hi>field,</hi> and whosoever will find it must <hi>dig deep</hi> for it.</p>
                           <p>But you will say, where shall I find this field? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>the field is thy self</hi>: if thou canst find in thy self the Union of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and these two <hi>qualifying</hi> together in <hi>one Essence,</hi> then thou hast met with the place where this <hi>noble stone</hi> is hid, and thou needest seek no further. And thus much shall suffice to have spoken concerning the <hi>Principle of Eternal Nature.</hi> I shall now proceed to the fourth general head, or the last part of this discourse, concerning God's introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of himself into <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi>

                     <head>Concerning God in Eternal Nature.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Mystical Divines do make mention of two great Mysteries in the Divine Nature</hi>; the <hi>first</hi> is the Trinity in Unity and Unity in Trinity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect's the Deity in their single, solitary and abstracted Essence: the <hi>second</hi> Mystery, is the Deity in Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Humanity in the Deity, which concern's God as being introduced and subsisting in <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi> I have in the former part of this discourse treated of the first of these; and do now intend in this Chapter to speak of the later, and that by opening this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that <hi>God hath introduced himself into the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Eternal Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which Proposition you will find explained in these following particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the first place, when I say that <hi>God</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced himself into <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> I understand that the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> Father, Son and Holy Ghost, have introduced themselves into <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> with his intellectual, all seeing Eye, the <hi>Son</hi> with his all flaming Heart of Love, and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> with his out-flowing acting Power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, when I say that God introduced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, &amp;c. I do include the <hi>Eternal Wisdom</hi> which God introduced together with himself into the principle of <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the third place, <hi>God introduced himself into Eternal Nature together with his essential Love, which is the holy Nature of the Trinity,</hi> according to that of the Apostle <hi>Iohn, God is Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Object. But some may object, That <hi>the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not only consist in Love, but also in Light and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101649:139"/>
Life, which are attributed to the Holy Trinity as well as Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> To which I answer, That <hi>Love,</hi> in the sense I take it, <hi>doth include both Light and Life,</hi> for this essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Love, is all Light and all Life; so that neither death, nor darkness can come near it. Now we must know that this <hi>essential Love is the unchangeable Nature of the Trinity,</hi> and therefore we must not think that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> is changed by being brought into and clothed upon with <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> and from Love turned to Wrath, or from Meekness to Severity. No, by no means: for <hi>as God is all Love in himself, so he is the same in Eternal Nature.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, that when the Scripture speaks of God's Anger, Wrath and Severity, it hath regard to God's manifesting of himself in and through <hi>Eternal Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>re</hi> as it is infected and defiled by sin. Whereas when I say, that <hi>the manifestation of God in Nature is all Love, I speak of Nature in its purity, before it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the fall of Lucifer, and when all its forms and properties were harmonized to the most penfect concord and Vnity:</hi> for in this state nothing but Love, which is the unchangeable Nature of God, was to be found in <hi>Eternal Nature's</hi> principle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the last place, I say, God introduced the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits before the Throne</hi> together with himself into <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>; else these <hi>seven Spirits</hi> could never have been seen, or manifested in <hi>Eternal Nature's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>; but the <hi>Scripture</hi> oft makes mention of them as introduced into <hi>Eternal Nature</hi>; so they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the first Chap. of the <hi>Revelation</hi> as existing in <hi>Mount-Zion,</hi> or the <hi>New Ierusalem-principle,</hi> which was brought forth out of <hi>Eternal Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:101649:139"/>And thus much shall suffice to have spoken of the first part, or <hi>subject</hi> of this proposition, which is <hi>God</hi>: we now proceed to the <hi>praedicate</hi> which is <hi>Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now by <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> into which it is said that God hath introduced himself, we are to understand <hi>Eternal Nature in its puriey,</hi> not as defiled with sin; for the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> would never of their own free-will have introduced themselves into any thing that was defiled, or impure. Again, we are to understand that when <hi>Gnd</hi> introduced himself into <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> that she stood yet in her original Unity, Simplicity and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, without any duality, or contrariety: for the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> would never have entered with their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Love,</hi> into that where division, disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and contrariety had taken place. No, <hi>Eternal Nature</hi> was without strife or contest, without any mixture of Good and Evil, or Light and Darkness, but was all perfectly harmonized; or else the <hi>blessed Trinity</hi> could not have made it the habitation of their <hi>Divine Love-Essence.</hi> And thus we see in what sence we are to take <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> when we speak of God's introducing himself into it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

<hi rend="margQuotes">When we say that the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> have introduced themselves into <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> we mean nothing else, but the <hi>Vnion of the Blessed Trinity with Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and Eternal Nature's Union with the Blessed Trinity, which is the full meaning of God's intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of himself into Eternal Nature's principle.</hi>

his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of Love into <hi>Eternal Nature's</hi> pure principle.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Nature</hi> of which <hi>Vnion</hi> I shall explain and open to you in these following particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                        <hi rend="margQuotes">now this <hi>Love,</hi> which is the link and tye of both the Uniter and United, is the essential Love of the Deity, wherefore this <hi>Vnion</hi> must needs be an essential and most intimate Union:</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> To which I answer, by denying that God's Love can be changed into anger in <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> as she stands in purity and perfection, before the coming in of sin; <hi>becaus</hi> in that state neither <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> nor any thing in it could be the subject of God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Hatred, Severity, or Iustice. Wherefore tho in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Nature we perceive the effects of God's Love and Hatred, Mercy and Iustice, Sweetness and Severity, yet <hi>in pure Nature, into which God hath introduced himself</hi> and concerning which we speak here, <hi>nothing can ever be found but the effects of an unchangeable Love:</hi> which unchangeable Love is that bond, which makes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Union between God and pure Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deity and Humanity. This <hi>Love</hi> is that which after a vital manner doth pass through and penetrate all and every part of <hi>Eternal Nature,</hi> and Eternal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture presseth into the Love, which makes the <hi>Vnion</hi> of them both most intimate, vital and inseparable: so that we may say, who shall, or who can separate God and pure Nature? Or who can disannul the Eternal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwen them? But yet notwithstanding all that hath been said concerning this Union between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>pure Nature's principle,</hi> we are to understand that <hi>this Vnion is without confusion,</hi> so as God is not pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor pure Nature God, for tho one be in the other; yet <hi>God</hi> comprehends <hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>Nature</hi> cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>Deity.</hi>
