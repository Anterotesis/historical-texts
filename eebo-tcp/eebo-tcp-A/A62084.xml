         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head type="sub">Four degrees of created beings.</head>
               <p>THere are four generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of creatures, by which
as four distinct rounds in the
ladder of created nature, man
may ascend to the right
knowledg of himself and of
God. There was no other
generall and visible book for mankind to read the
mind of God in, and their duty towards him, for
the first 2513. yeers of the world. Then began
the book of the holy Scriptures to be written by
Moses, which was finished by John, about the
yeer 4100. The former volume of it was peculiarly
committed to the jews. <hi>To them perteined the giving
of the law, the service of God, and the promises.</hi> Other
nations took little notice of it, till the promised
Messiah came in the flesh, and <hi>brake down the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
wall of partition between them and the jews;</hi> on
which, the holy Oracles became common to all
the world. But this book, though it do more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
excellently, and fully declare the mind of
God, as to the duty and concerns of man, then the
book of nature, yet doth it no wayes rescind, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate,
or invalidate it. That book is yet in being,
and doth by the various voices and lines thereof,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36640:5"/>
administer the same significant instruction unto
man, as from the beginning. And hereof is he
obliged to take notice, even by the Scriptures of
truth, as may appear by the two places thereof,
quoted in the title-page, with others, which, for
brevity, I refer to the reader's enquiry.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first generall degree, or lowest rank of
creatures, comprehend's all those things that have
being only, not life, sense, or understanding.</item>
                  <item>2. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> comprehend's all such things as have
being and life only, not sense nor understanding.</item>
                  <item>3. The third comprehend's all those creatures
that have being, life, and sense, but not reason or
understanding.</item>
                  <item>4. The fourth comprehend's only those crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that have being, life, sense, and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with free-will, which are rationall and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall
powers.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In the lowest round of this ladder, the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of created beings, we find more various spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or kinds, as also more individualls, then in the
second; in the second, more then in the third; in
the third, more then in the fourth. There is but
one species or nature at all, in the fourth, to wit,
humane; and not so many individuals as in any
of the former trhee.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In the first degree, we find abundance of
distinct species or natures of things, one above
another, in dignity; the four elements, all inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
compounds, the visible heavens with the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
<pb facs="tcp:36640:5"/>
thereof, Sun, Moon, and Stars. Water ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
the earth, and is scituated above it. Air ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
water in dignity and scituation. Fire excells
air. The celestial orbes with their furniture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
them all, <hi>The glory of the celestial bodies, it one:
the glory of the terrestrial, another. There is one glory
of the Sun; another, of the Moon; another, of the Stars.
And one Star differeth from</hi> or excelleth <hi>another Star,
in glory.</hi> There are also many kinds or species of
metalls and mineralls generated under the earth,
very different in worth and excellency, as Gold,
Silver, copper, tinn, ledd; brimstone, alume, &amp;c.
There are also divers sorts of precious stones, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in worth, as Diamonds, Rubies, Saphirs,
and the rest; amongst which, the Diamond has
the pre-eminence. Many other kinds of things
there are in the first degree, of different natures
from each other; together with all sorts of artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things, which agree in this, that they have
being only, not life, sense, nor understanding.</item>
                  <item>2. In the second degree, are all trees and plants
or herbs. Of both sorts there are many species,
distinguish'd from and surmounting one another
in their different properties, qualities, and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
They draw nourishment from the earth,
whereby they do grow, bring forth fruit and seed
for the use of man, as also for the multiplying of
themselvs.</item>
                  <item>3. In the third degree are conteined all variety
of creatures that have being, life, and sense, but
<pb facs="tcp:36640:6"/>
not reason. Sense here is comprehensive of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is found in meer animals, birds, beasts, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
and creeping things, over and beyond what
is to be found in any things of the second rank, to
wit, plants and trees.</item>
                  <item>4. In the fourth round of nature's ladder, we
find but one species or nature only; man's. In man
is summ'd up and put together whatever is found
in the other three degrees, to wit, being, life, and
sense, advanc'd into a union with reason or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and free-will. This nature is lord of the
other three, and ought to own no other lord over
it, but God himself.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These four degrees of things, well considered
(of which there can be no doubt, as being evident
unto the common reason and experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
we may, by duly comparing and observing
of them (as to their agreements with, or differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from each other) gain great instruction, as to
our duty towards God, and advantages therein,
both temporall and eternall.</p>

generall and special. His general agrement is
this.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. He has being, with elements, Sun, Moon,
Stars, and all inanimate compounds. His body is
compounded of, nourished and mainteined by the
elements and products thereof, as other things
are. He dwells and lives in and by them, every
moment.</item>
                     <item>2. He has life, with trees and plants. They live,
are nourish'd, grow, encrease, and multiply, by
propagation of their like. <hi>The herb yeeldeth seed, and
the fruit-tree yeeldeth fruit after his kind, whose seed
is in itself.</hi> Gen. 1. 11.</item>
                     <item>3. In harmony or agrement with things of the
third degree, <hi>birds, beasts, fishes,</hi> and <hi>every thing that
creepeth upon the earth,</hi> he has outward senses;
seing, hearing, &amp;c. He has also all the inward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
powers, or faculties of animalish life. He
has the attractive, retentive, digestive, and
expulsive powers, in order to growth, nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and generation. He sees, hear's, smell's,
tast's, sleep's, wake's, eates, drink's, &amp;c. as
they do. No degree then of created being, is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the composition of every individual man.
He ha's being, with all inanimate parts of the
creation; life, with herbs and trees; sense, with
beasts,  reason, with angels. He is the only
true microcosm, or little world, in whose nature
and constitution is put together al the variety of
<pb facs="tcp:36640:7"/>
nature that's to be found in the whole creation.</item>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The fruit or profit that's to be reaped from this
general agrement of man with all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
creatures.</head>
                  <p>FRom this general view and comparison of
himself with all inferiour creatures, may man
argue and certainly conclude, that there is some
invisible lord over him, who gave to all inferiour
things what they have; and to himself, what he
has. If he had given to inferiour things, what they
have, he had bin their creatour. If inferiour
things had given him, what he has, they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him more then they have in themselvs, and
would be superiour to him. The same almighty
lord made, order'd, proportion'd, and limited all,
within their severall bounds. All are the works
of his hands. <hi>He made us, and not we ourselvs.</hi> Ps.
100. 3.</p>
                  <p>Again, the excellent order of so different and
innumerable things, demonstrates the creatour
to be but one. Every inferiour order of things is
exactly calculated and fitted to the use and service
of it's superiour. The elements enter the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of trees and plants, nourishing them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.
Herbs and the fruits of trees enter into
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36640:7"/>
creatures endued with sense, and nourish them.
Elements, herbs, fruits, and the flesh of beasts,
enter into man, and nourish him. The celestial
bodies, Sun, moon and stars do influence and give
vigour and warmth unto all. Thus do inferiour
things help the superiour, in great unity, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and order. Things in the first, second, and third
degrees, are ordeined for the service of man, who
is the only creature in the fourth.</p>
                  <p>Now if the many particular and speciall natures,
comprehended in the three general degrees of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
things, be ordeined for the relief and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of one nature only, to wit, man's; much
more ought that nature to yeeld itself wholly
up to the service of one only nature above it, the
divine.</p>
                  <p>There are many distinct special natures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
under one generall, in the three infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
degrees of things. There are many species
or natures in the first; elements, sun, moon, stars,
metals, mineralls, stones, &amp;c. In the second, are
many several natures, species or kinds of trees and
plants. In the third, are several kinds of birds,
beasts, fishes, and creeping things, very different
in their natures. But in the fourth, we find only
one nature or species, wherein all the individuals
do agree.</p>
                  <p>All the severall species or distinct natures of
things in the first degree, are united in one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
consideration, as having being only. All the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36640:8"/>
several species in the second, have being and life
only. All in the third, agree in this, that they have
being, life and sense only, not reason. Thus may
we observe a generall unity of the distinct respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
species under the three inferiour degrees of
creatures. In the fourth, all are of one species or
particular nature, differing only individually. And
that nature which is above humane, and all the
rest, must have one degree of unity above humane,
to wit, numericall, without any diversity, so
much as in individuals. One degree of unity ought
to be acknowledg'd incident to the divine nature,
above humane, which can be no other, or lesse
then this; that one and the same undivided sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
nature, or essence, be found in three divine
persons, really distinct from, and yet most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
one with each other. Otherwise would
nor the unity of divine nature in three persons, be
superiour to the unity of humane nature in three
or more men. All created natures are gathered up
and knit together in humane nature, which is but
one species; and humane nature is united with the
supream nature of all. So comes the whole world
to be consummated and terminated in the greatest
unity that is possible.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he that gave being, life, sense, and
understanding to his creatures, has all these emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
and incomparably in himself, beyond what
they are in the creature. He has being, life, sense,
and understanding, in supream perfection and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36640:8"/>
unity. He had them from all eternity in himself,
He received them not from any other, nor did he
give them to himself. They are not limited in
him. For who should measure them out unto him?
They are infinite, immeasurable, and boundless.
They are all one and the same thing, in him. Life,
sense, and understanding, are the self-same thing
with his being. In him is no composition. What
then is attributable unto his being, is attributable
to all the rest. If his being be infinite, <hi>his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is infinite,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus having found out the infinite perfection
of God, by the finite things which he hath made,
we may further conclude from such infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that he made not the world, as standing
in need of any thing his creatures could be or do
unto him, for ever. But in meer bounty, did he
communicate unto them their being, in order to
bring them into a final state of indissoluble union
with himself, which is their utmost perfection and
eternall blessednes.</p>

                  <p>THe difference of man from other creatures
is also general and special, as well as his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grement
with them. A greater degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
is atteinable, by considering his difference
from, or excellency above them, then by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
those things, faculties, powers, organs, and
operations, wherein he agrees with them. The
knowledg atteinable from his agrement with
them, wil profit us little or nothing, unlesse we
proceed also to take notice of his difference from
them. In order to this, we are first to consider the
difference that the three inferiour degrees of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have from one another, which is also gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and special.</p>
                  <p>Their general difference hath bin already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to. Things of the second degree excell those
of the first, by having life, which is not to be found
in the first. Things of the third, excell them both,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36640:11"/>
by having sense, which is not found in either of
them. Man ha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s being, life, and sense, in a generall
community or fraternity with them; and he has,
over and above, reason and free-will, which none
of them have. Herein lies his general difference
from, or excellency above them all.</p>
                  <p>There are also special differences to be found
amongst inferiour creatures, under each of the
three general degrees. There are many distinct
natures, species or kinds, under the same general
degree.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Under the first, the elements differ in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
nature, qualities, and scituation, one from
another. Amongst metals, gold has a peculiar
nature and excellency above silver; silver, above
tinn; tinn, above lead, &amp;c. Amongst stones, one
is more excellent then another, by its peculiar
nature, and specifical difference from others. Yet
all these things do agree and meet together in one
general degree of creatures, that have being
only; not life, sense, or understanding.</item>
                     <item>2. Under the second general degree of things,
that have being and life only, there are many also
and great specifical differences. All the various
kinds of trees and plants, have their peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
distinct from one another.</item>
                     <item>3. In the third general degree of creatures,
there are many kinds of beasts, birds, fishes, and
creeping things, that have their peculiar natures,
very different from one another.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36640:11"/>4. In the fourth and highest generall degree,
are no such special differences. We find only one
nature or species; humane. All men are of one and
the same nature, or kind. They differ only as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
individuals. One man may have many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
differences from, and excellencies above
another, in his personal constitution, qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
acquirements, or gifts; but his nature is one
and the same with his fellows. If God strip such a
man of his accidental ornaments in mind or body,
whereby he excell'd others, (as is familiar to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation)
he does not thereby lose his nature;
which demonstrates that those differencing inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
to his person, advanc'd him not above the
sphere of that nature, which all men partake of.
When many peeces of cloth, equal in worth, are
variously coloured, the different value of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded
tinctures makes them to be of different
prices. But all such differences are accidental to
the clothes. All men have the rational powers,
called understanding and will, which equally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
them from all inferiour creatures. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
differences, incident to these rational
powers, may render some men fit to ascend over
the heads of others, into places of superiority.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Having thus taken notice of the differences that
are found in the three inferiour orders of things,
both general and special, let us now observe the
difference that is found in the nature of man, from
them all, which also is both general and special.

is wholly delectable, and that in him alone is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
satisfaction to be had. He is an infinite,
boundless good, and he is communicable to us, or
capable to be enjoy'd by us. Yea, even his own
infinite understanding and desire have absolute
and compleat satisfaction in his own infinite
being, and unutterably desireable goodnes.</p>
                  <p>2. Having thus ascended by the creatures, to
some general knowledg of the creatour, as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in wisdom, power, goodnes, and all possible
perfections; let us descend again to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ourselvs, and of our duty towards God.
Man is generally differenced from brut's, by his
understanding and will. All things then that we
rightly conclude from this general difference,
must be concluded from the due consideration of
his understanding or will, or both together. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he is bound to doe, as a man, perteins to one
or both of these powers. These ought he to use in
such a way only, as is conducible to his own true
good, perfection, and blessednes; and not against
himself, to his own disadvantage, damage and
destruction. Whatever any creature received from
the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God that made it, it received to its own
advantage, and ought to use it so. Inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
fail not so to use it; and shall man only, the
master-peece and lord of all the rest, miscarry in
this great point? Each element enlarges itself as
much as it can, and destroy's its contrary, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
does any thing against itself. Things of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36640:12"/>
degree, trees and plants, do draw conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
nourishment from the earth and water, for
their augmentation, growth, and support in life.
They fix their roots in the earth, and multiply
their kind. In like manner do things of the third
degree, beasts, birds, fishes, and creeping things.
They seek and lay hold on what's good for them;
flie, avoid, and refuse what's hurtful; and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themselvs by generation. And ought not man,
the lord of all these things, carefully to improve
what he has, to the glory of his maker, and his
own true profit and advantage (which is insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
connexed therewith) as much as he can; and
not at all against God, and consequently against
himself, to his own detriment? If he do abuse
them to his own ruine, he alone in the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
creation, act's contrary to the glory of God,
to his own true good, to the order of the universe,
and common law of nature in all creatures. He
alone, for whose use and service the rest were
made, does perversly deviate from the general or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and due course of nature, in all.</p>
                  <p>The rational powers of man, as they are more
excellent then any thing that is found in inferiour
creatures, so ought they more heedfully to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
to the praise of him that gave them, and
man's own true profit, advantage, joy, peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
and blessednes; not against the honour of
God, and so to his own damage. He ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
those <hi>fleshly, foolish, and hurtfull lusts, which war
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36640:13"/>
against his soul, and tend to the sinking and drowning
of him in destruction and perdition.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. We may conclude from this general diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of man from other creatures, by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and will (which are given him for his
own true profit and advantage) that his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is able to se and conclude such truths, as are
evidently conducible to his welbeing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and to oppose and reject the errours, contrary
thereunto. T'is his true interest and advantage,
that there is a God, infinitly powerful, wise, holy,
just, and good; that there is a resurrection, and an
eternal reward of just men; that God is able so to
principle and qualify men, as to render them fit
for such reward. These, with many other truths,
which conduce to the true good and blessednes of
man, may and ought, on that very account, to be
owned and asserted. If the contraries thereunto be
enterteined, owned, and asserted by him, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
which was given him to use for his
profit, is abused to his ruine, against the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He enterteins and own's false perswasions,
destructive to his own being, enemies to his own
soul; and so abuses his understanding, to his da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
despondency, and ruine, that was given
him to use for his profit and salvation. He does
thereby, what in him lies, destroy and render void
his own nature and all the rest, even the whole u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,
whereas inferiour creatures do exactly
use and improve their various natural powers to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36640:13"/>
their own advantage, and for the preservation of
the universe.</p>
                  <p>4. By man's will and the freedom thereof, duly
considered, may we yet attein a more distinct and
ful knowledg of God, of ourselvs, and of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
and duty to God. Inferiour creatures have
no power over their own operations. They act by
natural impulse and necessity. Man ha's power to
consider of any thing, and deliberate within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whether he were best to do it or no, before he
does it. He know's his own works, and can judg
of his own actions, whether they be good or evil.
By the freedom of his will, he is lord of his own
operations. His works may properly be called his
own, as done by the choice of his own will. Other
creatures may rather be said to be acted, then to
act, being carried by such an instinct and impulse,
planted in them by the creatour, as determin's
them constantly one way, exclusive to any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of deliberation or choice. Hence it follow's,
that the works of man, being properly his own,
are imputable to him; the works of inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
not so to them. They sin not, because they
have no power to do any thing upon deliberation,
and by choice. Hence also may we conclude, that
the works of man are honourable and praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
or culpable and shameful. The former are
capable of approbation and reward: the latter, of
detestation and punishment. The actions of man
do leave behind them desert or guilt. They do
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36640:14"/>
adorn and cloath, or stain, vitiate and corrupt
him, accordingly as they are good or evil. The
actions of other creatures have none of all these
properties. Good actions do more and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and incline a man to good: evil ones do more
deprave him, habituate and incline him unto evil.
If man use not his understanding and will aright,
in doing what he ought, he perverts what was
given him for his good, to his own damage and
confusion, and to the disturbance of the general
order and harmony of the universe.</p>
                  <p>Four things do follow the works of man, desert,
guilt, reward, punishment. Desert is the natural
consequent of a good work; reward a consequent
of desert. Guilt is the natural consequent of an evil
work; and punishment is the certain consequent
of guilt. The inseperable properties of the works
of man, in distinction from the works of inferiour
creatures, are, first; that they are his own; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they are imputable to him; thirdly, that
they leave merit or demerit, desert or guilt behind
them; fourthly, that therefore reward or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is due unto man, for them.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Another use or fruit of this general

                  <p>FOrasmuch as the rewards and punishments,
due unto all the good and evil works of man,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36640:14"/>
are not dispensable by man; there must needs be
some one above him, that can reward and punish
him, in a suitablenes and correspondency to his
works. This can be no other but God alone, who
exactly know's all the works of all men, with all
their aggravations and dimensions, to the full. If
man can sin and deserve punishment, some one
there is against whom he sin's, who know's all his
sins, and can punish or pardon him. Both the fault,
and the consequent guilt, obligation, or debt
thereby contracted, do argue there is a God, that
can punish man for his sins. This then is a good
argument; man can sin, therefore there is a God;
and this also; Man can do and deserve well, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a God, <hi>who is a rewarder of them that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
seek him.</hi> Heb. 11. 6. Thus from the works
of man, as man, we may conclude there is a God,
who is the only meet rewarder and punisher of
his actions.</p>
                  <p>We may farther conclude from the works of
men, and the recompence thereof, both wayes, in
rewards and punishments, that the rewarder and
punisher thereof is omniscient, omnipotent, and
most just. He perfectly know's all the thoughts,
intentions, desires, words, and actions of all men,
that ever were, are, or shalbe. So can he exactly
proportion rewards and punishments thereunto.
He must be absolutely infallible in his knowledg
of all the circumstances and aggravations of every
step man makes, within or without, in thought,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36640:15"/>
word, or deed. Otherwise, how can he be exactly
and absolutly just, in recompencing them? And
how numberless are the thoughts, words, and
actions of one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in a race of 40, 50 or 60 yeers,
more or less? How innumerable then must all the
works, words, desires and thoughts of many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of men, in all places and ages of the world,
needs be? And what then must he be, that know's
all, in such sort, as exactly to proportion rewards
and punishments thereunto? <hi>His understanding</hi>
must be <hi>infinite,</hi> who is the infallible judg of all
these matters. And he must also be omnipotent,
that is able to perform, and effectually to dispense
such rightly proportion'd rewards and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
unto all men, for their numberless
thoughts, words, and actions, good or evil. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the due recompence of all may yet faile. As
for the justice of God, shall not the judg of all the
earth do right? can he do wrong? His will is the
supream rule of all justice.</p>
                  <p>To sum up all then. Man, by the free exercise
of his rational powers, can perform works good
or evill. There is therefore some rewarder and
punisher of all men: and he must be infinitly
wise, powerful, and just; that every thought,
word, and action of every man, may receive its
due recompence.</p>

judges, propounds; the latter chuses and
executes. The joynt operation of both, is required
in every free action: and therefore, as joyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
are they the proper reception and subject
of reward or punishment. The principal riches or
treasures then of man, as wel as his punishment,
must be spiritual and invisible, not corporeal, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
or visible. They are also everlasting, as the
powers that immediatly receive and possess them,
are. The chief good of man, as man, consists not
in any thing he has in common with beasts, and
therefore not in any thing that can be perceived
or received by such bodily senses and powers of
life, as he hath in common with them. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36640:16"/>
it consist's not in any bodily delights or
pleasures. Nor does the evil of man as man, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
consist in bodily punishment. They then
that place the chief good of man in things bodily,
visible, or sensible, do embrace and teach a lie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
others and themselvs, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>

creatures, whereby a yet more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
knowledg of him is to be gained.</head>
               <p>THe general difference of man from all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
things, by having what they have not,
is common to other degrees. The second hath
what the first hath not; the third, what the second
hath not. But there is a more peculiar and especial
difference of man from all inferiour creatures; and
that is, not that he has what they have not, but
that he know's both what they have, and what he
has, which none of them know. They know not
at all, what value they are of, in themselvs, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively
with one another. They know not of
what order or degree they are, or wherein they
differ from and excell one another. Beasts,
birds, fishes, and creeping things do not know
what they have received from the hand of their
creatour, beyond trees and plants. Nor do trees
and plants know what they stand possess'd of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36640:16"/>
elements, stones, metalls, mineralls, and all
inanimate compounds. Man only, in the whole
visible creation, know's what he hath of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and dignity above all the rest; and what they
have above one another. He know's also that
other creatures do not know either what he has,
or what themselvs have. He knows that he only
can know both.</p>
               <p>There are five degrees of difference to be found
amongst creatures; and four of them are peculiar
unto man.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Man has that in his nature, which no infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
creatures have. Things of the third degree
have also that in their nature, which no things in
the first or second have; &amp;c. So this difference is
common to other creatures, as wel as man.</item>
                  <item>2. The second difference is, that man know's
what he has, beyond other creatures; and what
they have, above and beyond one another. This
difference is special and peculiar unto man only.</item>
                  <item>3. Man know's that what he has, he has not
from himself, but hath receiv'd it from another;
and that other things have not what they have,
from themselvs, nor yet from him.</item>
                  <item>4. He can, by the right exercise and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his rational powers, find out him, from
whose bountifull hand, both he and all other
things have received what they have.</item>
                  <item>5. He hath a capacity of cleaving fast unto him,
when found out, and of being firmly and indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36640:17"/>
united with him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Again, man only can rejoyce in the things he
has; inferiour creatures, not. What can it
profit any creature to have a more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
nature then other things, unless it can
kuow what it has? To have a great treasure, and
not know it, will afford no matter of rejoycing.
Trees and plants, on this account, as not knowing
what they have, can have no joy in what they have
beyond things without life. On like account,
birds, beasts, and fishes, can have no joy or glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
from what they have, beyond trees, plants,
and other things, because they know not what
they have. For joy arises, not barely from the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of any thing, but from the knowing that we
have it, and of what value it is, in distinction from
other things. Yea, even this knowledg alone,
would nor yet be a sufficient ground of rejoycing
unto man, unless he could also know him, from
whose hand he has received all; unless he could
find him out, and hold him fast when found, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him and adhering to him eternally.</p>

               <p>INferiour creatures were not made for their own
sakes, but for man's; for his profit, necessity,
comfort, and instruction. For what does any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36640:17"/>
thing they have, profit themselvs, seing they
know not what they have? What they have, they
have it for man; and what is wanting in them, man
has. He alone know's what they have, and what he
has. They with man do make up one visible body,
city, or Kingdom, of which he is head, ruler, and
King. He, being the only creature for whose sake
they were all made, stands obliged to return praise
unto God, for himself and them. They are all
freely given unto him; and he ought to give up
himself unto God; and in himself, all the rest.
They received not what they have, for themselvs.
Man is the only receiver, properly, and God the
only giver. And there arises a natural obligation
in the receiver to the giver, from the gift recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
especially when great, and freely given. The
gift is all that man has in his own nature, and all
that inferiour creatures have in their natures, for
his use. There is no naturall debt or obligation
on them, to God; nor can they perform any such
thing. Man alone is obliged to paythe debt of
pure obedience and thankfulnes unto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
for himself and all the rest. He is not obliged
to inferiour creatures, for the service they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to him, because they serv him not by choice,
but naturall necessity. He only is bound unto God
for all, as affording therein, food for his body, and
instruction to his mind.</p>

               <head type="sub">Man is to be weighed and considered of, by
his parts, that it may be known of
what value he is.</head>
               <p>MAn can not fully know how much he is
obliged unto God for himself, unless he
rightly know of what value he is.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. For this, we may first consider him by his
general parts, as comprehending in his nature
and composition, whatever is to be found in the
whole creation. He has being, with things of the
first degree; life, with those of the second; sense,
with things of the third. And the being, life,
and sense they have, are inferiour to the being,
life, and sense he has, in conjunction with reason;
and are designed for the mainteining of his being,
life, and sense, as the end for which they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
The rational powers in man, ought to rule
over these inferiour generall parts of him, his
being, life, and sense; as also over all inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that have the like. The generall parts of
man then are four; being, life, sense, reason. The
three inferiour are more excellent in him, then in
other creatures, by personal union with the
fourth. All inferiour creatures then, by being yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
up to the service of man, as appointed, attein
in him a more excellent kind of being, life, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36640:18"/>
sense, then they have in themselvs, to wit, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
being and life of sense. But although as
they do enter the composition of man, they are
advanc'd beyond what they are in themselvs, such
their advance by a personall conjunction with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
powers, is gradual and proportionable to
the different worths thereof. The elements in
man's composition, are the immediate seat of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative
life, which he has in common with herbs
and trees. Vegetative life is the immediate seat
of sensitive; sensitive, with all its parts and powers,
is the immediate seat and servant of the rational
powers and operations. The rational or intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
life of man, having no other created kind
of life superiour thereunto, ought to be the seat
or throne wherein God alone is to sit and rule the
whole man, and all the world, made for man's use,
and put together in his constitution. The will and
understanding of man ought to be yeilded up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, in order to their becomming in seperably
united with and subjected to his mind and will.
Thus, as all other creatures come to be united in
man, so do they all in and with man, come to be
united with God. Man, by the resignation of his
will and understanding unto God, is therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
united with God. Other parts or powers
of life in man, are mediatly, by his rational or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
powers, united with God; as sensitive
life in man, is united immediatly with his ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
but vegetative life, mediatly, by the sensitive.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36640:19"/>
The whole world, as brought together in man,
comes to be inseperably united with God that
made it, when man comes to be so united with his
maker. Every man that declines or rejects the
means and way of being brought into such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable
union with God, does what in him lies
to frustrate and render void the principal inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God in creating the world. The rest of the
world was made for him. He therefore is of more
value then all the rest; and is more obliged to God
for himself, then for all the rest. He is responsible
or accountable unto God, for himself and for the
whole world, as made for him. He ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to seek out and gaine as right and cleer a
knowledg as he can, as to what he has received
from the hand of God, both in himself and other
creatures, that he may the better know and pay
the debt thereby contracted, to his creatour.</item>
                  <item>2. We may weigh and consider man in the two
principall parts of his composition, body and soul.
His body is <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made;</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
organized for all manner of operations of his
threefold life, vegetative, sensitive, and rational.
He is more bound unto God for his body only
then for the whole world besides. But much more
yet is he obliged to him, for his soul.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In tbe body we find a multiplicity and diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of excellent and fit organs; in the soul, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
multiplicity and diversity of excellent
faculties, whereby it is enabled to use all those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36640:19"/>
and perform all those various offices and
functions, in and by the body, which are conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the good of the whole person. An artist has
divers instruments, for various artificial purposes;
the soul, on like account, his divers bodily organs
or instruments, for various natural uses. Man has
a kind of Kingdom as wel as world, within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
In this kingdom are three orders, or distinct
powers, lowest, middle, and supream.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The lowest powers of life and operation
in man, the nutritive, augmentative, and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
(all of them comprehended under the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative)
have four attendent of subservient facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with in the compass of vegetative life and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration;
to wit, the attractive, retentive, diges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and expulsive powers. These all are as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
and merchants in the kingdom of man.
They do incessantly labour to sustein and keep
up the other more noble orders and excellent
powers of this kingdom, within man. If they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
not their severall offices, and respective char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the whole fabrick fall's, the man dies, and the
kingdom is dissolved. The office of the attractive
or appetitive power, is to desire and receive food.
The office of the retentive, to keep it in, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
The digestive and concoctive powers do
gradually prepare and transform it into flesh,
blood, and spirits. The expulsive cast's out the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities,
by way of evacuation sensible, as also
insensibly, by perspiration through the pores of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36640:20"/>
the body. By this means is the body nourished,
augmented, and fitted for generation. All these
offices does the vegetative power of life in the
soul of man perform by various bodily organs or
instruments; and without them it cannot exercise
any such faculties, or perform any such offices.
And as the organs are stronger or weaker, better
or worse temper'd, accordingly are such offices
performed.</item>
                  <item>2. There are a middle sort of powers in man, the
sensitive, perform'd by outward and inward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.
By outward organs are the powers, of seing,
hearing smelling, tasting, touching, performed;
to wit, by eyes, ears, nose, palate, and the whole
body, which is the organ of touching. By inward
organs, within the head of man, calculated and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereunto, do the common sense, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and memorative powers of the soul, perform
their several offices. The visive power, by the eye,
discerns and distinguishes the colours, forms, and
figures of things. The auditive, by the ear, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv's
and distinguishes sounds, words, &amp;c, The
olfactive perceivs and distinguishes different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
or smells, &amp;c. These are their offices. We
may observ a kind of natural matrimony between
the several organs of the body, on the one part,
and the correspondent faculties of the soul, on the
other. The body has a multitude of excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
without and within. The soul has a wel-proportion'd
multitude of excellent faculties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36640:20"/>
only in conjunction with these organs.
Besides these corporeal, organical powers in man,
hitherto named, he has also a loco-motive power,
by contracting and extending the parts of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whereby he can goe from place to place, and
perform all artificial works, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. The supream and most noble powers in the
kingdom of man, are the rational or intellectual,
whose office it is to order and regulate all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour,
both vegetative and sensitive. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is the chief counsellour of state in
the soul, judging, discerning, and advising what's
to be done. The will is commander in chief, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with a kind of kingly, imperiall, executive
power.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Man, thus furnish'd and adorn'd with many
wonderful natural powers in his soule, and organs
in his body (and having also in his personal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
being, life, and sense, in a superiority to
what is found in the three inferiour orders of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
because in conjunction with reason, which
render's him the fourth and highest) may well be
termed a microcosm, or little world, an epitome
of the whole universe. All that man has in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and all that is to be found in the whole visible
creation, set up and ordeined for his use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
proceeds from the meer bounty and love of
his creatour. The love of God to man is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
thing of all. It is of like infinite excellency
with himself, <hi>for God is love.</hi> Jo. 4. 8. Great are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36640:21"/>
the gifts of God unto man, that have proceeded
from, and do manifest his love. But his love to
man is infinitly greater then all his other gifts; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
more valuable then man himself, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures, given for his use. Thus is there an
infinite and unspeakable obligation on man to
God, first; for his infinite love; and secondly, for
his unspeakable gifts. But the knowledg of all this,
will little availe man, unless his will be yeilded up
in such sort unto the will of God, as to be brought
into unchangable harmony therewith, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
thereunto.</p>

                  <p>LOve. Something he has to render unto God,
that may properly be called his own; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would he be obliged to an impossibility. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as the love of God is his principal gift unto
man, the root and foundation of all his other gifts
(which are but as tokens and manifestations of
that) the intire, free, and most syncere love of man
to God, is the most natural, reasonable, and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
requital, that 'tis possible for him to make unto
the lord, for his love, and all his benefits. Love
is the most precious and excellent gift, the will
of man has to dispose of, freely and uncompulsori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36640:21"/>
where it list's. Thus have we found the thing
we sought for, love, seated in the supream ruling
power in man, his will. Syncere love to God, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that in and with it, which is the best requital
man can make for all that God has done for him.
It does comprehend in it all that God requires of
him. It is written; <hi>thou shalt love the Lord thy God,
with all thy heart, soul, strength, and mind; and thy
neighbour as thy self.</hi> Luk. 10. 27. <hi>Love is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the law.</hi> Rom. 13. 10. Love is the radical
gift of God unto man, from whence did issue forth
all other gifts. And by the love of man to God, as
the prime and radical gift he has to return, will
all the secondary gifts of God, that are tokens and
manifestations of God's love to him, in his own
and all inferiour nature, be surrendred and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
used, and improved to the praise of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
Man's love to God will cause him to <hi>glorify
God in his body and in his spirit, which are God's.</hi> 1
Cor. 6. 20. Love then is the most natural, orderly,
proportion'd retribution, and therefore the most
pleasing and acceptable unto God, that man can
make. No other gifts or performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
can be acceptable unto God, unlesse love
be the root and spring from whence they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
Love, as it is the first, so is it incomparably
the greatest gift of God to man, or man to God.
The love of man to God, is that which season's,
qualifies, and render's acceptable all his other
gifts and performances. God first loved man; man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36640:22"/>
therefore ought to love God, and that in the first
place, above all; and no other things, but for his
sake, or as bearing his image and superscription
stamp'd or impress'd upon them. Otherwise, his
love to God will carry no correspondency with
God's love to him, and so will not be accepted.
Though the most absolute and perfect love of
man to God, can, in no wise, equal the infinite
love of God to him, yet being the best thing man
can give, it wilbe accepted. The love of God to
man, as much exceeds all possible love of man to
God, as the being of <hi>God</hi> who <hi>is love,</hi> excell's the
being of man; that is, infinitely. But if man give
all that God requires of him, even all he has to
give, it wilbe accepted. There is no pain, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes,
or trouble in love. It alleviates all other
labour, and renders all right performances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull.
Our love rightly plac'd and fix'd, begets
continual delight and gladnes of heart.</p>

needs have incomparably more profit from his
service of love, freely performed unto God, then
from any service that inferiour creatur's do by a

And the more perfectly any man serv's God, the
more profit he receiv's unto himself. 'Tis the true

                  <p>The service, other creatures perform to man, is
not remunerable or capable of reward, because not
freely performed, but by natural necessity. The
service perform'd by man to God, being free, is
remunerable. Man then receiving all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by both services, let us distinctly consider
what profit he receiv's by the first, and what by
the second.</p>
                  <p>By the first, perform'd by other creatures unto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36640:23"/>
him, his being is for a while continued in this
mortal state. By the second, performable by him
in Christ, unto God, is his everlasting wel-being
atteinable. So much then as the eternal wel-being
of man, excell's his bare temporal being in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
body, does the second service exceed the first,
in dignity and profit. A bare being, is not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto man, unless he may have a wel-being.
Other creatures then by serving him with all they
have, unless he serv God with all he has, will but
aggravate his sin and adde to his misery. Being was
given unto man, in order to his wel-being; So is
the service of other creatures performed unto
man, for his temporary being in this world, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that service he ought to perform unto God,
with reference to his eternal wel-being, in the
world to come. If the second service be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by man to God; the first, to wit, of other
creatures unto him, is render'd void and to no

to the service of the devil, in enmity to God.
All the service perform'd by other creatures to a
man that serv's not God, is lost, or worse. The
main end and chief design of God in creating the
world, is frustrated and rendred of no effect, by
the man that serv's not God.</p>
                  <p>We do plainly experience that man can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his being in this world, unless maintein'd

continue or subsist, unless upheld by the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36640:23"/>
same hand that made them. If they could, they
would be greater in this point of self-preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then man. Man can't maintein them in being,
but is maintein'd by them. Some other hand then
above both, mainteins them, and him by them.
But man alone stands indebted unto God, as for
his own being and theirs, so for the continuance
of both.</p>
                  <p>By the first service, perform'd by inferiour
creatures unto man, they are brought into union
with him. By the second, performed by man unto
God, he is brought into union with God. So in
and by man, the world comes to be united with
God. All things that came out of the love of God
to man, by the love of man to God are brought
into union with him that made them. He then
that does not love and serve the lord, does what in
him lies towards the disjoyning and seperating of
the world from God, and the bringing of all things
into disorder and confusion. Man alone (in whose
nature and constitution all sorts of created na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
life, and being are put together) is the means
in and by whom all inferiour creatures come to be
united with God.</p>

                  <p>FRom the first obligation on man, or debt of
love which he owes unto God, does naturally
arise a second, like unto it; and that is the love of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36640:24"/>
all creatures, as the works of his hands, and as bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any thing of his image, or superscription up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; on which account, himself pass'd that
universal approbation, that <hi>every thing that he had
made, was very good.</hi> Gen. 1. 31. But forasmuch as
amongst all things there mention'd, men, for
whom the rest were made, do beare the most
compleat and lively image of God upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, they
are, on God's account, to be loved by us, more
then any inferiour creatures. All men, as of one
and the same nature, ought to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
as one man, not many. There ought, by the
very law of nature, to be the strictest union, the
greatest peace and agreement amongst them,
that's possible. As their love of God in the first
place, so is the love of one another in the second,
as bearing his image, founded in the law of nature.
<hi>Thou shalt love the lord thy God, with all thy heart,
soul, strength and mind,</hi> say's Christ. <hi>This is the first
and great commandment. And the second is like unto
it; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dments hang all the law and the prophets.</hi> Mat.
22. 37, 40. All men are bound by the law of their
own nature, to live in perfect union with God,
and with one another, by love. The greatest unity
amongst men, arises from their first being united
with God: and the firmer their union, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their strength. Self-love divides us from God,
and consequently from one another. So come we
to lose that strength which depend's on union,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36640:24"/>
and to lie naked and exposed, in our own single
persons, to all the wiles and darts of the devil; &amp;c.
Inferiour creatures are to be loved by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, only on
God's account, as the works of his hands, bearing
some characters and shadowy resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of his
infinitly persect being and life. We are not to look
on ourselvs as obliged to them, for any benefit,
use or service we receive from them, or have of
them; but unto God only, who causes them to
perform such beneficiall service. The loving of
inferiour creatures, as gratifying, our sensual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
is so far from being a natural consequent of
our loving God, that 'tis direct enmity to him.
Such <hi>love of this world</hi> and the things thereof, <hi>is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God. If any man thus love the world, the love of
the father is not in him.</hi> Jam. 4. 4. 1 Jo. 2. 15. To
ask of God creature-contentments, to <hi>consume
upon our lusts,</hi> (Jam. 4. 3.) is to desire him that he
would maintein us in our enmity against himself.
The multiplicity of heathen Gods, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
idolatries in the world, have arisen from
man's unlawful, prohibited love of inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Many heathens concluded that any thing
that did them good, was a God. On this account
were they induced to worship the sun, moon,
stars, fire, air, earth, water, sheep, oxen, &amp;c. Such
unlawfull, idolatrous love of inferiour creatures,
has its rise, as a natural consequent, from self-love.
When we love our own wills, in distinction from
and opposition to God's, we love the creatures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36640:25"/>
for our use, only as they do gratify our
wills in enmity to god; and not at all as the works
of his hands, or as bearing any thing of his image
and superscription upon them.</p>

fruit of love.</head>
               <p>LOve is the only treasure man has, properly,
to dispose of. If it be rightly bestow'd, 'tis
good, and the man so too; if wrongly, evil. When
'tis given, the thing chiefly beloved obteins do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over it, and so over the whole man. The
will is the ruling power in man, commands all the
rest of him. To whom or whatsoever a man's
whole love is given, his whole will is given; and
consequently, the whole man. As the chief love
is, so is the man, good or evil. Nothing better
then a right love, nothing worse then a wrong.
Love, being all we can properly call our own,
when we give that, we give all we have. If
then we mis bestow and lose that, we lose all. We
are undone. We lose it, when we give it where it
is not due; whereby we dishonour and provoke
him, to whom alone it is due. Good love is the
root of all other vertues; evil love, the root of all
other vices. He that has a right knowledg of
love, know's the whole good of man. He that
know's not the nature of love, is ignorant of
the whole good of man. The proper nature and
inseperable condition of love, is, that thereby the
lover is tranformed into and united with the thing
loved. The lover and chiefly beloved are of two
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36640:26"/>
things, made one, by love. The thang brought
upon the lover by the beloved, through the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
assimilating property of love, is not
forc'd, violent, painful, or laborious; but free, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
pleasant and delightfull. The will, and so
the whole man is denominated from the thing
chiefly loved. If earthly things be chiefly loved,
he is an earthly man; has an earthly will. If god be
his chief beloved, he is a heavenly man, has a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
will. By love a man is capable of being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and brought into union with another
thing, better then himself, as god; or equal to
himself, as man; or inferiour to himself, as earth,
gold, beasts, houses, lands, &amp;c. The first union
advances him, the last degrades him. Through
love, as wel or ill plac'd, is man capable of ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and being exalted above himself; or of being
vilified, degraded, corrupted, and so of descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
below his own natural dignity in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
He ascend's or descend's, is advanced or
depressed, enobled or abased, accordingly as the
thing chiefly loved by him, is more or lesse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
then himself. If he place his chief love on
what's equal to him, he ascend's not, nor advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
himself, at all; but indeed, does deprave and
abase himself, because he sin's, in giving away
god's peculiar due, to any creature whatsoever.
God alone, who is infinitly above us, and infinitly
deserv's our chief love, does undispensably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it; and by having it, will unspeakably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36640:26"/>
us. <hi>Those that so honour him, he will honour.</hi>
1 Sam. 2. 30.</p>
               <p>The chiefly beloved, is to the will of man, by
love, as the bridegroom to the bride. There's a
kind of matrimonial union, contracted by love,
between the will and its chiefly beloved; the thing
so loved, becomming the husband; and the will,
the wife. And as the woman, ought to have but
one husband, the will can have but one chiefly
beloved.</p>
               <p>If a poor mean man should have eight daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and one of them should marry a man of like
meaness with herself; the second, a gentleman;
the third, an esquire; the fourth, a knight; the fift,
and earl; the sixt, a duke; the seventh, a king; the
eighth, an emperour; they would ascend one over
the head of another, according to the several dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of their husbands. But though we may find
many husbands, or chiefly beloveds (of different
degrees) amongst creatures, for the will of man;
there is, indeed, none but God himself, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
emperour and king of kings, who can truly
dignify, ennoble, and adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce our will, by its being
brought into a state of unchangable marriage-u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with his. To a greater dignity it cannot
ascend, then is so atteinable. But the wills of men,
which are equal by nature, contract some gradual
difference in dignity, within the compass of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-beloveds.
They are called earthly, brutish, or
humane, accordingly as their husband or chief-beloved
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36640:27"/>
is. But there is no creature-beloved, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
below God, which finally rested in, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, will not leave the will and whole person
exposed to eternal confusion. We can never attein
any true hapines, but by the marriage-union of our
will with God's. Nothing is worthy to be our
chief beloved, that cannot truly meliorate and
ennoble us. God only can do thi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

can hurt that beloved, or <hi>separate us from his love;
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers; nor things present, nor things to come; nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature.</hi> Rom. 8. 38,
39. But if our will be joyned to some poor, weak,
slight, feeble, indigent, variable, insufficient thing,
as its chiefly beloved; it is in continual tribulation;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36640:27"/>
or, at best, can have no true and wel-grounded
security, rest, peace, or comfort, at all.</p>
               <p>This doctrine about the right transmutation of
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>'s will (by resignation to, and union with god's,
to his unspeakable advantage) is signified to him
by such natural and advantageous transmutations
as are observable in inferiour creatures. Things
of the lowest degree, are changed or tranform'd
into things of the second: things of the second, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those of the third; and all, into man, the only
creature in the fourth. The elements are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
as they run-together into the composition
of trees and plants. These, with their fruits, roots,
&amp;c. are transform'd into things of the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
whereby they receive a more noble being,
in the life of sense. And all are farther advanc'd, by
way of transformation, into the life of man, in
whom they do attein a yet more noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
kind of being. And man, by rightly placing
his love upon God, so as to live in his will, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
all, in his own person and nature, into uncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
union with God. By this last transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
do all things, in man, attein the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
kind of being that is possible for them to
have. If man be not induced freely to yield up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the will of God, by this last and utmost
transformation, he thwart's the naturall order
and course of the whole universe, to his own
destruction. Inferiour things do most orderly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
their advance, by quitting their own form's,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36640:28"/>
and ascending into personal union with rational
nature, in him. If he refuse to quit the naturall
activity, life, and freedom of his rationall powers,
to live in the transcendently more excellent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and power of the mind and will of God, as
partaker of the divine nature, he, for whom all
the rest were made, is the only disorderly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to his own eternal damage and confusion.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Two first loves, or chiefly beloveds.</head>
                  <p>THere are properly but two principal loves
or beloveds, God and self, his will or our
own. The love of God carries our will
forth to a right, general, universal love of all
things, as the works of his hands, loved and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by him. If our own will be, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
upon itself, our chiefly beloved; such a
narrow private love will not carry us forth to a
right love of any other things; but will cause us to
regard or value them, no otherwise, then as rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or subservient unto the great idol, self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
We shall love only ourselvs in them; not
them, as the works of God's hands, related to,
and approved by him. To these two chief loves,
of God or self, are all other loves reducible, as
flowing from the one or other of them.</p>
                  <p>There can be but one thing chiefly beloved, for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36640:28"/>
whose sake only, other things, in connexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
or as related thereunto, are loved. All other
subordinate loves to all other things, considered
as in harmony, correspondence, union, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with the chief beloved, are included in the
first love, as the basis and cause of all; the root
and fountain, whence they do pullulate and arise.
All are but as one love, centring in, and relating
to the chief beloved. Tis the chief beloved only,
that is properly loved in all other things. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is in conjunction with that, must necessarily
be loved: and whatever is against it, or contrary
to it, will as certainly be hated. It is so strongly
and intimately united with the will; does so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
and intirely draw and engage it unto itself,
that it suffers it not to love any other thing but for
it's sake, as in harmony with, and subserviency
thereunto. By necessary consequence, so many
particular hatreds wilbe begotten in the will, as
there are things contrary to, or against its chief
beloved; and as many particular subordinate and
secondary loves, as there are things in harmony
and union therewith. If the radical or chief love
be good, just, and orderly, all the rest are so too:
if evil, corrupt, and disorderly; so are the rest. As
is the root, such are the branches: as the fountain,
so are the streams issuing there-from.</p>
                  <p>Self-love is a narrow, private, unlawfull, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
thing, the fountain and root of all false
and unlawful loves of other things. If the love of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36640:29"/>
God be not the chief, the love of the creature is.
And amongst the creatures, that which is most
neer and dear unto the will, wilbe its chief belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and that is the will itself, which can reflect its
love upon itself, as the most dear, lovely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable
thing to itself. If then God be not a man's
chief beloved, his own will or himself most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is. And then he loves neither God, nor any
other creature, but as conducible to the gratifying
and pleasing of his selfish, private, narrow will. If
he do seem to have some regard unto God, so as to
pray to him; he does, in such demeanour, but
make use of God in a subserviency to his own sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish
will. <hi>He askes</hi> things of God, <hi>to consume upon
his lusts.</hi> Jam. 4. 3. He regards not God, any body
or any thing else, but as conducible and helpful
towards the bringing in <hi>provisions for his flesh, to
fulfill the lusts thereof.</hi> Rom. 13. 14.</p>
                  <p>In the first sin of Adam, we all turn'd away from
God, into the love of our own will, in distinction
from and opposition to his. Such self-love can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be destroy'd or eradicated, but by the irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grace of God, which alone can cause man's
will freely to draw off and disengage its love from
every thing else, in order to the receiving of the
omnipotent creatour in the room of a fraile, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
creature, as its chief beloved. By receiving
God for its beloved, it is furnish'd with the power
and armour of God, ha's the power of godlines in
it, whereby to withstand all the powers and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36640:29"/>
works of darkness. No created being can bear up
against a man that's thus furnished with power
from on high. <hi>If God be for us,</hi> in us, with us, <hi>who
can be against us?</hi> Rom. 8. 31.</p>

                  <p>THese two chief loves are capital enemies of
each other, contending for primacy. The
primacy is due to god alone; and he has no enemy
to contest with, but self love. As he is infinitly
above all, so ought he to be loved above all. The
prerogative and honour of being our chief belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
does, on all accounts, belong to him alone.
Whatever then stands in competition with, or
oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, in this point, ought to be look'd
upon and handled as the capital enemy of god.</p>
                  <p>Self-love is an unjust, false, tortuous, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
love, contrary to god, to truth, to the good
of man, to the order and voice of nature in the
whole universe. Tis the root of all other evil
loves, of all vice, injustice, iniquity. To deny God
the first place in our hearts, and to place our selvs
in his room, is a high contempt of him, a denying
and jusslling him out of what is his due by the law
of nature. When a man bestow's his chief love on
himself, he offends God, both as he is the giver
and receiver of his own love. He gives and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv's
that unto himself, which is indispensabiy
and undeniably due to God alone. So, on both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36640:30"/>
as giver and receiver thereof, is he the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
enemy of God. If he should bestow his chief
love on some other creature, and not on himself,
he would be the enemy of God, only as the giver
away of his right unto another, but not as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
thereof.</p>
                  <p>By self-love, man preferr's his own will to
God's, and so makes himself his God. In pursuit
of self-interest, he will desire to annihilate God,
which is the highest enmity to him, imaginable.
His will, by self-love, assum's an absolute prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
refusing to follow or obey another will, which
is the incommunicable prerogative of God alone.
Tis peculiar to him only, to follow his own will,
and not be subject unto, or lead by any other.</p>
                  <p>When a man has once proudly set up his own
will in the room of God's, he wil also rob God of
his other dues. He will desire his own honour, his
own glory, his own praise, not God's. When he
hath presumptuously made himself his God, he
will desire all those things for himself, that are due
to god. Self-love erects a new Kingdom, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and soveraignty within man, out of God,
and against him, which renders man a direct capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
enemy of God.</p>
                  <p>Man's love of God or himself, is the root and
cause of all he does. The love of God in him, is
the root and fountain of all good actions. 'Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the fountain of all other right love, of all true
friendship, courage, rest, peace, comfort, light,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36640:30"/>
joy, gladnes, and whatever is truly good for man.</p>
                  <p>Self-love then, as the capital enemy of the love
of God, is the root of all evil actions, of all injus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
sin, blindnes, ignorance, and so of all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row's
and evils, incident unto man. He that by
selflove exalt's his own will, into the roo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god's,
find's this false god to be but a weak, indigent
thing. This puts him upon agreedy and eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
after innumerable vanities, corruptible, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient
things, for the support of his impotent, false
God, himself; and so render's him subject unto
those things, which by nature are inferiour to
him. Such a man must needs be in continuall sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude
and tribulation, his false God and all the
supports thereof, being but feeble, fickle, unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
indigent things; and the true, omnipotent,
all-sufficient God, being all along against him.
Thus have we seen how selflove renders a man
the capital enemy of God, evil and perverse in
himself, exposed to all evils, and slavishly subject
to abundance of transitory things, inferiour to his
own nature.</p>
                  <p>The love of God render's the will divine, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
communicative and bountiful to others.
Selflove renders it narrow, private, incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to others; all for itself. The love of god makes
the will just, holy, righteous, meek, good, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
friendly, humble. Selflove makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
evil, perverse, proud, unquiet, litigious, ful of
discord, tumult, and confusion. The love of God
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36640:31"/>
gives the will of man dominion over all inferiour
creatures: Self-love brings it into bondage and
captivity under them. The love of God makes the
will unmoveable, firm, stable, and fixed: self-love
renders it a fluctuating, unstable, variable thing.
In a word, the love of God makes it beautiful and
lovely: Self-love makes it filthy, deformed, and
detestable. He then that know's what the love of
God is, know's all the good of man. He that
know's what self love is, know's all the evil of
man. He that's ignorant of both, know's neither
the good nor evil of man, in the two distinct roots
and causes of all. He that has the love of God in
him, is thereby so illuminated, that he know's
what that is, and what self-love is, together with
the comfortable consequents of the former, and
sad consequents of the latter. But he that lives
in self-love, is thereby darkned, blinded, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
as to the making any right judgment
of himself. He neither know's what the love
of God is, nor what self love is; nor what are the
good or evil consequents of the one or other, unto
man. The root of all evil in and to man, self love,
is the greatest evil; but the most lurking, hidden,
undiscern'd thing of all the rest. It obscures and
blind's the mind of man, that it may not be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
in its native, ethiopian hiew.</p>

                  <p>MAn, having two principal parts in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
a soul, and a body, has distinct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in reference to each; but all centring in self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest.
The soul desires praise, honour, and the
like, in reference to itself. In reference to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it desires and affects sensual delights. Self-love
then puts a man upon the seeking and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his own honour and bodily pleasur's, as his
two principal goods. And from these two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
branches of self-love, do arise the secondary
loves of all other things, as tending to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
defence, or preservation of his own honour
and sensual pleasur's. On these accounts, he must
needs love, desire, and seek after outward riches,
as conducible both to his honour and pleasures.
He will also desire and seek after humane scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
offices, and dignities, as tending to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his honour.</p>
                  <p>Thus from self-love do arise these vicious, evil,
corrupt loves in man; pride, which is the love of
his own honour, with a glorying in it; luxury and
gluttony, which is the love of bodily delights; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnes,
which is the inordinate love of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things. And he that loves his own honour
and pleasur's, does by necessary consequence hate
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36640:32"/>
every thing, that tends to the diminution or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
thereof. Hence arises anger, which is a
love and desire of revenge against those that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to diminish his honour or bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur's.
Hence also spring's up another monster, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
which contein's in it a hatred of any other's
good, as it tend's to the obscuring or diminution
of his; as also a love of and delight in another's
evil, if it diminish not, but rather tend to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of his good. From the love of bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
do arise negligence, sloth, intemperance,
incontinency, and the rest. Thus may we se, how
that all vices do arise and spring up from self-love.</p>

               <head type="sub">From self-love may we argue our duty to god.</head>
               <p>BY self-love may man find, even from within
himself, as the neerest and most evidencing
example that's possible, what it is he owes unto
God. For having by self-love made himself his
God, he gives, seeks, and ascrib's unto himself,
all things that he ought to give unto God. He
seek's his own honour, praise, and glory, not
God's. But thereby may he know what belong's
unto God, into whose room he hath thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
By the consequents of loving himself, and
following his own will, may be certainly know
what would be the consequents of loving God
and following of his will. He now seek's his own
honour, above all other honour, of God or men:
he does all he can, to preserv, defend, and encrease
it. From hence may be certainly conclude, that
he ought to seek, defend, propagate, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the honour of God in the hearts of men, to his
utmost; that he ought to hate, oppose, and do all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36640:33"/>
he can, to diminish and abolish any honour that's
contrary thereunto. In a word; all things a man
does from an evil principle of self-love, or would
have done by others, to and for himself, ought he
to do, and desire may be done by others, unto god.</p>

the love of God, and self.</head>
                  <p>THat which is finally expected and desired by
man, from other creatur's, is fruit. Every
kind of fruit has its proper seed; and every seed
brings forth its peculiar fruit, distinct from others.
The will of man is a kind of spiritual field, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two chief loves, as two very different seeds,
are sown; self love, and the love of God. Let us
now enquire after the final fruit producible from
these two seeds or roots, which being contrary
to each other, the fruits must needs be so too.</p>
                  <p>Endless joy and endless sorrow wilbe the two
final fruits, springing up in the field of man's will,
from the love of God, or self. Man seek's for joy
in all he does; hates and flee's sorrow. True joy
springs up only from the love of God; true sorrow,
from self-love.</p>
                  <p>God only is that infinite, invariable, al-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
good, which when man firmly loves and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys,
he hath joy enough; and that such, as none
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36640:34"/>
can ever deprive him of. Tis a fixed, solid, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
joy. Such as the thing chiefly loved is, such
is the love, and such the joy arising therefrom.
The nature, conditions, and properties of such
joy as arises from the love of God, are the same
with those of the love of God, above demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The fruit is of the same nature with the root.
If the love of god be a just, holy, true, orderly, pure,
clean, excellent love, suitable to the nature of
man and of God; the joy arising therefrom, is also
a just, holy, true, orderly, pure, righteous, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
joy. Such joy will endure as long as the love
it spring's from; and such love will endure as long
as the thing beloved, God. The heart then that's
fix'd on God, will have everlasting gladnes,
eternal pleasure, delight, complacency, rest,
peace, satisfaction, jubilations. Joy dilat's, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies,
comfort's, delight's the heart of man. Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
contract's, weaken's, discourages, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy's
it. He that has perpetual joy, has perpetual
life; he that has perpetual sorrow, has perpetual
death.</p>
                  <p>God is an alsufficient, inexhaustible fountain
of life and joy eternal, to innumerable creatur's,
without any diminution to himself. Nor will the
joy which any man will have eternally in God, be
any way's diminished, but increased by the like
joy in other men. If the holy angels rejoyce afresh
at the conversion of a sinfull man unto God, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
an addition thereby to their former joy,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36640:34"/>
how can it be but that all elect men and angels
should eternally and mutually rejoyce in the joy
which all of them will have in the lord?</p>
                  <p>By how much the more cleerly any man sees
and know's the lord, so much the more will he
love him, and rejoyce in him. Perfection of joy in
God, arises from the perfection of love to him;
and the perfection of such love arises from the
perfect knowledg of him. Nothing can destroy
such love, such joy, that cannot destroy God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with whom man is inseperably united by
such love.</p>

                  <p>THe perfection of man's eternal joy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes
in heaven, argues the resurrection of
his body. The spirit of man has a natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and love to its own body, as that which was
fashion'd by the hand of God, and brought into a
kind of natural marriage-union with it. The body
alone is not a man, nor yet the spirit; but both, as
put together in personal union. The recovery and
restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body then, after it is laid down by
death, cannot but be naturally desired by the spirit,
as a necessary ingredie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the compositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
man. Till he hath all the essentialls of his humane
constitution about him, so as to be compleated in
his personal being, wanting nothing that may
justly he desired by him, his joy cannot be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36640:35"/>
perfect and compleat. And on the same
ground that we may conclude the body wilbe res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored,
may we farther conclude, that it wilbe res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored
in a state most proportion'd, lovely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable

                     </gap>ly,
glorious, impassible, immortal, agile, spiritual
body. He that can advance the soul into a higher
and more excellent state then at first he gave it,
will proportionally rarefy, spiritualize, and exalt
the body, at the resurrection, into a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
state, then when <hi>formed</hi> by him <hi>out of the

2. Pet. 1. 4. the body, by its proportionable
transformation, will ascend into a spiritualty of
being, as partaker of the very nature of the spirit.
In the essentials of his constitution, thus advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
compleated, and perfected, will he have an
absolute fulnes of joy and blessednes, for ever. He
will for ever have all he can desire, and for ever
be rid of all he hates, and would not have. And
then farther; from this radical, fundamental joy in
God, will spring up innumerable other secondary
joy's, on the account of all that are in the same
state of blessednes with himself. His joy wilbe
multiplied according to the <hi>numberless multitude of
saved men</hi> and angels. Rev. 7. 9. The elect angels
rejoyce in man's hapines; why should not elected
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36640:35"/>
men rejoyce eternally in theirs? Every man in
heaven, will ever love every one, as himself, that's
in the same blessed condition with himself; and
therefore equally rejoyce in the joy of every one,
as in his own. If then therebe innumerable men,
that will have the like joy in God, every one of
them will have innumerable joyes. Every ones
unspeakable joy in God, wilbe innumerably mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied
by the like unspeakable joy in others. All
this is the necessary, certain, eternal fruit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of man's wel-fix'd love of God.</p>

                  <p>THe temporary fruit of self-love, in this
world, cannot be any true joy, but only a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical,
deceptive, seeming joy, carrying reall
sadnes in the womb of it. He that loves his own
will, praise, honour, glory, and bodily pleasur's,
loves and seek's after such things as conduce
thereunto; worldly riches, dignities, offices, scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
&amp;c. Such a man, when he has any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
hopes or enjoyment of such things, he has a
proportionable kind of joy. And because all these
things may pass away, be lost or destroy'd, he
fear's to lose them, and hates all that would dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
or destroy them. From such danger, fear, and
hatred, sadnes must needs arife. His joy then, at
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36640:36"/>
best, in such delusive, transient vanities, hath sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and vexation of spirit, most intimatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
with it.</p>
                  <p>From the properties and conditions of self-love,
may we certainly conclude the properties of
the joy, arising there-from. If such love be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,
unjust, tortuous, false, vicious, corrupt,
unclean thing, contrary to the nature of God and
man, as also to the order of the whole universe; if
it be a most wicked, filthy, malignant, abominable
thing, the joy arising from it must needs be of the
same complexion, and have the self-same evil
qualities, properties and conditions. Self-love is
the leading injustice and injury, dishonorable to
God, and destructive to man. It sets up a false
God, in the room of the true; the will of man, in
opposition to the will of God. Any joy man can
have in such a course, must needs be a false, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive,
inordinate, unjust, vicious, corrupt joy,
contrary to the nature of God and man, as also to
the nature and order of all creatures. Tis a most
wicked, filthy, poisonous, mortal, dark, lying joy.
As the root is, so is the fruit. And forasmuch as
self-love render's a man the capital enemy of God
(as thereby usurping a power of living in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Soveraignty and unsubjected exercise of his
own will, which is the peculiar prerogative and
incommunicable priviledg of God alone) all the
joy he can possibly find in such a course, is but yet
a higher strein of enmity to God. All his joy, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36640:36"/>
complacency in things temporal, is but a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
exulting, and rejoycing in his contempt of,
and enmity to God. The more a man has of such
joy, the greater enemy of God is he.</p>
                  <p>Self-love and the love of God cannot stand or
dwell quietly together in the same will, but, as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
enemies, will destroy and expell one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In like manner is it with the two opposite
joyes, thence arising. The joy that spring's up
from the love of God, strengthen's man's union
with God. The joy which spring's from self-love,
divides, separat's, and alienat's a man more and
more from God. For the maintenance of a false
joy, such a multitude of temporal things appear's
requisite, as cannot usually be gotten without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and destruction to others and ourselvs. <hi>The
love of</hi> such <hi>riches</hi> as are the nourishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of a false joy, will put us upon the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of many such <hi>foolish and hurtful lusts, as drown
men in destruction and perdition.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9.</p>
                  <p>True joy in the lord render's a man bountiful,
courteous, merciful, humble, mild, and sweet.
False joy in the creature, make's him cruel, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
proud, implacable, revengful, and all that's
naught. The former preserv's peace, unity, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and all that's good amongst men: the latter
tend's to the dissolution of all right friendship;
sowes envy, strife, divisions, animosities, and all
that's evil, amongst them. The former alway's
profit's, the latter alwayes hurt's him that has it.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36640:37"/>
The former enlighten's and cleer's up mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:

                  <p>IMmediatly after this life, he that had nothing
but a false, temporary, momentany joy in the
fleeting things thereof, wil for ever be deprived
of all that he loved, desired, or rejoyced in. He
wilbe compelled by the hand of God, to have all
that he would not have; and he wilbe everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

punish him. He wilbe eternally displeased that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his leaders, the devil and his angels. The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due to man for such contempt of his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent

wilbe cast, will burn, but not consume him, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

their evil deeds.</p>
                  <p>Man only, of all the visible world, can proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserv, and accordingly receive punishment
from the hand of god, because he only is furnished
with rational powers, to know what he ought
to do, and to do what he ought, in obedience to
God. If therefore he do things contrary to the will
of God, and his own light, God will bring som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon him contrary to his will, with eternal
darknes. His will, being a perpetual thing, and
fixed in enmity to God, God will do that which
wilbe perpetually contrary to it. His inordinate
will, chiefly affected and sought his own honour,
praise, glory, and pleasure; the contraries where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
in extreamity, wilbe his portion, eternal
dishonour, contempt, shame; confusion, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
unutterable. The everlasting punishment of

                  <p>MAn's obligation extend's to hatred as well
as love. The right knowledg then of hatred
and love, is the same. All that hath bin proved of
love, may be proved of hatred. As the will can
love, so can it hate. Hatred alway's follow's love.
If man be bound by the law of nature, to love the
lord with all his heart, soul, mind and strength, he
is consequently bound by the same law, to hate
every thing that's against God, with all his heart,
soul, mind, and strength; and that, continually and
incessantly. Theres the same obligation upon
man, to hate all that's contrary to the will of God,
as to love God above all. The first and principal
thing he ought by the law of nature to hate, is his
own private self-will, and that with all his heart,
as most contrary to God. And forasmuch as our
own honour, praise, glory, and bodily pleasur's,
do necessarily follow the love of our own will, in
opposition to God's, we ought to hate our own
honour, praise, and bodily delights, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all the vices subservient thereunto, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes,
envy, wrath, and the rest. As from one
principal love, many secondary, subordinate loves
do arise; so from one principal hatred, many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
hatreds. Every man ought to hate and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36640:40"/>
oppose whatever is contrary to God, to the true
good of himself, or any other man, on the same
account that he is bound to <hi>love the lord his God
with all his heart, and his neighbour as himself.</hi> Luk. 10. 27.</p>

                  <p>THe principal power and property of love, is
the transforming of the will into the thing
chiefly loved, or the uniting it most intimately
therewith. The principal force and property of
hatred then, is to divide, separate, alienate, and
elongate a man from what he hates. The greater
the love, the stronger is the union of the will with
the thing loved: the stronger, and deeper the
hatred, the greater is the division and distance
of the will from the thing hated. And neither
love nor hatred can be compelled, but are free,
voluntary things.</p>

and hatred of self, as also the hatred of God and
hatred of self. But the love of God and hatred of
self, agree well together in the same will: So do
the love of self and hatred of God. He that loves
God and his will, hates himself and his own will.
He that loves himself and his own will, hates
God and his. There's no middle state or way.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The different fruits of these two hatreds.</head>
                  <p>LOve has the primacy of hatred. For hatred
arises from love. From the love of God, and
of all things in conjunction with him and his will,
does necessarily arise the hatred of self, and of all
things in combination with our own, private,
selfish will. In like manner, does the hatred of
God and of all things in conjunction with his
will, arise from the love of self and its interests.
If the love of God be good, holy, most orderly
and just, according to the law of nature; then is
the hatred of God most wicked, disorderly unjust,
and contrary to the law of nature. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
if the hatred of our own will be good, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
just, and according to the law of nature; then
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36640:41"/>
is the love of it wicked, disorderly, unjust, and
contrary to the law of nature. The good hatred
of self, arises from the good love of God: the
evil hatred of God, arises from the evil love of
self. The fruits, above-specified, that arise from
a good love, arise secondarily from a good ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
which alway's followeth such a love: and
the fruits that naturally flow from an evil love, the
love of self, do flow secondarily from an evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
the hatred of God. So much of love and

                  <head type="sub">Concerning other particular debts man owes
unto God, besides love, and that,
first, in generall.</head>
                  <p>HAving considered the debt of love, which
man owes to God, and the great advantage
redounding unto him, by the due payment
thereof, as also his unutterable damage if he pay
it not; let's enquire after other debts, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof will also be our great gain, and
the final non-payment our eternal damage. God
made all inferiour creatures for man, and man
for himself; furnishing him alone with a nature
and capacity, fit to perform all the duties and to
pay all the debts, which he owes unto God, both
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36640:42"/>
for himself and all the rest. No inferiour creatures
can perform or understand any such matters.
From what man is furnished with, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of all duty to God, may he certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
what ought to be done by him. If he can
know, love, fear, honour, glorify, praise, adore
or pray to God; if he can beleeve, hope, and
trust in God; he may conclude, that God is to be
known, lov'd, fear'd, honour'd, glorified, prais'd,
ador'd, beleev'd, hoped and trusted in. If he can
wholly delight himself in God, then is God
wholly delectable. If he can do well, God can
reward him: if ill, he can punish him. If he can
be guilty, God can be a judg. If he can ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
God can give it. In like manner we may,
the other way, from the properties of God, argue
the duties of man. If God ought chiefly to be
loved, as infinitly most desireable, man ought
chiefly to love him. If he ought chiefly to be
fear'd, honour'd, prais'd, man ought to fear,
honour, and praise him. The like correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as is between the soul and body of man, is
between God and man, in this case. If the body
have eyes, ears, nose, &amp;c: we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the soul has a power of seing, hearing,
smelling, &amp;c. And if the soul have these powers,
the body ought to have such organs. The bodily
organs, without such faculties in the soul; or such
faculties of the soul, without such organs in the
body, would be useless and in vain. A man that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36640:42"/>
has no eyes, is never the better for having a visive
faculty in his soul. He sees nothing.</p>
                  <p>Though all other debts man owes unto God,
are included in and connexed with love, yet hath
each its proper and special reason why it ought to
be paid. For they are due to him, on different
and special accounts; love, on one; fear, on
another; honour, on a third; praise, on a fourth;
&amp;c. Again, love is not fear, or honour, nor is
honour love or fear; each is a distinct debt. But
where love is paid, all wilbe paid. God is chiefly
to be loved, because he is originally, essentially,
and unchangably good. <hi>There is none</hi> thus <hi>good,
but God only.</hi> Mar. 10. 18. He alone is to be fear'd,
as omnipotent. He alone is to be honour'd, as the
inexhaustible fountain of all things; and of all the
joy, comfort, and blessednes, that his choicest
creatur's, in their most extended capacities, are
ever able to receive. Obedience is due to him, as
the supream lord of all. Glory and praise are due
to him, as the creatour of all things. And because
he is infinite, he is infinitly to be loved, fear'd,
honour'd, obey'd, prais'd, and glorified. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
to be beleeved and trusted, because infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faithful and true. But love does most principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
correspond with the nature of God. <hi>For God is
love.</hi> 1 Jo. 4. 8. It cannot be said that God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

                  <p>ALl other debts or duties of man to God, must
be founded in and spring from his love of
God. Love is acceptable of itself. No other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
is acceptable to God, but as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with love. He that fear's God without
love, his fear carries in it punishment, sadnes, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
bondage to himself, and find's no accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with God. He that pretend's to honour god,
without love, flatter's him, play's the hypocrite,
and is abominable. But fear joyn'd with love, is
voluntary, free, and acceptable; has no torment,
sadnes, or bondage in it. Fear then, singly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in itself, without love, being but a servile
thing, carrying with it pain and torment, ought
not to be multiplied, as love ought. One right fear
of God admits no other fear's, but expell's them.
From the love of God, do flow infinite secondary
loves of all creatur's, as made or born of him, and
as more or less resembling what is in him. But
from the true fear of God, issue no secondary fear's
of any creature whatsoever, <hi>I am he that comforteth

fears; the one arising from the love of
God; the other, from the love of self. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
are they good or evil, just or unjust, as the
love is, whence they flow. The true fear of God
strengthen's man's union with God. He that
rightly fear's him, need's fear nothing else. But the
evil fear, arising from self-love, is multiplied infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly
beyond the love from whence it spring's.
From one of the many secondary loves, issuing
from self-love, may arise numberless fears, all
which being in conjunction with an evill love, do
multiply punishment, sadnes, and sorrow to him
that has them. This multiplication of fears de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrat's
the poisonous filth of self-love, to him
that lives in it. He that chiefly love's himself, must
needs fear all those things that can diminish, hurt,
or destroy him; which are numberless. In like
manner, his own honour, praise, and glory being
earnestly sought by him, he must need's fear all
that can diminish or destroy them. And loving
bodily pleasures and delights, he fear's bodily
torments, cold, heat, poverty, or whatever tend's
to the diminution and destruction thereof. Thus
is evil fear, arising from an evil love, infinitly more
multiplicable then the love itself. A self-lover
fear's every thing that can hurt or diminish any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36640:44"/>
thing he love's; himself, friends, wife, children,
parents, brothers, sisters, houses, possessions. He
fear's to lose all these, and therefore fear's every
thing that can take them from him, hurt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them. The foundation of all his misery and
fear's, is, he foolishly loves that which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd,
and therefore slavishly fear's all that can
destroy it. He that chiefly loves God, and by love
is united with him, has no cause to fear any of
these things, which the self-lover is so sollicitous
about. Nothing can diminish, hurt, or destroy his
beloved. The <hi>perfect love</hi> of God <hi>cast's out</hi> all sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish,
tormenting fear. 1 Jo. 4. 18. The true fear
of God is often put in Scripture for the whole
worship and service of God, performable by man.
He that truly fear's God, does truly worship and
serve him. He that fear's other things, makes
himself the servant thereof; becom's a slave to
many such things as were made for his use and
service. He incurr's infinite bondages, and loses
all true liberty. By man's false fear's is the world
turn'd upside down. Man, who was created upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
is laid at the bottome, as the subject, serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and slave of all things. But by the true fear of god,
he recovers his due place in the universe, suitable

                  <p>HOnour has its distinct consideration by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
All things are done for honour or profit,
or both. Of the two, honour is the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and belongs to God alone; profit, to man
only. The creature is in itself, indigent and needy;
profit therefore is calculated to its interest; not
honour, at all. But the creatour, being infinitly
full of all perfection within himself, no profit can
possibly redound unto him, from all the works of
his hands; but honour only. Profit is due to the
creature, honour to God, who aim's joyntly at his
own honour and the profit of his creatur's, as the
compleat end of all he does. Honour as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell's
profit, as God (to whom all honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long's)
excell's the creature, to whom all profit
belong's; that is, infinitly. God therefore princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
intend's his own honour in all his works; but
his crearur's profit is so wrapp'd up, and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
connexed with it, that the more he design's
his own honour, the more he design's his creatur's
profit; and the more his creatures honour him, the
more profit do they receive. Here then are the
two grand fruits of the universe, God's honour
and man's profit. The honour redounding unto
God, from all his works of creation and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
will endure for ever. They therefore must
remain for ever, that can ascribe it to him. And
consequently their profit will also remain for ever.
God will have everlasting honour, and man ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36640:45"/>
profit; each, that which is most convenient
and suitable to them. What should a needy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
do with honour; or the inexhaustible fountain
of all fulnes and perfection, with profit? Man is a
needy creature within; honour therefore, being a
meer outward thing, signifies nothing to him.
Nothing does him any reall good, but what tends
to his inward perfection and accomplishment. If
he fondly seek honour, which is due to God only,
he not only receiv's no profit thereby, but great
disadvantage. He corrupt's, and waxes worse and
worse within, being puff'd up with that which to
him is a meer nullity, a vanity. Man is apt to be
seeking his own encrease and advance, one way
or other. If he seek not a right, to encrease in
goodnes within, he will fondly seek to encrease
without, in honour, glory, praise, name or fame, in
which the more he encreases, the more will he
decrease in inward goodnes. Such practice is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
hostility to God, against nature, reason, and
the due order of all things.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The name of God, acquired by his wonderful
works.</head>
                  <p>THere is a twofold name of God, natural, or
acquired. Amongst men, there is a proper
name, whereby one person is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from another, which is not given on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any thing done by them. But if a man, in
the course of his life, do some notable things, he
acquir's a name amongst men, as David's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
according to the excellency of his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
And this name is joyned with his other,
which before did only distinguish him from other
men, but carried nothing of fame or honour in it.
His former name is rend'red honourable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
from this additional name, acquired by his
atchievments. Such hononr, glory, or fame, as
this additional name brings with it, enters not at
all into the being, but name only of the man. Yet
though the name, fame, honour and repute of a
man, be but a meer outward thing, and no intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
ingredient into his person; it is, of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, the most neer, dear, and valuable to
him. This acquired name of man, may encrease
two wayes; intensively, by more and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
exploits; or extensively, and by way of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36640:46"/>
multiplication, as more and more men do come
dayly to hear of his fame.</p>
                  <p>God, on the account of his inward naturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and infinite perfections, has a manifold
natural name, which together with his additional
name and honour, acquired by his wonderful
works of creation, providence, &amp;c. do make up
one most great and glorious name, ever to be
fear'd and prais'd by man. He does not, by all his
wonderful works, acquire any new thing within
him, but an outward name only. The glory of all
good things, done by God immediatly; or mediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with and by his creatur's, is properly attributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him alone. <hi>His name alone is excellent in all
the earth, and his glory is above the heavens.</hi> This
name of god is capable of encrease; by new works
and wonders. He <hi>got him a name,</hi> or a fresh addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his name, by his wonders on Pharaoh, in
Egypt; Ex. 9. 16. 14. 17. And as it is with man,
in this point of honour, who by self-love makes
himself his God, so is it with God; his honour or
honourable name, though but an outward acquest
by his famous works, is more neer, dear, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
to him, then all creatur's put together, as
being the principal end for which they were all
made.</p>
                  <p>God was ever omnipotent, infinitely wise, just,
and good. But he cannot be known by any other,
to be so, till in a way of bountifull communicative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
he manifest himself to be so, by his works, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36640:46"/>
the works of his own hands, angels and men.
Had God not made some creatur's, capable to
take notice of his works, and thereby to know
him, who could have known or honour'd him? By
the works of his omnipotency, justice, judgment,
and wisdom, he declares and so gets the name of
an omnipotent, infinitely wise creatour, and just
judg. He does also by his works, get the name<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
or titles of most faithful, true, merciful, bountiful,
gracious, holy, helpful, saviour, protectour, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer,
&amp;c. whereby men are obliged to place all
their hopes, expectations, confidence, and trust,
in him. One glorious name of God acquired by
his works, is made up of all these, to beget the true
feare thereof in men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God; and the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
sheweth his handy work;</hi> Psal. 19. 1. By the
works of God, may and ought men to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and know him. <hi>For the invisible things of him,
even his eternal power and godhead from</hi> or by <hi>the
creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made.</hi> Rom. 1. 20. Accordingly
as men do more or less know, <hi>regard, and consider
the works of the lord, the operations of his hands</hi>
will they more or lesse know, love, and honour him. If
they consider them not at all, they will not know,
love, or honour him, at all.</p>
                  <p>The heart or will of man, is the proper recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
and ought to be the habitation of the name
of God, As men then are multiplied, the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36640:47"/>
name of the lord is capable to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
as finding new hearts to reside and dwell
in. Those men, in whose hearts that name does
dwel, will discover it unto others, by some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
signs, actions, or words. Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the heart or inner man, the mouth, or
whole outer man will speak, and act. <hi>His light will</hi>
so <hi>shine in good works before</hi> other <hi>men,</hi> as to induce
and incline them also to take notice of, <hi>glorify</hi> and
honour <hi>his father which is in heaven.</hi> Mat. 5. 16.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the works of God, man is the master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece;
the comprehensive epitome of all the rest.
As then a man does more or less know and se
himself (the principal mirrour and resemblance of
god, the summ of all created beings put together)
the more or lesse clearly will he se and know
God; and accordingly, more or less esteem, love,
and honour him. We may know much of God,
by knowing what other creatures are; but more,
by knowing what ourselvs are, as the principal
work of God: and yet much more, by experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the peculiar works of his grace and spirit, in
our new formation, or true regeneration, as we
come to be <hi>born of him, of his will, his spirit.</hi> As the
right knowledg of ourselvs encreases, our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God will encrease: and the more we know
him, the more shall we love, praise, honour, and
admire his glorious name.</p>
                  <p>All the works of God are calculated and desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for his own honour, name, glory and praise:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36640:47"/>
So ought all the works of man. Every man ought
to do his utmost for the spreading abroad, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and multiplying the name, fame, and glory
of God, in the world. The more he does, gives,
or parts with, on this account, the more profit and
advantage redounds unto himself. <hi>Godlines is great
gain.</hi> If he lay down his life for the honour of
God (which is the utmost he can do in this world)
he can't part with it on better terms, or use it
more to his own advantage.</p>
                  <p>Whatever any man does in this world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he honour's not God, he dishonours him.
There's no middle, neutrall way, thought, word,
or action. To honour God, is the greatest good
man can do; to dishonour him, the greatest evill.
All that man owes unto God, (love, fear, praise,
obedience, hope, faith, confidence, &amp;c.) belong's
to his honour: and the neglect thereof, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit's
thereunto, are a dishonour to him. He that
does not love, fear, and obey, him; beleeve, hope,
and trust in him; dishonour's, contemn's, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur's

                  <p>HAving thus read over the book of the visible
creation, and considered of some special and
highly concerning instructions unto man, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
there-from; let us proceed to take notice of
a third sort of created nature, which is invisible.</p>
                  <p>In the three former of the four degrees of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur's
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36640:49"/>
already spoken to, we find meer bodily na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
in the fourth (to wit, man) bodily and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
or spiritual nature, joyn'd together. By
these things, so manifested and known, may we
ascend
to the consideration of intellectual nature,
as found alone, by itself, in separation from bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Bodily nature has two wayes of existing, one
by itself, in the three inferiour degrees of created
beings; another, in conjunction with intellectual
nature, in the fourth; man. Intellectual nature
then, being far more excellent then bodily, and
much more neer and like to its creatour, will
doubtless be found to have the like priviledg of
existing also two wayes; first, singly, as a whole
being, in angels; secondly, in composition with
bodily, as part of a being, in man.</p>
                  <p>We may farther conclude also, that angels, as
the choicer sort of first-created beings, <hi>excelling</hi>
all others <hi>in</hi> understanding and <hi>strength</hi> (Psal. 103.
20) were first made. Man, though the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
creature in the visible world, lord and master
of all the rest, was last created; because, in respect
of the bodily part of his constitution, the other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
creatures were a requisite provision for his
enterteinment and subsistence. But angels, being
meer spirits (unconcern'd in, and independent on
the visible or material parts of the creation, for
their subsistence and operations) might well be
before any of this visible fabrick was set up. <hi>These
morning stars and sons of God, sang together, and shou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36640:50"/>
for joy, when the foundations of the earth were
fast'ned, and the corner-stone thereof was laid,</hi> by the
hand of the creatour. Job. 38. 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>Now forasmuch as angelical nature had the
same kind of free-will that man had in his first
make, the things above proved concerning the
obligation, duty, and true interest of man, may be
look'd on as equally proved in reference to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p>So have we, by ascending natur's ladder, found
out the divine nature, uncreated, which is the
same numerical nature in three persons; and then,
three created natures, meer bodily, meer intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall,
and mixt.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The sin of Angels.</head>
                  <p>ANgels sin'd before men. Sin and depravation
were first found in intellectual nature. Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
nature sin'd without any instigation to evil,
by any superiour nature, already fallen. Humane
nature sin'd and fell by the instigation of angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
the highest kind of created nature, already fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.
Sin therefore was first in angelical nature.
For, till angels were sinners, they would not
tempt man to sin.</p>
                  <p>Sin was brought into humane nature, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
from the way it entred into angelical. It
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36640:50"/>
was first brought into the weaker part, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
then, by her into the man; and so, into all
mankind. 'T is the right method in the art of
tempting, to assault the weaker part, for entrance.
When evil is to be introduced by way of instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this is the surest course. But the evil of ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
nature, entred first into the stronger part;
then, by it, into the weaker; because that nature
sin'd and fell of its own proper motion, without
any instigation from another. The stronger, more
excellent and capacious angel, whose will was of
the most flexible, active temper, was most apt to
assume unto himself a soveraign and uncontrolled
excercise of his own will, in a proud and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
opposition to God's, with an ERO SIMILIS
ALTISSIMO, I wilbe like the most high. This was
the case of the Luciferian head of the fallen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
                  <p>The evil of sin then may seem to have begun in
him that by creation was the most excellent of all
the other angels that fell. They fell by freely and
instantly complying with his rebellious will. In
humane nature, man, the stronger part, became
evil, by adhering to and complying with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
the woman's disorder'd will. Angelical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
first fin'd. By that, was the woman tempted:
by her, the man. So sin entred upon all mankind:</p>
                  <p>The chief evil angel, proudly exalted himself
and his will, into competition with God and his;
and so became the first capital enemy of God. He
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36640:51"/>
affected soveraignty: he would not remain sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to any superiour will. He erected a kingdom,
empire, and dominion within himself, against the
Kingdom, empire, and dominion of God. And he
presently became obstinate, resolute, and fixed in
this deviation from and enmity against God. He
can never return from it, to all eternity. Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
will he ever hate and oppose, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
the will of his creatour, as most opposite to
his. Thus came there to be two totally distinct,
contrary, and opposite wills; the most absolutely
pure and holy will of the omnipotent creatour,
and the depraved will of the first angel that sinn'd.
And the said leading angel, the devil, does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
with all his might, for the maintenance and
defence of his own will, in opposition to God's.
To these two contrary wills of God and the devil,
are all other wills of men or angels reducible. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
will truly good, is joyn'd with the will of
God; every evil will, with the will of the devil.
All the other angels, that adhered unto, joyned
with, and took complacency in the will of the
devil, became fixedly one with him, so as that they
cannot will any thing but what he will's. He is
the head, they the members, in opposition to
<hi>Michael and his angels.</hi> Rev. 12. 7. All the wills of
of the good angels are bound up in a state of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
and unchangable harmony with the will
of their head, <hi>the head of all principality and power.</hi>
The evil angels are a compacted army, resolved
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36640:51"/>
to fight for the defence of the depraved will of
their head, and for the fulfilling thereof, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the will of God. The good angels are an
opposite army, united with the will of their head,
and contending for the fulfilling thereof, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the devil and his followers.</p>
                  <p>By how much the more high and excellent a
creature the first angel that sinn'd was made, so
much the more vile and inferiour did he become,
by the voluntary corrupting of himself. He is the
lowest, basest, and vilest of all creatur's. His will,
perverted by pride and self-love, became the root,
and fountain of all evils. When once his will was
perverted, he resolved to employ the over-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
subtlety of his understanding, in all possible
arts, methods, and wayes of delusion, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
and drawing of men into the same perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>THe two principal opposite wills of God and
the devil, make two opposite Kingdoms, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
dominions, and lawes; a Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a Kingdom of light. All men are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the one or other of these Kingdoms. The
devil layes claim to all those things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to God; honour, praise, adoration, &amp;c.
He is obstinate and blinded in this transcendent
strein of pride and presumption. He does all he
can, to destroy the honour, glory and worship of
God, as contrary to his. He extreamly hates the
Kingdom of God; envies man's capacity of ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thither, and labour's to the utmost, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
and hinder his motions that way. He la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
might and main, to bring all men under his
dominion.</p>
                  <p>But there is a twofold difference between the
first captivity of mankind, and other fallen angels,
to the will of the first; the devil. First, all the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
angels became fix'd in and with the will of
their head, in enmity to God: but men are capable
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36640:53"/>
of recovery <hi>from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
the evil angels are subject to their leader
and head, as his incorporated members, resigned
up to his will. They do all most unanimously and
harmoniously agree and center in one will, so that
no discord or contention can possibly arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. They are the most free and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
subjects of the devil. As for men, they are
cozen'd into slavery: they are, unawares, by
fraud, captivated to the will of the devil. They
agree with the devil in enmity to God. They quit
all union with the will of God; but, with design to
live in the soveraign and uncontrolled exercise of
their own wills, as the devil does in his, unsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
either to God or him. But when they de
part from God, they fall into the devil's hands,
and are <hi>taken captive by him, at his will;</hi> 2 Tim. 2.
26. Man intend's a distinct Kingdom within
himself, separate from God's and the devil's
too, as a new third Monarch, distinct from both.
But it fall's in, by way of coalition, and becomes
one Kingdom of darkness with Satan's, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Kingdom of God. The will of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
separated from God, of itself. The will of
man, separated from God, by the instigation of
the devil; on which, the devil gain'd entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and dominion over his will, beyond, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his intention. The devil caught man at
first with guile, did with craft surprize him, and
does by violence and fraud usurp a tyrannical
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36640:53"/>
domination over him.</p>
                  <p>The fallen angels are the devil's natural sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and members, being of the same angelical
nature with him. But men, as of a different nature
from him, are by fraud and force, captivated and
subjected to his will. Every wicked man retein's
his own private will in himself, which alway's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree's
with the will of the devil, in enmity and
contrariety to the will of God. The devil is a gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by men's living and walking in their own
wills, as not willingly or knowingly subjected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his. For, by this means, he can, in combination
with the will of man, do many exploits in the
world, which by himself alone, or by his angels
who are freely united in and with his will, he
could not do.</p>
                  <p>Wicked men, in this world, do not center by
way of resignation, in any one will; but have every
one their proper and private will, distinct from all
others. They cannot therefore agree amongst
themselvs, as evil angels do, because they have
distinct private wills and <hi>lusts, whence</hi> contentions,
<hi>warrs, brawlings, and fightings do arise</hi> (Jam. 4. 1.)
every one raking and tearing from another, to get
what he can for himself. Satan know's too well
how to manage the private lusts and passions of
men, to his advantage. He does thereby stir up
man against man, nation against nation, Kingdom
against Kingdom, putting the world into an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar,
and filling it with all manner of tumults and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36640:54"/>
confusions. This he does by his hidden artifices,
and unperceived influencin<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

to each other. He is ready also, on all sides,
to suggest innumerable wayes and arts of doing
mischief, as the grand master of al mis-rule in
the whole world. He uses his angels as his own
members, for the doing of mischief. But he and
his angels use men as their beasts, to ride on.
Men's minds and wills are secretly bestridden and
spurr'd by these <hi>principalities and powers of darkness;</hi>
and they no more know or consider who is on
their backs, then horses know what men are, that
ride them. Into this deplorable condition is man
brought by self-love, and living in his own will,
separate from god's. He is made a servant, a slave,
a captive, a beast, for the devil and his angels to
triumph over, and ride on, who are themselvs
most miserable captives in <hi>everlasting chains of
darkness.</hi> Jude v. 6.</p>
                  <p>The will of the devil is a bottomless pit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the wills of wicked men are imprison'd; and
their own private wills are so many distinct spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
prisons, subordinate to the will of the devil,
wherein they are deteined. Man's own will is
both the prison and the chain that bind's and
hold's him fast in the will of the devil. Here's that
man gets by living in his own will. When he hath
once separated himself from God, and set his heart
wholly upon vanities, in case he sometimes get
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36640:54"/>
what he desires, if he rejoyces in it, he add's ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
unto iniquity, by rejoycing in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
of the fleshly desires of his carnal mind,
that is enmity against God. All the desires of our
wills, in separation from God's, are evil. If we
have not what we desire, we are sad, looking on
our disappointment as a punishment. If we have
what we desire, we rejoyce, and so adde to the
iniquity of our unlawfull lust, a rebellious exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and rejoycing against God. Turn which way
we will then, while we live in our own wills, we
are sure to find sin or sorrow, to meet either with
the evil of sin, or evil of punishment, continually.
To center, unite, live and dwell in the will of
God, is true blessednes and glorious liberty unto
man, in direct opposition to all the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
captivities and inconveniences.</p>

                  <p>THe whole angelical nature fell not. The
whole humane nature fell. Angels descend
not from one another by generation, as
men do; but were all created together. Those
angels that fell, fell irrecoverably, at first. No
men were rendred unchangably and irrecoverably
evil by their first fall, nor were they thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to remediless misery. Had mankind, by
being made totally sinful, bin totally lost, in vain
had all men bin made, as to the principal design
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36640:55"/>
of God in the creation of the world, which was,
to bring the world, summ'd up in man, into union
with and enjoyment of himself. Had no course
bin taken for the recovery and salvation of men,
after their first fall, we might be apt to think it far
better, that God had forthwith destroy'd Adam
and Eve, on their first sin, and put a period to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature in their persons, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
multiplication. That which Christ say's
of Judas, <hi>it had bin good for him, if he had not bin
born,</hi> Mat. 26. 24. may seem to countenance this
general assertion, that it had bin far better and
more eligible for all those who will eternally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
uever to have bin at all.</p>

                  <p>AS to the recovery, redemption, and salvation
of man, this we may take notice of in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that none but God himself could make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to his own infinite justice for the sins of
men. And none is obliged to give satisfaction, but
man. He then, that perform's it, must needs be
both God and man, united in one person. The
natural and most intimate marriage-union of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature with the divine, in Christ's person,
did render it so valuable, in the vertue and dignity
of its husband, that the laying down of the life
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36640:55"/>
thereof, was a satisfaction to divine justice for the
sins of men, infinitely beyond what the voluntary
surrender of life, by al creatures in their full puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
would have amounted unto. Such a man as
was also God, could and did by the <hi>death</hi> of his
manhood, <hi>overcome him that had the power of death,
the devil;</hi> Heb. 2. 14. <hi>And having spoiled those princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
and powers</hi> of darkness, <hi>the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over
them in it;</hi> Col. 2. 15. He will also cause his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
from among men, to triumph over them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
to trample them under their feet, as Josua or
<hi>Iesus</hi> (Act. 7. 45. Heb. 4. 8.) the type of Christ,
caused <hi>the captains of the men of war, to put their feet
upon the necks of the five Kings.</hi> Jos. 10, 23. 24. He
does, by regeneration, put a spirit into them, <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then he that's in the world,</hi> the devil; 1 Jo. 4. 4. a
spirit, which <hi>that wicked one cannot touch,</hi> deprave,

that cannot touch or put forth its hand unto sin.
<hi>He,</hi> or that <hi>which is born of God, sinneth not, nor can

                  <p>Fallen man, who was seduced by a superiour

through the tender mercies of God, declared to
be in a recoverable condition; and accordingly,
are there means afforded him, by the personal
suffrings and performances of Christ, whereby he
may be saved. But being fallen and corrupted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a state quite contrary to his own nature, he is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
so far from any due considering of the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

<hi>vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> which will certainly
follow, that he laugh's and rejoyces in his chains,
his prison-state under Satan, who is a chained cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
himself. He glories in his shame, put's far
from him the evil day, laugh's at the sad stories of
hel and damnation, as old wives fables. <hi>The heart
of the Sons of men is full of evil; madness is in their
heart while they live; and after that they go to the
dead. Man also knoweth not his time: as fishes are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the Sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth
