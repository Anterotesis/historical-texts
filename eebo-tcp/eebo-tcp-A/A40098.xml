            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>With good Will doing Service, as to the LORD, and not unto Men: Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doth, the same shall he receive of the Lord; whether he be Bond or Free.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Design of these Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Sermons being to Encourage those Worthy Persons, who are Entred into <hi>Societies for Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> to persevere and abound more and more, in the Extraordinary good Work they are Engaged in; as also to Excite others, in their respective Stations, to follow their Example: And it being moreover very Seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, to Discourse at this time of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44193:4"/>
the <hi>Principle,</hi> by which we ought to be acted in <hi>all our</hi> Services; and especially in a Service of <hi>this</hi> high Nature, I thought I could not make Choice of a more proper Subject for <hi>this</hi> Occasion, than the Words now read.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We meet with in them a great <hi>Duty: With good will doing Service; as to the Lord, and not unto Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. A most Perswasive <hi>Motive</hi> thereto: <hi>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any Man doth, the same shall he receive of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to the <hi>Duty.</hi> We find an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the same, <hi>Col. 3. 23. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you do, do it heartily; as to the Lord, and not unto Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>With good Will,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as 'tis in the foregoing words, <hi>from the Soul,</hi> i. e. most freely and chearfully.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44193:4"/>
               <hi>Doing Service,</hi> or any Service you do, whether Sacred or Civil. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you do,</hi> as 'tis in the parallel Text. And these Words do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately relate to Services of a mere Civil Nature, because they are in <hi>both</hi> places directed to Servants of <hi>Men,</hi> for their Instruction in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>their</hi> mean Services <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</hi> But if even <hi>these</hi> are to be done <hi>as to the Lord,</hi> much more should far higher Services; and most of all those which immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Lord, and not unto Men;</hi> or, not <hi>as</hi> to Men. <hi>i. e.</hi> Having a greater Regard to the Lord than to Men. This is an <hi>Hebreism,</hi> which expresseth what is not to be done, but in a certain limited Sence, as if it were not to be done at all: Of which Forms of Speech there are in Scripture abundance of Instances. I will name but one, <hi>viz.</hi> those Words of our Saviour, <hi>Labour not for the</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44193:5"/>
               <hi>Meat which perisheth, but for that Meat which endureth to Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And not unto Men,</hi> i. e. for the pleasing of them, and obtaining from them a Reward for your Service.</p>
            <p>We will, in discoursing on these Words, shew</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is Implyed in <hi>thus</hi> doing our Services.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Under what Obligations we are thus to do them.</p>
            <p>I shall defer speaking to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> to the <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What is Implyed in this <hi>doing our Services as to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These <hi>three</hi> things are herein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, Having a respect to God's Command: And to his Glory: And to <hi>both</hi> Chiefly and Principally.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44193:5"/>
1. Having in our Services a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to God's Command. To His Command either particularly or in general, expresly or by evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, requiring them. And therefore in the two Verses before the Text, Servants are enjoyned to perform their Services <hi>in Singleness,</hi> or Simplicity and Sincerity, <hi>of Heart, as unto Christ. Not with Eye service as Men Pleasers, but as the Servants of Christ, doing the Will of God from the Heart.</hi> Which is exprest in the Verse before the <hi>other</hi> Text by <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,—in Singleness of Heart, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (or <hi>as</hi> fearing) God. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Service we are employed in without any Consideration of the Divine Law, we are not therein obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God: Obedience to Him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a mere doing <hi>what</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but doing it <hi>because</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; under the <hi>Notion</hi> of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing required by Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Herein is implyed doing our Services, with Respect also to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44193:6"/>
Glory of God. To have Respect to God's Command, and to His Glory, are different things; so different, that the one may be without the other. As when a Man obeys God from a slavish Dread of Him, as the poor <hi>Americans</hi> worship the Devil. Or when Obedience to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty proceeds from no higher a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, than hopes to obtain thereby <hi>temporal</hi> Blessings, or a sensual Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in the other World; such a Sort of Heaven as is the <hi>Turkish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise. But that our Services ought to have Regard to God's Glory, as well as to His Command, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be implyed in the Text, in that our Apostle <hi>expresseth</hi> it in that Injunction of his, <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever you do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> Or, make all your Actions subservient, as far as they are capable of being so, to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Glory of God,</hi> which we so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44193:6"/>
read of in the H. Scriptures, is the displaying of some or other of His Glorious Perfections; or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Reasonable Beings to feel or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them in their Effects. And <hi>We</hi> are said to Glorifie Him, when we are His Instruments herein; and when his Moral Perfections do shine in our selves; which are those alone wherein we are inabled to imitate Him, and which are called His <hi>Image.</hi> These are His <hi>Loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> and may be all comprised in this one Word <hi>Goodness.</hi> To do good consequently from the Love of Goodness, is an Instance of design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Glory in the good we do; as also to do good with a Design to be <hi>like</hi> to God, and by this means to be qualified for the Enjoyment of Him.</p>
            <p>God glorifieth Himself by Exerting His Goodness, or His Power and Wisdom in doing good, from the <hi>Delight</hi> he takes therein. <hi>I am the</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44193:7"/>
               <hi>Lord, which Exerciseth Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Judgement and Righteousness in the Earth; for,</hi> or because, <hi>in these things I delight, saith the Lord.</hi> Jer. 9. 24. <hi>Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th Iniquity, and passeth by the Transgression of the Remnant of His Heritage! He retaineth not His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for ever, because He</hi> Delighteth in <hi>Mercy,</hi> Mic. 7. 18. <hi>Thou art good,</hi> saith the Psalmist, <hi>and dost good;</hi> or, therefore thou <hi>dost</hi> good. because Thou <hi>art</hi> good; and what is God's <hi>being</hi> good, but His <hi>delighting</hi> in Goodness? Loving-kindness &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness are too Excellent things, to be Exercised as a mere means to a farther End; for these are the very <hi>best</hi> things (as <hi>Tully</hi> discourseth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably in his Book <hi>de Naturâ Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum)</hi> and as they are in <hi>God</hi> they are the Divine Nature it self, not as qualities in their Subject. It may be said, that the same may be affirmed of the Divine Power and Wisdom: That's certain, but <hi>these</hi> Perfections do
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44193:7"/>
concur to the Constituting of the Divine Nature, as they are necessarily determined to the Serving of the Ends of Loving kindness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; as it is easie to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. And in saying, that God Glorifieth Himself in Exerting His Perfections in doing good, from the Delight he takes therein, I say also, that <hi>We</hi> do glorifie <hi>Him</hi> in herein resembling Him.</p>
            <p>So that, in short, to have Respect to God's Glory in our Services, is the same thing with being acted from a Principle of Love to God and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Of Love to God, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red meerly as good to <hi>us</hi> or <hi>ours,</hi> but chiefly as infinitely good in Himself, &amp; as unspeakable good to His whole Creation. And he who loves Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as <hi>such,</hi> with what is implyed therein, will <hi>so</hi> as we now said love God; as he who so loves God, will necessarily love Goodness <hi>as</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:44193:8"/>
3. To have Regard to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and the Glory of God, <hi>chiefly and principally,</hi> must needs also be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in doing Service <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> This rather is expressed, in that it is said <hi>as to the Lord and not unto Men,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> to the Lord than to Men. But <hi>indeed</hi> it is too little a thing to say, that in all our Services we are obliged to a <hi>merely greater</hi> Regard to God than to Men; or than to the Serving of any selfish worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; for nothing is more undoubted (as will be shewn presently) than that the Serving and Glorifying of God must be <hi>so</hi> the Principal, as to be the Ultimate End of all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: Such an End, as that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>other</hi> Ends we propose to our selves in them, should be intended to be subservient thereunto; should be designed as Means to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof. For instance, our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour saith, <hi>Let your Light so shine before Men, that they may see your good Works;</hi> or let the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

End of your doing good Works <hi>publickly</hi> be, that Men may take Notice of them: But in what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, he saith, that their being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice of should be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as means to the Glorifying of God, <hi>and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Not to the having the Praise of Men, but to glorifie God, by doing Credit to your Religion, and so bringing the Observers of your good Works, to the embracing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to the following of your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; whereby <hi>they</hi> will bring Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God too.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Praise of Men, or a <hi>good Name,</hi> may very lawfully be design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in doing good Works; but <hi>then</hi> it is a <hi>bad</hi> End, a very bad one, when our Motive thereto is the gratifying of fond Imagination, and an Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humour (for which our Saviour so condemned the <hi>Pharisees)</hi> and not from a Desire to be enabled to do the more <hi>good</hi> in the World, by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44193:9"/>
the means of our good Name, or the more to Glorifie God. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to shew,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Under what <hi>Obligations</hi> we are thus to perform our Services <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> I shall speak to <hi>three,</hi> and they are the greatest imaginable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are obliged hereunto, in that all we <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>are,</hi> is from God. All the Faculties, Abilities and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, both bodily and spiritual, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are fitted for any Service; all the Means, Opportunities &amp; Adva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we have for the doing of good; nay, our very Willingness to improve them for that purpose: These are all from God. What a devout Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment doth K. <hi>David</hi> make of this! 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 14. <hi>But who am I, and what is my People, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of Thee, and of Thine own have we given Thee.</hi> And once more, All the good Success
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44193:9"/>
of our Endeavours is from God too. <hi>O Lord</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>I know that the way of Man, is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; it is not in Man that walketh to direct his Steps.</hi> It is not in <hi>Man,</hi> either to do what is most eligible, for the bringing about this or that good Design; nor, when he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>fittest</hi> Means, to bring his Affairs to a good Issue. <hi>Paul</hi> can but <hi>Plant, Apollos</hi> but <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> it is God alone <hi>that giveth the Increase.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, who is not able, at first fight, to perceive the mighty Force of the Obligation which ariseth from <hi>hence,</hi> to do all his Services <hi>as to the Lord?</hi> Are we our Selves, all our Powers, all our Opportunities for the Doing of them, from God? <hi>Are we not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of our selves, so much as to think any thing as of our selves</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks) <hi>but our Sufficiency is of God?</hi> Is our very Willingnefs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour owing to the Grace (tho'
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44193:10"/>
not the <hi>irresistible</hi> Grace) of God; and is all our Success from his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; and can any thing <hi>then</hi> be more evident, than that we are bound to have principally, and ultimately, an Eye to Him in them?</p>
            <p>There is no <hi>First Principle</hi> more apparent, than that the Glory of Him who is our <hi>First Cause,</hi> and who is All in All to us, ought to be our <hi>last End. Of Him and through Him, and to Him are all things: To whom be Glory for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> Rom. 11. ult. Or, therefore to Him be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Glory by the whole Universe <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> There is so inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a Connexion between that Premise and this Inference, that they can not be parted by the Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it self. Especially since,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are <hi>farther</hi> obliged hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in that God made us and all things belonging to us, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of Himself; the exerting and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44193:10"/>
displaying of His glorious Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This Consideration doth very much heighten our Obligation to do all our Services <hi>as to the Lord.</hi> Had He only made us, and placed us in the Circumstances in which we are; and then left it free to us (which 'tis impossible he should) whether we would serve Him, or <hi>not</hi> serve Him, with our Souls and Bodies, His own Gifts and Blessings, we should not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding be eternally Obliged hereto by the Law of <hi>Gratitude:</hi> But when He hath given us our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all we enjoy, that we <hi>may</hi> glorifie Him, we contradict the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of our Great Creator and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in making us what we are, and doing as He hath done for us. I need not tell those who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Divine Oracles, that there had been no such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as our selves, but for <hi>this</hi> End. But were this never revealed, we are assured of nothing more from <hi>natural Light,</hi> than that it must necessarily
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44193:11"/>
be so. For He who is infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodness, can not but have the <hi>best</hi> of Designs in all His Actings; but what Design can be Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>this,</hi> of making His Creatures to observe and teel, how Glorious He is in His Power, Wisdom and Goodness; and those of them to be His Instruments in setting forth the Glory of these, which he hath made capable of being so?</p>
            <p>If it be Óbjected, that the <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>inanimate</hi> Creatures are made to Glorifie God, as well as <hi>Men and Angels;</hi> and therefore <hi>Designing</hi> His Glory is not necessarily implyed in Glorifying Him: I answer, that God aims at His own Glory, in a far higher and more excellent Manner, in rational Agents, than in Creatures void of Reason. That is, He hath made those so to Glorifie Him, as to <hi>Intend</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> the Glorifying of Him. And farther, we can not conceive, how Brutes, and insensible
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44193:11"/>
Creatures, can be said otherwaies to Glorifie their Maker, than as they give occasion to Reasonable ones so to do. <hi>Origen,</hi> indeed, was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that because the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> are called upon by the Psalmist <hi>to praise the Lord, they</hi> are endued with Reason as well as our selves: But he might for the self-same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as well have asserted, that <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and <hi>Fowls,</hi> and <hi>all creeping</hi> things; nay, <hi>Mountains</hi> and <hi>Hills, Fire</hi> and <hi>Hail, Snow</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> and <hi>all God's Works,</hi> are reasonable Creatures too; <hi>these</hi> also, and that in the <hi>same</hi> Psalm, being called upon to <hi>praise Him.</hi> But <hi>Plato</hi> was, in this matter, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Divine than that holy Father; for having stiled the World <hi>God's Temple, wherein all His Creatures do joyn together in the Worshiping of Him,</hi> he calls <hi>Mankind His Priests, by whom the Worship of the Universe is Performed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Obligation to the Duty in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44193:12"/>
the Text, is also founded upon our own <hi>Interest;</hi> our infinitely greatest Interest. And therefore, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the two <hi>former</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that it is the most <hi>disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous</hi> and the most <hi>unjust</hi> thing, not to make the Glory of God the chief and ultimate End of all our Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; so <hi>this</hi> Consideration speaks it to be the most <hi>unkind</hi> thing to our selves: Since it is only <hi>our good</hi> God aims at, in desiring to be Glorified by us: For <hi>none</hi> can accrue to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from any thing <hi>without</hi> Him, nor the smallest drop added to His <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Fulness.</hi> If there <hi>could,</hi> He could not be <hi>God;</hi> that is, a Being of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, Infinite Perfection.</p>
            <p>The Apostate Emperour was much disgusted at the <hi>Second</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and would have had it struck out of the Decalogue (as the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, for a reason too well known, hath left it out of her daily Offices) because God in that Commandment
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44193:12"/>
expresseth so great Jealousy for His own Honour; which he would have to be very unworthy of the Divine Majesty: But St. <hi>Cyril</hi> well answered him, That it is by no means so, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Man's greatest Happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the due Apprehension of God, and giving Glory to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God, I say, is not more Glorious in Himself, by means of the Glory His Creatures give Him, but all the Gain thereof is their <hi>own;</hi> they by this means becoming <hi>like</hi> to Him, and therefore qualified for everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with Him.</p>
            <p>I will farther observe to you suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the two former Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That God Almighty must needs also expect our designing His Glory in all our Services, as it is a <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Act of Righteousness,</hi> it being (as has been shewed) most highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, sit and just, that we should have such a Sense of His infinite
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44193:13"/>
Goodness, as <hi>thus</hi> to do, He cannot but look for it for this reason from us, and oblige us thereto. So that, as God exerciseth Goodness and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness because He delights there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, so will He have <hi>us</hi> to exercise the same, because He <hi>delights</hi> in our so doing. Not (as we said) in regard of any <hi>Advantage</hi> that He can reap thereby, but because the Exercise of Goodness &amp; Righteousness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is, is as <hi>such</hi> most highly pleasing to Him; and the <hi>contrary</hi> thereto, as abhorrent to His Holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And now, to make <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been discoursed, To <hi>You,</hi> my Brethren, who are Members of of our Societies <hi>for Reformation of Manners:</hi> The Service in which you have engaged your selves, is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the most Noble, the most highly Praise-worthy, that it could be <hi>possible</hi> for you to be employed in. So it is, as the most Publick and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44193:13"/>
Good is the Design of it; not the Good of some particular Persons, or Bodies of Men, or onely of this Great City, but of our whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In several Parts of which a good Progress is made therein. Nor is this Design confined within our own Country, but it hath taken in that of <hi>Ireland</hi> too; where (thanks be to God) it hath had as good Success, as could reasonably have so soon been hoped fer. And to <hi>what</hi> People may not the Influence thereof reach, soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later, according as it prospers where it is undertaken? And the setting it on foot hitherto is, under God, wholly owing in every Place to <hi>your</hi> worthy Example, Gentlemen, and to the Directions they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Some of you.</p>
            <p>And as this is a Service of the most <hi>Publick Nature,</hi> so is it of the greatest <hi>Concernment</hi> imaginable to the Publick; as highly conducing to both the Temporal and Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44193:14"/>
thereof. He knows not what this Phrase <hi>Spiritual Interest</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, who can question, whether <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Manners</hi> be absolutely necessary thereunto. And he must be sunk below <hi>Paganism,</hi> who can doubt of its being necessary also to the <hi>Temporal</hi> Wellfare, both of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons, and of Nations as Nations. Even that Atheist <hi>Epicurus</hi> (as <hi>Tully</hi> has demonstrated him to have been, as much better Thoughts as many <hi>since</hi> have had of him) as he forbad <hi>Adultery</hi> to his Disciples, in regard of the great Mischiefs which he saw attended that Vice; so he condemned the indulging of <hi>any</hi> unreasonable and vicious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, as inconsistent with all Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Mind, and Self-Enjoyment. And as to <hi>Nations,</hi> the wise King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> hath observed, that <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People.</hi> And 'tis easy to shew, that there is no one Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im wherein the wisest of <hi>Pagans</hi> are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44193:14"/>
more agreed. That excellent <hi>Tully</hi> hath this very remarkable Saying, <hi>Omnia Prospera eveniunt colentibus Deos, sed Adversa spernentibus. All things happen well to those People, who have a Care of Religion; but as ill to the Contemners thereof.</hi> And those who are acquainted with Divine Revelation, and such as have only Natural Light, together with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Observation, for their Instruction, are very unanimous in declaring the Toleration of Vice to be the most pernicious thing to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Politique, both in regard of its Natural Consequents, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation it gives to the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty severely to visit for it. Surely therefore those among <hi>our selves,</hi> who have no Sense of the fatal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a general Corruption of Manners, upon <hi>both</hi> those Accounts, must either have little more of <hi>Men</hi> than the Figure and Shape; or (which is infinitely worse) <hi>be given over to a Reprobate Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44193:15"/>
Now, notwithstanding God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has constituted one Order of Men, whose whole Business it is, to turn Sinners (with the Assistance of His Grace) to Righteousness; and to Advance Piety and Virtue in the World, by inlightning Men in the Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion; by instructing them in the Divine Laws, and exciting them to the Observance of them, by the Glorious Promises, and Terrible Threats annexed to them; and by the Exercise of Spiritual Discipline: Yet such is the Depravation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, that He saw it more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over necessary, to ordain Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates <hi>for the Punishment of Evil-Doers,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks) <hi>and for the Praise,</hi> or Incouragement, <hi>of those that do well. For the Punishment of Evil-Doers,</hi> by inforcing their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Laws, with Laws of their own Enacting, with the Sanction of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Pecuniary Penalties; and the due inflicting of them on those
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44193:15"/>
who are too much hardned in their wicked Practices, to be reformed by the Menaces of Punishment in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life; and by Spiritual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>And it being the Business of the foresaid Societies, to do their utmost to <hi>Awaken</hi> the good Laws of our Land against Prophaneness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, which have for the most part a long time lain a sleep, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to little better purpose, than the reproaching of those (too generally speaking) who have been intrusted with the Execution of them: What more worthy Enterprize, or of greater, or so great Importance, could enter into the hearts os you, my Worthy Brethren, who have entered into these Societies, to undertake! And the method you have pitched upon for the carrying on of this Blessed Work, is so excellently well contrived, that it hath succeeded, by the Blessing of God, to Admiration,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44193:16"/>
in and about this City. This hath been a great Age for Projects; but this of <hi>Yours</hi> (tho' I undervalue it in so calling it) doth infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell them all; as very beneficial as some of them are found to be.</p>
            <p>It must be Acknowledged, that no Man is the more Religious for abstaining from the Practice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vice, merely for fear of <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Penalties: Yet those on whom this fear works an outward Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, are in a much more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way to a thorow Conversion from <hi>Religious</hi> Motives, than the more <hi>hardy</hi> Sinners. Besides, by the vigorous Execution of the Laws, wicked wretches are restrained from doing open dishonour to Almighty God; that dishonour to his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which may well be called <hi>National,</hi> when Connived at, and as <hi>such</hi> deservedly punished: And, by this means they are forced to give over offending <hi>Scandalously,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44193:16"/>
others by their infectious Example, and insnaring Practices. Whereupon will necessarily follow, that our Youth for the future, will be nothing so liable to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and a happy stop will be put to that propagation of Vice, which for so many Years hath been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreasing.</p>
            <p>And as nothing is more evident, than that this your Undertaking is the most excellent one considered in it self; so we ought not in the least to doubt but that it is likewise so, with respect to the <hi>Principle</hi> by which you are acted. For what Motive can you have thereto, besides the Love of God and Goodness, and an earnest desire to promote both the Temporal and Eternal Wellfare of your Fellow Citizens and Country-Men; together with the hope of being qualified thereby for greater degrees of that Happiness which our Blessed Lord has promised to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44193:17"/>
his faithful Servants, and chiefly confisteth in Likeness to GOD, and the Eternal Enjoyment of him? Which hope must as much proceed from Love to God, as to your selves.</p>
            <p>Can you design any <hi>Secular</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by being thus employed? <hi>Expense</hi> it brings upon you; but can it make you a Recompence for it, and for all your pains, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what the World calls <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit?</hi> I must be an idle Man, if I seriously asked you these Questions. There is a Reward from <hi>Men,</hi> which you could not but expect, when you entred into this Service; and you have accordingly <hi>found</hi> it: But I verily believe this was no <hi>Motive</hi> to you. I mean, the Reward of hard Censures, as a Company of Busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies, and Medlers in Matters that don't concern you; tho' if they concern not <hi>you,</hi> they can concern no body. But, indeed, nothing is more evident, than that every Man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44193:17"/>
without Exception, is obliged to Concern himself in this great Work, suitably to the Circumstances in which Providence hath placed him. And none can accuse those of you who are not Magistrates, as Seizing upon <hi>their</hi> Office. The best of it is, you cannot be Censured, as <hi>Exercising your selves in things too high for you</hi> (tho' you do in <hi>great Matters)</hi> this your <hi>Success</hi> demonstrates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brow-beatings</hi> also from too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who ought to have given you the greatest Encouragement, is a Reward which I suppose did not neither come unlookt for; nor yet that of <hi>Vexatious Prosecutions;</hi> nor that of running imminent dangers from Lewd Mobs: Neither <hi>these,</hi> nor <hi>worse</hi> things can surprize those, who are bent upon doing their utmost to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Overthrowing of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Kingdom; who express the greatest Emnity to the darling Lusts of his Children, and to the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44193:18"/>
               <hi>Trades</hi> of a great number of them.</p>
            <p>And, whether you <hi>Expected</hi> them or no, you cannot be ignorant what Reflections upon your proceedings, many <hi>Sober</hi> People have been too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to make; and some who have the Repute (and very justly I doubt not) of <hi>truly Religious</hi> People too; thro' their rash Credulity, and lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too favourable an Ear to idle Tales; and from jealousies of what Consequence such <hi>Combinations</hi> may in time prove to be to our Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in Church and State. On which Topick I never yet heard one wise word; and do perswade my self I never <hi>shall.</hi> And since Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience assures us of nothing more, than that no great Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king can be managed with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Advantage, otherwise than by <hi>Societies;</hi> and therefore in all Professions they are found to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: It is very wonderful to <hi>me,</hi> that the least danger to <hi>either</hi> of these
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44193:18"/>
Constitutions can be suspected from <hi>such</hi> Societies, as are formed wholly for the promoting of the <hi>grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of both;</hi> as I need not say the <hi>Reformation and Regulation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> is. But it will be well for those Regular Persons, who are so forward to find fault with <hi>these</hi> Societies, if there be nothing of <hi>Envy</hi> at the bottom, arising from their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of being much out done by them, in Concern for the Publick Weal, in Activity in doing good, and in Zeal for the Honour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And, mentioning their <hi>Zeal,</hi> I cannot but observe, that were it not as Prudent as Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their Adversaries would never have been baffled in Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, as they have been.</p>
            <p>And as, my Brethren, you might reasonably have made account of far <hi>worse</hi> requitals for your Pains, than any of you have found hitherto, through the special protection of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44193:19"/>
Divine Providence, and yet you <hi>would</hi> run the Venture; so have I not heard, that the furious Rage which some have met with, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving informations against Impious and Profligate People, hath in the least discouraged any of them. And by the way, none but such as are either wicked, or very silly, can look upon <hi>this</hi> as a base Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as infamous as the Trade of Informing was against <hi>another</hi> sort of Men, we know when. For since Crimes must <hi>ever</hi> go unpunished, if there be no Informations; and therefore no care can be taken, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Honour of God, or the Honour of the Government, and the Welfare of the Publick, or of the Souls of Obdurate Sinners; <hi>this</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more necessary than <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Service.</p>
            <p>But to return to what I was now saying, the principle of this your Zeal may not, without great Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44193:19"/>
nor apparent Injustice, be called in question: Since, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what has been said, you must be the <hi>Weakest</hi> Men in the World, if you do not this Service, <hi>as to the Lord, and not as to Men:</hi> Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring likewise, how not only <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Deism, speculative Prophaneness,</hi> and <hi>Contempt of Religion,</hi> but also a <hi>Gallio like</hi> indifferency in such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Profession of Christianity, have gotten ground amo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g us; and how much the very <hi>form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is grown out of fashion among such as may not be accused of being irreligious in their Principles. So that there can be very little Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>now,</hi> what so ever was <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,</hi> to the vice of Hipocrisy: It being become also very Modish, to give jerks at <hi>all</hi> Zeal as a fanatical, enthusiastical, and hot-brain'd thing. As indeed Zeal <hi>is,</hi> when <hi>it is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Knowledge;</hi> and the World hath had lamenrable Experience, and particularly <hi>our</hi> Church and State,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44193:20"/>
of the horrible Mischievousness of such a Zeal. But this is a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, it may by no means be called a Religious Zeal.</p>
            <p>But doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>It is good to be always zealously affected in a good thing?</hi> And it is the <hi>Best</hi> of things, in the Opinion of all but the <hi>worst</hi> of Men, in which these Societies are zealously affected. To be inspired with a Zeal in things of this weighty Importance, which is well Principled and well Governed, is the most Blessed Thing we can pray for. The more we have of it, the more shall we be <hi>filled with all the Fruits of Righteousness, unto the Praise and Glory of God.</hi> The more <hi>like</hi> shall we be to our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour, whose Zeal for His Father's Glory, and the Salvation of Men, and their <hi>bodily</hi> Welfare too, did put Him upon <hi>always going up and down doing good.</hi> And I need not stand to shew, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44193:20"/>
Blessings that ever have accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church of God, by the Ministry of Men, have been the Effects of a warm Zeal: Nor was ever GOD much glorified, nor the publick well served without it; let our Fleerers at Zeal think what they please. And therefore to be called <hi>Zealots</hi> in such a Cause as you, my Brethren, have espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is so far from a Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is a Name to be <hi>glorified in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that I once more say, Your doing this Service <hi>as to the Lord, and not as to Men,</hi> may not be in the least doubted of; and the <hi>less</hi> may it, for what was now sadly observed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the prevailing Humour of the present Age, is such, as gives as little Temptation as can be, to affect Popularity by Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this Nature.</p>
            <p>And having reflected upon the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44193:21"/>
deplorable Degeneracy of the Age, I can not forbear professing to you, That the greatest Hope I have, that God hath still Mercy in store for us, notwithstanding the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Returns we have made to as mighty Obligations, as he hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid upon any People, is, from the excellent Spirit with which He hath of late indued so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good Christians among us, for the running down of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by the most justifiable Means, in their respective Stations: And from His <hi>Majesty's</hi> having given them so great Encouragement, by his late Proclamation, <hi>For the more effectual Suppressing of Immorality and Prophaneness;</hi> and his recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great Work, again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to the special Care of the Houses of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And I pray God, they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the King's Desire the next Session; by preparing for the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44193:21"/>
Assent as effectual a Bill or Bills, against the other Reigning Vices of the Age, as is the late <hi>Act against Prophane Swearing and Cursing.</hi> And who were the Contrivers, and chief Promoters of <hi>this</hi> Act, some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the chief of these Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do best know.</p>
            <p>But I must not forget to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Another</hi> most Pious and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Design, which hath for some time been carrying on with very great Industry, by these Societies, <hi>viz.</hi> The Setting up of <hi>Free Schools</hi> in the great Parishes within and without this City; for the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of poor Children to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Write,</hi> and <hi>cast Account,</hi> to enable them for honest Callings; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the imprinting in them the Principles of Christianity; and the forming of them to true Piety and Goodness.</p>
            <p>There are several of these Schools
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44193:22"/>
already set up by them; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Parishes of <hi>Aldgate</hi> and <hi>Wapping,</hi> and St. <hi>Margarets West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster.</hi> And an Account will be shortly published of the Progress of their Endeavours; and their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Orders for the Securing, and rightly applying what is and shall be given, for the promoting of so excellent a Design.</p>
            <p>And surely 'tis impossible that any good Christian, should not freely contribute according to his Ability, to such a Work as this. Nay all such, certainly, must needs be very <hi>glad</hi> of the opportunity now given them, of being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the best of all Charities; and of having such faithful and skilful Hands at their Service, for the imploying and Management of this their Charity.</p>
            <p>Now for your Encouragement, my worthy Brethren, to persevere
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44193:22"/>
in doing these incomparable pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Services <hi>as to the Lord;</hi> and the more powerfully to excite us all <hi>thus</hi> to do all our Services, of what Nature soever, I shall lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you a few <hi>Considerations;</hi> upon which I want time to enlarge, as I would do.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This doing our Services <hi>as to the Lord,</hi> will make <hi>those</hi> very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delightful, which would otherwise be as grievous and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome. You have heard, that <hi>thus to do,</hi> is to Act from a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Love to GOD and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And who knows not, that <hi>Love</hi> is an Affection most highly Pleasing? And therefore <hi>how much</hi> there is of it in any performance, <hi>so much</hi> of delight there must needs be. Now, if <hi>Love,</hi> whatsoever is its Object, carrys pleasure with it; <hi>what</hi> Pleasure must necessarily arise from <hi>that</hi> Love which is placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Infinitely most Lovely Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44193:23"/>
               <hi>GOD,</hi> and that which is the next Lovely, <hi>Goodness;</hi> or rather, which is scarcely to be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from <hi>Him;</hi> and no otherwise at <hi>most,</hi> than as Rayes from the Sun, or streams from their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p n="2">II. This will greatly Dignifie our Services, and therefore <hi>our selves.</hi> 'Twill make all Acts of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> Acts of <hi>Piety:</hi> 'i will hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low all our <hi>Civil</hi> Employments, and make them <hi>Sacred;</hi> it will make even <hi>drugery Divine,</hi> saith our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Poet Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Servant of <hi>Men,</hi> by having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to God in his Services, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>HIS</hi> Servant, and a Fellow-Minister with the Glorious Angels: For, <hi>the doing God's will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven;</hi> for which our Blessed Saviour hath taught us to Pray, consisteth in doing it from <hi>This</hi> Principle; many of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Angels being, for the <hi>Matter</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:44193:23"/>
of them, such as <hi>We</hi> are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing, in <hi>This</hi> state at least.</p>
            <p>The Angels, considering the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Nature, may be said to be more meanly employed than the meanest of Men; as being Attendants on us poor Worms, who are mueh more their Inferiors, than the poorest Peasant is the greatest Peers: But they designing their Great Creators Service, in being serviceable to <hi>us,</hi> makes them to be employed Honourably, and like <hi>themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Nothing but this hearty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God in our Services, will secure our <hi>Constancy</hi> in well-doing. The discouragements we shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in find, upon the failing of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, will sooner or later quire dishearten us, when we chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propose to our selves the poor low ends of Gain or Credit; but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44193:24"/>
especially, upon our meeting with a quite contrary Reward to what we hoped for. We shall be ready <hi>then</hi> to say, with those profane <hi>Jews, It is vain to Serve God; and what profit is it, that we have kept His Ordinances?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. This will be consequently a great <hi>Support</hi> to our Spirits, when we find our good Services not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by Men; or not to have their desired success. When we do good Offices either to the Bodies or Souls of Men, and find our selves unworthily requited, it goes to our Hearts: But we are soon easy again, when we can <hi>thus</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, I did these Services <hi>as to the Lord, more than to Men; and God is not Unrighteous to forget my Work and Labour of Love, which I have shewed to His Name;</hi> which is the Encouragement Given by the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. and was that which enabled him, to express
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44193:24"/>
himself so <hi>bravely</hi> as he did. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>I will very gladly spend, and be spent for you, tho' the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly I love you, the less I be loved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Nothing will secure to us the <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> in difficult Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but being governed by this <hi>Divine Principle.</hi> Nor can we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably have the least suspicion, of Gods readiness to go along with us in those Services, to which we are induced by the love of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and a generous desire of doing good.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. This is that only which can give us a well - grounded hope of <hi>Success</hi> in any good undertaking. I know no Argument <hi>that</hi> Man can urge, to encline God Almighty to give a Blessing to his Endeavours, who is chiefly acted by little private selfish ends.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:44193:25"/>
VII The successes those have who Chiefly design <hi>themselves,</hi> or the gratifying of their <hi>Animal</hi> Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, will prove more unhappy to them, than their greatest disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments: They will help to make them so much the more miserable, both here and hereafter. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> as they will aggravate their Punishment, by aggravating their Sins; and <hi>here,</hi> as they will more and more Encourage them in those <hi>gratifications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Self-designer who <hi>obtaineth</hi> that Credit, that Profit, or Sensual Pleasure, he hunteth after, becomes by this means more <hi>uneasy</hi> than he was before: For the more any Lust is pampered, the stronger it grows; and there is nothing a Man's Observation, Experience and Feeling, do more fully prove to him, than that <hi>all</hi> Lusts are very troublesome things; and therefore no wonder that <hi>Perturbationes</hi> was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44193:25"/>
the common <hi>Philosophical</hi> Name for them.</p>
            <p>There may also be given not a few Instances of <hi>Outward</hi> Mischiefs, that attend on Mens prosperous Successes in <hi>Selfish</hi> Designs: But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to our <hi>last</hi> Consideration, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. By principally designing the <hi>Glory of God</hi> in all our Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we infinitely best consult our <hi>own</hi> Interest. This was touched upon in the <hi>Doctrinal part.</hi> By <hi>our own</hi> interest, we are to understand the interest of our <hi>Souls:</hi> Our <hi>Souls</hi> being <hi>our selves,</hi> our Bodies <hi>ours</hi> not <hi>our selves;</hi> as some of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> have observed. And therefore the interest of our Bodies, is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Our</hi> interest, than as it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to that of our Souls. The Glory of God, and our Happiness are so inseparably conjoyned, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44193:26"/>
in promoting the <hi>one,</hi> we promote the <hi>other</hi> also. So that he loves <hi>himself</hi> best, who loves <hi>God</hi> most; and he who chiefly designeth His Glory, in the best and truest sence is the most Selfish Man.</p>
            <p>And thus are we come to the <hi>Motive in the Text, knowing that</hi> whatsoever good thing any Man doth, (viz. <hi>as to the Lord, and not unto Men) the same shall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Lord,</hi> Or (as we have it in the parallel place) <hi>Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the Reward of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And this <hi>Reward of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> we find in our Text shall be <hi>proportioned</hi> to the Services we do: To our Services, not to our Successes; Endeavour only being <hi>our</hi> Work. <hi>This</hi> the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> did <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mfort himself withall. <hi>Chap.</hi> 49. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. 5. <hi>Then said I, I have laboured in vain; I have spent my Strength for nought, and in vain:</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:44193:26"/>
               <hi>Yet surely my Judgment is with the Lord, and my Work</hi> (or Reward) <hi>is with my God. And now, saith the Lord, who formed me from the Womb, to be his Servant, to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>again unto Him; tho' Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my Srength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh how Admirable, how Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, are the Expressions by which this <hi>Reward of the Inheritance</hi> is set forth to us! It is called <hi>an Inheritance incorruptible and undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, reserved in Heaven for us: A Building of God, and an House not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens: A Crown of Life,</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> and of <hi>Glory: A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared from the Beginning of the World: A being with Christ,</hi> and <hi>beholding the Glory which the Father hath given Him: A Sitting with Him upon his Throne, even as he Sits on his Father's Throne:</hi> A
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44193:27"/>
               <hi>transcendently transcendent</hi> (as the Words may be rendred) <hi>and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting weight of Glory.</hi> By <hi>these</hi> and <hi>more</hi> such Amazing Words, is this Reward expressed by our Blessed Saviour Himself, and His holy Apostles.</p>
            <p>But by <hi>our interest,</hi> I understand likewise the interest of our Souls, with respect to the <hi>Bodies</hi> with which they shall be Cloathed: Since the happiness of the other Life is set forth by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>having our vile Body so changed</hi> by Christ, as to be <hi>fashioned like unto his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body.</hi> And our Saviour might have a special reference to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Bodies of the Righteous, in saying, that <hi>They shall Shine forth like the Sun, in the Kingdom of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by the <hi>Exceeding great and precious promises</hi> of the Gospel, as St, <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, <hi>viz.</hi> The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44193:27"/>
Promises of so unspeakable a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness as is therein described, <hi>What</hi> may we not be Encouraged to <hi>do,</hi> for the Glorifying of our most Blessed Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier! And <hi>What</hi> may we not be Encouraged to <hi>Suffer</hi> too, for the same end! The <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this present Life,</hi> being <hi>not Worthy to be Compared with the Glory, that shall be revealed in us;</hi> as saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>therefore, my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (to <hi>conclude</hi> with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of that great Apostle) <hi>be ye stedfast, immoveable, alwaies abounding in the Work of the Lord; for as much as you know, that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord:</hi> Our Labour will be so far from being <hi>in vain,</hi> that we have now heard our Reward will infinitely exceed the greatest Services, we can ever be capable of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Through the Merits of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44193:28"/>
our Dear Lord and Saviour, Christ Jesus; to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be Ascribed by Us and the whole World, all Honour and Glory, now and for ever.</p>
