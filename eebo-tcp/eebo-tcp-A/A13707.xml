            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The second part of my Antecedent viz. that the scripture hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny senses litterall; many senses spirituall; of whose manifold, deepe and mysticall sense, the ignorant reader cannot be possest. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since in the old law when any difficulty happened, the Preist was to decyde it; and therefore with a farre greater interest is the Preist of the new law that hath that spirit of interpretation redoubled, and ratification of his doctrine assigned and confirmed by Christ Jesus himselfe. is to expound the hidden senses of scripture.

                        </gap> bids S. Peter and his successors feed his flock with the spirit of interpretation, which is the food to a reasonable flock and fold. This made the Apostles when they were to decyde the controversies about the cessatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ceremonies of the old law, not to repaire vnto their private spirits interpretation, but to a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell gathered in Hierusalem, where S. Peter was head: where all was concluded with <hi>Visum est Spiritui sancto et nobis,</hi> It seemes good vnto the holy ghost and vnto vs. And therefore let S. Peter himself conclude.

For they doe not onely allow of private lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mens interpretation, but the poorest handycrafts man, or the sillpest huswife that is, they doc allow to interpret the hardest places of scripture, to shoulder the vniforme consent of all the fathers, Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and schoolemen, with some fond toyes of their owne braine, and invention; yea to give their glosse of those places of S.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we are referred to the scriptures for assurance of our faith: so also are we willed not <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 6. phronein.</note> to presume, (or be wise) above that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. This being the auctoritie and authentia of the scriptures, as we are taught of God: let us now weigh your reasons alleged to disable them.</p>
                     <p>Your first argument is:</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The whole word of God being of it self worthy to be credited, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving testimony of the same Spirit which spake &amp; wrote it, is also further confirmed by the power &amp; effect therof in the conscience, peircing more sharply then any <note n="“" place="margin">Heb. 4, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

perhaps he cannot perswade it, to them which are carnal &amp; have not the spirit; as the <note n="*" place="margin">Iude, 19.</note> Apostle speaketh. It this be not, as I have shewed; but we must rely upon men, for the ground of our faith: then would I know, how you can perswade an infidel, to beleeve Christianisme rather then Mahometisme, to be the way of life. For the Turk will say &amp; swear that the Alkoran is of God; as the Pope will say of the new Testament. And if mens voices shall cary it away, our beleef in Christ is lost. If mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles be alleged, there is still the same controversie, whither they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or divilish: for hethens and idolaters have had miracles many; and Antichrist, as it is prophesied, shal <note n="‡" place="margin">Rev. 13, 13.</note> shall doe great wonders, making fyre to come down from heaven on the earth, in the sight of men Your other allegations of antiquitie, Vniversalitie &amp;c. wil not stop the mouth of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> the Apostata, but he will bear down Christianitie and restore Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, as being ancient and universal. So there wil be no setling of the conscience til it come unto God, and rest upon him alone, and receive the plerophorian, the full assurance by his spirit; without which men can not discerne between the propheticall writings and the Iewes Thalmud, between Christs Testament and the Turks Alkoran, or between Gods oracle out of the Debir in Ierusalem, and the Divils oracle out of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Delphos.</p>
                     <p>Again, as the Israelites discerned canonical scriptures from others; so doo we: for we Gentiles are <note n="‡" place="margin">Ephes. 3, 6</note> coheyrs with them, and of the same body; for there is <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 4, 4, 5</note> one body and one spirit, as there is one Lord and one faith. But they relyed not on the Church, or on the Highpreist &amp; his council: for had they so doon, their church must haue had privilege not to err, (as you think of yours,) which if you grant a Iew, he wil overthrow your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef in Christ, seing their Preists, Elders &amp; people condemned Christ, his Apostles, and their writings. As you would answer a Pharisee for this point, so mind the like answer to your self</p>
                     <p>Finally your plea is overthrown &amp; confounded by your own practise: for you will have us receive the scriptures for canonical, because your Church of Rome sayth so they are: we must beleeve upon her word, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie and Iudith to be canonical, but the third and fourth of Esdras, not: the first and second of the Machabees to be canonical, but not the third or fourth. If any make question of this for conscience sake; you seek to resolve him by the definitive sentence of the Pope who cannot err. But if he ask why the Pope of Rome may not err, aswel as the Patriarch of Constantinople: you then allege (as after to me in this your letter) Christs promise to Peter, Mat. 16 and there you scan every word, and presse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very circumstance of the text, to make him beleeve that Peter was the Rock and head of the Church, and consequently the Popes his successors. Ask he you againe, how he shall know that Matthewes gospel (wherin this promise is written) is canonical, rather then Nicodemus gospel you will answer because the Pope hath so determined. Thus the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and ground of your religion, bringeth men into a maze and Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth: for we must beleeve the Pope cannot err, because Christ sayth such
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:603:10"/>
words to Peter; which the Pope expoundeth and applyeth to himself: &amp; we must beleeve that Christ sayd them words, because the Pope hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that he sayd them. Thus the foundation of our faith, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wholly upon man, (a clod of clay:) whatsoever he telleth us is scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that must we so esteme; how ever he expound scripture, so must we take it: what he sayth is tradition or Gods unwritten word; we must so regard and keep it: be it never so absurd, against the light of nature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason, against the grounds of faith; against the evident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the prophets and Apostles; we must captivate all our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, faith and conscience, under the Popes wisdome: and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he telleth us we must so doo. Otherweise, if we may trie this principle of yours by the scripture, through the light of Gods spirit in us; then may we doe the like of other, which be of lesser moment. Consider I pray you this first point seriously; and the Lord give you understanding in all things. And let me here put you in mind (though I be not yet come to the end,) of the last motive in your letter, where you tell me how <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shalbe demanded at the tribunal of almighty God, why you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the Roman catholik church;</hi> you can answer, <hi>by reason Christ himself teacheth you so,</hi> saying, <hi>He that heareth you heareth me</hi> &amp;c. But deceive not your own soul; for when Christ shall ask you at that day, why you have worshiped images, sung masse and Dirige, prayed to Saints and soules departed, and <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 15, 3.</note> transgressed many other of his fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements by your traditions; you will answer, because the head of your church the Pope did teach you so; when he shall ask you, how you knew the Pope to be head of the church, and to haue such authoritie over your conscience; you will answer because Christ himself spake such words to Peter as are written, Mat. 16. When he ask you agayn, how you knew that he spake those words, or that they extended to the Pope of Rome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other: your answer vvil be (according to the grounds of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) because the Pope himself, vvith his senate of Cardinals did tel you so.

                     <p>I answer, you hold not to the point which you took upon you to prove, viz. that <hi>the bare word of God is not an infallible rule of truth:</hi> the scripture you cite maketh against you; for the Apostles were publishers not of their own word but of Gods, 1. Thes. 2, 13. 1. Pet. 1. 25. 2. Pet 1. 16. They confirmed their sayings in this Council, by the former scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Act 15, 15, 16.

And vvhere you say <hi>S. Peter was head</hi> of that council, you passe the boundes of the text vvhich shevves no such thing. Christ vvas <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 18, 20 Eph. 1. 22.</note> the head, and he guided them by his <note n="‡" place="margin">Act. 15. 28</note> holy spirit.

                     <p>The first part of this your argument I deney, for neyther many nor any mysteries of our faith, are without their due and sufficient proof from the holy scriptures. You labour to confirm that you sayd, thus, because till Moses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <p>Your first reason is altogither insufficient: for though the scriptures could be no perfect rule of faith, before they were written; yet after the writing of them, they mought be, and so were. You might as well say, neyther tradition nor doctrine by lively voice, could be a rule of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was spoken. You might also say, the scriptures are not sufficient to make one beleeve any one mysterie of faith, seing before Moses, all my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries were taught by voice. The <note n="*" place="margin">Exo 25, 40</note> pattern of the Tabernacle shewed to Moses on the mount, could be no perfect rule for him to build by, before it was shewed. Was it not therfore a perfect and sufficient pattern, after it was exhibited? Even so the scriptures, now that they are written, are a sufficient rule and assurance of our faith. Ioh. 20. 31. 2 Tim. 3. 16. 17.

Wherfore Christ prayed not onely for Simo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for all the Saincts; though speciall need and use was for him at that time: yet as Paul sayth of Abrahams justification, <note n="‡" place="margin">Rom. 4, 23, 24.</note> it is not written for him onely, but also for us; so say I of Simons confirmation by the prayer of Christ: for whatsoever is written, is written for our learning Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 15. 4.</p>
                     <p>But you prosequute your argument thus, that S. Peter was bidden <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his brethren; but onely S.

If this be not a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to prove a supremacie of visitation; the other is no better to prove a supremacie of Confirmation. For the church in generall is a <note place="margin">1.

Christ sayd he would build his church upon that Rock (petra) and had changed before Simons name not into that, but into Petros. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as CEPHAS the Syriak name is ambiguous to signifie in Greek both PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRON and PETRAN; the ambiguitie is cleared by the holy Ghost, in Ioh 1. 43. where <hi>Cephas</hi> the mans name is interpreted <hi>Petros,</hi> that is in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>a stone.</hi> Moreover that Simons name was not <hi>Petra</hi> Rock, is playn by Mat. 16. wher the Apostle distinguisheth the terms, adding also a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune demonstrative of the <note n="*" place="margin">

As it standeth not with the grammatical construction that Simon should have the name of the <hi>Rock:</hi> so neyther standeth it with the theological explication. For the Rock signified Christ himself, who was figured out to his Church by a Rock, 1. Cor. 10. 4. which is a title that Moses and the prophets after him, give unto God; as <note n="†" place="margin">Deu. 32, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.</note> 
                        <hi>perfect is the work of the Rock;</hi> and, <hi>the Rock of his salvation;</hi> and many the like: and that he onely is the true and proper Rock of the church, we are taught by this and the like speeches, <note n="‡" place="margin">2 Sam. 22. 32.</note> vvho is a Rock save our God? meaning none ells. So Christ is called <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 23.</note> the head of the church, and not any Apostle; and he is the onely foundation upon which the church is builded, as it is written, <note n="”" place="margin">1. Cor. 3, 11.</note> Other foundation can no man lay, then that which is layd, which is Iesus Christ. And Peter himself telleth us that <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> Christ is the Rock and living stone, unto vvhich all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as living stones doe come, and are builded to a spiritual house. And Simon being a principal stone in this house, had therfore the name <hi>Peter</hi> Stone, of <hi>Petra,</hi> as we all of Christ haue the name Christians; and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith, are living <hi>stones,</hi> that is <hi>Peters;</hi> having obteyned <note n="†" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> isotimon pistin, a like precious faith with Simon Peter himself, and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: though as touching order, they were principal, next unto Christ, (as it is written <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.</note> first Apostles, secondly Prophets &amp;c:) and then other officers and brethren, in their due places.</p>
                     <p>Moreover were it granted that Christ meant to build his church upon S.

Wherfore Christ builded the Church upon the 12. not upon one alone; &amp; it resteth upon you to prove that by saying super hanc Petram, Christ secluded Peter from the rest; for the rest had the rock, and belonged therto aswel as Simon, though he were foremost in the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The like answer I make, for the delivery of

keyes to Peter; (a thing which you barely mention:) they were not given to him alone. For as Christ asked his disciples joyntly (and not Peter onely,) <note place="margin">Mat. 16, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> whom say ye that I am? so Simon answered not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone, but for them all. Wherupon Christ pronounced a blessing, and annexed promises, not for him alone, but (as you grant for his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors also, as I defend,) for the other Apostles also. This may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other like testimonies, as Iohn. 6, 67. where Christ saying to the 12. will ye also goe away? then Simon Peter answered, Master to whom shal we goe? wherby it is playn, that Christ asking all, when one answered, he answered for all: therfore also the blessing upon the answer, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all; and so the promises not peculiar to Peter, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune with the rest. <note n="†" place="margin">The scripture plainly confirmeth this doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Apostles had equal power in using them. Your supply of proof from testimonie of later doctors, I leave as insufficient; their writings neyther being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentik, nor any thing so ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as the Apostles writings; and the most ancient records, I stand to be tried by. Yet if I lysted to fight with such weapons, I could cite Doctors against Doctors, and many against you, &amp; Augustine <note n="‡" place="margin">De verb. Dom. Serm 13.</note> most plainly contrarying your opinion, and saying that the Rock was that vvhich Peter confessed &amp; knew when he sayd that Christ was the son of the living God; and that the Rock was Christ, not Peter: but I will not presse you with mans auctoritie; the book of God shalbe my panoplie, and sufficient artillerie.</p>
                     <p>Your last proof is from Iohn. 21. Where Christ sayd to Peter, <hi>Feed my sheep: which sounds as much</hi> (you say) <hi>as have care of my fold: but in S. John. 10. it is sayd, there is but one flock and one shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard &amp;c. and therfore he honours Peter thrise with the stile of an Universal Pastor.</hi> This reason hath like frayltie as the former. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that Peter alone was to feed Christs sheep, for he sent al his Apostles with that charge. Mat. 28. 19, 20. and before this speech to him, he had sayd to them all, As my father sent me, so send I you, Ioh. 20, 21. Peter therfore as he was <note place="margin">1.

Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. 4. The same, Christ also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth in the place you allege, Iohn, 10. for there he sayth, <note place="margin">vers. 11. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

With many like speeches vvhich cannot vvithout blasphemie be applied to any mere man, but to him vvhich is <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 30.</note> one vvith the Father. And therfore unlesse you vvil renounce
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:603:16"/>
Christ, and make Peter your Rock, your God, your Saviour, that layd down his life for you, to give you eternal life  you cannot make him that <note n="*" place="margin">vers. 16.</note> one Pastor over the one fold of Iewes and Gentiles. Wherfore neyther thrise nor yet once, is Peter honoured with the stile of universal Pastor; but onely is charged <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. 21.</note> to feed Christs sheep, as other Pastors also are required; &amp; our Lord Iesus <note n="‡" place="margin">Heb. 13, 20.</note> the great Pastor of the sheep, hath given not one but many Pastors for this work: Ephe. 4. 11.</p>
                     <p>Having heard your reasons for Peters headship, I exspected somewhat for your Popes pretended primacie; but for this you shew no evidence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods book; you have none I trow, so ancient. Wherfore your position <hi>That the Popes definitive sentence as he is head of the church, is an indeficient rule in matters of faith:</hi> is farr as yet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being proved. And though this preeminence were yeilded for Cephas, yet would I not grant the like for Caiaphas: though Peter vvere the Rock on which Christs Church is builded; yet your house may be situate on the sands, for ought you have sayd to perswade the contrarie. But let us see what the 3. point in your letter wil afford, which now next foloweth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly and breifly</hi> you take upon you to <hi>shew that your Romane<note place="margin">III.</note> church is the true and onely catholik church of God, that holy citie. Apoc.</hi> 21. &amp;c. And first <hi>your church</hi> (you say) <hi>is catholik, for in your memory, you onely are catholiks, in so much that the name catholik was hateful to a puritan or a protestant,</hi> citing <hi>Beza, D.

What if others should say, your church is the whore of Babylon Apoc. 17. because in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory you only are lovers of that whore, in so much that the name <hi>whore</hi> is hateful to a puritan or protestant. Would you approve of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Yea but it is (you say) <hi>against the article of our beleef</hi> to deney the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik church. I answer, we beleeve <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 15, Gal. 4. 26.</note> ther is a catholik, that is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal church; no puritan or protestant I think denyes it.

                     <p>Now to descend down, more particularly vnto your answer: you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arp first at my proceeding, which I thought by a distinction <hi>direct enough,</hi> at which you except: as though direct and distinct, are not in the sense I take them, all one, and so then to answer by a distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to give a <hi>direct, or a distinct answer.</hi> But you are like one, that is even wearied ere ever he sets forth foot in journey; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make your journey the shorter, you would conceive it onely in a continued, and dead way, deluding therby your self with imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that your journey is shorter; And therefore I think you in a confuse dealing seeme more fearful of the way to run then I that consider the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are to handle by distinct points, dividing my answer by the eye of judgement into distinct portions. And therfore I answer you againe when you demaund of me what shall decide al controversies in religion, whether the word of God or of man? <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer you directly enough that by Gods written, and unwritten word, as by a formal motive we are to be tried;</hi> and by the catholick church as by <hi>a propounding manner, &amp; by way of circumstance</hi> necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to show what is authentick, and what is not canonica; And so I hope this answer is direct and plaine ynough: Aske a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher what burneth, and he wil tell you the fire and his qualitie; but demaund how approximation of the subject concurreth, without which the fire never naturally burneth, and he wil tell you it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio sine qua non most necessarily required. Ask a Philosopher, who gives power to some hidden herb vnknowen, to have his operation; he will answer the nature of the herbe principally, but what doth determine it, <hi>hic, et nunc,</hi> to work, he will answer the art, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the herbalist, that findeth out the secret nature of the herbe showes how it is to be applied, and vsed to have his due operation. So here I answer that Gods written, and vnwritten word formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and principally causeth vs to beleeve, but the church that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it as Gods word, concurreth as an applying circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce;

                        </gap>howse of truth showeth vs vnfalliblie what is to be beleeved and what is not. And therfore you wonder without cause that I should answer by a distinction, definition and distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two eyes or guides of reason. But now to proceed to the matter, I intend briefly to show how my reasons that I gave to prove my assertion, viz: That onely the scripture is not a sufficient rule and an infallible guide of faith, remaine yet (for all your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended answer) in firme force unshaken.</p>
                     <p>2. I intend to show how your reasons deduced out of the holy scriptures are not reasons, in that they are wrested from that sense, in which the holy Ghost spake them or meant them.</p>
                     <p>3. As occasion shall offer I will touch your answer to the other questions, leaving the exact and direct handling therof vntill this controversie in hand be ended.</p>
                     <p>First then you set down the first argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which I brought thus; Nothing is to be beleeved that is not taught, or manifestly gathered<note place="margin">I.</note> out of the written word: But that the Bible is canonical is not taught, or gathered out of the written word, therfore it is not to be beleeved that the Bible is canonicall. Mark then how Mr Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth<note place="margin">An ans. to his oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of my first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> smooths up the matter that he hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a sufficient answer; when he answers that <hi>the pillars of our propositions are earth &amp; ashes, and therfore the whole frame of my Argument lieth in the dust.</hi> Then descending more particularly he answereth that my Major is too generall. For he sayes many things may be beleeved, though <hi>they be not gathered out of the written word,</hi> so that we see he holds some tradition necessary besides the written word, for he sayes to <hi>be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved</hi> that is with an act of faith, now that which is to be beleeved must be certaine, and must have also infallible, &amp; most certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives proportionable to so firm an act; and must be beleeved of those at least that are schollars, who are more precisely to examine the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of beleef then laiemen, so that wee have drawen water out of the rock since you graunt that tradition is necessary to your own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef: which afterwards you deny, when you say <hi>there is nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to salvation but is taught by the written word.</hi> For now I ask those many things that may be beleeved without the written word, eyther have their motives infallible and sufficiently propounded &amp; so they shalbe faultie, if those schollers to whom they are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proposed beleeve not: or else the motives that are propounded are not certaine, infallible, and constant, and so they shall onely cause an opinion, or at most a humane beleefe; and not a most firme, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant supernaturall art of faith, that is ever most certaine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible caused by the written, and the vnwritten word of God, and the church propounding. Moreover your answer is found halting, when you say, that there is nothing necessary unto salvation but is delivered by the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, which is most false, since nothing with
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:603:19"/>
you is more necessarie unto salvation then the written word, which word is not proved by an other written word, for so that also by an other, and so we should never have an end, so that hence you must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, though against your position, that something most necessary vnto salvation is to be bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eved, and that without the written word; now if that which is most necessary, and the rule of all the rest, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, in that it is delivered by tradition, surely things of lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence though necessary to salvation, may also be beleeved, though ther is no written word of God to affirme it, having tradition which is Gods vnwritten word tyme out of mynd to deliver it.</p>
                     <p>As for the proof of my Minor proposition, you put down these words I cited, though not learned out of <hi>Mr Hooker. For if any book gives testimonie to the rest, yet the scripture that gives credit to the rest would require another scripture to be credited, neither could we come to any pause wheron to rest</hi> or assurance that way; and if you answer that all scriptures are <hi>theopneustoi</hi> that is in pired of God, I will graunt you that, but I wil demaund how you prove that this book, or this parcel of scripture without tradition is inspired of God? For to say it is inspired of God, by reason it is scripture, and scripture by reason it is inspired of God, is to prove <hi>idem per idem,</hi> and <hi>petere principium,</hi> to suppose that prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pound it out of my writings thus. That which is difficult &amp; includeth many senses: at least to the ignorant can not bee a certaine rule of faith. But the scriptures are thus. My antecedent you admit proved by Tertullian S. Hierome, and S. Peter himselfe whose place you one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examin; the others you turne over as you are woont deeming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnworthy of your consideration. You examine that of S. Peter now where he sayes that in S. Pauls epistles <hi>are certaine things hard to be vnderstood which the vnlearned and the unstable deprave, as also the rest<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 16,</note> of the scriptures to their owne perdition.</hi> Here you except against me that I say many things in sted of certaine; where in deed I cited one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sense of that place propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it as the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vse for yours and their advantage, meaning so <hi>tacitè</hi> to prevent an objection. For they answer here that S. Paules epistles are not hard, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are hard. For the Greek copies have <hi>en hois</hi> that is in which things; and some read <hi>en hais</hi> in which epistles: And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you object that I say all the rest of the scripture, in <hi>stead of also the rest of scripture:</hi> I answer the holy Ghost may very well speak gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally since the very plainest places of scripture have bene wrested to bolster up heresies: Thirdly you say that this testimony proves scarse the first part of my antecedent that scriptures are onely difficult; but you say, it doth not prove, that scriptures cannot be an indeficient rule of faith. I answer that it proves both. For in what doth S. Peter say that S. Paul is hard, but concerning many points of our faith and religion, as concerning predestination, reprobation, voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gentiles, justification by faith. Of which high mysteries S. Paul is the cheif and principall Maister. And as for the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the artize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you bring makes much against you. For if an unst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So if a man misse of the right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; sense of those places of scripture touching predestination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation &amp;c. the corruption of that place is able to turne all the other places of scripture that leaues that way into his owne nature.</p>
                     <p>But now here to your reply that not all but onely some places of scripture are difficult and hard, though we see the contrary by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, since Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Berengar: have stumbled at the plainest places of scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz. <hi>This is my body;</hi> yea they stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there at though S.

But even as a pigeon that is seeled in your soaring spirit you see onely the way, at length to your own downfall, though in your conceit you ascend bolt upright for a season: But that the scripture hath many senses we leave as proved, and if to prove, fitter for another place: Now it sufficeth for this place to show that which you graunt to sufficient to prove the second part of my antecedent. For if that one sense hath reference to diverse tymes places and persons, it must needes be very difficult, &amp; require some common help besides themselves to obtaine their severall true expositions: nay here me thinks you graunt that the scriptures hath diverse senses, since you graunt diverse as it were formalities of senses respecting divers places, tymes and persons.</p>

of his spiritt, how then can a private spirit decide any controversie? And for that you bring of the Israelites, it were wel if you with them from the mouth of the Preist would learne wisdome. And if you had that visible coming downe of the holy Ghost that the Apostles had, if you had the giftes of tongues, the power to worke miracles; if you were taught with them all truth; if your followers though illitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were indowed with all these priviledges of the Apostles, then might they with them take upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to interpret the scriptures. For S.

                     <p>You now proceed and begin to ponder my third argument, by<note place="margin">III.</note> which I did occure a future answer. Not onely scriptures by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but scriptures by a privat mans interpretation, or comparing one place with an other are not sufficient to be a rule of faith. Which you say I dor not prove here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this I answer, I did prove it there but the more sparingly in that this point seemes to be partly proved in that which goes before. Yet to give you ful satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I wil a litle reinforce the force therof: For since the scriptures hath diverse senses, or as you say diverse references to sundry places, persons and tymes; how can a private spirit of a man assure one that this and no other is the true sense of this place? Or how can you discern that the true spirit interprets this vnto you? For the communication of this infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed spirit must eyther be by a publick message bee delivered you, so that those that are your adherents and followers may be assured, by some visible signe that the holy ghost dictates unto you: and I think by these visible apparitions and communication of the holy Ghost, you wil not mainteyn your spirits interpretation. Or else the holy ghost secretly instil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And though the communication of the true spirit should be manifest to your self, yet you could give no warrant or assurance thereof to vs; to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant adversaries, or to your own followers. How would you be able to convince an Aria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that wil thwart you with that of S. John, my father is greater then I: If you say this place is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in regard of his humanitie and not in regard of his divinitie, he will bid you show scripture plainly to affirme that. How wil you answer an Anabaptist that will have no man to be baptized before they come to the yeares of discretion to give a reason of their faith? How will you answer us Catholiks or the Protestants when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of you why you follow the vulgar translation, in saying El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when the originall and all other languages almost hath stil the word Presbyter, which signifies Preist to all? Nay since the holy
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:603:23"/>
scriptures admitteth divers senses and doe not explaine themselves, how should a poore artificer perswade himself that this sense which he apprehends is onely the true sense; Nay that he is easily deceided herein by a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>dicated opinion I will show. For when he comes to read that S. Peter in his first epistle salutes them from Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he in that he may not admit S.

                     <p>My fift argument which you put downe thus, Many misteries<note place="margin">V.</note> of our faith are beleeved which explicitely are not declared in the word of God, nor so infalliblie (prescinding from all traditions of the church) deduted thence, so as they are sufficient to make a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve with so firm an act of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith as is required. Therefore that which makes that worthy of constant beleefe is a rule of faith, aswel as the written word, whether they be traditious divine or Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>
                     <p>Now to all the places I bring to prove traditions How the world was onely governed and taught by traditions till Moses tyme, who was the first pen-man of the holy Ghost, and to that Ero. 14. Deu. 32. 37. &amp;c. you graunt that traditions were before necessary, but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:603:24"/>
you deny that they are now a rule of faith. But you assigne no reason but onely this in disputing as if it were the total rule of faith; where I would inferr onely that it was a partial togither with the word of God. And whereas you object that these traditions spoken of in Deut. might for the Jewish Cabalists, which are rejected by S. Peter, 1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Tit. 1. 14 as vain conversation and Jewish fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; Is plaine against the holy scriptures Deu. 32. <hi>interroga patrem tuum, et anuntiabit tibi, majores tuos et dicent tibi.</hi> Ask thy father &amp;c. Ero. 14. <hi>Narrabis filio tuo in illa die dicens hoc est quod fecit Dominus: Et Iob. 8. Iud. 6. Psal 43. Psal. 47. Eccles. 8;</hi> where it is plaine that the holy Ghost speakes of such traditions that are good to be followed &amp; not to be estemed vain, idle &amp; fabulous. To that of S. Pa: to the Thes. is plaine that the Apostle speakes of that which was taught by word of his mouth, yea of such traditions as you call humane in vs. For when S. Chrysost. comes to explicate the 2 Thess. 2. he explicates it so plainely for such traditions as wee have in controversie that D. Whitaker <hi>de sacra scriptura</hi> pag. 678. sayes that S. Chrisost. spoke in this point inconsiderately, &amp; vnworthy of so great a father. Therfore S. Paul and S. Chrysost: vnderstood more here by traditions then you would willingly vnderstand. And that not onely things of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle consequence but of greatest moment, are beleeved onely by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I prove manifestly since the Bible can not be canonicall without it were delivered by the hand of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyme to tyme as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke. And besides, how can you prove the procession of God the son, and God the holy Ghost from God the Father, as from one begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the consubstantilitie of the blessed Trinitie? How are you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble onely by bare scripture to prove the remedie in the old law vsed to women children for original sinne, and to man children when in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death before the eight day they necessarily were to receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of their sinne? How prove you that our blessed virgin Marie was a perpetuall virgin, <hi>ante partum, in partu, et post partum?</hi> how ar you able to prove this by the bare letter against Helvidius the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;<note place="margin">vide D. Hier. cont. Helvid. et D. August: haeresi 84.</note> for he vrgeth you with the plaine text, and with originall phrase viz. <hi>That he knew her not till the brought forth her first sonne;</hi> and the word know you know what it imports in the Hebrew phrase: As Abraham knew Sara: So that you see we beleeve this perfection of the blessed and perpetuall Uirgin Mary by tradition, though the bare text seems to make against it: How doe you prove that our sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day should be celebrated on sunday and not on saterday by the bare letter without tradition? How doe you prove the celebration of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as it is now, without tradition? How doe you prove the Creede of the Apostles out of the naked word? How doe you prove without tradition that you should receive the blessed sacrament kneeling? the receiving of it fasting? the eating of blood and stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled meates prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the Acts of the Apostles? How are you able to prove all these or any one of these by convincing reasons out of the holy scriptures
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:603:24"/>
alone? All these you say you can prove, not alleaging one place of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for any of them, though you have bene most copious to prove idem per idem in other pointes to little purpose. Now you say onely it would <hi>goe hard with you if you could not prove these without tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and me thinks it goes hard with you since you prove not one particular of them all. Therfore I desire you that you would not confound your trace so like the Fore, or hare in doubling, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but that you would answer distinctly to each poinct as it lies if you answer. Wherfore to shut up this point I will conclude with S. August: Genes: ad litt: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now since we are come to the answering of your arguments, which are nothing but allegations of scripture falsly applied, me thinks I cannot better compare them, then as to so many orient pearles and rich Jewels, hung and placed out of order in an Judian, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For when you bring the place of Deut. 5 32. to take heed that wee should doe as our Lord commaunded us; not turning to the right hand nor the left, and of that of Deut. 12. 32. not putting any thing therevnto, or taking any thing therfrom. I answer first granting that God commaundeth this, but I deny that hence can be gathered that in that we should doe as our Lord commaundeth us, and that we should not turne vnto the right hand or to the left, that the holy scripture should be the onely rule and v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and the fourth commandement is to be observed, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is onely the fourth commaundement, and it is therfore the rule of all the rest.</p>
                     <p>2. I answer that all additions whatsoever are not here prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but onely such as are contrary to the word of God; For many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets as the penn men of the holy Ghost did adde diverse yea most part of the holy scriptures. But now it is plaine that the definitions and traditions of the Catholick church, by whose mouth the holy Ghost doth dictat are most consonant to the text of scripture. For the holy Ghost speaketh by them though not <hi>tanquam calamus velociter scribentis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Luke 10. it is sayd he that heareth you heareth me, and he that contemneth you contemneth me: Math. 18. If he doe not hear the church let him be to thee as an Ethnicke and a Publican, and S. Ambrose expounding the last of S. John 18 v. where S. John saith If any man shall adde unto these things, God shall adde vnto him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:603:25"/>
the plagues written in this book. S. Ambrose saith he makes not a protestation against the expositors of his prophesie, but against he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retichs; For the expositor doth adde nor diminish nothing, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly openeth the obscuritie of the place, and sheweth the moral and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall sense.</p>
                     <p>Now to answer your second argument, I wonder how you being a man of vnderstanding should be so much deceived as to think that these places make for you, against vs. For wee holding firm our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion can cite all the self same places Rom. 3. 10. 11 19. that man naturally understands not the things of God; &amp; that mans wisdome is foolishnes. Coloss. 2. 22. For we affirm it the gift of the holy ghost by an infused habit of faith that we beleeve; and that by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ghost promised that the Church cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r; neyther doe we when we allow of tradition make at our pleasure voluntary reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for we acknowledge tradition also to be the word of God, the voice of his spouse that is taught in al truth, guided up the holy ghost vnto the end of the world. Wherfore your argument proves nothing since you presuppose that proved that rests yet to you to prove.</p>
                     <p>The like answer I give vnto your third argument, viz. that men are dead in trespasses Ephe. 2. 5. Math: 15 9. that faith to by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and hearing by the word Rom. 10 17. But I deny that the word is the totall or onely rule of faith, since we finde many thinges to be beleeved that are not expresslie found in the written word, nor thence deduced.</p>
                     <p>And to answer breifly vnto your 4 Argument, I graunt that the Preists and Prophets were bound to heare the word, and that of Ezek. 13. 2, 3. that they should not prophesie according to their own heart, or follow their own spirit, but I deny that they should follow onely the written word or that folowing the voice of the Church, the interpretaton of holy Fathers and Doctors they follow their own harts and their own inventions. So that you see how weake your arguments be, so that they might with more reason bee returned on your self.</p>
                     <p>The second thing which you say I take vpon me to prove: but<note place="margin">II.</note> more rightly to say onely to propound, till the decision of this mayne question be ended; which was whether the definitive sentence of the Church and Pope be an infallible rule and guide of our faith. Thus questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I say, I onely inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded rather to propound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prove, that we have not at one tyme diverse pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For you leave out the force of the argument; as the circumstances of the promise vnto S. Peter by our Saviour, and the prerogatives and priviledge given vnto S. Peter; that he is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med first amongst the Apostles: That he alone walked with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

                        </gap> the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; That the first miracle in confirmation of our faith is made by S. Peter; That he as a supreame judge did condemne the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Ananias and Saphiras, that he first discovered Symon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus and condemned him; All which and other circumstances concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring onely in S. Peter showes manifestly that S. Peter had preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above all the other Apostles; that he is the rock and head of the Church, that Cephas so particularly pointed out by the holy Ghost, calling him first by the name given him at his nativitie <hi>Simon,</hi> by the name of his father <hi>Bar Ionae,</hi> and by his new imposed name Cephas; that no cavil might be took at a legacie so strongly and particularly confirmed unto S. Peter. Now all that you bring or can alleage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this belike is that the name Cephas was interpreted Petros, which in Greek eyther signifies a rock, or a stone. I answer it avay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing, since Petros signifyes, eyther a rock, or a stone; now if you ask, why he is called <hi>Petros</hi> and not <hi>Petra;</hi> I answer, in that the masculine gender best fitted the name of a man: And that S.

                        </gap>. so after a kind of a measured proportion S. Peter by the delegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is his Vicegerent in earth, a visible head of a visible Church.</p>
                     <p>But to that which you object that S.

                     <p>And that this poinet of the Popes supremacie doth not lack force of reason to confirme it, I will onely alleage one generall reason is prove it. The ecclesiasticall Hierarchie is no worse governed, then any temporall regiment and government. And therefore Math. 25. It to compared unto a kingdome that is governed by one King, and Heb. 3. to a familie well governed. Caut. 6. to a Campe well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But in all wel ordered common wealthes there is ever required some visible judge besides the written law; since there must be a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judge to know and take notice of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversies when they arise, and to ponder well and examine the reasons of both: 2. there must be one to erplicate the sense of the law, &amp; to pronounce sentence in the behalf of one partie, when it shalbe necessary: And lastly there must be one to compell those that refuse, to due observation thereof. Now since the church of God is as wel ordered, as any other gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that there ariseth the like difficults in her lawes explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as can happen in any temporall and politicall government; It is against the providence of God and love to his spouse the church, to denie her those helpes, which necessarily must be graunted to all well governed common wealthes. Therefore as the sentence of a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judge in explicating the sence of the low is to be followed; so by a greater reason S. Peters successor guided by the holy Ghost, in all difficults of mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is to be sought vnto for counsel, is to be heard with obedience when he counselleth, is to be obeyed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he proceeds with his powrfull jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>Now when you are come to my supplie of later Doctors, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the most ancient and venerable Fathers of the Church with noveltie; and onely you please your self with this answer that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them all as insufficient: I wonder how any man can say or think this, but I wonder more how you can averr, that you could cite in this point Father for Father, Doctor for Doctor with vs: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you cite S. August. 11. <hi>de verbo Dei sec. 12.</hi> where he sayes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:603:26"/>
that Christ was the roche and not S. Peter. I answer first he doth not manifestly contrary vs. For though <hi>1. lib. retract. c. 23.</hi> he doth approve rather of that opinion, yet doth he not manifestly contrary, that he thinks the other opinion false, or improbable; For he ronfes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that the whole Church, in a hymne of S. Ambrose doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge that S. Peter was head and rocke of the Church; Wherefore after he had proposed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion of the Church, and his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgement: In great humilitie he concludeth all. Let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der chuse whether of these two opinions is the probabler. Hence we may note how ill a friend you are to S. August. thus to put him on the racke: and how you may inforce fathers to seeme to speake for your cause in great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber if you bring those that makes against you: &amp; me thinks you that rely most in expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of scripture, on still of la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, should not onely rely of S. August: words here that in this for lack of skill of languages mistook a litle: But this is certain that S. August: in Psal. 63, <hi>et contra partes Donati</hi> calls S. Peter &amp; his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors the rock, against which hell gates shall not prevaile: So sapes Tertull. <hi>De praescript. Orig. homil. 5. in Exod. S. Cypr.

Cyrill. lib. 2. c. 1, 2. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment, in Ioannem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly you produce that which I bring out of S. John 21. wher it is sayd <hi>Pasce oves meas</hi> seed my flock, in which words I assumed S. Peters priviledge and power to be noted; since here a Pastorall office is graunted unto S. Peter, that is to feed with pasture, to lead, to defend, to governe, chasten, and heale. But you say that all the Apostles were alike charged here to feede. But the contrary is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest out, since he sayd onely to him feed my flocke to whom he sayd before, lovest thou me more then they? In which words he excludeth all the others: Besides Christ speakes to S. Peter that he should feed his generall flock though he may speak unto the other Apostles that they should feed their particular charges. Wherefore S. Leo saith 3. <hi>anniversario assumptionis.</hi> sayth <hi>Petro hoc singulariter creditur, quia cunctis Ecclesiae rectoribus Petri forma praeponitur;</hi> and so we may answer that in this generall charge given to Peter, the particular charge implicitly was commended unto all the other Apostles.</p>
                     <p>And though the other Apostles were sayd to be joinet Preists with S. Peter 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 1. It is spoken in regard that they were joinctly Preists in the exercise of their orders, and not in regard of the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of place, in which respect S. Peter was head of all the rest of the Apostles, though the others did joinctly labour with him in the conversion of nations.</p>
                     <p>Now after you have a litle smoothed up your self that you have done your part in this poinct, then begin you to say that my affertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not sufficiently proved: But as for that, you might better leave it to the iudgment of the indifferent reader, then to take upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you to be

For if the church be a catholicke mother, surely she hath Catholicke children of which you wilbe none. But you belike say with Gaudentius the hereticke that the name Catholike is a humane fiction. <hi>D.

                        </gap>. after he had considered the promises made by our Saviour to his Church that it should be spread over all nations and that hell oates should not prevayl against it, and how invisible their Church had been, how unheard of the essentiall pointes of their doctrine, inforced him to say that eyther these promises are to be fulfilled, or that God els is a lyar: This also made George David to deny the verity of<note place="margin">Historis Georgij Davidis Antverpie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the Bible in that the promised visibilitie of the Church was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Nay then a little to see whither wee or you make the best resolution of our faith, Let vs consider that we Romane Catholicks
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:603:27"/>
use all meanes and apply all helpes and motives to the due eliciting of an act of faith. For first we have all motives <hi>evidentiae credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi> required unto an act of faith: Wee have all antiquitie, vnitie, vniversalitie, visibilitie, confirmed by the consent of Dortors, by the institution of most holy religious orders, we have the conversion of nations, the power of miracles: the infinite number almost of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that have sealed our doctrin through al ages with their bloods: 2. wee have a certaine visible, and infallible way to decide all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies, which is the Catholick Church that propoundeth what is to be beleeved, and what is not: 3. we have Gods divine veracitie spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the mouth of the Church which formally makes vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: 4. wee have a supernaturall judgment to beleeve in common at least in that all people all nations have so beleeved. And lastly through all these we have a pious affection through the working of Gods holy grace to beleeve <hi>hic et nunc, hoc et illud,</hi> and that without any difficult, since we first beleeve there is but one true Church, and that Church cannot err, and so with great facilitie we beleeve ought that the Church shal propound unto vs to be beleeved. But you have none of these, but onely a prejudicated opinion not to beleeve ought wee say, and a presumptuous spiritt to preferr pour interpretations before all the Doctors of the Church: And if you would indeavour to convert any Turke, Jew or Atheist, you could not make him of your opinion, till you had convinced him in each particular and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall poinct. But when we shall come to deale with an Atheist or an infidell; wee can give him such evident motives, such profoundnes of reasons, that even by the light of nature he may think almost that our articles of faith are worthy of beleefe, and after we have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to beleeve that there is but one true church, one meanes of saluation, and that this Church is guided in all truth by the holy Ghost, with great facilitie I can induce him to beleeve any one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our beleef that this onely true, and most firm church teacheth. Let therefore any one judge whose foundation is grounded on sand: who is seated on earth and ashes. And as <hi>for the rellicks of the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned cupp</hi> they are all too blasphemonsly false if you would poure them upon us; and I think they might be applied to your congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if I would descend downe into particulars. Wherefore that pour understanding may be inlightned and judgment corrected <hi>read the Bible</hi> but not onely with the scholiast of your private spirit, but with the holy fathers and learned Doctors expositions. Therefore I will conclude with that short exhortation S. Augustin sent unto his freind Honoratus <hi>lib: De unitate Cred. c. 8.</hi> You see you have bene loue troubled with these broiles of parties in the world, and now if you think your self to have bene tossed and turmoiled enough, and would at length have an end of these verations folow the way of the Catholick discipline; in which the prophesie of Isoia the third is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.

                     <p>Or if you will not cease, the truth it self out of the mouth of God and man shal force yow hereunto. For in my former answer, I set down fowr reasons, fortified with many scriptures, to prove this position: <hi>That<note place="margin">The 1. point of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> God onely is to be umpier and arbyter of all questions and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies about religion:</hi> which was the first point to be accorded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. You (after you had generally censured them to be <hi>nothing but allegations of scripture falsly applied,</hi>) answer to the first, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Deut. 5. 32. &amp; 12. 32. by <hi>denying that hence can be gathered, that the holy scripture should be the onely rule or umpier of faith. For</hi> (say you) <hi>as it dooth not follow, nothing is to be added to the 4. commandement, and the 4. commaund is to be observed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is onely the 4. command. and it is therfore the rule of all the rest.</hi> The reddition of this your similitude, shewes not his face (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps least it should blush:) but lyes hid in silence.</p>
                     <p>First you gather a consequence, which here I strowed not: I spake of <hi>God,</hi> and of his <hi>verdict</hi> and authoritie; not of the scriptures as yet. For whither it be by writing or by speaking, or any other way that God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth his will unto us, it is to me all one, and the authority of the scripture is a second point. Thus your answer is not here to the purpose.</p>
                     <p>Your reason annexed, is a fallacie, concluding from a part against the whole unequally. The scriptures cited speak of Gods commands in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: you take one in particular; and because one is not all, therfore all must not be all, but more then all must be observed; which what they wil be I cannot tel, unlesse <hi>the commandements of men.</hi> Mat. 15. 9.</p>
                     <p>2. You <hi>answer, that all additions whatsoever are not here prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, but onely such as ar contrary to the word of God: for many other prophets, as the penmen of the holy Ghost, did add divers, pea most part of the holy scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In deed this answer is your own, none of Gods: you shew no tittle of his word for that you speak. But I will shew you the contrary. Prov. 30 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:603:29"/>
it is confirmed, no man dooth abrogate it, or addeth therto. If you add<note place="margin">This I.

                     <p>Your reason is direct against yow: for the Prophets being <hi>penmen of the holy ghost,</hi> added nothing of their own: the additions were<note n=":" place="margin">2.

I cannot make proof of that to an other, which can be known but to my self: onely as the tree is known by the fruits, so may my spirit by the <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 23—25.</note> fruits thereof be discerned whither it be of God or no.

Predestination is a hard thing for men to understand, whosoever speak or write of it: but the scripture that treateth hereof is playn in it self, &amp; Paul is not so obscure as your Pope. Secondly the Apostle saith that the <hi>unlearned &amp; unstable doo pervert</hi> (or <hi>wrest</hi>) these things as the other scriptures also: but what is this against those that be taught of God, and stablished in the truth by his spirit.

For touching these points you speak of, if a man read the late Fathers, Augustine, Ambrose &amp; the rest: he shall find them often dark, difficult, intricate, contradicting themselves sometimes, and one another. And if he compare your Popes determinations with the holy scriptures, he shall find as good agreement as between harp and harrow.

                     <p>To return therfore to the scripture which you deney to be an indefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rule of our faith: you objected that it had <hi>many senses,</hi> and stil you stand to it, as <hi>proved:</hi> well, I am content to leave it unto judgement. But though it were so, yet this is not proved, that therfore it is no sure rule of our faith: save by your churches exposition. For why might not the church in Corinth, which were made rich by Christ <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 5.</note> in all kind of speech and in all knowledge, so that <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 7.</note> they were not destitute of any gift: why might not that church (I say) declare the many senses of scripture, as well as the church of Rome? Or rather, why may not the holy ghost, shew any church or any member or Christs church, the meanings of the scripture; and so it remayn as a firm rule of faith, and the Spirit of God the sole authentik expositor of the same? But here you urge agayn your bastard phrase, falsly fathered upon S. Peter; <note n="‡" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20.</note> that no prophesie of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is made <hi>by a private spirits interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> though I blamed you before, for speaking in such sort. If you can not perceive heavenly things, consider earthly. Your one body hath but one spirit, which gives life to the vvhole and to every member of the body. The same spirit dooth quicken the hand and foot, that quickneth the head and hart: although a greater measure is in the principal members, then in the inferiour. Even so by the scriptures we learn, that the catholik church is <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 4.</note> one bodie and hath one spirite; and though the many members of this bodie have <note n="”" place="margin">Rom. 12, 4. &amp;c.</note> not one work, but have received diversities of giftes, yet it is <note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 12 4.</note> the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. To <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 8, 9. &amp;c.</note> one by the spirit is given the word of vvisdom; to an other the word of knowledge, by the same spirit, and to an other faith by the same spirit; and so all the gifts to all the members. This is the most pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick spirit that the church hath; and every member of the church hath the same: so there is no privat spirit which Christians have, as you by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it seemes have learned. Now seeing all Christians have the same spirit that the Pope himself (unlesse he have the spirit of Satan:) how is it that he onely must be the publik spirit and interpreter of the word? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (say you) <hi>he is the head of the church, and hath the promise of our Saviour that his faith should not fayl him.</hi> This I deney. Now you beleeve it, because the Pope himself tells it you; for your ovvn pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat spirit may assure you of nothing. I wil disprove it by your next words,

And how then dare you make him your rock, your hope, your confidence; to beleeve all that he sayth; not to beleeve Gods word, unlesse he tell you it is Gods word, not to beleeve any meaning of the scriptures, but as he tell you the meaning is.

                     <p>You say, it <hi>is playn that the Apostle 2.

But remember your ovvn vvords, <hi>God is more ancient then the Divil, truth then falshood.</hi> The Apostle shevved his ovvn meaning, long before Chrysostome had a mouth to speak. But if you can better see by Chrysostoms candle, then by Pauls bright sun: behold vvhat<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Mat. 22. homil 41.</note> the Doctor sayth.

This speech dooth farr better become his golden mouth, then your plea for humane traditions.</p>
                     <p>The 2. thing vvhich you took upon you <hi>to prove.</hi> (or, as novv you<note place="margin">The 2. of your asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> faintly say <hi>intended rather to propound then prove,</hi>) vvas, <hi>That the scripture expounded by the catholik church is a true and indeficient rule of our faith.</hi> I vvil ease you if I may of this labour; if you understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the position vvell, I grant it to be true.

us. For question being whither Gods written word, or the Popes definitive sentence must judge &amp; rule our faith: I cleav to the scriptures, you to the Pope. Now my ground is in part granted by your selves, for the scriptures which I build upon, your council <note n="*" place="margin">Sess. 4.</note> of Trent hath allowed for canonical, and come from God: and whither you granted it or not, I have given you reasons that are unanswered.

You would hav men think, that if you have so many men in a skirmish or <hi>velitation,</hi> you have many moe against a day of battel.

                     <p>You proceed and say, that Peter was <hi>particularly pointed out</hi> by his ovvn name, his fathers name, and his new name <hi>Cephas,</hi> that <hi>no cavil might be took at a legacie so stronglie &amp; particularly firmed unto S. Peter.</hi> His <hi>legacie</hi> is no way by me impugned, I know it is firme, though not so great as you would make it. But you impugne the legacie of the other Apostles, unto whom in Peter vvas promised, and after to them all generally performed, whatsoever power Peter had in the ministerie of the gospel. Mat. 28. Ioh. 20. Act. 2. yea you impugne the dominion of Christ himself; whiles you would make Peter the <hi>Rock</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the catholik church; contrary to the scriptures. 2. Sam. 22, 32. 1 Cor. 10, 4. Ephe. 5, 23. And whither you have answered <hi>all that I brought</hi> to prove Christ onely the <hi>Rock,</hi> let the equall reader of my former writing judge; you make bold and bare affirmations, without proof of holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or humane learning: <hi>Petros</hi> (you say) <hi>signifies eyther a Rock or a stone;</hi> but what learned auctor doo you shew for it? and he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Petros</hi> (you say,) not <hi>Petra, because the masculine gender best fitted the name of a man:</hi> as if Christ were not a man, unto whom the title <hi>Petra, Rock,</hi> is by Peter himself given. 1. Pet. 2, 8. But he is unto you the Rock of scandal, whiles you stumble at his power, and headship, and give it to his enemie the Pope, vnder the pretence of Peter. And that your church hath made shipwrack against this Rock, not onely of faith, but of learning also, appeares in this, that you make <hi>Cephas,</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Optatus</hi> credit,) in Greek to <hi>signifie a head; as Christ</hi> (you say) <hi>is called the head, Isa 8, &amp; 28.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The ecclesiastical hierarchie is no worse governed then any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral regiment. For it is compared to a kingdome governed by one King, Mat 25 to a familie wel governed, Heb. 3. to a camp wel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>But in al wel ordered common weales, there is ever required some visible iudge, besides the written law, since there must be a supreme iudge to take notice of controversies when they arise a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 2. there must be one to explicate the sense of the law, and to pronounce sentence &amp;c. and 3. there must be one to compell those that refuse, to the due obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof. Now in the church there arise like difficulties in her lawes explication &amp;c. Therfore S Peters successor indued by the holy ghost, in all difficulties of moment is to be sought unto for counsell: is to be heard with obedience when he counselleth, is to be obeyed when he proceeds with his powrful jurisdiction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This your reason is faultie from head to foot. The first part faileth in comparing togither a visible humane politie, and a visible hierarchie. Wheras humane polities concerning worldly matters are merely visible, earthly, temporal: but ecclesiastical polities are partly invisible, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eternal. Those, respecting this world and life onely, have worldly dominion and glorie: these, respecting chiefly the next world &amp; life; have no worldly dominion or glorie; but is for the meek, poor, persecuted for righteousnes sake &amp;c. Mat. 5. My kingdome (sayth Christ) is not of this

world, Ioh. 18. 36. Again the rulers of the gentils have domination over them, &amp; they that are great exercise auctoritie over them, but it shal not be so among you &amp;c. Mat. 20, 25, 26. These things being thus minded &amp; distinguished, I grant, that the church is no worse governed, considering the nature thereof, then any temporall regiment, considering the nature of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly you fail in applying to your Pope the scriptures intended of Christ onely. For he (not the Vicar of Rome) is the King of that one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Mat. 25. he is the master of that one familie, Heb. 3, 1, 6. he is the Captayn of that ordered camp, Cant. 6. Apoc. 19. 11. 13, 14, 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. So that he that challengeth these titles and honours besides Christ, is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
                     <p>To the second part of your reason I answer, 1. that in wel ordered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales, the lawes are above the magistrates, according to Tullies say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">De Legib. lib. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>as lawes are above the magistrates, so magistrates are above the people.</hi> What good order may we then think is in the papacie where Popes are above Gods lavv? 2. That for explicating the sense of the law &amp;c. in wel ordered common weales, it is a ruled case, that <note n="†" place="margin">L. Si. Cod. De legib. et constit. princip.</note> he who made the law, should interpret the law. According hereunto, in the church, the lawes given of God in the scriptures are aboue the Pastors <note n="‡" place="margin">Ezek. 44, 24.</note> that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the people by them: yea above <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 18, 10, 20.</note> Kings: &amp; Gods spirit which gave those lawes, is the supreme <note n="”" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 10.</note> interpreter of them. As for outward order, in difficulties, the <note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 2, 7.</note> Preists lips should preserve knowledge, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should seek the law at his mouth. If he <note n="†" place="margin">Zoph. 3, 4</note> wrest the law, and teach false doctrine, men should <note n="‡" place="margin">Mat, 15, 14.</note> let him alone as a blind guide, least they fal with him into the ditch.

The <hi>contrary</hi> (you say) <hi>is manifest,</hi> since he sayd onely <hi>to him feed my flock, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he said before, lovest thou me more then they, in which words he excludeth al the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Think you, in good sooth, that the former charge layd upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, vvas ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them &amp; novv layd vpon Peter onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because upon special oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he vvas spoken to alone? Why then, Peter also vvas himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, vvhen after this, Christ spake to Paul alone, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 26. 17. 18.</note> sending him to the gentils to open their eyes &amp;c. &amp; to <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 17.</note> preach the gospel. But it is a strange collection of you, that vvhen a company of men are sent vvith one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and one of them having fayled in his fidelitie, is in special excited unto duty &amp; diligence; al the other should be excluded. Doe you not see hovv after this, Paul shevveth, (Eph. 4.) not Peter onely, but Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers, to be given of Christ for the building up of his church?</p>
                     <p>Your conclusion to be inferred hereupon, (if you conclude the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) wil be much more unreasonable. The point you undertook to prove, vvas that not Gods vvord in the Bible, but <hi>the catholik churches</hi> (yea the <hi>Popes) definitive sentence as he is head of the church, is an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient rule in matters of faith.</hi> To confirm this haeresie, you produce here Christs charge to Peter, <hi>Freed my sheep.</hi> Behold Novv the strength of your argument; If Peter vvas to feed Christs sheep: then not Gods vvord in the scriptures, but Peters definitive sentence (and consequently the Popes) is an indeficient rule of faith. But Peter vvas to feed Christs sheep: Iohn 21. Frgo &amp;c. The unreasonablenes of vvhich consequence (if the bare rehearsal of it doo not convince,) may be shewed by the like thus. If the Bishops of Ephesus vvere to feed the church of God: then not Gods vvord in the scripture, but their definitive sentences vvere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deficient rules in matters of faith. But the Bishops of Ephesus vvere to feed the church of God, Act. 20. 28. Ergo.</p>
                     <p>If the Elders of the churches of Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:603:41"/>
were to feed the flocks of God: then not Gods word in the Bible, but their definitive sentences were indeficient rules in matters of faith. But the Elders of those churches were to feed the flock of God, 1 Pet. 5, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> 2. Ergo.</p>
                     <p>Behold what deep waters you have digged out from the Rock of Rome: their spring, I trow, comes from the bottomlesse pitt. If you say, those Elders were under Peter as a head, therfore they were to feed with his definitive sentence, not their own. First I deny that so they were under him; and you shal never prove it whiles Rome gates doo stand though I grant their office was inferiour to the Apostles. Secondly, if you could prove it, yet would it make against you: for if because Peter was their head, therfore they must feed with his doctrine onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then because Christ was Peters head, Peter was to feed with Christs doctrine onely. But Christ was Peters head, acknowledged by Peter himself to be <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4.</note> Arch pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; so taught by Christ himself Iohn. 10. Therfore Christ definitive sentence onely, not Peters, (much lesse the Popes) is the indeficient rule of our faith. And thus my cause is confirmed, and yours overturned by your own weapon.</p>
                     <p>Yet you procede and say; <hi>besides Christ speaks to S. Peter that he should feed his general flock, though he may speak unto the other Apostles, that they should feed their particular charges.</hi> I would we might once have an end of words of wind. You say al things, but prove nothing; unlesse your definitive sentence also must be taken for a law. But then I am sure it is against Christs law: for, as he neyther used the word <hi>general</hi> to Peter, nor the word <hi>particular</hi> to the other Apostles: so whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sent them with their charge al indifferently, it was unto <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note>

                     <p>MR. H Aynsworth. That you were so kindly gladde for my releasement out of prison, I am to thank you; but wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say you ery<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As for the latter replie, I can not tel where it is now; though I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you I had half answered it, and had fully satisfied you therein, if my papers and I had not suddainly bene severed. Although I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr there is no special poinct therein conteyned that I take I have not abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly satisfied in my former. That you seeme to say I gave the onset, it much imports not whether I did or no; I seeking to draw you from the AEgyptian darkness, that is so palpable.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:603:48"/>
answer any thing that urgeth you therin, &amp;c. I have out of my love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and in compassion of your estate, sent you a copie of my last writing, not urging you to answer, unless you think the goodness of your cause will bear you out, but desiring you to yeild unto the truth there shewed you. You brought for your defense C. Bellarmines reasons: I have manifested the weaknes of them. If you can fortifie them, or your cause by any other, I am willing (as I have begunn) to take notice thereof, &amp; eyther to refute them, or yeeld you the Victory. If you leave off, I also will rest, and let the prudent judge what we both have sayd.</p>
                     <p>2. You (as if you would beginn a new combate) propound 12. questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for me to answer: I told you before, I would not digresse to by matters, for so we might run into confusion fruitlesse and endless. Also your questions (most of them) are of Fathers Doctors &amp;c. since th'Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times, by whom I shewed you that I neyther might nor would trye any religion, til the Divine scriptures be proved insufficient, which will never be.</p>
                     <p>3. You then propound the controversie a new, as if we were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to beginn, when we are almost at an yssue: so might both of us wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our selves in vayn. Your first long writing to me, hath made my answers the longer, for I desired (and stil doo) brevity with perspicuitie. Least through want of your papers, you should swarve from the questions in hand, I wil set them down, in the words that they have passed.</p>
                     <p>My assertions were question weise, when I should enter into dispute vvith you, to see if you vvould grant;</p>
                     <p>1. That our differences in religion should be tryed and composed by the verdict or vvord of God: not of men.</p>
                     <p>2. That Gods vvord is to be found in the scriptures of the Prophets &amp; Apostles, vvho vvrote originally in Hebrevv and Greek. By these I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred my faith to be tryed, and to make trial of other faith proposed.</p>
                     <p>Yours were, vvhich you sayd you vvould prove; and so indevoured;</p>
                     <p>1. That onely the bare text of the scripture, is not a sufficient rule of our faith.</p>
                     <p>2. That the scriptures expounded by the catholik church, is a true and indeficient rule of our faith: or (as you set it dovvn vvhen you come to make proofe,) That the Popes definitive sentence as he is head of the church, is an indeficient rule in matters of faith.</p>
                     <p>3. That this rule is onely found in the Romane Catholik church sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and not in private mens illuminations and motions of a private &amp; unseen spirit. Or (as after you expresse it, vvhen you labour to prove it,) That your Romane Church is the true &amp; onely catholik church of God.</p>
                     <p>Your arguments for these vvere long discourses, I could not therfore ansvver, but by refelling your treatises. In these I folovv your footing still in my last vvriting, novv againe sent unto you. Hold I pray you to the points in hand, and be as breif as you can, I vvil labour to satisfy you in fevv vvords. But if you make outrodes to long narrations; blame not the length of my ansvvers, vvhich are but according to your ovvn size; &amp;

eeke your arguments no more with humane testimonies, til you have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the certainty and sufficiencie of the Divine oracles: which if it were possible for you to doo, you might colourably perswade fools unto Atheisme, but no wife man would ever suffer affliction for your traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and humane religion. Be you warned, yea intreated, to save your sowl from eternal flames; God hath offred more meanes of mercy unto yow then to many others; if yow shut your eyes against the light, (which shineth in darknes though the darknes comprehends it not,) yow wil but heap up unto your self wrath against the day wrath; but my prayer unto God is for your salvation in Christ, to whose grace I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend yow.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>SOme week agoe (Mr Henry Aynsworth) I received your letter and your last reply coppied out againe (as you say) to give me satisfaction. An answer whereof some three yeres agoe I had returned, if the papers then, and I had not been severed; And long ere this since the intended deliverie therof I had fully satisfied each point thereof, if some three weekes after the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied aryvall thereof, the deliverie had not been delayed.</p>
                     <p>For your paynes and good will I thank you. But I wonder that through private affectation, so much payns, and good wil should be so far from being <hi>secundam scientiam,</hi> that a man might doubt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whether you writ not <hi>contra conscientiam,</hi> since to any indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t judgement the motives for our catholik religion, and for her doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal assertions are so cleare, and therfore doubt not but that I shall answer you; although her well grounded truth would defend it selfe though I were silent.</p>
                     <p>But God willing I wil shortly send you the answer to your large biscourse, and to give you ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t of that which I wil prove in fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering your replication (though to write so large a coppie forth is more tedious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> difficult) I wil prove these seven points at least. First I will show the weaknes of your reasons; 2. I will prove that not onely the written word of God, but the unwritten word of God tradition, and the authoritie of the Church is the rule of our faith. 3. I wil show how my five Arguments for all your pretended an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers remaine in ful force. 4. I will prove how you walk in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, proving the word of God by your private spirit, and your privat
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:603:49"/>
spirit by the word of Gods 5. I wil defend our catholick opinion to be free from any circular or ridiculous proofe. 6. I wil show the Popes definitive Sentence, togither with a generall Councell at least to be an assured groundwork of faith: 7. I will show to you or any indifferent judgment that your building is on sand, and the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your faith at the last day of judgement groundless and full of feare.</p>
                     <p>But now to show that you have in nothing answered my last let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I propounded certaine necessary questions breifly for the more clearing of this or any other disputation to be had between us: of which though there were twelve in number, yet you have not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered one word to any, which eyther showes you glosed before whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you sayd you writ all before for my good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else rather that you could not answer one, which you might have doone in foure or 5. lines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying or granting. So that I must needes inferr that you cannot show which of the Apostles did teach your doctrine that you now hold: 2. that you can not show which are the essentiall poincts of your religion: 3. that no ancient Doctor did maintayn the doctrine you now held: 4. that you can not show who, in what tyme, and on what occasion did suppress that doctrine: 5. that you can not show your church to have begun to be invisible in the time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or in the time of peace: 6 that S. Laurence nor any of the primitive martyrs were of your religion: 7. that you approve of no ancient historie, and that you must graunt Constantine our first Christian Emperour not to be of your religion: 8 that no one of the 3. conversions of England was to your religion: 9. that you must graunt the church of Christ to be more subject to invisibilitie, ruin, &amp; subversion then the synagogue of the Jewes: 10. that you have no Bible or writen word of God that you allow of in all, and so that you have no rule of faith for all. To all these you answer with silence in your hart calling them carnall motives no doubt.</p>
                     <p>3. I answer you that in putting downe breifly my 5. argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in forme, I show you have not answered: But you in your silence to them showes that your answers consists onely in multiplicity of words that admitts no abbreviation.</p>

Wher first you show your wilful fraude, in that you would have me gather his superioritie by his bare rising up. Where I gathered rather by the due circumstances that passed there in that place. For the text sayes, <hi>when there was made a great disputation Peter rising up sayd to them, you know that of old dayes God amongst us chose that the Gentils by my mouth should heare the word of the Gospel and beleeve.</hi> In which chapter first we may note by the way verse 6. that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <hi>and auncients assembled to consider of this word,</hi> which place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>73. 2. I note the 7. verse that when there was made a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation<note place="margin">Note.</note> ech partie producing his reasons, and arguments for their assertion. S. Peter rising up and speaking by his authoritie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>that great disputation,</hi> that is settled the height of their differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which argues superioritie. For what decorum or manners were it, if two Doctors of like authoritie disputing, the third of the same or of lesse authoritie as Calvin would have, should stop the current of their disputation, when it touched the point of the difficultie, when there was a great disputation, when their reasons as the text both not obscurely note were in <hi>aequi librio</hi> unsettled, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was made a <hi>great disputation.</hi> So that we see it is a signe of great authority to speak so first as to interrupt the great disputation to prefixe an end, to firme a definition to the proposed question.</p>

                     <p>75. That which S. James speakes verse 15. and 16. is nothing else but a confirmation or an explication of S. Peters sentence. First<note place="margin">Also v. 15. 16. Act. 15.</note> he approves S. Peters vocation mentioned by S. Peter, by the tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of the Prophets, and nextly he doth as to win the goodwil of the Judaizing Christians moderate that sence of S. Peter, that would have all legal ceremonies removed; that so they might take that speech better at his hands then at S. Peters, S. James being their Bishop of Hierusalem he expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds that which he thought most conventent to be done: And the whole Councel and not onely Sainct James promulgates &amp; determines that decree. So that we see the<note place="margin">The reason why S. Iames did speak.</note> definition of the principal question is onely S. Peters and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Councel to the setling of the busynes to each parties liking is onely S. James.</p>
                     <p>76. But presently after to signifie his willingnes to say something, he objects that Peters sitting still would rather argue authority the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his rising up: To which I answer that admitting most true it were his sitting doth argue his authoritie as well as his rising up: and S. Peters judiciall and attentive hearing the debating of the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till <hi>there was a great disputation,</hi> and then being noted to begin to rise that to rising the heat of disputation comming to head, and the disputers vehemencie requiring a period, that he beganne then to<note place="margin">

                     <p>77. But on goes our subtil disputer to prosecute his great doubt, and argues out of the 5. of the Acts 34. where Gamaliel is sayd to rise up in the councel of the Jewes v. 34. But here he conceals what the Church distinguisheth calling him a Doctor of the Lawe and so signifying that it was his office as Doctors that be Cardinals doe<note place="margin">Why Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel rose up.</note> in the Popes conclavi to cramine matters by way of argument, and not to determine and define; then he conceals the immediate cause of his rising up including a farr inferior office then that of the head, v. 35. to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund the men to be put forth &amp; onely a while to signifie that he spake rather like a freind then like a judge.

                     <p>78. And that Gamaliels sentence was rather a favorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion then a chief Judges resolution appeares that howsoever he<note place="margin">Gamaliel did use ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable perswasion then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</note> was a pollitike statesman, yet he was a secret favourer of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and their preaching. For he did procure S. Stephens burial 20 myles from Jerusalem as B: Lucianus Martyr notes in the invention of the bodie of S. Stephen. Also he receives and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Nicodemus when he was spoiled and expelled by the Jewes, &amp; buried him there by S. Stephen as B: Lucianus testifieth.</p>
                     <p>79. And that which you bring out of the 17. of the Acts 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinders then furthers your purpose, since we may gather that as S. Paul being intreated by the princes of the synagogue verse 15 to preach, took upon himself without any more to doe, rising up and<note place="margin">Act. 17, 16. makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> with his hand beckening for silence, showes there that he was the cheife preacher, so <hi>S.</hi> Peter rising and composing their controversie shewes that in that kind he was the cheefe. So that we see we have woven the webbe to intangle flies of your own kind.</p>
                     <p>80. That which you bring before out of the 2. of Peter v. 20 ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me thus, No prophecie is made <hi>by privat interpretation,</hi> you call but doe not prove it a bastard phrase, showing that such ill befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting termes proceedes from a bad conscience.

For though there is the very self same soule in the head and foot, and in each part, yet it worketh otherwise in the head then in the foot; as the spirit in the cheese of his Church, then his members; so as it is the office of the head to decyde busyness, and not of the foot, so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto the head of the church and not to every particular crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to interpret scriptures; and verse 21 the self same doctrine is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in that it is sayd, <hi>For not by mans will was prophecie brought at any tyme, but the holy men of God spake inspired by the Holy Ghost,</hi> showing that the self same spirit whrewith they were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in the church must interpret scripture.

                     <p>81. And that which I bring for congruencie for the primarie of S. Peter Act 15, ver: 7. where he would gather that if the Gentiles were chosen by his mouth to heare the gospel that he was chosen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to preach unto them: his inference is nothing to the purpose since we graunt the Popes primacie is from God and not of the election of men.<note place="margin">The First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Pope Stephen examined.</note>

                     <p>82. I graunt that Pope Stephen the 7. called Stephen 6 did revoke many decrees (which yet are not definitions of Pope For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosus in the yeare 89. But this argues onely a violence in fact, and

Stephen did this as the head of the church, but out of the violence of his private spirit, which appears in that Sigebertus notes that all that were with him reclaimed from that violent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. And in the Councel he did approve onely of his fact, being flattered by factious Cardinals Sergius Benedictus &amp; Martinus.</p>
                     <p>83 Note also that at this unaccustomed course of the Pope the corporal church of Lateran fel down, and the Images of the church where Pope Formosus body was intombed did salute Formosus as Luitiprandus lib. 1. c. 8. witnesseth. And though I graunt that<note place="margin">Pope For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosus wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed for a holy man</note> Pope Stephen was a wicked man in the course of his privat spirit, yet we may see the great respect that Fulco the Arch B: of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>94. You proceed and would have me to mainteyne Tradition to be the totall and not the partial rule of faith togither with the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God. Hence you inferr that I graunt some word of<note place="margin">Intri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I answer the word of God as it is extrinsecall the word of God and to be knowen of vs depends of tradition, and the authoritie of the church. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecallie and in it self it is the word of God though it be knowen to none; so that you may see in what sense I make tradition to be the rule of faith, and apostolicall tradition also I affirme to be also the word of God though unwritten.</p>
                     <p>95. Here make you a long digression, and you show what acts kept by tradition are to be kept, and to be remembred to children, &amp; after ages; as you say to see the destruction of Rome, but we knowe certainly the opposers by their oppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will work themselves their destruction, and confusion of their Babylon. And we know that Balaam in stedd of cursing Gods people did blesse them. John Fox was your Nabucodonosor turned so out to grasse that he durst not come neare the wall (by reason of a deep mellancholie apprehension for feare of being crased like an vrinall.) As for the spanish Armadoe whatsoever the Spaniards intended to doe here in England, our Countrymen did performe much at Cales, howsoever they ded speed at Lisborne before. I answer onely this, God and St. George for my religion, King, and Countreymen. I would doe that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted a good subject, but these your instances are malitious and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                     <p>96. To that plaine place 2. Thes 2. v. 15. <hi>Therefore brethren stand and hold the traditions which you have learned whether it be by word of mouth or by epistle.</hi> This place is so playne that S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost: affirms S. Paul herein to have meant of unwritten traditions, that Doct. Whitaker sayes his speech is herein very unworthy so holy a father. And that which you bring out of S Chrysostom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, showes that all sufficient precepts of manners and good life are set down in scripture. That which you bring out of the 26. of the Acts 22, we say that in tradition nothing is spoken besides that is contrarie to the Apostles speeches. As for that which you bring the 1. of the Cor. 14, 37. is nothing to the purpose. For we doe not deny but those things that are written are true. But if you would have more plain places of scripture in defense of tradition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s the 15. of the Acts 41. Where he in <hi>confirming of the church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to keep the precepts of the Apostles,</hi> and what precepts S Paul meanes he explaines himself chap. 16. v. 4. <hi>He delivered unto them to keep the decrees that were decreed of the Apostles, and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents that were at Hierusalem,</hi> which deliverie without question were by word of mouth, what these decrees were it is uncertain by scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:603:62"/>
though they may be kept by the help of tradition.</p>
                     <p>98. The fourth thing that I am to show is to prove how you walk<note place="margin">THE FOVRTH PART.</note> in a vitious circle, proving the selfe same by the selfe same, as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the scripture by your private spirit, and your privat spirit by the authority of the scripture, by which manner of proof you may prove any thing.</p>
                     <p>99<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For first and formost you doe not distinguish what are scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and what are not, by the authoritie of the church. For so you should admit of all that she dooth receive, and if ye reject any thing that she hath doubted of you should as well as yow refuse those bookes called Deutrocanonici of the old Testament, you should as well reject those Deutrocanonici of the new testament as the epistle to the Hebrewes, Judas epistle and the Apocalyps, but the touch of your triall is the private spirit, and the unction not of the holy Ghost, but of an addle head, and a self conceipted phancie.</p>
                     <p>100. And that you like a blind baiard walk in this round though you may apprehend you have gone many a mile; and to show that<note place="margin">Mr. M. A. walkes in a circle.</note> you have confined your selfe in the selfe same circle I prove.</p>
                     <p>101. For first I aske how you know the scripture of the Prophets and Apostles is Gods word; you answer the spirit of God, the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and witness of the spirit, the annointing of the spirit doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie<note place="margin">Ioh. 15, 16. Ioh. 16. 14. Ioh. 3. 9. 11</note> to you that they are written by God. But then againe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund how you prove that you have that spirit of God this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall annointing.</p>
                     <p>You answ. what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth what is in him but the spirit of God that is in him 1. Cor. 2. He answers again that he can make no proof<note place="margin">Here it is proved that he doth pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re principi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>um.</note> of that to another that is onely knowen to himself; &amp; againe no man knoweth how the wind bloweth, or knowes how the bones do grow in the wombe of a woman, Eccles. 11, 5. it is the spirit that testifies 1. Joh. 5, 6. So that we see you prove the scripture by your private spirit, and your spirituall annointing, and you prove you have this spirit by the scripture. As if a child should prove he were no bastard, in that his mother sayes so, and she likewise prove that she her selfe were honest in that he saies so: Or prove the Church of Amsterdam to be a true church, in that the Amsterdamian spirit interpreting the scripture saies so. And that the Amsterdamian spirit is a true spirit, in that the Amsterdamia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spirit sayes so. So I demand of you how you doe know the scripture to be Gods word, you answer out of the<note place="margin">Mr H. A. walkes in a circle.</note> testificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy ghost; And how you know the internal testifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, you answer likewise out of the scripture interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Spirit. My sheep heares my voice, and how doe you know how it is the scripture? You answer by the testification of the<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 27.</note> inward spirit, so that we see your discourses like puppets have their motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one string, &amp; speak by the mouth of the same interpreter.<note place="margin">His dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>102. But now to show the falshood and unprofitablenes of your circular discourse, I demand what you hold the testification of the inward spirit to be. For you must hold that it proceeds from God,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:603:62"/>
as wel as your inward habit or act of faith: and then againe I aske<note place="margin">Mr H. A. to solution circular, fruitless &amp; endlesse.</note> whether you be certaine by the certaintie of faith that you have this inward act of faith that you have the testification of the spirit. Then I argue this certitude must proceed from an other testification, and that from another, and the other from another, so wee shall runne headless in infinitum.</p>
                     <p>103. Besides I ask whether that testification of the spirit, since it can not have his residence in the will, being a certaine perswasion<note place="margin">He cannot tell what this inward testificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is.</note> or speech of God belonging to the understanding; and so it must be a certain notice or cognitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If it be obscure I aske how it is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith: if it be clear &amp; evident how is it to be distinguished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowledg or vision of a thing; so that wee see you affirme a thing that indeed you doe not understand what it is.</p>
                     <p>104. But before I gathered your mind when you said the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of themselves are so cleare that by themselves they appeare for scriptures, so that you seeme to resolve that which you beleeve in<note place="margin">Mr H. A. resolution uncertain.</note> to the holie scriptures and the formal reason why you beleeve it into the testification or perswasion of the spirit, yet this also you doe not hold to alwayes. For other times you resolve both the one and the other into the testification of the inward spirit with you most often, which showes your great inconstancie grounded on seare.</p>
                     <p>105. But admitting that you had onely sayd the things to bee beleeved, or <hi>fides externa</hi> were to be resolved into the holy scripture onely. Yet so you should admit of as great an absurditie. For so you should say the gospel of S. Mathew, or the whole scripture ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken totally togither are not canonical and authentick, nor that Mr. H. Aynsw: is predestinated or that his sinns are remitted. All which<note place="margin">Many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities sequeles of his doctrin</note> Aprove. For nothing he is to beleeve, for which he hath not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of God. But none of these are expressed in the word of God. If he will say he will gather these by necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie consequence; his adversaries may oppose him, and he can show no certaintie; If he flie unto the inward testification of the spirit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I inferr that the things to be beleeved ar not to be resolved into the scriptures alone. So Mr H. A. eates his own word though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one graine of salt or pretence of reason. Yet to show this a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more plaine I reason thus. Is the scripture the word of God? you answer it is, and that without all question; But I demaund how you know it is the word of God; if you answer by the testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your inward spirit, you ride your first circuit; If you say it<note place="margin">No parcel of scripture affirms the whole scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> appeares by it self, this is not so plaine since most parts and parcels of scripture have bene doubted of and that by schollers. Yet admit scripture were so cleare a light by it self, yet you cannot avoid as great a difficultie. For I aske whether you will prove the whole scripture by the whole, and then every one will see you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ie for refuge thether which you ought to defend. If you say that the whole scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is proved by some particular parcell of scripture, you are bound to show me that which you can never performe, viz. that any part
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:603:63"/>
of scripture dooth affirme the whole scripture and every part and parcel thereof to be scripture.</p>
                     <p>106. And if I should graunt you this, yet another absurditie at the suit of reason hath arrested you. For by what will you trie that<note place="margin">What should au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise that scripture that should give authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickness to all the rest.</note> particular parcel of scripture that so authoriseth al the rest to be scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? Thus you see in defending your private spirit you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone the labours of Hercules, the difficulties arising as Hydraes heades two for one as one is dissolved.</p>
                     <p>107. Besides this opinion of theirs doth not onely lead a man into these endlesse windings, but it makes against co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sense, that God should leave his holte scriptures so carelesse, at six and sevens unsettled that every hereticli might challenge to himself to be taught from God, so that he might reject the authoritie of all the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <note place="margin">By his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Gods provid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>108. Against which men I reason thus, Eyther the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had this spirit of God or else they had not. If they had (as surely they should have if Mr H. A. did not feynedly preferr them before him) then they infalliblie were instructed by his spirit in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">Whether the holie fathers had this spirit or not, makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> of faith, why are their authorities rejected by Mr Henry Ayns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth as earth and ashes? If they had not, then this spirit is a new and so not a true spiritt, since it differrs from that spirit that ruled the auncient fathers many whereof were the Apostles schollers.</p>
                     <p>109. But that the holy Fathers had this spirit I prove, since you cannot deny, but that they were of the elect &amp; the sonnes of God, but they can not be of the elect and of the sonns of God without his spirit John 10, 27.

                        </gap>l to be held at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, since every one could sufficiently distinguish of this truth.</p>
                     <p>110. And to show further how your spirit is incompassed with difficults I argue thus: This spirits testification is ever infallible or not. If it doe deceive them it is not of God; If it be still infallible how can ther come such various co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troversies in the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>111. If you answer this is ever infallible when it agrees with
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:603:63"/>
the word of God to which it is to be compared. But then I argue if this spirit doth never testifie but when it is read, what will they doe then if they were to dispute with a Turke, if he should deny the<note place="margin">His answ. pretended</note> whole Bible, or about a controversie of the whole Bible whether it be Canonical or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </p>
                     <p>But admit that the testification of the spirit were onely to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the written word of God, How comes it then that the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans and Calvinists are at such an unreconcïlable diffentien in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the scriptures, This is my body, and this is my blood, by their private spirits interpretation; every one contends to have this spirit, to have the true sense of the word. How will you then be able to settle these variances by the bare word to the liking of both.</p>
                     <p>112. And to answer the placrs that you doe or may be produced for the mainteyning of the privat spirit, I wil give generall grounds<note place="margin">General groundes reselling the privat spirits proofe</note> to answer all, answering some in particular. First then to that of John 10, 27. My sheep heare my voice. you must mark what sheep he meanes, viz. the sheep that he committed to S. Peter as Pastor, John 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, 17. feed mysheep. And not content with this he showes how these sheep should hear his voice Luc. 10. 6. He that heares you hears me, and he that contemns you contemns me. The other place is of Esaie the Prophet 54. 13. I will give all my sonns learned &amp;c. Jer. 31. 34. Herafter the man shall not teach his neighbour all shall know me from the least to the greatest Joh. 6. 45. out of which and such like places they falsly gather they have testificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the spirit.</p>
                     <p>113. But these men abuse scripture drawing it to their own sence; For these places and the like doth not prove that which they seeke, but onely show a threefold difference between the old testament and<note place="margin">A threefold difference between the old and new testament</note> the new. First in that the Prophets did teach in the old testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but Christ Jesus himselfe did teach in the new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Moses and the Prophets did propound to the people what they were to beleeve, but Christ Jesus vy his inward prace given them did help them to beleeve, he not only teaching them by his voice, but also helping them by his grace. 3. that Moyses and the Prophets did preach Christ onely to the Jewes, but Christ, and his Apostles to all nations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE 5. PART</p>
                     <p>114. That I am to prove is to defend our Catholiche opinion from such an idle proofe or circular resolution of our faith. The which that I may better performe, some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon grounds are to be handled before that being presupposed the difficults that oppose our opinion may be the better cleared.</p>
                     <p>115. First then we must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> suppose that since every Heathen or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:603:64"/>
Jew doth know by the light of nature that their is one God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all things, and that wee are created to serve and honor him, and that God is the rewarder of vertue and punisher of vice. And<note place="margin">A general doctrine first to be presuppo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed.</note> since by discourse he may naturally reach vnto this, that although it was most free for God to create any thing or to will any thing ad extra, yet supposing that he hath created and so if not necessarily yet infaliblie by the excessive propension of his goodnesse, he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to men the best and fittest meanes for his honor and divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And since the Monarchical government is best as appeareth by necessary subordination of creatures, elements, nations, causes, beasts vnto one supreme Mr. spring of all: So since God having cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated man would be worshipped of him, It is most readie to any mans discourse that he hath ordained one vniform kind of church or service to al people. The which as it cannot chuse but seem most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to a man through the great conveniencie and congruitie. Yet if we shall suppose that the multiplicitie of religious and ceremonious services should as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictories or contraries thwart one another, &amp; so their supreme end. It would necessarily be gathered out of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of any reasonable reaching brain, that al these religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were not instituted of God and that everie man was bound to weigh &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the motives, and to see which religion had greater credibilitie.</p>
                     <p>116. 2. This being presupposed I will prove that our Romaine Catholicke church compared with what religions soever of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, ceremontal of the Jewes, heresies, and sects of Christians, is to be preferred in any reasonable mans judgment before any of them. Since I will prove that the motives of our religion are of evident credibilitie:</p>
                     <p>117. 3. I am to prove that the motives of our Catholick religion are to be and are of most evident credibilitie, whether they be taken<note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of evident credibility.</note> by themselves, or whether they be parralleld with the doctrine of the Gentile, Jewe, or heretick, and the motives of our religion must be of evident credibilitie, appeareth out of the Psal. <hi>9 2. Testimonia tua credibilia facta sunt nimis. Heb. 2.</hi> the preaching of the Apostles is said to be confirmed by signes, and myracles; 2. if there were not motives of evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t credibility, no man prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly should be thought to assent vnto faith.</p>
                     <p>118. And that the motives of our religion are of evident credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie<note place="margin">The author of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> appeareth in the particular relation of them.</p>
                     <p>119. The first motive of our religion is from the author of our religion who to have been is as certaine as that Alexander or Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle was. And that our Savieur did not teach false things of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or mallice appeareth by his doctrine preaching and his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and power prophecied by the Prophets, and by the Syb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

those things they sawe; nor of mallice, or gaine, since they preached without any hope of temporal commoditie, or preferment, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned and despised of all.

                     <p>121. Hetherto all Christians may vsurpe these motives as then own: But when those that they shall seek to perswade shall aske of them what the essentiall pointes of their religion are without which it cannot stand: If they be demaunded which of the Apostles schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars did teach these points of doctrine that they boast they teach, and say they have received different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Romane Catholiks grounds.

wisdome, sanctity integritie and efficacie, which by the infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation thereof, &amp; by many myracles hath been divinely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, which hath remained firme and stable against all persecutions of Gentiles Jewes and Heriticks; For the profession and defence of which doctrine, infinite men of all sects, ages &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, have most willingly suffred exquisit torments; Whose professors have been most holy illuminated men: But our Remane religion is this, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by a perticular induction, <hi>go.</hi> our religso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is most evident credible.</p>
                     <p>134 The second Demonstration that I make for the confirming<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Demostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> of this former is thus taken out of Gods divine providence he hath of al our humane actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s especiallie touching those actions as touch the eternal felicitie or honestie of manners, and about the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of himselfe: <hi>go</hi> it is against his providence that a man directed by so many prudentiall motives, especially since his faith is suffici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>135. These being presupposed it is the part of a prudent man to assent vnto many motives of credibilitie, especially having received a precept of faith and in generall having well pondered them, he is bound to dispose himself vnto a pious affection that he may give a firme consent by the working of the Holy Ghost in particular to that doctrine and faith warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by so many evident motives of credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
                     <p>136. These motives of evident credibilitie being <hi>hic et nunc</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto, here wee come to resolve our principal intended doubt of the resolution of our faith; presupposing still that the formall motive of our faith is the first veritie, or authoritie of God obscurely revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.<note place="margin">To faith two judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Into what one evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of credibilitie is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>137. Now since to faith there concur two judgments, the one evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the credibility of the thing to be beleeved, the other an obscure but a certaine beleefe of the veritie of the thing to be beleeved, so we see there is a twofold resolution. viz. of the resolution of the evident, and certaine judgment of credibilitie; and of the second of our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ceretaine but obscure.</p>
                     <p>138. First then I saie our evident judgment of the credibilitie of the thing being rather presupposed, then presupposing an act of faith is resolved onely into these related motives of credibilitie, &amp; into the foresaid humaine inducements as into the formal reason of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.<note place="margin">That this evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment is to be had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an act of faith.</note>

                     <p>139. Secondly I saie that everie one according to his capacitie is to have the for said certaine, and evident judgment of credibilitie before he elicit an act of faith, that prudently he maie be judged to give his asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

                     <p>140 Thirdly I affirme our certaine yet inevident judgment of the truth of the points of our faith to be beleeved, &amp; so the assent of our faith if it be as it ought; that is if it be accomodated &amp; proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned vnto the object, &amp; end of our faith as it is necessary vnto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deth eyther require a particular motion of the Holy Ghost, or an infused habit of faith, as it appeareth out of the 7. chapter of the Aransicanum Conc. and out of the <hi>Trident Sess 6. c. 5. et canone</hi> &amp;. Where it is affirmed, that without Gods preventing grace, and the illuminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Ghost, no man can beleeve things reveled as he ought, that is that Gods justifying grace be given him.</p>
                     <p>141. Fourthly I affirme that this certaine and inevident iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">In to what our cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident judgment is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into</note> of the truth of our faith into these humain reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and motives as into the moving, applying, and impulsive cause, but not as into the formal motive of beleeving.

                     <p>143. But if I be further questioned, since the revelation of God, and the proposing are both obscure and inevident, how cames it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I certainly and evidently doe beleeve.</p>
                     <p>144. I answer then I returne vnto the motives of evident cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilitie that maie induce any prudent man to beleeve that saith, and that church warranted by so many motives.</p>
                     <p>145. Neither is here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted any vitious circle between the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of God &amp; the church; as I have before convinced you in your grounds to commit. For first the authoritie of God revealing in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which the infailibilitie of the proposition is beleeved, and the selfe same infallible proposition in vertue of which we beleeve that God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ies and reveales, hath two diverse objects. For the object of the infailible proposition is that God reveales; And the object that

God reveales, or of the revelation of God is the veritie beleeves.</p>
                     <p>146. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

But when out of the infallible proposing of the church, a reason to given whie we beleeve the divine revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If it be vnderstood aright it is not to be given by a formal cause or motive; but by an intrinsecall and requisite application of the motives whie we beleeve, which is doone by the proposing of it by the church, so that ther is no circle <hi>ab eodem in idem, secundum idem,</hi> which Aristotle only <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demns 1. Post. text. 5.</hi> as I have shewed before.</p>
                     <p>147. Yet to goe one degree further in shewing how we are free<note place="margin">Wee are free from a circle.</note> in another regard from this mere circular, and fruictless resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs, I presuppose that then is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a circle when the selfe same is proved by the selfe same to him that graunteth neither or doth <hi>aequallie</hi> deny both, or doubteth of both. For proofe of which we learne out of Aristotle that we ought to proceed from that which to knowen to that which is not knowen: or at least from that which is graunted to that which is not graunted, for so we shall proceed from that which is knowen after a manner, to that which is not knowen.</p>
                     <p>148. Whence I inferr that he should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit this circuler discourse that to an Ethnick that equally should denie both scripture and the infallibilitie of the church, should prove that the scripture were of divine authoritie in that the church teacheth vs it; and the church of infallible authoritie in that the scripture teacheth vs it. But to a protestant that admits of most of the scripture, it is no circle to prove the infallibilitie of the church which he denies from the scripture which he admits of: but first you do not give a resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your faith (as I doe) that is powerful against Ethnick or heretick: 2. though wee admit of scripture yet wee cannot be vrged therevnto by you; that receiving from the church the scripture, will not beleeve all<note place="margin">See 1 <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>149. The foresaid manner of proof is vsuall both in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and in ancient Fathers. The Pharisees did admit of Moses, and denie Christ. Therfore our Saviour convinced them with these words Joh. 5. 46. If you did beleeve Moses you would beleeve me for he gave testimonie of me. Againe contrariwise the Manicheies did admit of Christ and the gospel, &amp; did deny Moses and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp; therfore S.

This you saie I propound faintly in that I did alleage I did not of purpose dispute it; though as you object it was the maine question.</p>
                     <p>154. I answer most true it is according to my answer wherin I did voluntarily, yeild to this to which by force of argument I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vrged, so it is the maine drift of the question. But in regard of the satisfaction of you or your arguments it is not the maine question. For when I saie there is something els required besides the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word to make it a compleat rule of faith. I did not answer faintly when I graunted more then that to which I was vrged For your Argument required to know how the judgment of the church and in what sence might be infallible; might have a manifold sence. For if you take the definition of the church; for the consent of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; doctors of the church so it is infallible. If you take it for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the Pope so it is also of infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: If you take it for the definition of the Pope with the councel of Cardinals defining <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> so it is of infallible authoritie. And since in all these sences the Catholick church is an indeficient rule to determine a matter of faith, and to interpret the scriptures, I did not therefore faintly answer when I insisted on the last.</p>
                     <p>155 As for your rhethoricall flourish, and forged resolution of my faith, I have sufficiently excluded our opinion from that circle in which you stick fast. Nervaeus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saies the Pope is virtualy the whole church, meanes nothing else; but that he is the spiritual head to direct the whole church by the infallible assistance of the holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>156. As for my vellitation those few that I brought were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to overthrow your groundles opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for my reasons in the armadoe of mine as you terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that you saie wil never enter the feild. It may be well they scorn to oppose one that lies at their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes mercie already.</p>
                     <p>157. Now you come to examin the prerogatives of S. Peter: Out of the whole series of which, &amp; the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances therof &amp; not onely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of each particular I drawe an infallible Argument, but you in an swering them rather seeke to shun or avoid a blow then to give any.</p>
                     <p>158. First you graunt that ever almost S. Peter is named first of the Apostles, you except some 3. or 4. places; but you cite none, though otherwise most frequent in multiplicitie of cited places to no purpose. Hence you graunt that primacie of order and not of authoritie maie be gathered: You saie this gratis: But since the holy Ghost both not repeat this prunacie to no purpose; surely there his authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his other brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is argued thence. And since to be named still first through the whol scripture rather argues primacie of autority then of order. Why should not wee rather i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>160. As for that which you object the 21. of the Apocalyps 19. where the foundation of the wall of the citie is described to be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with pretious stones.

                     <p>163. It is against the principles of faith; since so all Christians being truely baptised and so regenerated in grace, could not sinne to death and so all should bee saved.</p>
                     <p>164. You take it for a great matter that I graunt the Pope maie sinne in matter of fact, &amp; be reprovated if he die in mortal sinne. It is our Catholick doctrine, and the Pope goes to confession co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly oftener then any ordinarie Preist; yet this proves nothing that the Divill prevailes against him as he is head of the church, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines <hi>ex cathedra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But I proved that you admitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so farr as they agree to scripture that is to your owne phancie, to which as guiltie, you are altogither silent. As for the places cited by you Act. 14. v. 22. I finde therein nothing to your purpose but a grosse corruption of the holie text in your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> translating presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Elder, which soundes as well as if you would translate the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of London the Elder, against the common vnderstanding and vse of the word. But in the old testament you translate sacerdos a Priest; and yet here you translate Elder.</p>
                     <p>166. That which you prove the 16. of the Act. 41. proves that S. Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme particular churches; but not the whole church

That the 32. ver. affirmes that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar may particularly comfort others; the 1 of the Thess. 3. 2. proves onely, that Timothie was sent particularly onely to confirme them; and the like can onely be inferred out of the third of the Apoc. 2. which is so farr from proving the speciall confirmation promised to S. Peter that the confirmation is by the vigilencie of one that had the name, onely to live <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus wee though you object my objections bleede; I am assured your wrested places as poore same souldiers are to retreate on crutchess.</p>

                     <p>172. That which you object out of the 1 of Tim. 2. &amp; Act. 13. 11. proves that S. Paul exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated some, but it doth not prove that he exercised that judicial authoritie first, therfeor it proves nothing.</p>
                     <p>173. 10. I inferr S.

                     <p>174. After all these proofes breifly touched, and congruencies I inferred thus. All these, and other circumstances concerning S. Peter showes manifestly that S. Peter had preheminencie above the other of the Apostles; that he is rock and head of the church: How they have vrged I desire not to bee my owne judge, but referr my selfe to the indifferent judgment of the reader.</p>

                     <p>177. And that I doe not impugne our Saviour the head of the church, when I make our Saviour the head of the church, when I make Sainct Peter the ministeriall and subordinate head to him: I proved that as God is said to bee our onely Father; Mat. 23. 9. And yet it is said that wee have many fathers. Christ Jesus is said to bee the foundation, 1 Cor. 3. 11. And yet the Apostles are said to bee foundations Ephes. 2. 20.

                     <p>178. When I saie Petros eyther signifies a rocke or a stone, you bidde me produce any learned authoritie for it. I answer I could produce many.

Where I saie that it was Petros in the masculine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in that the masculine gender was most fittest for a man, But that our Saviour, the first of Peter 2, 8. was named a rock might well bee since all that admitted of his doctrine would never denie, but that he was head of the church, &amp; so there was no need to change the gender as there is here.</p>
                     <p>You taxe me that I on Optatus creddit would have Cephas to signifie a head. I answer that I doe not remember it; and I graunt that I have no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For eyther he must bee the spokeman or Mr. spring by election still where he speaks first; which election of theirs you cannot prove out of scripture; that he should as the foreman of the jurie or the speaker in the parlament: or else being cheife ever in place and speach, he must have it by authoritie given him as I have proved it before.</p>
                     <p>181. You seem to except against my breife confutation of your wordes when I reasoned thus. If S.

                     <p>182. To that where you saie all the Apostles were equall, though there was order as, first, second, and third, Apoc. 21. 19 Whence is that order fetched and derived, but since not in the first ordering or age as I have proved, therefore in the free election of Christ Jesus, that chose and made worthie S.

                     <p>206. To answer every thing againe that you repeat would but make me more wearie, and tyre the reader. It is much that you graunt the Popes primacie to have beene fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Councel of Nyce, thereby to graunt Antichrisme to have reigned so long in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For the Popes loving of preheminence. As for that of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes that you obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ct is nothing to the purpose. And 1 Petri 5. 3. Preheminence absolutly is not forbidden, but one secular prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence with example of lyfe and humilitie. For Tit. 15. 16 It is said
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:603:74"/>
                        <hi>Haec doce, exhortare et argue cum omni imperio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>207. My generall reason you repeat thus. The Ecclesiasticall Hierachie is no worse governed they any temporall regiment For it is compared to a kingdome governed by one King. Mat. 25. to a<note place="margin">My gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason for the Popes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</note> familie wel governed; Hebr:3: to a campe wel ordered. Cant: 6. But in all well ordered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales there is ever required some visible head or judge besides the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawe, since there must bee a supreme to take notise of controversies when they arise etc. there must bee one to explicate the sence of the lawe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to pronounce sentence etc. &amp; there must bee one to compell those to the due observation thereof.</p>
                     <p>208. Now since in the church there ariseth like difficults in the lawes explication etc. Therefore Peters successor indued by the holie Ghost, with gifts of grace in all difficults of moment is to be sought to for councell, is to be heard with obedience when he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selleth, is to bee obeyed when he procedes with his powrefull juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                     <p>209. Your answer is that this reason is faultie from the head to the foot. Wherein you give the holie Ghost the lie that compare his church to the visible government, and nothing so frequent in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures there is then by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of terrestrial things to be instructed<note place="margin">His answer refuted.</note> in caelestiall. But you must note that a similitude must not run on 4. feete or agree in all, but in the primo analogato which you cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe, 2. You bring one falsehood to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm another. For though we saie the Pope is to explicate the lawe; yet he is not above the lawe in your sence; and all that you cite proves onely; that the scriptures are the partiall explicators of themselves Ezech. 44. 24 Deut. 17. 18. 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I have proved one invisible, your proofe is to small purpose. For in London then wee might inferr there were as many churches as there hee parishes, which would bee a fond or fruitless inference, except you vnderstand materiall churches.</p>

                     <p>215. That the whole world is replenished with our doctrine you slight over with most impertinent places of scripture to inferr the Pope to bee Antichrist; and you graunt that the synagogue of the Jewes in her flourishing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I answer, you strayten the words too much, in restreyning them to the 10. commandements: for you may see before, (in Deut. 5. 4.-22.) that the people themselves did hear the 10. commandements promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You proceed and ask, <hi>what this is to my purpose to prove that the written word alone is sufficient to decide all controversies?</hi> I answer, I did express my purpose was to prove this, <hi>That God onely is to be the umpier and arbiter of all controversies about religion:</hi> &amp; whither it were by his word written or unwritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I stood not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in this first point.

I answer, you run into your former fault, abridging the scope of the text. To imitate the hethens, was vnlawfull: but to divise things of their own heads, yea and to imitate God otherwise then he commaunded them, was wicked also. Proofe in Ieroboam, who made a feast not like the heathens, but like the feast in Iudah, 1 King. 12. 32. yet was it sinful, and the holy Ghost bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

him with forging the moneth <hi>out of his own hart,</hi> v. 33. Many of your Popes idolatrous feasts, have nothing so good a colour. And your devised worship of Lord, Lady, Angels, Saincts, Popes, Confessors &amp;c. is not onely an imitation of the hethens; but an idolatrie worse then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theirs; as when we have ended these questions in hand, I will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove vnto you. As for <hi>explicating the law;</hi> I before approved it.</p>
                     <p>Your former reason from the 4. commandment, you seek <note n="*" place="margin">S. 10. p. 100.</note> to vphold with a staffe of reed. For when God gives many commandements, why will you make the keeping of one to be the keeping of all? In deed, if he had given but one precept, and men had given the rest: it were somwhat that you say. But they are all given by the same God, to be our <note n="†" place="margin">Deut <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

In Gal. 3, 15. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sheweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the similitude of a mans Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that much more vnto Gods, nothing may be <hi>added.</hi> Against this, you having nothing justly to except: doo choose to your selfe an other place, more easy to pervert. What els dooth this bewray, but the helplessnes of your cause? Now to folow your wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dringes: What dooth Gal 1. 8. say against that I set down? The word <hi>besides,</hi> meaneth as you think, <hi>contrary to,</hi> and not <hi>more</hi> then they had receaved: because he forbidds not any explication or true gloss &amp;c. I answer, you weary your selfe and others, to prove that which none denyeth. Explications of Gods law by the mouth of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, are allowed of God, Nehem. 8. 8. these are not additions, such as God forbiddes, Galat. 3. 15. Our question is of <hi>other</hi> or <hi>moe</hi> lawes or doctrines then God hath taught. And vnto those which the Prophets had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Paul with the other Apostles taught, none might be added. For he kept back nothing that was profitable, but taught the whole counsel of God, Act. 20. 20. 27. so then whatsoever men could add <hi>more</hi> or <hi>besides,</hi> was not profitable, neyther any of Gods counsel: therefore it was contrary, and so may be put among Popes tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. For their doctrines and traditions are as evidently contrary to Gods word, as darknes is to light. Such be your image worship, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Exo. 20. 4. your praying to creatures, contrary to Mat 4. 10. Rom. 1. 25. service in a barbarous vnknowen tongue, contrary to 1 Cor. 14. 11, 16. 28. robbing the people of the chalice in the sacrament, contrary to Mat. 26. 27. justification by mens works, contrary to Rom. 3. 20. 22. 24. and 4. 2, 3, &amp;c. and many other idolatrous observations, as plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods law, ever vvere the abominations of the heathen.

wil shew how you wrap vp things in confusion and darknes. First <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which title you claym for your <hi>vnwritten</hi> mysteries, is as well the word of God <hi>written</hi> as vnwritten, 2. Thes. 2. 15. but you doo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to the <hi>written</hi> word. Secondly, holy Tradition or Doctrine by word of mouth, was delivered alwayes by holy persons: even as holy Tradition or doctrine by writing, was delivered alwayes by holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The holy persons that spake, were eyther <hi>God</hi> himselfe, (as to Moses in the Mount; to Iob <note n="†" place="margin">Iob. 38, 1. &amp;c.</note> in the whirlwind:) or some Angel, (as to <note n="‡" place="margin">Gé. 22, 11. &amp;c.</note> Abraham, Iaakob, &amp;c.) or, some holy man of God, (as Peter <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21</note> sayth,)<note n="*" place="margin">Exo. 20. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So Abraham is <note n="*" place="margin">Gé. 20. 7.</note> called a Prophet: and so vvas <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> Iaakob and all the holy patriarches from Adam to Moses.

For thus may Mahomet, or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milist reason: that vvhich vvas a rule heretofore, may be a rule stil: but the vvord of God given by visions, revelations and instinct of the spirit, vvas a rule heretofore: therefore it is so still; at least in part. Here is as good and true an argument as yours: that your Logik vvill persvvade as soone to Mahometisme, or Familisine; as vnto Popery. Novv as for the persons, there vvil be no disparagement. For Mahomet himselfe, or H. N. vvill as easily be proved to be holy men of God, as Pope Iohn the 23. vvho vvas judged by the Council <note n="‡" place="margin">Sess. 11, &amp; 12.</note> of Constance to be <hi>a divil incarnate;</hi> and as other your reprobate Popes that vvere <hi>monsters</hi> among men, for their beastly life til their dying day, as your ovvn vvriters doo record, and your selfe in this your vvriting deny it not, nor defend them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And novv I pray you tel me, vvhy men may not be induced by your manner of reasoning, as vvel to receive the Turks Alkoran, and H. N. his <hi>Evangelium regni,</hi> as your Popish decretals. I find no more mention in Gods book, that the Pope of Rome in the vvest churches, should be a divine person to give heavenly traditions, then that Mahomet in the East, should be the man of God. You find not so much as the Popes name, much less his provvd office spoken of (for good) in the Bible. You tel us of the promise to Peter, Mat. 16. and Mahomet telleth us of the promise of the comforter, Ioh. 16 7. That the Pope is head of the church, is as vnpossible for you to prove by Gods lavv; as it is for the Turks to prove that Mahomet is that <hi>Comforter.</hi> You vvould have vs take the Popes ovvn vvord for a vvarrant: the Turks vvould have us take Mahomets vvord for a vvarrant. The truth is, these both vvith their new doctrines and traditions, are the curse and scourge of God vpon the world; because they received not the love of the truth, therefore God hath sent them strong delusion to beleeve lyes, as th' Apostle prophesied: 2 Thes. 2. 10. 11.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That which is not known for Gods word, cannot be the rule of faith. But scriptures by themselves are not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Gods word:</hi> go. <hi>Scriptures by themselves are not the rule of faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I answer, first by imitating your argument thus.</l>
                        <l>That vvhich is not knowen for Gods word, cannot be the rule of faith.</l>
                        <l>But Popes traditions are not knowen for Gods word.</l>
                        <l>Therefore Popes traditions are not the rule of faith.</l>
                        <l>On the contrary I reason thus.</l>
                        <l>That vvhich is known for Gods word, is to be the rule of faith.</l>
                        <l>The holy scripture is known for Gods word.</l>
                        <l>Therefore it is to be the rule of faith.</l>
                        <l>The first proposition is by your selfe here proved.</l>
                        <l>The second, was also by your selfe graunced S. 3. where you said of the scriptures thus, <hi>we reverence them as Gods holy word, derived from the fulnes of truth</hi> &amp;c.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>The conclusion must follow of the premisses: so the truth hath wonne for the book of God: &amp; your error for vnwritten traditions must give place: or ells your owne mouth shall condemn you.</p>
                     <p>Secondly I answer, your argument is deceytfull as your former vvas. For (to omitt, that it is all of negatives, vvhich in strict reasoning should not be,) you add a term in the 2. proposition vvhich vvas not in the first, viz, <hi>by themselves,</hi> vvhich also you put in the conclusion. This is no right nor faithful vvay of reasoning. If (as your ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner is) you vvould have me to vnderstand it in the first: I vvill so. Then it is thus: <hi>That which is not by it self known for Gods word, cannot be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Your 2. proposition I deny: for the scriptures by themselves (vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your traditions) may as easily be known for Gods vvord; as the Sun in the firmament may be known to give light, vvithout a candle.

their religion to be vayn, vvhich teach for doctrines the precepts of men Mat. 15. 9. Secondly you allege a reason. <hi>Since we doo not see or heare God in his known Prophets to write or speak the word &amp;c. there must (you say) be one certayn rule or depositum fidei. As 1 Tim. 6. 20. 2. Tim. 1. 13. 14. have thou a form of sound of words etc. whence you gather that Christians must keep acertain platforme of words delivered to them over and above Pauls epistles: amongst which you name for one, Transsubstantiation.</hi> I answer, first God his vvisdome, power majesty, truth &amp;c. are to be seen as evidently in the vvritings of the Prophets and Apostles; as his eternall power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head are to be seen in the creatures of the vvorld, Rom. 1. Ps. 19. although Atheists cannot see these in the one, nor Papists in the other. Secondly as men doo not hear God vocally in his Prophets: so if they did hear him in them, or in Christ his sonn, yet could they not beleeve, vnless Gods spirit illuminated their harts, Iohn. 12. 37. 39. So your reason is against Christ himselfe, as vvel as against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Fourthly, vvhat church mean you; Greek, or Latine, or AEthiopian? and how shall men know Christs Church from Antichrists? And if the Latin church tel us the fables of Tobit and Iudith, are Gods canonicall scripture; and the Greek church say they are nor, but apocryphal; vvhich of these shall vve beleeve?

                     <p>To those vvords of Paul I have answered before: and (to let pass your mistaking as if he did inioyn <hi>a sound of words,</hi> as you vvrite;) further I vvould have you manifest if you can, vvho are Timothees successors and vvith vvhom he left Pauls <hi>depositum,</hi> as you call it?

                     <p>6. You ask <note n="*" place="margin">S. 37. p. 108.</note> a question thinking to intangle me, <hi>what the seal of the spirit is:</hi> and you suppose divers answers. Because you are so partial a judge of my spirit, I pray aske your Pope, what the seale of his spirit is, and how he discerns scripture, &amp; whither he <hi>build without ground,</hi> as you say I doo Look what he can wel answer for himself to satisfy your conscience; that think to be answered by me. In the mean while, mind that the seal of the spirit is for my own assurance and comfort: which concerneth an other man nothing. 2 Cor. 1. 22. 1 Cor. 2. 11.</p>
                     <p>7. You having my answer already, doo refuse <note n="†" place="margin">S. 38.</note> it: saying it is <hi>most false</hi> that the scriptures are distinguished (from other books) by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as light from darknes For then (say you) <hi>every one that had but naturall perfection of the organ and free proposing of the object, should distinguish this light.</hi> This (say I) is most true: for the law of God is a light, Prov. 6. 23. which when it is by him free proposed, and the organ that is the mind of man (wich now is <note n="‡" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> blinded) recovereth <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perfection,</hi> that is to say, is <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 17. 18.</note> illuminated or renued in knowledge <note n="“" place="margin">Colos. 3. 10.</note> after the image of him that created it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every such man with his perfect organ, seeth the word of God to be in the scriptures, as every man that hath a perfect naturall ey, seeth the light of the sun: and can assure himself hereof, though he goe not to Rome to ask the Pope whither the sun gives light or no. But you are as a man without sense, that though the sun shine at noon day, yet if the Pope say it is midnight you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him: &amp; so on the contrary. For you <note n="*" place="margin">S. 3.</note> profess to beleeve each part of scripture to be <hi>Gods holy word, derived from the fulnes of truth.</hi> Now this is because the Pope tells you so, and he tells you also that the books of Tobit, Iudith, Maccabees, &amp;c. are scripture canonicall, although in them there be apparant lyes, as you may see Tobit 12. 15. compared with Tob. 15. 18.

Mac. 1. 20. 21. 22. 31. &amp; many the like. Now though the Apostle sayth, <hi>no lye is of the truth,</hi> 1 Ioh. 2. 21. yet you beleeve these lyes are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>from the fulnes of truth;</hi> because the Pope will have it so to be. Thus the blind lead the blind into the ditch.</p>
                     <p>So you <hi>doo not by your private spirit,</hi> (as you <note n="†" place="margin">S. 40.</note> say) distinguish he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiks from true beleevers, but by the <hi>definitions and declarations of the church;</hi> that is (I trow) of the Pope. I shewed you a better way by the Apostle, 1 Ioh. 4. 1. 4. but you love darknes better then light. And by your grounds, if you had lived in Christs dayes on earth, you would have distinguished Christ as an heretick from true beleeving Iewes, by the definitions of that <note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 22.</note> church and Preisthood.</p>
                     <p>Vnto Iewes, you confess <note n="‡" place="margin">S. 41.</note> you must shew other grounds, then your Popes authority: But if they retort vpon you your <hi>private spirit,</hi> as you doo to me, eyther your mouth is stopped, or your conscience in pleading against me as you doo, is corrupted.

                     <p>Gamaliel (you <note n="‡" place="margin">S. 77. 78.</note> say) spake rather <hi>as a freind then as a judge: as a Cardinall in the Popes conclavi,</hi> rather then as a Pope. Be it so: yet he <note place="margin">Act. 5. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>rose up</hi> I trow vvhen he spake: so then <hi>rising up</hi> to speak, is no proof of superiority: and you might have spared this strife about your frivolous reason.</p>

At the most this sheweth but primacie in order; (which I graunted:) seing Paul and others did the like. But by your manner of reasoning, vvhosoever dooth any thing first, shallbe head of the church. And why I pray you, by like reason should not those Popes that first practised Simony, sorcerie and hypocrisie; be heads of the man of syn. You leav <note n="‖" place="margin">S. 174.</note> it for the reader to judge whither all these reasons togither shew not that Peter was <hi>rock and head</hi> of the church.

                     <p>I proved by the scriptures Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20. Ioh. 20. 21. 22. 23.

I answer, first Gods word no where caleth Peter the head: and vvhy will you be vviser then God? Secondly the Apostles, because they <hi>layd the foundation</hi> vvhich vvas Christ, as Paul sheweth, 1. Cor. 3 10. 11. therfore the Church is sayd to be built upon their foundation, Eph. 2. 20. And in this they vvere equal: if any excelled, it vvas Paul, who laboured in laying the foundation more then the rest, 2 Cor. 12. 11. 1 Cor. 15. 10. In this sense if you speak of <hi>ministerial head,</hi> that by the ministery of the word Peter preached the head Christ, the thing is true, but the phrase is not good: it vvas true in Paul also as much as Peter, yea &amp; in all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 1. 2. 3. 4. 8.</note> and thus all Christs ministers at this day, minister and preach him the head, vvhich the Pope dooth not. But you feign a thing which never vvas, that Christ should substitute Peter for head in his place &amp; absence: no scripture tells you this, but the contrary, for Christ being <note n="‡" place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note> present and <note n=":" place="margin">Rev. 1. 13. and 2. 1.</note> vvalking vvith his churches, needeth no vicar. And this title head, God in his vvord giveth onely to Christ: Col. 1. 18. Yet you, leaving Gods vvord, fly to your S. Basil for succor: that all men may see, your church and prelacy, is built on the sands of mens traditions, not on the Rock of divine oracles.</p>
                     <p>You vvill not from it, <note n="“" place="margin">S. 178.</note> but <hi>Peter</hi> signifies a <hi>rock:</hi> vvhich I have disproved; and shewed that <hi>Petros</hi> of <hi>Petra</hi> the Rock, and <hi>Cephas of Ceph,</hi> is no more then to be a Christian of Christ. Peter vvas a principal <hi>stone</hi> (yea the first if you vvill) layd upon Christ the chief <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2. 20.</note> corner stone, the <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> Rock: all Christians are <note n="‡" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> living stones layd on him also. Your racked allegations from Augustine and other Doctors, I vvil not spend time to confute: for I build my religion vpon the Rock Christ, &amp; not upon men.</p>
                     <p>Your <note n="‖" place="margin">S. 179.</note> reason vvhy the gender vvas not changed in Christs name as in Peters, is for that all vvhich admitted of his doctrine vvould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him to be head of the church. I see you love to say somwhat unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing. I also may say, all vvhich admitt of the Popes doctrine, vvill not deny Peter to be head of the church: so (by your argument) there was no need to change the gender for him neyther. And so the scripture hath doon somthing needless: or els your answer is fruitless. How you save Optatus credit, and your self from blame, for falsely interpreting Cephas a <hi>head,</hi> contrary to the holy Ghost, Ioh. 1. 43. vvho interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it a <hi>stone:</hi> I leave it for the learned to judge.</p>
                     <p>Your exception <note n="*" place="margin">S. 180. pag. 140.</note> that Peter vvas not elected to be the mouth of the rest, vvas refelled in my former vvriting, if you vvould rest: for Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, Philip, Iude, vvere not elected any more then Peter to speak for the other disciples, Ioh. 14. 5. 8. 22. yet you vvill not have them heads.</p>
                     <p>So your distination of the Apostles equallity in power of order, not of <note n="†" place="margin">S. 183.</note> jurisdiction; is a bare repetition of a thing never proved, but before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed And where you add, <hi>equall as they were Apostles but not as they were Bishops:</hi> it is mere trifling, you might as vvell say,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:603:86"/>
equal as they were <hi>men,</hi> but not as they vvere <hi>living creatures.</hi> For they vvere no otherweise Bishops, then as they were Apostles. And in Act. 1. you may see that Iudas his Episcopee or Bishops office, vvas no other then his Apostolee or Apostles office, Act. 1. v. 20. compared vvith v. 17. 25. 26. Besides by 1. Cor. 12. 28. and Ephe. 4. 11. you may see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were by office the <hi>first</hi> in the church: that if the other were equal vvith Peter in the Apostleship (as you graunt); they vvere equal also in al power: that if you resist any longer, you vvill be condemned of your self. Your <hi>succession</hi> grounded but vpon mens report, I allow not of, for you build on boggs.</p>
                     <p>Your understanding <note n="*" place="margin">S. 184.</note> of that admonition Rom. 11. 20. 22. &amp;c. is partly true, and against your self in that you vvrote before S. 162. partly it is frivolous, vvhiles you dream of more previlege to the See of Roome and Bishop there, then to others churches and Bishops. You have no colour for this in the testament of Christ: yet is it the mayn thing that yow should prove, if it were possible. No citie in the world remayneth so execrable by Gods word, as Rome for killing Christ of old, by her power and pollicie: and for being Antichrists throne. Rev. 17. and 18.</p>

And that in matters of fact he maysyn</hi> (you say) <hi>as well as any other.</hi> Your Popes facts I am sure prove this, if any shoud have the face to deny it. Hereupon I inferr, that your Popes are not members, and so not possibly heads of the catholik church of God. It is high blasphemy to say the head of that church may want Gods holy grace, Colos. 1, 18. &amp;c. &amp; 2, 19. How now doo you know that the traditions and definitions of your graceless Popes, are of God? If you trie them not by the scriptures, (which you dare not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>private spirit,</hi>) they may deceive and damne your soul, as well as any other men. You say, you hold <hi>a necessary assistance</hi> which the Pope hath of the holy Ghost, <hi>as he defines ex cathedra.</hi> And upon what ground hold you this? You find in Gods book no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eyther of your <hi>Pope,</hi> or of his <hi>Chayr,</hi> for good. The Apostle Peter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth us to that vvhich holy <note n="‡" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> men of God spake: not to that vvith Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans slaves doo teach: such as vvas P.

And by the same answers of the Divils vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had deceived many, he vvas also deceived himself, &amp; vvas intercep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted vvith suddayn death, by the judgment of God.

Never vvas there such a thing known since the beginning of the vvorld, that a graceless reprobate, should have necessarily the assistance of the holy Ghost, so often as he sits him down on his <hi>chayr,</hi> to define or determine the matters of God. No religion on earth (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) ever admitted such an unreasonable doctrine; for vvhich you have no proof, unless from the Popes own ungracious spirit: vvhereby he exalteth himself against all that is caled God, 2.

                        <hi>Godded with God.</hi> But I wil take S. Leo at the best. Secondly therfore I answer, that this speach of Peter vvas to all the Saincts, that fled the corruption vvhich is in the vvorld through lust, 2. Pet. 1. 1. 4. so that S. Peters privilege, vvill get litle hereby, much less the Popes. For these graces have not appeared in many heads of your church, but the contrary, vvhiles your Popes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the corruption in the vvorld through lust, (as your self deny not:) so then such vvere not partakers of the divine, but of the <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> Divils nature. And now consider vvhat <hi>grace</hi> they have infused into your church. But for this <hi>participation</hi> you say, <hi>S. Greg. the</hi> 7. prayed to <hi>S.

                           </gap>e, there ye shal see him,</hi> This which Christ had promised to doo himself, Mark. 14. 28. and now performed it, Mark. 16. 17. you falsely apply unto Peter: to prove him head and Captayn: and so by Peters feighned Captainship, to intrude your Pope as head and Captayn; so thrusting out Christ. Did ever men offer such abuse to Gods word as you doo?</p>
                     <p>No better is your next addition; <hi>S. Peter (you say) came first to the monument.</hi> Ioh 20. 4. were this so, what sense is there to conclude him head of the Church for it? Mary Magdalen was there before Peter, Ioh. 20. 1. why doo you not make her head? But you falsify the scripture: for it sayth <hi>they rann both togither, but the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the monument.</hi> That which the holy Ghost witnesseth of Iohn, the other disciple: that doo you ascribe to Peter. How unsufferably doo you vvrest the scripture? What lyes (may vve think) vvill you not preach to your seduced people, vvhich may not read the scriptures: vvhen you vvrite thus to me? But any thing is good
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:603:88"/>
ynough, to help your Popes: like proofe like prerogative.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly you add, S. Paul came to Ierusalem to see S. Peter, Gal. 1. 18. This had had some show, if he had come to Rome to see S. Peter: now, if it could prove S. Peters preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, it might have some colour for the Bishops of Ierusalem: but for the Pope of Rome none at all. No more then as if one should reason thus, Iudas betrayed his master: therefore the Pope is Antichrist. I think you vvil not graunt the conclusion, though it be truer then yours. I further answer, that Paul there proveth his authority to be no vvay inferiour to Peters, both by his caling, v. 1. and his behaviour after his caling: for he vvent not to Ierusalem to them vvhich vvere Apostles before him, but (as he saith) vnto Arabia, and turned agayn unto Damascus, v. 17. then after 3. yeares he vvent to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem to see Peter, vvhich being compared vvith his words and deeds af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Gal 2. 6. 7. 8. 11. &amp;c. argue rather Pauls Priviledge, then Peters. For his going to Peter, vvil no more debase him, then the mother of our Lord, vvho vvent into the hil country to Elizabet, vvith vvhom she ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed much longer then Paul did vvith Peter, Luk. 1. 39. 40 43. 56.</p>
                     <p>And now we have seen your plea for S. Peter: I vvil shew how a man might plead better for S. Paul, that he was the head of your Catholik Roman church as you vainly call it. 1. S. Paul was caled to his office, not by S. Peter but by Iesus Christ, Gal. 1. 1. 2. S. Paul received the doctrine vvhich he preached, not from S. Peter but by revelation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iesus Christ, Gal. 1. 12. 3. S. Paul laboured in preaching the gospell, more then S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did 1. Cor. 15. 10. 4. S. Paul went and preached vvithout so much as conferring vvith S. Peter or the rest, Gal. 1. 16. 17. 5. The gospel over the vncircumcision (that is the Gentils among vvhom Rome vvas cheif) was committed to S. Paul. Gal. 2. 7. 6. S. Paul had upon him the care of all churches, 2 Cor. 11. 28. 7. S.

My reasons are, first because he sayd elswhere, <note place="margin">Mat. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>.</note> shal arise <hi>false Christs,</hi> &amp; false Prophets. Secondly because Antichrist is described as a <hi>Beast,</hi> Rev. 13. which <hi>beast</hi> in the Prophets signifieth <hi>a kingdom,</hi> and many persons of one sort, as is sayd in Dan. 7. 23. <hi>the fourth beast shalbe the fourth kingdom</hi> &amp;c. So the <hi>Lion</hi> vvas for all the Kinges of Babylon, the <hi>Bear,</hi> for all the Kings of Persia &amp;c. Dan. 7. 4. 5. &amp; so by proportion that deformed <hi>beast</hi> Rev. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. for all Popes. Thirdly because the word [Allos] <hi>another,</hi> vvhich Christ useth, often noteth many particular men of one kind; as in Ioh. 4. 37. one soweth and <hi>another</hi> reapeth: which he expoundeth in the next words, v. 38. other man laboured, (meaning the Prophets) and ye (my Apostles) enter into their labours. And thus the <hi>man of syn,</hi> though he be one person at once, yet successively meaneth many: as when Christ sayth, Ioh. 10. 10. <hi>the theef</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not but to steal: he restreyneth it not to one theef in person alwayes; but meaneth every theef whensoever he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth. Fourthly Antichrist cannot be one singular man, as you think; because he must reign at least 1000. yeres: as may be gathered by Rev. 20. 4. vvhere the godly vvhich worshiped not the Beast, lived &amp; reigned with Christ 1000. yeres during vvhich time the Beast persecuted and kylled them: also by the vvomans lying hid in the vvildernes so many dayes, Rev. 12.</p>
                     <p>Your 3. reason is, <note n="*" place="margin">S. 203.</note> 
                        <hi>Antichrist shalbe of the tribe of Dan,</hi> as Gen. 49. 17. <hi>Dan shalbe a serpent</hi> &amp;c. Ier. 8. 16. <hi>the neyghing of horses was heard from Dan.</hi> &amp;c.] I answer, first you shew no reason that this is meant properly of Antichrist.

And thus the Chalde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrast on that place expoundeth it, saying: There shall be a man which shall be chosen &amp; rise out of the house of Dan, vvhose fear shal fal vpon the peoples, and he shall valiantly smite the Philistians as an adder, as an asp he shal lye in wayt by the path, he shal s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>1. We hold all the vv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itings of the Prophets and Apostles, to be of God, ful of heavenly vvisdome, inspired by his spirit: 2. Pet, 1. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 3 16. 2 Tim. 3. 16.</p>
                     <p>2. That therefore they are of divine authority; and unfallible truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="182" facs="tcp:603:92"/>
vvherein the creature is bound to rest, as in the vvord of the creator: and sufficient to make men vvise unto salvation. Many reasons there be to perswade men, that the scriptures are of God: some principal, which are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himself: others secondary, vvhich are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men. God himself testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the scriptures to be of him two vvayes. Outwardly, vvhereby he prepareth the hart unto faith, by motives of credibility: and inwardly vvhereby be assureth the hart of the beleever.</p>
                     <p>The outward motives are: which God giveth us in the word it self.</p>
                     <p>First in the Holy scriptures ther is a Majesty wisdom and grace of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, differing from al other writings in the world; which the minde of man (if it be not blind) may see and discerne to be of God; as the eye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the light of the Sun, from the light of a torch or candle: For God hath shewed as great wisdom in the Scriptures, as in the making of the world. Psal. 19.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the doctrine it self or institution in the scriptures, excelleth al humane doctrines and lawes, as leading us from our selves, from this world, &amp; from Satan the prince of it; unto God, in faith, love, holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, feare, humility &amp;c. And these things farr passing the reach of any earthly creature naturally to conceiv or comprehend fully, though he be taught: much less could they be by men devised.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly the prophesies, which shine through all the scriptures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade this. For as God convinceth al heathens idols, and Gods, to be vayn, because they could not prophesie; and proveth his ovvne sole deity by this foretelling of things to come, &amp; performing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Isa. 41. 22. 23. 24. 26. &amp; 44. 7. 8. 26. So the Holy scriptures, by the prophesies and true events of them, may be discerned to be divine, and of God: from all other writings in the world.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly it appeareth by the consent and agrement of al the partes of the Holy Bible, though written by severall men at several times, even hundreds of yeres one after an other, and that also after divers manners, some histories, some prophesies, some songs, some parables, some epistles &amp;c. in al which notwithstanding, ther is an harmony; that no one writer in any place, crosseth or convinceth an other of error or falshood. The like wherof, is not possible to be shewed of halfe so many writers, that ever so agreed togither in their writings, since the world began.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the efficacy of the scriptures, &amp; powrful working in the harts of al sorts of men, illumining the mind, changing the affections, sanctifying the whole body, sowl and spirit of men, that have read and heard their words: Wherby all other false religions have been confounded and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and this hath been stablished against the forces of the divil, and of the princes and powers of the world, and sense of the flesh, and naturall minde of man: Al which doo manifest that these cannot but be of God.</p>
                     <p>The inward testification of God, is by his Holy <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10 11. 12. &amp; 14 37. 1. Ioh. 2. 20.</note> spirit, which illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth the mind, to vnderstand the things given us of God, writeth them in our harts, and sealeth up the assurance of the promises that ar in them, unto the beleeving conscience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:603:92"/>The secondary testimony that the scriptures ar of God, is from men: as,</p>
                     <p>First the Vniversal consent of churches in all ages, of the Iewes first, and after of the Christians in all places, which have received, beleeved, and obeyed the Holy scriptures, as the Oracles of God: yea even Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christians themselves acknowledge them to be from heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the multitude of men that have given their lives, for defense of these scriptures and doctrines taught in them, yea even the heretik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s themselves, who thought their errors were confirmed by these scriptures and therfore died in them, are not excluded from this motive; which is such, as the like can not be shewed of any book under the sun.</p>
                     <p>The first outward proofs, which God hath engraved in the scriptures themselves; are sufficient to convince al men, and make them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. For as the invisible thinges of God, that is, his eternal power and godhead, are to be seen in his works the creatures; Rom. 1. 20: so the invisible things of Gods word, the powrfulnes, wisdom and alsufficiencie therof unto mans salvation, are to be seen in the Holy scriptures: which<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7. &amp;c.</note> they that beleeve not, wil not be perswaded though one should ryse agayne from the dead: Luk. 16. 31. And if God will damn the wicked, that doo not by his works discern him, and honour him as God: much more wil he damn the prophane, that doo not by his scriptures discern his holy wil, and obey the same.</p>
                     <p>The inward testification by the spirit of God in the beleevers hart, is for the comfort and assurance of every one that hath it: not for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proof to others, much less to the wicked which have it not, neyther can perceive it. In vayn therfore doth Mr. I. A. and the papists, cal for manifestation of that, which they can not discern: and cavil against the spirit, as not a due outward proof, when we allege it not for that end.</p>
                     <p>Now wil I set down some motives which may draw any reasonable infidel (if God shut not up his hart from understanding,) to come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ather unto true Christianity, with us the Reformed churches: then unto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikisme or Popery, with the Romists.</p>

But Papists dare not stand to these, but allege for the triall of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, later new records of Doctors, Councills, Popes &amp;c.

                     <p>Thirdly, the grounds which we build upon, namely the Prophets and Apostles writings, are both <note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 4. 4. Luk. 16. 20. 31. 2 Pet. 1 19. &amp; 3. 2.</note> commanded of God, and by Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the scriptures are acknowledged to be of God, authentik and canonical, so that we build upon the Rock, even our adversaties being judges. But their traditions, and Popes decrees besides scripture, are <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, the writers of our grounds the Holy scriptures, vvere all <note n="‡" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21 Rev. 18. 20. Luk. 13. 28.</note> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons, governed by the spirit of God; and not any one of them vvas a reprobate. But the writers and determiners of popish traditions, have been many of them (and that by the papists owne confession) most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vile persons, that sold themselves unto syn and Satan al dayes of their life, and got their popedomes some by simonie and bribes; some by schisme and sedition, and other like evil meanes. Therfore in al reason, they are nothing so vvorthy to be beleeved or rested vpon, as the sacred vvriters on vvhome vve depend.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, the Holy Apostles &amp; Prophets (to vvhose vvritings vve cleave) preached not <note n="‡" place="margin">Isa. 8. 20. 2 Cor. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 3. 57.</note> themselves, but Gods law and Christ: drew no <note n="“" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note> man to subjection unto themselves but unto God: sought not in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines or vvritings their ovvn vvealth or vvorldly preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, sold not the Gospel, nor <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 8. 18. 20. 2 Cor. 2 17.</note> made marchandise of it: Wheras Popes (on vvhose defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive sentences Papists doo rely) preach themselves; as, <hi>wee declare,</hi> (sayth <note n="†" place="margin">Extra. de Major et o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.

                           </gap>nct.</note> P. Boniface) <hi>we define, and pronounce, that it is altogither of necessity to salvation, that every humane creature be under the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome.</hi> So other their traditions and definitions, tend to the maintenauce of their own pomp, dignity, vvorldly vvealth and pleasures; for their Popes bulls, pardons, and blessed reliks are set to sale for money; so are their Preists masses and Trentals, as the vvorld vvel knoweth: and therefore of all naturall vvise men are justly to be suspected: and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets to be preferred much before them.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the holy vvriters vvhom vve depend on; are all of such autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and credit, as vve admit of proof from any one of them because they all teach one faith and obedience. Whereas Papists send men to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Doctors, Fathers, Councils, which disagree one from another: so making great show of them to the simple; wheras themselves as often as they lyst, refuse the judgment and exposition of their fathers doctors &amp;c. as is to be seen in Cardinal Bellarmine and others, that often doo refuse the sentences of the Fathers: and conclude vvith the Council of Trent or definitive sentence of the Pope.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the scriptures that vve build upon doo all agree and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:603:93"/>
in them. But Papists have also for their rules of faith, Apocryphal booke and fables, vvherein are many open lyes and vnreconcilable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the Prophets, as Tob. 12. 15. compared vvith Tob. 15. 18. 1. Maccab. 6. 16. vvith 2. Mac. 1. 16. 2. Macc. 1. 19. vvith 2. King. 25. Iudith. 9. 2. 3. vvith Gen. 49. 5. 6. Esth. apopcryph. 12. 5. 6. vvith Esth. can. 6. 3. and 3. 2. Esth. apoc. 11. 2. vvith Esth. can. 2. 16. besides their Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations for making and vvorshiping of similitudes or images, of silver and gold, wood and stone, hethenlike: for having the vvorship of God and scriptures in a barbarous tongue vvhich the people understand not, and many the like; are expressly contrary to the commandements of God; as any man of common judgment may evidently preceive; yea &amp; some of their Popes have repeled the decrees one of another; as before hath been manifested.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, The summ of our faith learned from holy scriptures, is to trust on God and Christ alone for mercy and salvation; not on creatures, as Angels, and souls of men, nor on our selves or humane merits: vvhereby vve resting on God, <note n="*" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 29 Rom. 8. 38. 39. Luk. 10 20. and 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>2. Heb. 10. 22.</note> have, and doo profess to have ful assurance of our salvation; and so have peace of conscience, in life and death. But Popish faith learned by tradition, teacheth men not to trust on God and Christ alone, but on the intercession of creatures, and Pardons of Popes, and on their own merits also for salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: vvhereby their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences accusing them, they neyther have nor profess to have such peace, by full assurance that they are heyres of God unto salvation, as vve: nay they rage against this truth; as against an heresie.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The holy scriptures vvhich vve rest vpon, are of such power and authority that many thowsands in their ages have given their lives for the defense of them, and of the things taught onely in them; yea even hereticks have dyed for things vvhich they have erroneously thought to be in the scriptures reveled. But for Papists, they cannot shew many (if any) that have vvillingly given their lives for such doctrines as have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bene taught by men &amp; by unwritten popish tradition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not in their judgment by the prophetical and Apostolical scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, the Holy scriptures vvhich are the rule of our faith, have prophesies of things to come, and due accomplishments of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies as they vvere foretold: vvhereby vve are confirmed of the truth and infallibility of those vvritings. But the vvritings of Doctors, Councils, Popes, on vvhich Papists rely, are destitute of this confirmation, Neyther dooth the Pope use to prophesie; though it vvere necessary, if he vvould as Christs vicar obtrude his ovvn decrees for divine oracles, seing the tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Iesus is the spirit of prophesie, as the Angel sayd Rev. 19. 10. Nay rather the prophesies of <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 13. &amp; 17. &amp;c.</note> scripture plainly foreshew the Church of Rome to be the whore of Babylon, and her Lord the Pope to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. Which he fearing it wil come to light, forbiddeth therfore his subjects, the reading of Gods book.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, Papists themselves are forced in disputing against Iewes (which were once Gods church, and from which they themselves with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:603:94"/>
us received the books of Moses and the Prophets:) to use onely the holy scriptures and prophesies to convince them: for their Romish church &amp; traditions, the Iewes doo not regard. With these scriptures the Papists doo rightly <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. I. A. sect. 41. 43.</note> think the Iewes are sufficiently convicted. Even so doo we much more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (having the scriptures of the new Testament added to the old) rightly hold it sufficient to convince the Papists by the written vvord vvhich they acknowledge to be of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they have no more reason to refuse this and draw us to their Popes decretals, then the Iewes have to refuse the Bible, and draw men to their high preists, Rabbies and Thal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds: or the Turkes, to their Alkoran.</p>
                     <p>12. Finally, grace, vvisdom, and divine majesty appeareth in the holy scriptures, to all that read them (except they have a reprobate sense) even by the confession of our adversaries. But no such vvisdom grace or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty appeareth in Popes decrétals, more then in other humane vvritings: yea they are full of ignorance, grossnes, barbarisme, error, favouring of the Popes private spirit; as any of understanding (unless they be the Popes bondmen) vvil confess: and no singular grace appeareth in them, more then in the books of H. N. or Alkoran of Mahomet. For all vvhich and sundry other like reasons vvhich might be alleged: every reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble infidel vvhom God vvill save, vvill rather incline to our grounds of ancient Christianity; then to the other, of late Iesuitisme or Popery. Let him that readeth consider, and give sentence.</p>
                     <p>By this vvhich hath bene vvritten, you may see (M. I. A.) that we fly not for proof, to our privat spirit, as you often slander us: but we say a Papist may be couvinced by the wisdome and majesty of God shining in the scriptures (and other arguments forementioned,) more easily then an Atheist can be convinced by the wisdom and majesty of God shining in the creatures. And if this later were sufficient (by th'Apostles <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 1. 20. &amp;c.</note> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) to condemn the hethens: the former must needs be more suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to condemn you: especially seing you confess the scriptures to be of GOD: vvhereas the Atheist will not confess<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the world to be of God: and yet you dare not abide the trial of your religion by this book of God, without your own traditions and decrees also. Whereas if you graunt a Turk to be tried by the Bible and his Alkoran; or a Iew to be tried by the Prophets, and his Thalmud, you will betray all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>

And therefore as I remit you for all your slight replie to my former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in so many sheates of paper delivered, so I remitt your audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but to compare both for their satisfaction and manifestation of the truth if they bee intelligible.

And since you doe confess to bee tyred, as indeed I profess I am, but to reade your slight stuff; I shall content my selfe to poinct out how you have satisfied me in no one poinct, referring my selfe to my former defence, which doth, and shall stand in force for ought therin that you can justly oppugne.</p>
                     <p>To the first of mine wherein as I showe that your reasons va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish of themselves, you keepe a greate pudder to no purpose; Naie you overthrow your selfe graunting the vnwritten word of God to deepde controversies, &amp; that the law must bee explicated by Preists. For as traditions, the vnwritten word are included and implied in the written word, or belonge to the explication or performance of the same; so also fasts, feasts, and ceremonies of the Church are virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie included in those generall precepts and prerogatives of the Church as I expressed in my former. Now to add that which is gathered thence, or to explicate that which is included is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as you doe in your replie not obscurely confess as I show in my 12. parag. as also the 16. &amp; 17. parag. is to answer. Where as you charge me that you have often answered that which I object parag. 20. I referr to the indifferent reader; But verily I maie speake and not from my own judgment, that your writings deserve no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>

                     <p>In my 32 parag: I fullie satisfied your tortured places; and if I doe leave out som places it is in that they are virtuallie answered in other places expounded; For if a man should examine each place you bring, wee should never have an end.</p>
                     <p>And if the scriptures bee as cleare as the Sunne to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it followes that they must bee knowne of all, if you saie of all his, you doe petere principium, since everie one will pretend to bee his: I<note place="margin">See 113.</note> proved also by the authoritie of S.

                     <p>As for your motives; to propose which onely, is not to answer mine; I referr my selfe to the judiciall and indifferent reader to compare both together; see par: 109 120. 121. 122. 153. where I show how<note place="margin">See the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>heminence given to S.
