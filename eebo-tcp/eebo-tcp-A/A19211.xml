            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it argues guilt to be accuſed, no man ſhall be innocent; he is therefore blameleſſe, that being charged, defends himſelfe: Gentle Reader, the firſt impreſsion of this historie of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, came no ſooner foorth, but many (greedie to detract from anothers glorie) did therein bitterly wrong me, accuſing me to be ill affected to the Portugall nation in generall, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere cenſor of the priuate actions of great perſonages, and of the officers of that crowne. And albeit it behooueth him that ſhall write of late accidents, in the Theater of this vniuerſall worlde, to beare the malice and follie of many; beſides that, he ſhall hardly ſatisfie all; yet were it more tollerable, if ſome (content wrongfully to backbite me,) were not ſo tranſported with their owne paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as to labour to haue the vſe of this Booke forbidden throughout all Spaine; notwithstanding it had beene allowed by the Inquiſitors: Albeit I knowe well that many men of iudgement, and louers of truth, haue ſhewed themſelues fauorers of this worke: yet haue I thought it fitte in this ſecond edition briefly to make my innocencie knowen. And although they haue inuented many more to theſe two ſlanders, yet will I ſatisfie euery point I thinke neceſſarie, with this ſuppoſition for a firme ground, that the truth and diligence of a hiſtorie, be the qualities that giue it ſpirit, and life, the which by no meanes can be infringed, without conuerting the moſt graue and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manner of writing, into the moſt vaine and preiudiciall of all others: So as if my accuſations grow from the truth and my diligence, I will not yeeld my ſelfe guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeeing I cannot amend them without errour. But let them vnderſtande that I write onely to thoſe Readers that can iudge of the truth of a historie and the newtral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the writer: First of all, they must conſider it was my chance to write the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that realme, which hapned in thoſe fower moſt vnfortunate yeeres, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that of <hi>77.</hi> ſo as there is no reaſon that ſuch as report I was enclined to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the Portugals, ſhoulde from the qualitie of the time, ſiniſterly iudge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition of the writer; neither let them hold him partiall in the conquerors behalfe, ſeeing that in accidents of warre, they can hardly honour him that fals, but he that ſuffereth himſelfe to be vanquiſhed, must with his loſſe, willingly beare the blame that growes thereby: The which the ancient writers could ſo well obſerue (whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I do willingly imitate) that if <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> had begon and finiſhed his historie in the courſe of <hi>Hannibals</hi> victorie, he had been held for a Carthaginian; and <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in deſcribing the calamities of the Iewes, and the triumphs of <hi>Titus,</hi> ſeemed a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: If I writing of two battailes, where in the one, the Portugals loſt their king; in the other their kingdome; beſides that at ſea, and the loſſe of the Terceres; what
<pb facs="tcp:9072:3"/>
offence is it, if I ſeeme not a Portugall? ſeeing that if I were one, I ſhould not ſeeme to be ſo: or how is it poſsible to conuert this mornefull historie into praiſes, making him ſeeme valiant that looſeth? without doubt, if it had fallen to my lot, to write the deeds of that nation, whereby they made ſhew how apt they were to armes, and to noble at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as the victories they got of Castile at Aliubarotta, and at Trancoſa, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts they made in Affrick, their woonderfull nauigations and happie ſucceſſe in Aſia, touched in this hiſtorie, as occaſion required. I had not then beene more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then now I am, though more acceptable to Portugals, yet men of iudgment do with one minde feele both gaine and loſſe, praiſe and diſpraiſe, when they be truely related: So as without doubt we may conclude, that no man ought to cenſure the inclination of the writer by the matter he treates of, be it either in fauour or blame of the nation of which he writes; but onely of the truth and indifferencie he profeſſeth. My accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers must alſo vnderſtand, that a Hiſtoriographer doth not wrong any nation, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the qualities which the heauens that couer them, doe infuſe vpon them, the aire they breath, and the water they drinke, eſpecially when thoſe properties be not baſe but exceſſes of vertue: As for example, if a man ſhould (imitating <hi>Iulius Caeſar)</hi> write, that the French are in the beginning furious, and in the end, faint; he ſhoulde not for this ſhew him ſelfe an enimie, nor diſgrace that mightie and warlike nation: And who ſhould ſay that the Spaniards are proud, ſhould he therefore impugne their reputation publiſhed through the worlde? neither ſhould he offend the Portugals, that ſhould ſay they are naturally preſumptuous, ſeeing they neither can deny it, nor do ſeeke to hide it; yea themſelues are woont to ſay, that they liue by opinion, that is, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelues more, with that they imagine themſelues to be, then with what they are in effect: my accuſers ſhoulde likewiſe conſider, that I offend not the Portugals, in ſaying, that the ignorant regard not dangers a farre off, and feare them neere, if they meane not to ſeparate them from the condition of man, and againſt all reaſon make equall ignorance with knowledge. Moreouer I would gladly knowe why it were not lawfull for me without offence, to relate with truth the misfortunes and calamities of the Portugals, and the altered forme of their realme, as well as for ſome of the ſame nation to write many of their actions blame woorthie, and yet not helde diſcourteous: The entrie which <hi>Henrie</hi> the baſtard, king of Caſtill made armed into Portugall, running from the confines of Gallitia, vnto Lisbone, where he lodged, forcing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all places, was it not more diſhonorable then any thing I haue written, king <hi>Ferdinand</hi> not being able to make any reſiſtance? Read the Chronicles of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond their naturall king, being quiet and peaceable, what conſpiracies were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed against him by the nobilitie of his realme, ſo as he was forced to ſeeke reuenge by ſtabbing, and to behead ſome of the chiefe publikely, is not this a reprochfull thing? Although ſome alleage, that the king exceeded in the execution, &amp; that by nature he was a ſeuere man, and full of reuenge, yet there want not others that do number him amongſt the ſaints; but be it as it may, it lies not in me to iudge, and yet this booke is Printed and ſold in Lisbone, whereas my booke (that treates not of matters of ſo great doubt) is mightily abhorred. As for the priuate perſonages of the realme, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they reaſon to ſurmiſe that I haue ſpoken of them, either with paſsion or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſtlie, the which I beleeue themſelues haue founde, if they haue had any leiſure to read this hiſtorie with iudgement, or haue any perfect knowledge in the Italian toong. But relying vpon the report of ſuch as (enclined to flatter) reprooue all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb facs="tcp:9072:4"/>
that are not corrupted with flatterie, it is no woonder, if they be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that I haue written diſcurteouſly of them and with paſsion: But to make knowne the contrarie, they muſt vnderſtande, that of vices which are common to ſtates, and to mens priuate humours, we may ſaie the like as hath beene ſaide of thoſe that are commonly incident vnto nations, that they blemiſh not ſo much as they ought to be concealed, but march alwaies vnited to the ſtate and qualitie of the perſon. For example, he that talking of a yoong gentleman, ſhoulde ſay, that he were phantaſticke, cholericke, amorous, arrogant, for all this he doth him no wrong; for beſides they are no baſe affections, they are commonly incident to youth and nobilitie: In like ſort, an officer reſpected by his prince, or any fauorite whoſoeuer, ought not repine, if he be deſcribed to be tealous, circumſpect, ambitious, a temporizer, carefull in his owne cauſes, and careleſſe of others, being qualities that do accompanie princes fauours: ſo as when I touch any one with ſuch like, no man of iudgement ought to greene more, then if I ſhoulde terme him cholericke or flegmatike, being certaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall qualities, as the humours and inclinations: Notwithſtanding when I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly note ſuch points as ſeeme blame woorthie, although they be publike and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet doe I ſuſpend my iudgement, attributing the faults to the emulation of courts, and the ambition of competitors: And ſuch as will not be ſatisfied with this exception ſhewe plainly they deſire to be flattered; but they ſtriue in vaine, for I eſteeme flatterie in a writer, to be like the ſinne of idolatrie. Some haue beene ſo ſenſible as to note for an exceſſe (ſpeaking of any officer) to ſate couertly, that men tranſported ſlander him with ſome ſecret action, to ſuch I can make no anſwer, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are not content that I tearme them paſsionate that blame others, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende ſurmiſes that I call in queſtion that which others affirme for certaine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing in a manner the accuſed.</p>
            <p>Others haue laboured to publiſh vnto the world, that in my relation touching the title of the realme, I haue ſhewed my ſelfe partiall for the Catholique king: To ſuch I can not ſay any thing, but wiſh them to be aduiſed, they accuſe not the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence as partiall, which depriued of life twentie ſucceſſors of that crowne, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceading the ſaide king. But I woulde haue theſe men to tell me if in this historie (where I coulde not alleage Bartoll nor Bald) I haue omitted any one point of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which hath beene alleaged by the pretendents, and haue not ſet euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon downe as their owne aduocats did plead it: Let them conſider if there be any thing omitted touching the repreſentation of the Dutcheſſe <hi>Katherine,</hi> of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of <hi>Rainucius Farneſe,</hi> of the precedence of <hi>Phillibert</hi> duke of Sauoy, in caſe that <hi>Henrie</hi> had out liued <hi>Philip,</hi> of the election the people pretended, of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie</hi> his grounds, and his pretended legitimation; and to conclude, if there were anything defectiue of that which Queene <hi>Katherine</hi> of Medicis alleaged against the eleuen kings of that realme: Now if all theſe reaſons which I haue ſo largely ſet downe, can not hinder the king of Spaine from being the eldeſt kinſeman, that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> left when he died, a male, and legitimate, what faulte is there in me? If men will not beleeue that <hi>Katherines</hi> prerogatiue by her father be of more vertue and efficacie then <hi>Philips</hi> owne right, and that the imperfection deriued from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth more preiudice the king, then that of the Dutcheſſe which remaines in her owne perſon, how can I helpe it? It is most manifest, that ſuch onely as are partiall
<pb facs="tcp:9072:4"/>
haue held me partiall in relating plainely, this title with the reſt, without giuing mine owne iudgement, and the rather for that they ſee ſuch as are indifferent, doe happily eſteeme it better then the reſt: I may not be more tedious in this reſpect, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it ſhall ſuffice for euerie man of a free iudgement to diſcerne mine innocencie, from the malice or ignorance of mine aduerſaries. But moreouer I entreate them that know me to be a writer not accustomed to lie, to conſider that I haue written to Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians in the Italian toong, who coulde not perfecty vnderſtande the ſubſtance of this historie, if I had giuen them leſſe knowledge of men whom they knew not: And to verifie this, let a Portugall writer in Italy deſcribe in his owne toong, vnto his owne countrimen the tumults of any of our cities, he ſhall well finde, (if he deſire to be vnderſtoode in Portugall) whether he may forbeare to ſpecifie much more then I haue done, of the humours of the head and principall members of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince whereof he writes. But if all this ſufficeth not to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me; I make God iudge of the ſinceritie of mine hart, and the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie I haue ſtrictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ortugall is a part of Spaine, lying vpon the furtheſt borders of the Ocean. It bordereth vpon the Eaſt with the kingdome of Caſtill, vpon the Weſt with the great Ocean, vpon the North with Gallicia, and towards the South with the Atlantike ſea and Andelouzia. The late writers haue deuided it into ſixe countries, which they call Comarques, that is, beyond the riuer of Tagus, Eſtremadura, betwixt Duero and Minies (and this with the countrie which ſtretcheth to Coimbra is the ancient Portugall) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the mountaines Beira, and Algarues, which laſt hath alſo the Title of a kingdome. It containes in circuit 850. miles, whereof 400. run along the Sea ſhore, the reſt is maine land, which maketh it in forme long and narrow: It hath in it eighteene cities, with many great villages and caſtles, in number aboue 470. Three of theſe cities haue Archbiſhopricks, Braga, Lisbone, and Euora: whereof the firſt is Lord both ſpirituall and temporall. Nine haue their Biſhopricks, Coimbra, Lamego, Viſco, Porto, Miranda, Portalegro, Guarda, Leiria and Eluas: the other fiue remaine without dignitie, and thoſe are Bragança, Tauira, Lagos, Faro and Silues: Theſe laſt fower be in the kingdome of Algarues, whereof one Biſhop hath the Title. It is watered with many riuers, whereof two are moſt famous, Tagus and Duero; the firſt runneth by the walles of Lisbone, and ſixe or ſeuen miles off diſchargeth it ſelfe into the Sea; the other doth the like by the citie of Porto, and two miles from thence falleth into the Ocean: from their mouthes vnto the citie they are no riuers, but as it were armes and boſomes of the Sea; and moſt aſſured and capable portes for many great ſhips which may ſaile farre vp againſt the ſtreame, but further in that of Lisbone then of the other, whereas many great veſſels paſſe fifteene or twentie miles vp beyonde the towne: beſides theſe two portes, twentie miles from Lisbone, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9072:8"/>
the South, is Settuual, which hath a ſmall Tower at the entrie thereof, with a port capable of many ſhips. And in Algarues is Taui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Lagos, and Villeneuue; theſe three are of reaſonable capacitie, the reſt are leſſe, with many pleaſant plaſhes. The ſeate of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is commodious for all partes of the world; being in the middeſt of many great kingdomes, fit for the ancient and later nauigations: For turning towards the Weſt, they diſcouer directly Gallicya, Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, Fraunce, England, Germanie, &amp; the other Northerne Regions. Before them lieth the Iſlands of Azores (otherwiſe called Terceres) the fortunate Iſlands, with the countries called the Weſt Indies. On the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lieth Andelouzia, &amp; the Streits of Gibraltar, by the which they enter into the Mediterranean Sea, for the Nauigation of Italie and Greece. And leauing the Streits coaſting Affrick, on the left hand they diſcouer many nations and new people, vnknowne to the auncient, who beleeued that the burning Zone was inhabitable: from which places many ſhips arriue at Lisbone with great riches, chieflie from the Eaſt Indies, the which the Portugalles themſelues (as we ſhall declare hereafter) conquered: beſides their traffiqne with the kingdome of Caſtile, which lieth behinde them.</p>

The aire is verie wholeſome and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; diſtant from the Equinoctiall nine and thirtie degrees; and with the ebbing and flowing of the ſalt water (which is great vpon that coaſt) there bloweth alwaies a temperate winde, which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh it. It is neither wholie plaine nor all mountaines, but deuided into fiue ſmall hilles, betwixt th'one and the other of theſe, the plaine extends vnto the Riuer. It hath beene walled, whereof ſome part continues to this day; but for that it hath beene ſince much augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that part without the walles exceedes the other in greatnes: There ſtands vpon an high hill a very ancient caſtell, which hath no other ſtrength in it but his height, nor any guard, but is reſerued as a priſon for noble men. At the mouth of Tagus, on the citie ſide, ſtands a Fortreſſe built after the neweſt manner, which they cal the rocke of Saint <hi>Iulian,</hi> made to defend the entrie of the Riuer. The fruite it bringeth foorth ſurpaſſeth all their neighbours in bountie: and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9072:9"/>
although it yeeldeth not corne ſufficient to feede them, yet haue they prouiſion daily out of Fraunce and Germanie. The whole Realme is at this preſent greatly inhabited, being repleniſhed with manie Noblemen and Gentlemen, and much building of ſhips, and veſſels for ſundrie Nauigations: Beſides the order of the knights of Saint <hi>Iaques</hi> and <hi>Alcantara,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Bennet,</hi> which they call <hi>d'Auis</hi> (of a place ſo named,) theſe carrie a red croſſe, and theſe a greene, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Knights of Caſtill) when as the Templers were ſuppreſſed, they did inſtitute another order with the ſame reuenewes; which they call the Knights of Chriſt, bearing a red croſſe, and in the midſt a white, the which are bound to goe to the warre againſt infidels, to whome Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, did ſince graunt libertie to marrie. And their Kings hauing encreaſed their reuenewes, a great part of their Nobilitie affected this order, although they haue many times receiued men baſe and vnworthie. A great part of this Realme was ſometimes vnited to the crowne of Caſtill, but in the yeere of our Lord one thouſand one hundreth and tenne, <hi>Alphons</hi> the ſixth being King, that part towards the north was ſeparated, giuing it in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for a certaine tribute, to <hi>Henrie</hi> nephew to the Earle of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, borne at Beſanſon, marrying <hi>Theraſie</hi> his baſtard daughter: for that comming out of Fraunce with <hi>Count Raimond</hi> of Tholouſe his vncle, who was after Earle of Gallicia; he went to the warres which the Caſtillians had againſt the Moores that poſſeſſed Spaine. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome deriue the originall of this <hi>Count Henrie</hi> from Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, others from Aragon, and from other places; yet this is the moſt approoued opinion: But it hapneth in the originall of Kings, as of great riuers, whoſe mouthes are knowne, but not their ſprings.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</note> Portugall was then obſcure, vntilled, poore, and reduced into ſtreight limits, yet <hi>Alphons Henry,</hi> ſonne vnto this firſt Earle, did greatly augment it by his valiant exploits, taking many places from the Moores by force, againſt whom hauing woone a great victorie, in a pitched battaile, he was proclaimed King by his ſoldiors, in a place called Campo d'Ourique, and following his victorie, woone Saint Arem and Lisbone, remaining peaceable Lord of the Realme; he had the title of King confirmed by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fourth, for a certaine ſmall tribute. Their firſt king which ſucceeded him, named <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the thirde, did no leſſe augment it by another meanes:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9072:9"/>
For hauing (before his comming to the Crowne) married with <hi>Matilda</hi> Counteſſe of Boloigne in Picardie, being now in poſſeſſion of the Realme, he put her away of his owne proper motion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, taking to wife <hi>Beatrice,</hi> baſtard daughter to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> the tenth King of Caſtill ſurnamed the wiſe, to haue in dowrie with her (as indeed he had) the kingdome of <hi>Algarues.</hi> So as their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits being extended as they be at this preſent, and the Moores ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, who kept them in martiall exerciſe, they began ſince to make war with the Kings of Caſtill, although their Dominions were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies greater then the Portugals; the which they did ſo often and with ſuch obſtinacie, that theſe nations all of one continent, iſſued from one ſtocke, &amp; of one language, were enflamed one againſt the other with ſo mortall a hatred, that it remaineth euen vntill this daie, but more with the Portugals then the Spaniards. And although theſe late warres did breede them more honor then profit; yet were they not without ſome vtilitie; for that this continuall exerciſe did maintaine them in diſcipline and keepe them from delights and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, capitall enimies to any State. Since which time they haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained idle, but (inured vnto war) wonne vnto themſelues ſome honour vnder <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, at the perſwaſion of <hi>Henry</hi> his ſonne, they laboured to take from the Moores certaine places in Affricke, the which ſucceeded happily. For in time they became Maiſters in Mauritania Tingitana of the townes of Ceute, Tanger and Arzilla, (and this is that auncient Zillia) and other places; which ſince they haue either loſt, or abandoned to the Moores (as they did Arzilla) being of great charge and ſmall profit. They onely maintained and defended the two firſt, and built towards the Weſt, Mazagon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeated at the mouth of <hi>Hercules</hi> ſtraites; for holding thoſe places the Moores ſhould not harbor ſo neere vnto Spaine, but they ſerue, as a buckler vnto that Prouince. By reaſon of theſe euents they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their hopes yet further, ſo as the Ilands of Madera, not farre diſtant, and the Terceres, lying from Liſhbone 850. miles, in the fortie degree of latitude (then vntilled and vninhabited) were by them diſcouered and peopled: And not yet content (eſpecially the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> who aſpiring to higher matters, though with leſſe hope then the effect which followed) they began (ſailing through the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean) to coaſt Affricke, ſearching new countries and nations: So as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9072:10"/>
running along that coaſt by the ſpace of many yeeres, they went on ſo far, that comming to the other Hemiſphere, they diſcouered all Ethiopia. And although <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the fifth of that name, and the twelfth King renewed the war againſt the Spaniard, yet did they not diſcontinue their nauigation, to their great good; but in the end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made peace with the catholique King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in the yeere of our Lord 1479. they had more leiſure to think of their new conqueſt. It is worth the obſeruing, that in capitulations then made, it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpecified, that the peace was concluded for a hundreth yeeres and one; naming alwaies a certaine for an vncertaine: But this prooued a propheſie: for it continued iuſt a hundreth yeeres &amp; one; for ſo much time paſſed from thoſe wars vnto this which I vndertake to write: if the words of the Treatie agree with the qualitie of the euent. The Realme was greatly ſtrengthened both with people and wealth, and ſince encreaſed more; when as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabell,</hi> King and Queene of Caſtill, in the yeere 1482. expelled the lewes out of their Dominions being then in great numbers: they agreed with <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond, ſucceſſor to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the fifth, and obtained li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie (paying eight duckats for euerie perſon) to enter into his countrey, vpon condition to depart at a certaine time prefixed, and that the King ſhould appoint them ſhipping to tranſport them. So as vpon thoſe conditions (which were not fully obſerued) there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred about 20000. families, and in euery one ten perſons at the leaſt: the time of their departure expired, and not performed, many remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſlaues; others either vnwilling to depart, or to looſe their goods were baptized, as the reſt had done that remayned in Caſtill. So as vnder the name of new Chriſtians, the greateſt part remayned in Portugall vnknowen; being vndiſtinguiſhed, and allyed for money with ſome Noblemen of the countrey; they laboured to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for citizens: And although (according vnto reaſon of State) this manner of peopling were not good, being of a nation different in blood and law, the which in multiplying might cauſe an important diuiſion, being many in number; yet brought it great profit to the Crowne. Since in the time of <hi>Emanuell</hi> the fourteenth King, who began to raigne in the yeere 1495. they continued their new naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, with greater feruencie, and more quiet: For the Caſtillians being growen mightier by meanes of the forces annexed to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9072:10"/>
Crowne, and hauing by new alliances drawen vnto them the loue of the Portugales, the one durſt no more contend, &amp; the other ſuffered them to liue in peace. His predeceſſors hauing many yeeres coaſted along Affricke, they built a fort at Argin; tooke the Iſlands of Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, which now are called Cape-Vert; fortifyed the Caſtle of Saint <hi>George</hi> in Ethiopia, which they call Mina; diſcouered the Princes Iſland, and that of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> which lyeth perpendicularly vnder the Equinoctiall, with certaine ſmal Ilands thereabouts, they became Lords ouer all. And paſſing further, they entred into league with the Realmes of Congo, and Angolla, all Moores; hauing paſſed the great Cape of<note n="*" place="margin">Of good hope.</note> 
                  <hi>Buena Eſperança,</hi> and the Iſland of Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> right againſt it vpon the mayne land they became Lords of Soffolla, Mozambique, and Melynde: where according to the humours and qualitie of the people; they had won ſome by loue, &amp; ſome by force, although for the moſt part where they ſet footing, they preuailed by Armes. In the time of the ſaid <hi>Emanuell</hi> they paſſed the mouth of the red ſea, traffiquing at Socotra, &amp; Calahiate, they did run through the Perſian gulph, and (hauing paſſed the mouth of the riuer Indus) they entred into India, where firſt by traffique, &amp; after by force, they landed at Calecut, Cochin, and other places thereabouts; but more ſtrongly then in any other place vnder the conduct of <hi>Alphonſo Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buquerque,</hi> a famous captaine at Goa, a ſmall Iland in the Realme of Accen, neere vnto the countrey of Idalcan, the which is now a citie with an Archbiſhopricke, chiefe of that State, where the Vizeroy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his ordinarie aboad. They haue gone along all that coaſt buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſmall fortreſſes, and hauing turned backe to the mouth of the ſaid gulph, they are become Maiſters of the Ile of Ormus; and along that coaſt haue conquered the cities of Chaul, Damane, Bazain, and Diu. Vpon the point of the coaſt of Mallabar (which they call the Cape of Comery) turning towards the gulph of Gangis, they haue traffique, and fortreſſes in the Ile of Zeilan, which ſome take to bee the ancient Taprobana, where groweth the beſt Cinnamom. And hauing paſſed the ſaid gulph towards the Eaſt, &amp; the mouth of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis, they diſcouered the other coaſt, at the point whereof (which the ancient call the golden Cherſoneſſe) they became Lords of the towne of Malaca, fiue and twentie miles from the great Iland of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra (held alſo of ſome for Taprobana.) And paſſing on further,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9072:11"/>
not onely by their traffique, in the Realme of Pegu, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries vpon the firme lande; but alſo by their nauigation, they haue diſcouered the greater and leſſer Iaua, the kingdome of China, the great ſea of the Iſles of the Molucques, from whence come all the Cloues and Nutmegs, with many other drugs, the Ile of Iappon: To conclude, they haue ſayled on ſo far as they haue met in thoſe quarters with the Caſtillians that came to the Conqueſt of the Weſt Indies, diſcouered by <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> a Geneuoys, in the name of the Kings of Caſtill. Of late daies ſome by theſe two naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations haue compaſſed the whole world, and ioyned Eaſt to Weſt: They haue alſo in the time of Emanuell conquered (oppoſite to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, and to the Cape of<note n="*" place="margin">Of good hope.</note> 
                  <hi>Buena eſperança)</hi> the prouince which they cal S. a Croix, commonly called Brazill, ioyning to Peru, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning 1500. miles in length, yet ſtretcheth it not far into the maine land: they haue deuided it into eight parts, which they call Captaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and haue in a manner giuen it to thoſe that haue conquered it, reſeruing to the King the greateſt part of the iuriſdiction. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for a time it did ſeeme of ſmall profit, ſo as the criminall Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Portugall did, and doe yet ſtill, confine and baniſh thither theeues, murtherers, and ſuch like malefactors; yet being fertile, it is greatly inhabited, ſo as at this day there are great dwellings and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie buildings for ſugars. The principall townes be the Bay of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaints and Pernanbuc: All theſe countries of new conqueſt (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue made mention) are rich, and of great importance, from thence commeth yeerely (as we haue ſaid) into Portugall, ſhips laden with ſugars, ſpice, drugs, ſtones, with many other precious things and of great value. And to ſay the truth, this nation is woorthie of great praiſe; that hauing but a ſmall and barren countrey, they haue made themſelues equall (by the good inſtitutions, frugalitie, and vertue of ſome of their Kings) not onely to all the kingdomes of Spaine: but haue gloriouſly maintained war againſt Caſtil, a Realme far more rich and mightie, then that of Portugall, and their other neighbours. They haue ſhewed the like vertue, nay rather greater, far from home, as well in Affricke, as at the Indies, hauing not onely perfourmed ſo woonderfull a nauigation, as was held in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the wiſeſt to be raſh and fooliſh; but alſo giuen ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of their Armes in thoſe parts, that the writers hold many of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9072:11"/>
their deeds to be miraculouſly performed, by reaſon of the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie wherewith they were attempted, hauing ſhewed themſelues in fight at ſea, and defending of forts, more valiant than in any thing elſe. And beſides the conqueſt of ſo great an empire, in ſo long and large a ſea, as we haue written; it hath cauſed an other good of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance for Chriſtian religion; the which is now planted in all thoſe countries: So as whole Realmes which were Idolatrous, are now obedient to the Apoſtolique Sea (to the great commendation of the Ieſuits, whom in that countrey they call Apoſtles) who haue and doe ſtill maintaine a ſpirituall war. Notwithſtanding the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals who for the ſpace of 460. yeeres had beene buſied in theſe glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts, who had planted their croſſes in the fartheſt bounds of the Eaſt, whereas the name of Chriſt was not yet knowen, they haue not ſince followed the ſteps begunne, but contented with the weake borders of the Indian ſeas, they haue not pearſt into the maine lande, but (corrupted with the pleaſures of the people, and inriched with the traffique of marchandize) they haue beene content to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their gettings, not acknowledging the benefite of the giuer of graces: and hauing conuerted the militarie reuenewes of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries into pleaſures, they became idle and vaine; attributing to themſelues the honors and ceremonies which faithfull Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue vnto God: they liued long in this eſtate, yet in good opinion of the worlde. This corruption and weakenes of the Realme brought in by the delights of Aſia, was in the education of king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> diſcouered, and reiected by the Ieſuits, who as religious men, deſired and laboured much to reforme it: But they applied not fit medicines for ſo languiſhing a body, not conſidering the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſodainly to reclaime a whole people alreadie corrupted with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, to the extreame rigor and ſparingnes of theſe Fathers. A hard matter to performe not onely in a kingdome, but alſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of their monaſteries: Whereupon they made ſumptuarie lawes, and eſpecially vpon victuals; which the auncient Spartaines coulde hardly haue tolerated: They did ſpecifie what meates were allowed, and what defended, diſtinguiſhed wherein euerie man ſhould imploy his money, taking from them in a manner all that came from forraine countries, were they for profite or pleaſure.

                  <note place="margin">The life of king Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> The afflictions of this Realme tooke their beginning in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yeere of the age of <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> who (borne after the death of his father, &amp; a little before the deceaſe of his grandfather) (by entreaties, and to the fatall ruine of his ſubiects) ſtrong of body, and of a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious minde, full of ouerweening, (the which is a naturall vice in Portugals, not content with his owne dominions) reſolued (as it were by force) to alter the quiet, which his Realme had ſo long enioyed. And although it ſeemed hard of execution, being inuironed with the territories of <hi>Phillip</hi> of Auſtria King of Spaine, his deare friend and kinſman, more mightie than himſelfe, with whom he might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, nor paſſe by land into any other countrey. But as it is eaſie to periſh for him that is deſperate, he let him vnderſtande the exceſſiue deſire he had to ruine himſelfe &amp; all his. He had firſt plotted a warre againſt the Indians, which his kinſmen and ſubiects woulde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto. But as there was ſome difficultie wholie to withdrawe the yoong Prince (who had a warlike ſpirite) from this enterpriſe, ſuch as were neere about him laboured to diuerte him by meanes of an other which they laide before him; turning all his reſolutions vpon Affrick to indomage the Moores which liue in that part which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mauritania Tingitana, whereas the Portugals maintaine (to their great charge) vpon the borders of the Sea, thoſe three forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fortreſſes, Ceute, Tanger, and Mazagon, the buckler and key of Spaine; by which the Moores haue heeretofore conquered it. But this diuerſion whereunto they perſwaded the King, was cauſe of great ruines, proceeding from want of iudgement; for although it

were hard wholie to diſſwade him from the enterpriſe of the Indies, and therefore conuenient to repreſent vnto him ſome other action; yet ſhoulde they aduiſedly haue foreſeene, not to drawe him from one miſchiefe to thruſt him into a greater. But theſe men diuerted him from an enterpriſe farre off, and of hard execution, by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto him a neerer, eaſier to effect, but more perillous. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſurmized he would not haue vndertaken it but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, yet ſhoulde they not haue giuen too much confidence to his yoong age, for the which the Ieſuits were greatly blamed, who hauing planted their religion in this Realme more then in any other of the worlde, and with more zeale, as enimies to the enimies of God, they did encourage this yoong Prince (whom Queene <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> had giuen to them in charge) to this enterpriſe with carefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the which as then they might eaſily effect: But finding the King ſoone after readie to execute it with raſhnes, they had no more the credite to diuert him being in diſgrace. So as this yoonge King bred vp amongſt women, religious perſons, delights and pleaſures, had a more bould and warlike ſpirite, then if he had beene borne and nouriſhed in the middeſt of armies.

This inclination (wherein the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens had ſome part) was not gainſaid by any of his chiefe Counſell, nor kinſmen of riper age, who might haue diſſwaded him, and drawn him to haue enioyed his Realme: For although the action ſeemed raſh, yet ambition and feare of the Kings diſgrace were of ſuch force, that the Nobles, Magiſtrates, and great perſons (who might haue forced him) durſt not open their mouthes, nor oppoſe themſelues againſt his will: and if any one did mutter or ſpeake to the contrary, they were men of baſe qualitie, and not admitted.</p>

For <hi>Martin Gonzales de Camera</hi> his competitour, hauing ſucceeded him in his offices, with ſome other depending of the Ieſuites, whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall ſought to bring in, they had no leſſe conflict with their enimies then <hi>Peter</hi> had with his, for that <hi>Aluaro de Caſtro</hi> fauorite to the king,

of a contrarie faction, with ſome of his friendes (deſiring ſecretly to withdraw the Kings affection from <hi>Martin</hi> and his partie) tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to effect it, when as the King was at Cape Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> whether he went in Sommer to ſatisfie the deſire he had to go to ſea, making him beleeue (and it may be not without cauſe) that <hi>Martin</hi> and the fathers (as men ignorant in matters of State, &amp; of the wealth of Princes) had waſted the treaſure of the Crowne, and cut off the meanes, for all ſuch enterprizes as he might execute, by their lawes made vpon the changes of money: the which if they did not reuoke, it were impoſſible to effect his glorious deſignes. This was a deadly blowe; yet did they adde one more of greater moment, giuing the King to vnderſtande (being yoong and high minded) that he was oppreſſed by them, that they ruled in effect, and he in ſhew; and they paſſed on ſo farre, that they cauſed a Secretarie of the chamber well fauoured of the King, and a great talker, (preſenting him one day with a commandement of ſmall importance to ſigne) to ſay vnto him that he might boldly ſubſcribe it, for that hee was king vntill he ſhoulde returne to Lisbone: ſo as mingling ſport with truth, they drew this yoong Prince from the affection he bare to the miniſters which had beene giuen him by the Queene and Cardinall, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the doctrine wherein he had beene nouriſhed.

And although his cunning did ſomewhat aſſiſt

               <p>Long time before there died in Affrick <hi>Mulei Mahamet Cheriffe,</hi> he who had vnited the Kingdome of Feez, Marroc and Turedant, the which he had alwais poſſeſſed, deuided with his brother <hi>Mulei Hamet:</hi> It ſeemes that theſe (whiles they liued quietly togither) made a law, that al the children that ſuruiued after their deceaſe, ſhould ſucceed in the kingdome before any one of the nephewes ſhould enioy the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; ſo as to the yongeſt vncle ſhould ſucceed the eldeſt nephew: yet after their deceaſe, although they left many children, the greateſt part thereof (euen as it hapned vnto their fathers) died by the ſword, or were ſtrangled in priſon, for the iealouſie of State, by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Abdala,</hi> one of the ſonnes of <hi>Mahamet,</hi> who ſucceeded his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; raigned xvij. yeres, the moſt happie &amp; peaceable Prince that euer that countrey enioied. This man although he were cruel, yet did he refraine from murthering his three brethren; it may be for that they were very children, when he came to the ſucceſſion; but gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing to more yeeres, they fell to diſtruſt him: ſo as two of them fled to the Turke; the thirde tooke his way by lande and went to liue amongſt the Arabians. And although the lawe had decreed that the next brother ſhoulde ſucceed to the Crowne, yet <hi>Abdala</hi> reſolued to ſweare his eldeſt ſonne <hi>Mahamet</hi> his ſucceſſour, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſodainly this newe Prince practiſed againſt his vncles, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Moore to Tremiſenne to kill the eldeſt, who was deteined by the Turkes, the which he did effect; wounding him with a dart in the <hi>Mezquita.</hi> This act did greatly trouble the other brother <hi>Mulei Moluc,</hi> yoong and of great hope, who (remaining at <hi>Algier)</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuccours in vaine from <hi>Philip</hi> King of Spaine, by the meanes of <hi>Rodorike Alphonſo Pimentel,</hi> Earle of Benauent, then Viceroy of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia; he reſolued to goe ſeeke it at Conſtantinople, where he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended long with patience; exclaiming againſt his kindred, and not obtaining that which he demaunded, till in the end (hauing giuen an honorable teſtimonie of himſelfe in the laſt ſea fight at Nauarin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the armies of the league and Turke, and at the taking of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette) he obtained three thouſand ſouldiers of the Turke for this conqueſt; vpon certaine conditions that were not obſerued. With theſe forces and his Moores that followed him, which wanted not in

Affrick, he entred his Nephewes kingdome (for his brother was now dead) and defeated three armies, whereof the laſt (which ſeemes woonderfull) conſiſted of threeſcore thouſand horſe, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foote, and tooke abſolute poſſeſſion of the Realmes, liuing with great reputation both of the Moores and Chriſtians. <hi>Mulei Mahamet</hi> being in this manner expelled his countrey, he fled to Pignon of Velay, a fortreſſe which the Catholique king holdes in Affrick, and from thence by the counſell (as they ſay) of a <hi>Renegado,</hi> he ſent his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to the ſaid King, letting him vnderſtand of his diſgrace, and crauing aide to be reſtored to his eſtate. Whereunto the Catholique King hauing made no anſwere conformable to the deſires of the Moore, being gone to Ceuta, he did the like office with King <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> ſhewing vnto him, that by this occaſion he ſhoulde eaſilie make himſelfe Emperour of Marocco. The yoong Prince fedde with this vaine hope, ſeemed nowe to haue a lawfull ſubiect to make warre, whereon he reſolued, and to ſuccour the Moore <hi>Mahamet.</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded this to his Counſell, laboring to proue that it was both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and honorable, whereunto (although there were ſome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie aduiſe, laying before him that he was without heires, that Chriſtians ſhoulde rather imploy their armes againſt heretikes then Infidels, that his forces alone were too feeble for ſo great an action, ſtrengthning their reaſons with many examples: notwithſtanding as Princes blinded with their owne deſires, will not allow the miſhaps and diſgraces of an other, iſſuing from their ill meaſured Counſell, to ſerue them as examples of better aduiſe, there was neither reaſon nor example could preuaile againſt the Kings opinion, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in his reſolution by many (who either for their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or for want of iudgement) did counſell him to warre, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>

He deſired greatly to marrie, to haue iſſue (although his Phiſicions feared much he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for generation) and woulde willingly haue taken one of the daughters of the Catholique King, whereof they had giuen him an

aſſured hope: for theſe two cauſes he deſired to enter parle with him, ſending <hi>Peter D' Alcaſoua</hi> as Embaſſadour vnto him, with comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to treat of three points, that is, for aide in the action of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick; for the marriage of his daughter, and for an enteruiew. The Embaſſador departed, and effected with great diligence the charge his maiſter had giuen him: and hauing attended ſome time in this court, he obtained all three, the promiſe of marriage with one of his daughters, when ſhe ſhoulde come to yeeres, for as yet they were too yoong; That the Catholique King ſhould goe to Guadalupa to meete with King <hi>Sebaſtian:</hi> And as for ſuccours he ſhoulde furniſh men &amp; galleies, to vndertake the enterprize of Alarache, the which was ſpoken very coldly. For the Catholique King knowing the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals to preſume beyond their ſtrength, and holding it nothing ſafe to vndertake this action of Affrick without great forces, he laboured what he could by letters to temper this heate, diſſwading him with many reaſons (if not from the enterprize) at the leaſt not to go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in perſon: but this yoong Prince reſting immooueable in his counſels, and moſt obſtinate in his opinion, did ſtill importune him by letters. <hi>Phillip</hi> confirmed the ſuccours of men and galleis, ſo as the Turke ſhould ſende no men into Italy, and that they ſhoulde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake Alarache in the yeere 1577. the whole being referred vnto their enteruiew at Guadalupa. The Embaſſadour returnes home more fauoured then euer, ſeeming to haue effected more then was thought or looked for: In both Courts they make no great delaies, but take their way for Guadalupa, where both kings arriue with no great traines, but with the chiefe Noblemen and Gentlemen of their Realmes: There the Portugals (who arriued laſt) were receiued with great ſhewes of loue, finding in all places of Caſtill, where they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the kings expreſſe commandement to receiue him of Portugall as his owne proper perſon, ſo as at Badagios and in other places, where he paſt, the chiefe men went to meete him, the priſons were opened, and he conducted to his lodging vnder a cloth of eſtate. The Catholique King tooke great pleaſure to ſee yoong <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> whom he entertained as his hoſt, laying aſide all tearms fitte for a greater King, entreating each other equally in maieſtie, talking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the warre, being both profitable and honorable for the Realmes of Spaine. The Catholique King did not diſſwade him, yet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9072:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he aduiſed him not to goe in perſon, excuſing himſelfe that he could giue no great ſuccour, by reaſon of the continuall charge he was put to in Italy to reſiſt the Turke: but <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being fully reſolued to goe, and admitting no excuſe, <hi>Phillip deſirous</hi> to pleaſe him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him in this ſort.

                  <note place="margin">Preparation for the war of Affrick.</note> In Portugall they made ſlowe preparatiues to warre, and in the firſt beginning their money failed them, for that the reuenewes of the Crowne are ſmall, and ill imploied. The whole Realme vpon the maine land yeelding but a million, and one hundreth thouſand duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets a yeere: The greateſt part in cuſtomes (the which be vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) paying for all things twentie in the hundreth except fiſh, which paieth the one halfe.

Of theſe two millions and a hundreth thouſand duckats, there remaines nothing at the yeeres end in Court, and if the King vſe any liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, his charge exceeds the reuenewes; for that they receiue without order, and ſpende without meaſure: For theſe Kings were neuer ſo happie as to be ſerued with men of iudgement, and diſcretion, who could order the reuenewes and expences; but giuing the charge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vnto Noblemen, who were aduanced thereunto by fauour, and not by merite, (an ordinarie cuſtome in that countrey) they ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to maintaine themſelues in that throne by other meanes, letting the reuenewes of the Crowne goe as it woulde. So as what in wages of officers, rents, created, recompence for life, priuiledges (which

They went therefore ſeeking heere and there for money, forcing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to contribute, and the chiefe Citizens extraordinarily: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they gathered much by this meanes, yet they did drawe vpon them the curſes and exclamations of the people, <q>being moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and obedient to their King; but nothing preuailed againſt the burning deſire of officers.</q> They exacted from the Clergie the thirde part of their reuenewes, whereunto they would not yeeld: yet ſeeing the Pope yeelded vnto the Kings affections, they granted a hundreth and fiftie thouſand duckats. They granted vnto the new Chriſtians paying two hundreth &amp; fiue &amp; twentie thouſand duckats (that which before had been for a time granted &amp; often ſince denied) that for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the Inquiſition they ſhoulde not looſe their goods as they did. They impoſed a newe cuſtome vpon the ſalt, and exacted money from the Nobilitie, and Gentlemen of the Realme, againſt their auncient cuſtomes; many being by this meanes vniuſtly vexed. Amongſt other Noblemen, the King ſent to <hi>Frauncis de Melo,</hi> Earle of Tentuguel, who excuſing himſelfe, did write vnto the King, with greater libertie then poſſiblie reaſon woulde allowe: For noting greatly the demand of money, which they had made vnto him, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, he ſaid, it agreed not with the vertues with which his highnes was indued; neither did it ſeeme reaſonable, that they whoſe fathers had beene helpers to conquer the Realme, ſhoulde be ſubiect to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and tributes, which are paid for the warres, where of many of meaner qualitie were exempt. He laide the blame of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands vpon the ſinnes of the Realme, but much more vpon ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites as the King had about him, of whom he complained; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the example of that fatall chaunce, which hapned at Tanger, to <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſonnes to King <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, ſeeking to make warres againſt the Moores at the peoples charge, who ought in reaſon to pay rather then Gentlemen: inferring thereby that hee could attend no better ſucceſſe of the action the King now tooke in hand, being at their charge, who had neuer contributed, although the Realme by reaſon of warres had beene ſeene in greater neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then at that preſent, he concluded (beſeeching the King to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der better what he did, and to imitate the example of his aunceſtors,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9072:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not to leaue a woorſe of himſelfe to his ſucceſſors.) This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the King read with diſdaine, freed the Earle and many others from the contribution of money, ſeeking by other meanes (but chiefly by the bloud of the poore) to ſupplie their wants. And to the end there might be greater plentie of money within the Realme, he commanded that the Royals of Caſtill, which before were defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhould be now currant, valuing them a ninth part more then they were accuſtomed, which many noted as ominous. The King began now to draw his men oftner to fielde, putting them into ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, to come to encounters, and to counterfaite all that which is acted in warre, where he himſelfe was often preſent, in danger of his perſon, in the midſt of their harquebuzes, yet had he neither Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nor Sergeant that could inſtruct them, onely one <hi>Iohn de Gama,</hi> who in the habite of an Hermit, became a great maſter of the warre. So as notwithſtanding the great paine they tooke in this exerciſe in manner forced, hauing neuer ſeene any thing, they remained more ignorant then at the beginning. The King gaue himſelfe much to hunting, accounting it a glory to encounter with the moſt furious beaſts, wherein he grew very expert: If he went (as he did often) for pleaſure from one place to another, either by ſea, or vpon the riuer of Tagus, he thought it a ſhame to go in calme weather, but ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome ſtorme whereby it ſeemed that ſome furious deſtinie lead him headlong to his end. But in the meane ſpace time ſteales away, neceſſarie prouiſions want, and all things proceed ſlowly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They muſt prouide money in Italy, to leuie the Italian foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to pay the Germaines: but the Pepper whereby it ſhoulde be raiſed, was come but that ſommer to Lisbone, from whence it ſhould be ſent by the merchants ſhips to Liuorno, there to be ſolde. This enterprize, the which (for that they ſought to do it with little money, we may tearme vndiſcreet) was now almoſt made impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Peter D'Alcaſoua</hi> (who was Chamberlaine, and had charge of the treaſure) durſt not diſcouer the defects vnto the King, fearing his diſpleaſure, if he ſhould now contradict that which before he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: He did ſtill temporize with hope, that the Catholique King ſhoulde excuſe himſelfe from furniſhing the men, whereunto he was bound, vpon colour of ſending an armie into Italy againſt the Turks, or for ſome other pretext, the which he greatly deſired, that the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9072:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole blame might fall vpon <hi>Phillip:</hi> neither was he without hope, for the exceptions vnder which he had promiſed, made him beleeue that which fell out otherwiſe. In the meane time <hi>Mulei Moluck</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theſe preparatiues, fearing the Catholique king ſhould ioyne with the Portugals, ſent wiſely vnto him to will him aduiſe what part of his Territories he pleaſed to haue, the which he would giue to be his friend and confederate. The King preſently let <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his offer, aduiſing that it were a matter of conſequence to keepe the Moore in hope and to ſend vnto him to expound his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the which muſt needs be profitable, ſeeing that practizes are no ſuſpenſions of armes, whereof there might grow ſome good effect; for poſſiblie the Moore would neglect his defence, or yeeld that quietly which they pretended to take from him by force: but this yoong King, who knew not how much better an aſſured peace were, then an expected victorie, and who deſired rather to winne by force, then by agreement any place whatſoeuer, preſſed the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King not to treat any accord with <hi>Moluck.</hi> But <hi>Phillip</hi> knowing <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> deſignes ſeeing him neither willing to accord, nor able to perfourme the enterpriſe, the which was likely to be broken, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to effect it himſelfe; and ſeeing ſommer now come, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Italian nor Germaine ſouldiers in Portugall, he made offer vnto him by <hi>Iohn de Sylua</hi> his Embaſſadour, that if he were not prepared for the enterpriſe as it was conuenient, he woulde furniſh both men and ſhipping, ſo as he ſhould pay the two thirdes of the charges, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Treatie. But foraſmuch as this offer was farre off from the marke, whereat the King of Portugall ſhot, it was neither heard nor accepted. And although the ſeaſon of the yeare was now farre paſſed, and the preparatiues weake, (matters being concealed from <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> who was abuſed by his miniſters) yet he feared nothing, but that <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhould excuſe himſelfe, and not keepe promiſe on his behalfe, which ſhould make him vnable to performe the enterpriſe, whereof he was ſo deſirous; ſo as he laboured to obtaine of him an aſſured promiſe of aide, without exception of the comming of the Turkes army, the which he ſecretly feared, and his miniſters greatly hoped for, ſo were their mindes diſtracted. The Catholique King being aduertiſed heereof, ſeeming vnto him impoſſible to do any thing that were good, either to ſatisfie, or to withdraw himſelfe from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9072:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the promiſe that he made, left it to the iudgement of his Embaſſador, to make offer vnto the King of the fifty galleis lent, &amp; the fiue thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d foote, to be preſently imploied (if neede were) according to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but he ſhould haue a ſpeciall care not offer them, if he did ſee any impoſſibilitie to imploie them, being vnwilling to hazard his forces alone without ſuch as the King of Portugall was bound to leuie: Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this offer which the Embaſſador had made, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being come to himſelfe, and caſting vp his reckonings, he found himſelfe vnable that yeere to paſſe into Affrick, by reaſon whereof he cauſed proclamation to be made, that the enterpriſe ſhould be deferred vntill the next yere: <hi>Phillip</hi> a little before (being mooued with the practiſes of this warre,) had ſent Captaine <hi>Frauncis D'Aldana</hi> diguiſed into Affrick to viewe the townes and fortreſſes vpon the ſea coaſt, who (being in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) returned. This man he ſent to <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> who receiuing many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, he informed him particularly of the ſtate of Affrick: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Aldana</hi> made the enterpriſe more difficult then he ſuppoſed, yet could he no way diſcourage him; but laying aſide that diſcourſe, he inquired ſecretly of him (as of an expert ſouldiour) of many things touching the gouernment of Armies, wherein <hi>Aldana</hi> did amply ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him. The King now beleeuing he ſhould be well able to execute all he vnderſtood, not knowing the difference betwixt ſaying and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the winter come, he gaue <hi>Aldana</hi> leaue to depart, honouring him with a chaine of gold, of one thouſand duckats, making him promiſe to returne when he ſhould need his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>In this meane time for the yeere following <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> (by the meanes of <hi>Gomez de Sylua,</hi> his Embaſſadour at Rome) treated with the great Duke of Tuſcane, to leuie in his Territories three or fower thouſande foote, accepting in part the offer which the great Duke had made vnto him, not long before by his Embaſſadors, but the effect followed not. He ſent likewiſe <hi>Sebaſtian de Coſta</hi> into Flaunders to <hi>VVilliam</hi> of <hi>Naſsau</hi> Prince of Orange (who being choſen head of the Flemmings againſt the Catholique King, commanded in thoſe parts) entreating him to aſſiſt him with three of fower thouſand Germaines: He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpatched fower coronels throughout his Realme of Portugall, to leuie twelue thouſand foote; and thoſe were <hi>Michael de Norogna, Iames Lopez de Sequeira, Frauncis de Tauora,</hi> and <hi>Vaſco de Silueira,</hi> the which had neuer beene at the warres. He aſſembled ſome Spaniards
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9072:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which came at the brute of warres, and of this voyage, whereof he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a good number, without the conſent of <hi>Philip,</hi> and in Caſtill it ſelfe without any noiſe of drum he enrolled many ſouldiers for this warre, which cauſed <hi>Philip</hi> to puniſh ſome Captaines afterwardes: But notwithſtanding all theſe goodly ſhewes, no man beleeued it woulde take effect, for beſides they did eſteeme the Kings forces, too feeble to attempt any warre, much more beyond the ſea, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the charge woulde be greater) they did conceiue that when the Catholique King, the Cardinall <hi>Henry,</hi> Queene Katherine, and the people, ſhould ſee all lets taken away, they would not ſuffer the King to go in perſon, which made euery man ſuppoſe that after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of much mony, it would vaniſh to nothing, as it had hapned the laſt yeere, and ſome yeeres before, with the armie of <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings vncle, prepared for the ſame Countries of Affrick, and ſome other enterpriſes. But foraſmuch as we can hardly reſiſt the diuine powers, it ſeemed that all things did ſecond the effect of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: the Queene (a Ladie of bountie and great value) who as well for the loue ſhe bare vnto the King, being bred in her boſome; as to content <hi>Philip</hi> her nephew, who was the ſonne of her brother, did vehemently diſſwade this enterpriſe, ſhe died. The Pope foraſmuch as this warre was attempted againſt Infidels, giuing ſuccours in time of need, opened his ſpirituall treaſures, granting the Bull of the <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſada,</hi> which till that time was not brought into the Realme. The ſhips of the Indies returned home to a ſafe Port very rich. The Prince of Orange although he were ſufficiently buſied in the low Countries, yet ſhewing how little he eſteemed the forces of the Catholique King, graunted out of his troupes the three thouſand foote, which were demaunded; ſo as all things ſeemed to yeeld vnto the Kings wil. All that time which was the ninth of Nouember, there appeered in the Zodiaque, in the ſigne of <hi>Libra,</hi> neere vnto the ſtation of <hi>Mars,</hi> the goodlieſt &amp; greateſt Comet, that hath beene ſeene in many ages, the which happening in the progreſſe of this war, amazed many, who looking to examples paſt, ſaid it was a ſigne of vnhappy ſucceſſe, and that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from a corrupt aire, it did endomage the delicat bodies of Princes. And for as much as the auncient Captaines with their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, did interpret it to good, not for that they beleeued it, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their ſouldiers: the Portugall likewiſe taking it for a fauour
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9072:18"/>
ſaid, that this Comet ſpake vnto the King, ſaying, <hi>Accometa,</hi> which is to ſay in the Portugall toong: let him aſſayle them, not hauing any ſuch beliefe, but for flatterie, fearing more the Kings choler, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his rough inclination, then the heauens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> at that time by a certaine treatie of peace had pacified the war of the Low-Countries, where <hi>Don Iohn de Auſtria</hi> his baſtard bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was gouernour, who ſeeming not abſolute Maſter of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Prince of Orange his aduerſarie not well ſatisfied, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rather to be Lord of all, then gouernor of a part, they began new practizes againſt the conuentions agreed on. And <hi>Don Iohns</hi> letters being ſurpriſed, (the which he had written into Spaine,) by the Lords of the countrey they diſcouered, that vpon the Princes fortifying of ſome places in Holland, he had an other intention then he made ſhew of, who finding his letters ſurpriſed and his purpoſes laid open, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (as he ſaid) to ſubdue them by armes, he thought it not ſafe to remaine vnarmed in thoſe parts: So as one day ſeeming to goe take the aire, he retired himſelfe to Namur, vpon the frontire of Flanders, towards Lorraine, with his greateſt fauorites, and there diſcouering his minde, and diſmiſſing ſuch as he truſted not, he ſuddenly called backe the Spaniſh foot (the which according to the Articles of peace) were departed, and ſcarſe arriued in Italie; and hauing made a newe leuie of Wallons and Germaines, the warre began in thoſe parts more cruell then before, and with greater diſaduantage for the King: for that in the conformitie of the treatie of pacification, they had left all the fortreſſes in the hands of the Flemmings. By reaſon of theſe new broiles, &amp; for that the war of Affrick was deferred a yeere more then was agreed on, the Catholike King framed an excuſe to denie his promiſed ſuccours to the King of Portugall, ſhewing that it behooued him to prouide in Flanders for his honour, and the ſafety of his brother; hoping by this meanes to diuert him from the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, but it preuailed nothing: for the other being raſh, reſolued in any ſort to vndertake it, whether he had his expected ſuccours or not, thinking (being yoong) with his owne forces and the Italians and Germanes which hee attended, to bee able to conquer the worlde. This reſolution diſpleaſed <hi>Philip</hi> and did much afflict him, for being vnable to aſſiſt him, he feared that without his aide the day would be perillous, and ſeeing the danger increaſe, he continued theſe good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9072:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
offices with more vehemencie, either to breake off the enterpriſe, or at leaſt to diſſwade him from going in perſon: whereupon he did write many letters of his owne hand full of loue; he cauſed the Duke of Alua to write vnto him, and in the end ſent the Duke of Medina Celi (one of the greateſt in Spaine) to doe his laſt endeuour to diuert him; but all was in vaine, he would attempt it at his owne coſt, although the Catholike King ſent him not one ſouldier. And for as much as good deedes are often taken in ill part, ſome ſaide that all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of King <hi>Philip</hi> were but cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit, &amp; that he wiſhed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> ſhould go, for howſoeuer it ſhould ſucceed, he ſhould receiue a benefit thereby: if it happened he ſhould take <hi>Allarache</hi> or any place vpon the coaſt, it were more aduantage to <hi>Philip</hi> then to him, hauing his Dominions fronting neerer to Affricke then the other; but if he ſhould happen to die in theſe wars, a greater good ſhould come vnto him, being heire vnto the Realme. But to ſay the truth, <hi>Philip</hi> was mooued to doe this office towards <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> both of his owne quiet diſpoſition (beeing no friend to broyles) as alſo for another priuate ſubiect, of no ſmall importance, which was: At that time the Treatie of Truce was reuiued betwixt him and the Turke, whereunto both were mooued for one and the ſelfe ſame reſpect, not to diuide their forces at ſuch time as they had moſt need of them to be vnited; the Turke againſt the Sophi, and the King againſt the Rebles in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: So as without infringing this Truce, the Catholike King could not ſend any Armie to endomage Affricke, being tributarie to the Turke, and eſpecially of <hi>Mulei Moluc</hi> his friend and confederate. And this excuſe was ſo much the more tolerable, for that he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to comprehend the King of Portugall within this truce, deſiring him to enter into it, but he not onely refuſed it, but alſo anſwered, That he maruelled he would treat a peace for three yeeres with the Turke, to auoide war during that tearme in Italy, being moſt aſſured that Affrick ſhould be repleniſhed with Turkes, and the three yeeres expired, he ſhould haue that war in Spaine, which now he ſought to auoide in Italy: He did aduiſe him not to conclude; or if he would needes, not to comprehend him, to the end he might afterwards ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly aſſiſt him againſt <hi>Mulei Moluc:</hi> by meanes whereof with ſmall charge he might aſſure himſelfe of Italy by the truce, and of Affricke by war in the name of the Portugals. <hi>Philip</hi> diſallowed of theſe friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9072:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reaſons, ſolliciting <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> to reſolue himſelfe either to enter or be excluded: After ſome delaies he was contented to bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended therein. But as theſe Treaties were in handling, he ſuppoſed it ſhould not any wiſe hinder his enterpriſe of Affricke: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Preparation for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond voyage of Affricke,</note> they armed their gallions at Lisbone, they ſtayed merchants ſhips, they inrolled all their ſhipping throughout the Realme to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport men, horſe, victuals, and munition, making readie other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues: <hi>Lewis Dataide</hi> was named generall of this Action, but he did not exerciſe the charge with the authoritie due to the place, for as much as the King with <hi>Peter D'alcaſoua</hi> and ſome other his fauorites, reſolued and gaue order for many things concerning the war, which belonged to the Generall to do, or at the leaſt to conſult of. But as he was not greatly pleaſing vnto the King, although he were the moſt renowmed of all the Portugals, ſo did he not follow this enterpriſe being ſent Vizeroy to the Indies: <hi>Diego de Soſa</hi> was made Generall at the ſea, <hi>Chriſtopher de Tauora</hi> his Chamberlaine, and maſter of his horſe (whom he loued entirely) was made commander of all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie that ſhould go into Affricke, and of many ſtrangers that came by aduenture, giuing him the Title of Captaine of the Aduentures, by meanes whereof he was preferred before all the Nobilitie. And for that he could not make himſelfe equall with the Moore in horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; he reſolued to fortific himſelfe better with foote, commanding that no man ſhould furniſh himſelfe with horſe, but ſuch as he ſhould appoint, the which ſhould not be lightly armed, but barded, like to the ancient men of armes, ſo as many gentlemen that prepared to go on horſe backe remained on foot. It was ſtrange to ſee the Portugals furniſh themſelues to war; for being an exerciſe that requireth order &amp; meaſure, all things were there diſordered and confuſed: The faults which were committed in taking of Muſters, giuing of paies, ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in many things, and defect in other, were infinite: The gentlemen after a new prodigious manner attired themſelues like vnto the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillians, in ſteede of ſcouring their Armes, they guarded their habits, for corſlets they prouided dublets of ſilke &amp; gold, they were charged with ſugar and conſerues, in ſteed of water &amp; bisket: The veſſels of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, &amp; the tents lined with ſilke and ſatten were without number, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gentleman went furniſhed like a king, and the poore ſouldiers died for hunger: To conclude, it ſeemed they ſuppoſed that hee that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9072:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
went braueſt and beſt furniſhed with delights, and pleaſures, ſhoulde ſooneſt conquer the enimy; contrary to the opinion of true ſouldiers, <q>who beleeue that when a man goes to the combate clad in gold, and ſilke, he is either ſlaine or returnes home laden with blows; but when he goeth couered with iron, and ſteele, he returnes a conquerour la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with gold.</q> 
                  <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was carefull to whom he ſhould leaue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Realme, for that there was none remaining of the bloud Royall, but his vncle the Cardinall, whom (being very old, &amp; not greatly pleaſing vnto him) he woulde not willingly admit to ſo great a charge, yet hauing no other, he went to Euora where he liued, entreating him to take the care in his abſence, the which he would by no meanes accept, excuſing it by reaſon of his age, and indiſpoſition; ſo as he made choiſe of fower gouernours to command in his name, which were <hi>George d'Almeda,</hi> archbiſhop of Lisbone, <hi>Peter d'Alcaſoua, Frauncis de Sada, &amp; Iohn Maſcaregnas,</hi> to whom he gaue full power in al things, leauing with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Seale which did imprint with inke this word REII, with the which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſubſcribe their diſpatches.</p>
               <p>In the meane time vpon Affrick ſide, the <hi>Cheriffe Mahamet</hi> did ſtill ſollicite <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> by Embaſſadors to make haſte, and by no meanes to abandon the enterpriſe, and with many hopes he gaue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that (beſides a good number of ſouldiers, he had already ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) he was moſt aſſured, that vpon the preſent view of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals enſignes in Affrick, being knowne that they came in his fauour, the greateſt part of townes, fortes, and men of warre woulde rebell againſt <hi>Mulei Moluc</hi> &amp; come to him. It is moſt true he diſſwaded the King for going in perſon, ſaying, it was not neceſſarie, but woulde prooue very hurtfull, alleaging that the Moores (which eaſily would yeeld at his deuotion) ſeeing the King of Portugall there in perſon woulde grow iealous, leaſt he came to ſubdue them to the Chriſtians; and therefore woulde not ſo willingly leaue the enimie. The which he ſaide, both for that it might ſo fall out, as alſo fearing (not without reaſon) that if the King were conquerour, and there in perſon to, he would not leaue him his kingdome free. Al theſe things greatly enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> &amp; the more the <hi>Cheriffe</hi> diſſwaded his going, the more his deſire encreaſed, ſuppoſing that the Moore grew fearefull that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſhould depriue him of his kingdome, he did firmely beleeue that he ſhould conquer it: and continued ſo blinde in this deſire, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9072:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he cauſed a crowne to be made and carried with him, <q>with other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiues to be crowned King, not knowing in the morning what the euening brings. </q>But it ſeemed to him that fortune began now to ſmile, for that <hi>Albacarin</hi> the Moore, who commanded for <hi>Mulei Moluc,</hi> in Arzilla, a towne vpon the borders of the ſea, ſometimes belonging to the Portugals, &amp; voluntarily abandoned to the Moores, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the <hi>Cheriffe Mahamet,</hi> had deliuered it to the gouernour of <hi>Tanger,</hi> whereof the King receiued great contentment, and beleeued now the Moore had ſuch as he ſaide, affectionate to his partie.</p>
               <p>At this time the Iriſhmen rebelled in diuers parts of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, pretending the libertie of Religion, and complained to Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. taking for their leader the Earle of Deſmond and others, as <hi>Oneale,</hi> and ſome other of the ſauage Iriſh, affirming that if they were aided, they could eaſily drawe the whole Iſland from the Queenes obedience. The Pope did communicate this with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique King, exhorting him to vndertake this action, as moſt godly, &amp; to ſuccour this people, the which they reſolued to do. But foraſmuch as the Queene of England did ſeeme in words friend vnto the king, &amp; did as the Spaniards ſuppoſed couertly vnderhand aſſiſt the Prince of Orange in Flaunders againſt him; the King woulde likewiſe march in the ſame path, and make a couert warre againſt her: they concluded to aſſiſt this people in the Popes name, but ſecretly at the kings charge. To this effect they leuied certaine footemen in the territories of the Church, whereof ſixe hundreth vnder the conduct of <hi>Thomas Stukeley</hi> an Engliſhman, fled out of England for treaſon; (who a little before had obtained the title of a Marques from the Pope,) were embarked at Ciuitauechia, in a ſhip of Genua, to be tranſported into Ireland, the which arriued at Lisbone, in the time they made preparation in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall for the warre of Affrick: the king hearing of their arriuall, and that for want of money he could haue no Italians out of Tuſcane, deſired to ſee them, with an intent to retaine them, &amp; vſe them in the war of Affricke, &amp; hauing cauſed them to diſimbarke, and to lodge at Oeiras neere to the mouth of Tagus, he went one day to view them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were no chiefe men, yet did he admire their order, their ſpeedie diſcharging of their Harquebuzes, their diſpoſition to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the pike, and their ſtrict obedience: and hauing had ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the ſaide <hi>Stukeley,</hi> they perſwaded him to promiſe to goe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9072:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with him into Affrick. The Catholique King for that he woulde not ſhew himſelfe a partie, woulde not contradict it. The Pope was ſo farre off, that before the newes coulde come vnto him, he gaue them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and they remained for his ſeruice. In this time the foote which were leuied by three Coronels, approched to Lisbone: the fourth which was <hi>Frauncis de Tauora,</hi> ſhoulde imbarke in Algarues. The three thouſand Germaines (which the Prince of Orange had granted) were (vnder the conduct of <hi>Martin</hi> of Burgundie, Lord of Tamberg,) arriued within the mouth of Tagus, in Flemmiſh ſhips, and were lodged at Caſcaies, and thereabouts, to the great amaſement of the peaſants, not accuſtomed to the charges of warre. King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, deſired to ſee the Duke of Alua, whom he ſent vnto, but he excuſed himſelfe vpon the King; and the King at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of the Duke, vpon the infirmitie of the old man; ſo as his deſire tooke no effect. The Dukes friends tolde him he ſhould haue accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this fauour; whereunto he anſwered, that hauing knowne by the practiſes and diſcourſes of Guadaluppa, and by the Kings letters, his reſolution to paſſe into Affrick, he thought it impoſſible to diuert him from that opinion, that hauing beene diſcreet in his youth, he woulde not in his declining age make himſelfe author of the ruine, which he did foreſee of a King and kingdome. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> without any graue Counſellors, haſtened his departure, impatient of the leaſt delaies, his forces being all aſſembled with the ſhips at Lisbone; the ſouldiors (which were ſcarce nine thouſand) were imbarked againſt their will: The Noblemen and Gentlemen likewiſe had euery one a ſhippe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wherein he ſhould imbarque, with thoſe vnder his commaund, but hardly were they drawne from their deere houſes. And although there were a certaine day for their departure appointed, yet was it<note place="margin">The ſecond voyage of Sebastian with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke.</note> not obſerued: So as the King going one morning in great troupe to the cathedrall church, with the Standard he ment to carrie into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick, he cauſed it to be hallowed with great pompe, and deliuered it to the maſter of his horſe, and ſo returning (many beleeuing he would haue returned to the pallace) he went directly to the galley wherein he woulde paſſe, to haſten the reſt, ſaying that he woulde preſently depart: And although this were the xvij. day of Iune, in the yeere 1578. yet did he ſtay eight daies in the Port, and neuer diſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, preparing the reſt of the ſoldiours, who were no ſooner

readie then the day after Midſommer: at what time hauing a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous winde, the whole armie ſet ſaile, to the great pleaſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the King, who yoong and vnskilfull, guided by ſome ſiniſter ſtarre, or by that diuine permiſſion which woulde puniſh this people, went into Affrick, to a dangerous (although a glorious) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, leauing the Realme emptied of money, naked of Nobilitie, without heires, and in the hands of ill affected gouernours.</p>

There was ſuch a deadlie ſilence in the porte, that (during all the time of their abode in ſo great a number of ſhippes) there was neither flute nor trumpet heard. The Kings galley iſſuing foorth, was carried downe with the currant and brake her rudder againſt a Flemmiſh ſhip: a cannon ſhot from the towne ſlew one of his marriners in the boate; ſo as if we ſhall giue credite to ſignes as the auncients did, theſe ſeemed very ominous.

The firſt towne they touched vpon the maine lande was Lagos in Algarues (where did imbarke the regiment which <hi>Frauncis de Tauora</hi> had leuied in thoſe parts) and certaine other veſſels ioined to the armie, ſo as in all one and other they made neere one thouſand ſaile; but except fiue galleis and fiftie other ſhips, all the reſt were vnarmed, and the moſt of them were barkes to paſſe horſe and munition. They arriued ſoone at Cadiz, whereas the Duke of Medina Sidonia feaſted the King, with chaſing of buls, Iocodecanna, and all other delights that poore Iland coulde yeelde. The Duke laboured to perſwade<note place="margin">The arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Portugall armie in Affrick and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> him not to goe perſonally into Barberie, but he preuailed not, hauing ſoiourned there eight daies like a fleete of merchants, without guard or Centinell, directing their proweſſe towards Affrick, in fewe daies they arriued at Almadraues, betwixt Tanger and Arzilla, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing caſt anchors, they ſtaied ſome ſpace. The King hauing then an intention to diſimbarke at Alarache, a ſmall towne of the Moores, lying fifteene miles towards the ſouth, a little before the armie appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the land, being fully reſolued to depart; the King with his fiue galleis and fower gallions (leauing the reſt of the ſhips) went to Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where he made a ſhort abode: for hauing ſent <hi>Mulei Cheque</hi> ſon to the <hi>Cheriffe,</hi> of the age of twelue yeeres, by land with <hi>Martin Correa de Sylua,</hi> and certaine horſemen Moores and Portugals, to the ende they ſhould draw towards Mazagon, and backe the people thereabouts that ſhould reuolt againſt <hi>Moluc;</hi> he returned to his armie, hauing ſupplied the fortreſſes with freſh ſouldiors, and taking into his ſhips the <hi>Cheriffe</hi> and eight hundreth Harquebuzers that were at the guard thereof. From the Almadraues, he went to Arzilla with all his fleete, where ſeeing his ſouldiors diſtreſſed for water, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to lande and refreſh themſelues, meaning to imbarke them againe, or to tranſport them in barkes to Alarache: But waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his thoughts, nothing was conſtant, for the ſouldiors being landed with no ſmall confuſion, it was hard to force them to returne, for the ſmall obedience they were in, and for the neceſſitie of water, whereof they muſt make prouiſion, ſo as he continued long irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. The armie was lodged vpon the ſea ſhore, hauing on the one ſide fortified their lodging with rampiers of earth and waggons, on the two other ſides the ſea and the towne ſerued them for trenches: It remained in this eſtate fifteene daies, during which the Portugals

landing with their King, had ſo troubled all the prouince, that the Moores that are neighbours to the ſea townes, as Alarache, Tituan, and others, were reſolued not to make any reſiſtance, but to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their townes, and had alreadie tranſported their poore wealth with their wiues to the mountaines.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Mulei Moluc</hi> being at Marrock, had before both from Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, Cadiz, and Arzilla very particular aduertiſement of the King of Portugals preparation, and of the quantitie and qualitie of his men, wherewith he was greatly mooued, ſeeming vnto him that <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> pretended to depriue him of his kingdome being a Moore, to giue it to another Moore, no more friend to him then he was, without any pretext or iudgement to whom of them the eſtate did iuſtly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. And ſeeing the accord with the Catholique King tooke not the effect he deſired, he reſolued vpon his defence: but weighing how much better an ill peace is then a iuſt warre, and diſcerning well the diſcommodities, great charge, and dangers it drawes with it, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured firſt to compound with him, making offer to the King to giue him tenne miles of the countrey lying about his fortreſſes in Affrick for tillage. But <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> who was of another conceite, made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that he had beene at great charge in leuying of forreine forces, and therefore he coulde not deſiſt from the enterpriſe, vnleſſe he would yeeld him Tituan, Alarache, and Cape D'Aghero. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ſeemed too exceſſiue to the Moore, and therefore made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that hee muſt pauſe thereon, although the ſiege were before Moroca, and that the King ſhould offer to giue him in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <hi>Mulei Mahamet</hi> his capitall enimie, That he had conquered thoſe Realmes with his ſword and policie, and ment to defend them with all his forces.

The ſixe and twentith of May he went towards Suſe, the chiefe citie being Northward from Moroca, to giue order in thoſe parts for certaine things there concerning the warre. But hauing intelligence vpon the way that the King of Portugall was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of Lisbone, he returned ſuddenly to Moroca, where hauing left the ſaid <hi>Rhodeuano</hi> as his Vizeroy, he aſſembled thoſe men of war he commonly keepes in paye in that Realme: he lodged his campe at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9072:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Camis, and from thence came in three daies to Temiſnam (townes which lye towards the frontriers of Portugall) where he fell ſicke with great caſtings and a fit of an Ague. There he vnderſtood that <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> was come to Cadiz: and although he were verie ſicke, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his courſe, he went to Salé with 14000.horſe, and 2500. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuzers, whereof one thouſand were on horſebacke, &amp; the reſt on foot the moſt part of Andelouſia, &amp; <hi>Renegados.</hi> Here he vnderſtood the Portugals were arriued at Arzilla, and therefore hauing paſſed the riuer of Marmore at a foord, hauing cauſed ſome quantity of met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to be brought from Moroco, he caſt fower pieces of great cannon in his campe, three of them with certaine other peeces he drew with him, the other he ſent to Moroco, marching himſelfe towards Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar; <hi>Mulei Hemet</hi> his baſtard brother, gouernour of the kingdome of Feſſe, was alreadie come to field, by his commandement, as generall of the horſe of that prouince, and hauing aſſembled all the ſouldiers both horſe and foote thereabouts, was come to the place which they call the faire of Thurſday, ſixe miles neere to Alcazarquiuir, where he expected his brother to ioyne their armies togither, hauing two and twentie thouſand horſe, and fiue thouſand fiue hundreth foote. There <hi>Moluc</hi> arriued the xxiiij. of Iuly ſo ſicke, that he coulde ſcarſe endure on horſebacke, who hauing marched long in his Litter, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his brother a farre off, he tooke his horſe to meete him, when they approched the one to the other, <hi>Mulei Hemet</hi> put ſpurres to his horſe, and being come neere his brother, he lighted and kiſſed the ground, in ſigne of humilitie, the whole armie giuing a great volley of ſhotte. His ſicknes encreaſing daily, <hi>Mulei Moluc</hi> entred not with pompe (as the manner was) into his lodging, but returning to his Litter, ſeated his brother in his place, to effect his entrie, himſelfe going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to take his lodging. And foraſmuch as he vnderſtood, that <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> had ſent <hi>Mulei Cheque</hi> with troopes to Mazagon, he diſpatched <hi>Mulei Dan</hi> his nephew with two thouſand horſe, and ſome foote to make head, leaſt he ſhould indomage thoſe quarters: Toward Cape D'Aghere, and Alarache, he likewiſe ſent men; but hearing that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi> was diſimbarked at Arzilla, they returned to the campe. <hi>Moluc</hi> was a man couragious, hardie, and free in wordes, ſeeming to make ſmall account of the Portugals, he ſaide openly, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer went not willingly with him, he ſhoulde retire, ſuffering any

freely to depart that were more friend to <hi>Mulei Mahamet</hi> then to him, wherein they ſhould do him a fauour; the which he ſpake not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the enimies forces, but knowing how hardly he ſhoulde ſtaie them that minded to leaue him, deſiring rather they ſhould then go, then attend vntill a battaile, or reuolt at ſome other time when they might do him a greater miſchiefe: And therefore to giue them the better meanes to eſcape, he made choiſe of three thouſand, out of ſuch as he ſuſpected, ſending them to diſcouer the Chriſtians Armie, to keepe them buſied with courſes, and to giue them often Alarums, not with any meaning they ſhould do this exploite, but if they meant to flie, they might effect it at their pleaſure. But this meaning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to that nation, wrought in them a contrarie effect to that which <hi>Moluc</hi> attended: for hauing conſtrued this commaundement to the fidelitie and truſt he had in them, they meant ſtill to remaine faithfull, ſo as few went vnto the Chriſtians armie: The greateſt part did well performe that which <hi>Moluc</hi> had giuen them in Charge, for being deuided ſomtimes into 600. ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe, they ran to the Trenches of the Portugals lodgings, moleſting and ſlaying thoſe they found ſcattering from the Armie.</p>

This man (both ambitious and cunning, did ſecond the Kings humours, although he did know with himſelfe they were raſh and hurtfull, and againſt that which he thought conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient) perſwading him to march by lande for two reaſons: The one to make knowne vnto the King vpon his march the want of victuals there was in his Armie, by reaſon whereof he coulde not proceed: to make his officers odious, and to whip them with the ſame rod he had beene ſcourged before, whereby the voyage ſhould be broken. The other reaſon was to ſhew himſelfe valiant to pleaſe the King and to recouer his diſgrace, ſeeming vnto him that whether he did aduiſe it or not, the King would vndertake it, and ſince that he muſt of force hazard his life, he thought it beſt to make himſelfe Author of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: if it ſucceeded ill, the loſſe would be generall; if it happened wel, he alone ſhould haue the honour of it, ſeeing that he alone was of that opinion. He ſetled the Kings weake iudgement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall enflamed this deſire to march, ſaying that this Armie in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke being maſter of the field, ſhould not ſhew any feare by imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but turne head whereſoeuer it pleaſed and open all paſſages.

               <hi>Silua</hi> one of the Kings chiefe fauorites ſpake his mind freely vpon this point, ſaying, there was no reaſon for an Armie to march by land, that went to a towne adioyning vpon the ſea, hauing ſo goodly a Fleete, which might eaſily be furniſhed with freſh water for ſo ſmall a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9072:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which was their onely want. He alleaged that it was moſt eaſie to goe by ſea ſtanding in no feare of any enimie, moſt profitable, for that the way ſhort and the deſcent eaſie, vnderſtanding that there was no reſiſtance: contrariwiſe it was moſt dangerous to march by land, being ignorant where the enimie did lie, &amp; what forces he had: So as ſuppoſing him to be far off, he might be at their backs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any wants which happen often in an Armie, being far from the ſea, they ſhould hardly be ſupplied; that betwixt Alarache and them did run the riuer of <hi>Lixe</hi> (called by <hi>Ptolome</hi> Lixos) vpon the left bank whereof ſtandeth the towne, that hauing neither bridge nor barkes to paſſe, they muſt (leauing the ſea ſide by a long courſe ſeeke a foorde, or the Moores bridge, whither being come, it were doubtfull to know with what facilitie they ſhould paſſe it, being likely the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would fortifie the paſſage.

The ſame day the Portugals had paſſed Mucazen, and come to their fifth lodging, they were in doubt whether to encampe on this ſide or on the other ſide of a ſmall riuer, which beginnes in the mariſhes of Alcaſarquiuir, part of the armie hauing paſſed the water, they turned head, reſoluing to lodge on this ſide: there they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode that <hi>Moluc</hi> approched, making ſhew to fight; and if it had not growne late the armies might haue diſcouered each other. <hi>Moluc</hi> grew then extremely ſicke, without hope to liue many daies, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to command and diſpoſe of all things that were neceſſarie with great reſolution: and ſeeing the enimie to draw neere, he firſt<note place="margin">Molucs ſpeech to his brother.</note> called his brother vnto him ſaying. That although he did not thinke him to haue the ſpirite and courage fit for the place, he woulde giue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:9072:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him; yet being his brother, he made him generall ouer all the horſe, that he might fight, conquer, and die with them, aſſuring him that if he were noted with the leaſt ſhew of cowardiſe, he himſelfe would ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him with his owne handes, and iſſuing foorth of his tent, he put his armie into battaile, going himſelfe from ranke to ranke in a ſmall<note place="margin">The qualitie of Molucs armie.</note> litter carried by men, executing the office of a Sergeant. His armie conſiſted of many nations, there were three thouſand Moores of Andalouſie, as well on foote as horſebacke vnder the conduct of <hi>Doali Algori</hi> and <hi>Oſain</hi> their Commaunders, valiant men, which are thoſe that paſſed into Affricke from the warres of Alpuſſarres or the mountaines of Grenado; he had alſo three thouſand foote, and twentie fiue thouſand horſe, with a thouſand Harquebuziers on horſebacke, the moſt part of them Renegados and Turkes, all of them men of warre, entertained daily in paie: and this was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall force of his campe. He had about ten thouſand horſe gathered togither, &amp; fiue thouſand foote, ſo as in all he had about fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, &amp; eight thouſand foote, beſides a great number of Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and aduenturers that were come vnto him. <hi>Moluc</hi> had no great confidence in the hirelings or Arabians, eſteeming the firſt fearefull, and the laſt inconſtant. Amongſt his entertained bandes, he had likewiſe three thouſand horſe, which (as is ſaide) he ſuſpected to be friends to <hi>Mulei Mahamet,</hi> and not greatly fauouring his rule. But the Portugals who for their honour do willingly augment their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, affirme that the Moores were threeſcore and ten thouſand horſe, and twenty thouſand foote, and the Moores (who do encreaſe their owne actions) doe report their number to be very great: but it is verified by men without paſſion, that although <hi>Moluc</hi> coulde haue aſſembled threeſcore thouſand horſe, and more footemen then he did; yet had he no more in his armie, then we haue ſpecified, with thirtie and fower peeces of artillerie. <hi>Moluc</hi> kept to himſelfe the title of Generall, he gaue to his brother (as is ſaide) the charge of all the horſe. <hi>Oſarin</hi> of Raguſe was Colonell of all the Harquebuziers on horſebacke: <hi>Mahamet Faba</hi> of the Renegados: <hi>Doaly</hi> of the Andaluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the reſt were vnder men of leſſe qualitie, euery one commanding his nation: &amp; <hi>Muſa</hi> was captaine of his guard. The ſame day towards night <hi>Moluc</hi> ſent <hi>Soliman</hi> the maſter of his horſe, a Renegado of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dube, with certaine horſe to view the enimies armie, and to diſcouer if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9072:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they were in battaile, who deſcrying the Portugals that had paſſed the riuer to returne againe; did not beleeue it had bin done to leaue the riuer betwixt the two armies, but imagined they had retired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he returned to the campe with this falſe newes that the Portugals fled; wherewith the Moores being mooued, woulde haue purſued and not let them depart without ſome domage: but <hi>Moluc</hi> woulde not ſuffer them, and as a wiſe Captaine who pretended onely to defende him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to make a bridge vnto the enimie if he woulde flie, ſaide, Let them goe in a good hower, I will not runne after them; ſodainly he altered the diſpoſition of his armie, not for that he beleeued the Portugals were retired; but being informed by <hi>Mahamet Taba</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell of the Renegados, that there was treaſon in his campe, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there were three thouſand Harquebuziers Moores, that had neither powder nor bullet, ſodainly he cauſed to be proclaimed, that whoſoeuer wanted munition ſhoulde repaire vnto the Purueior, and he ſhould furniſh him, and euery Harquebuzier that ſhould be found the next morning without fiftie bullets, and two pounds of powder, ſhoulde be corporally puniſhed: He called vnto him likewiſe all the Captaines (and to be more aſſured of their fidelities, and to take from them all meanes to effect any treaſon they might haue practiſed) he changed euery mans charge, and made one Captaine of an others companie, without leauing any man of qualitie in his accuſtomed place.</p>
            <p>This night paſſed with more quiet then the neerenes of the armies did threaten: And although <hi>Sebastian</hi> had proclaimed that no man ſhoulde ſhoote at any Moore, that ſhoulde willingly retire himſelfe into their campe, but receiue him; yet there came not any one, either for that they bare no ſuch affection to <hi>Mahamet</hi> as he made a ſhew of, or for that they kept ſo ſtrict a guard in the Moores campe, that none coulde iſſue foorth, as indeed they did. It preuailed little for <hi>Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> to plant his colours in the head of the armie, as it were calling them, for no man ſtirred. And the day being come the Portugals held a Councell what to doe? The King became more milde, hauing aſſembled the chiefe, heard with greater patience the opinions of<note place="margin">The conceit of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall to fight.</note> ſuch as would not haue proceeded ſo farre. They propounded either to retire backe, or to march againſt Alarache, &amp; to paſſe the riuer at the mouth: but the moſt expert in warre, thoſe that had diſſwaded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9072:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the courſe they had taken, and laboured by al meanes to flie the ſight of the enimie, helde that they muſt fight; the reſolution being too late nowe to auoide the battaile, and to turne head: for to retire they could not without great loſſe: to ſtande ſtill, want of victuals would not ſuffer them: and to continue their vndertaken way, they coulde not without the hazard of a battaile: that it was better to encounter the enimie valiantly, then to giue him courage by a retraite, or by ſhunning the way. The Cheriffe <hi>Mulei Mahamet,</hi> although his hopes to recouer this kingdome were grounded vpon the onely victorie of a battaile (and that the King being maſter of Alarache and the ſea townes, he ſhoulde reape no profite thereby) yet did he all he coulde to diſſwade him from fight, eſteeming the Portugals to be inferiour, perſwading them to keepe cloſe togither, and to ſeeke meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire although it were with ſome loſſe. And although <hi>Sebastian</hi> were ſome what tempered, yet was he not amazed, like to all the reſt, but with great courage deſired the combate, not eſteeming the enimies forces ſo great as they were: No man durſt contradict him, both for that (as it is ſaide) many thought it neceſſarie to ioine battaile, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for that the Portugals doe generally thinke it cowardiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade from fighting, holding it more honourable to looſe a battaile with raſhnes, then to conquer with cunning and iudgement, without fighting. For this reaſon it was reſolued (after great contrarietie of opinions) to march againſt the enimie, although ſome practiſes of peace were yet in hande, but with weake hopes: So as the ſame mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">The order of the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals armie.</note> they diſlodged, hauing deuided their armie into three ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, the one following the other immediately, and almoſt vnited togither; that in the front, was in a manner diuided into three, for in the middeſt the aduenturers were led by <hi>Aluaro Pirez,</hi> brother and Lieutenant to <hi>Christopher</hi> of Tauora: on the left hande were the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillians led by <hi>Alphonſo d'Aguilar,</hi> lined with Harquebuziers of the ſame nation, commanded by <hi>Lewis d'Godoy:</hi> and the Germaines were on the left hande vnder the Lord of Tamberg, intermixed with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuziers Italians, and thoſe Portugals that vſed to be at Tanger, commanded by captaine <hi>Hercules d'Piſa:</hi> euery nation was ſet in long rankes with their Commanders in the front. In an other ſquadron which did ſecond this, were the Portugals of <hi>Michell de Norogna</hi> and <hi>Vaſco de Sylueira,</hi> with harquebuziers in flanke: and in the other which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9072:28"/>
ſerued for the rereward, were the Portugals of <hi>Diego Lopez de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queira</hi> and <hi>Frauncis de Tauora</hi> (although that <hi>Sequeira</hi> remained at Arzilla,) for the guard whereof beſides two wings of ſhot, there were three hundreth Harquebuziers in the rereward: on both ſides of the armie were their horſemen deuided being in all fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, placed in triangles, whereof the right wing was commanded by <hi>George d' Alencastro</hi> Duke <hi>d'Auero:</hi> on the left ſide was the ſtanderd Roiall, <hi>Iean de Sylua,</hi> Embaſſadour for the Catholique King, and yoong <hi>Theodoſe</hi> Duke of Barcellos, (for ſo they call the eldeſt ſonne of the Dukes of Bragançe) and on the right hande a little ſeparated, were about two hundreth horſe, of thoſe which liue commonly on thoſe frontiers, which they call Affricans: not far from them were the Moores, of the Cheriffe <hi>Mahamet,</hi> but fewe in number: In this order they marched with their baggage in the midſt betwixt their horſe and foote on the right winge, leauing a ſpace on both ſides betwixt their ſquadrons to retire if need were.</p>

               <hi>Moluc</hi> who loſt no opportunitie, had now put his armie in battaile; he placed his footmen (which were all Harquebuziers) in forme of a creſſent; the firſt rank were of Andaluſians; the ſecond of Renegados, and the laſt of Affricanes placed expreſly in this ſort, for that one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being enimie to an other, they might preſſe forwarde their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and not ſuffer them retire: vpon the two hornes of the creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he planted two ſquadrons of ten thouſand horſe in each; and behinde (as it were in the rereward) followed in equall diſtance, all their horſe in ſmall troopes, reſoluing (if they ment to fight) with ſo great a number of men to compaſſe in the Portugals armie, and charge them on euery ſide. But in the meane time his ſicknes encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, feeling himſelfe die by degrees: and although his Phiſitions vſed all their skill to ſuccour him, yet decaying howerly, they founde he coulde not liue two daies. He felt a double death by reaſon of the time wherein he died, and not being able to execute his reſolution in this warre, he doubted that he ſhoulde not leaue any one that could effect them. For although hee were then in battaile, yet had hee no meaning to fight at that inſtant, foreſeeing (after that hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Portugals did march into the maine land with their baggage) if they ſought to delay the battell, they were all vndone, and that without the loſſe of any one man he would take them all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9072:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
priſoners, by reaſon of the want they ſhould find in that poore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Affricke: But ſeeing this reſolution (which required time and could not bee effected in haſte) would not ſucceed by reaſon of the ſhortnes of his life, he was much troubled. He thought it not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to diſcouer his conceit vnto his brother, that ſhould ſucceede him, both for that he much doubted of his iudgement, and knowing aſſuredly that if he died before the victorie, the Moores would flie, and rebell againſt his brother, and yeeld to the Portugals, chiefely by the pretence of <hi>Mulei Mahamet,</hi> and in this manner the kingdome would be loſt. Afflicted with theſe cares, ſeeing the enimie neere with ſo great an Armie, and his death approaching, he reſolued not to truſt his heire, but leauing his firſt reſolution, rather during his life to hazard a bloodie and doubtfull battell againſt all Reaſon of warre, then to die with feare of the loſſe of his Realme, the which he knew aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly would happen after his death: being reſolued to fight, all practiſes of accord diſmiſſed, he aſſembled the chiefe commaunders of the Armie, and ſpake vnto them in this manner.</p>

            <p>In the meane time the Chriſtian Armie marched on, and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched neere the enemie, in an open Champion, (which the Moores cal Tamiza.)

The Portugals fearfull and amaſed (imagining vpon

In the rereward they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe charged <hi>Frauncis de Tauora,</hi> with the regiment of <hi>Diego Lopez de Sequiera,</hi> where for a while they reſiſted weakely: Thoſe in the middeſt were the laſt that fell to armes: But <hi>Moluc</hi> gaue them no long time of reſt, for he ſent to aſſaile <hi>Vaſco de Sylueire,</hi> and <hi>Michael de Norogna,</hi> on both ſides, ſo as at one inſtant they fought on all partes: Theſe made weaker reſiſtance then the reſt, for that ſome of them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting cowardly away their armes, and falling on their knees, yeelded to the diſcretion of the Moores, who for the moſt part deuided their heads with their Cimiters, in recompence of their baſe yeelding. The combate being hot on all ſides, the circle of the Moores horſe, &amp; their ſquadrons that were behinde, drew neere, and firſt charged the auantguard, where they found their ſuccours were more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie then in any other part; (for that the Italians and Caſtillians had cut in peeces a great number of the Moores, and of their beſt men,) preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Chriſtians armie on all ſides they coulde approch, without any diſorder of their owne, who nowe growne fearefull, began to<note place="margin">The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals haue the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Moores.</note> looſe grounde, and to ſhrinke togither, to the great diſcontentment of the King, who for any labour of his, coulde not containe them in their rankes.

horſe that were accuſtomed to liue in thoſe frontiers, the Moores of the Cheriffe <hi>Mahamet,</hi> and the Duke of Auero with his triangle did valiantly march towards them, charging the firſt they mette, &amp; greatly endomaging them, and put their horſemen on that ſide to flight. This happie beginning of victorie laſted little: for whileſt the Duke who commanded the greateſt number, did fight hand to hand, he diſcouered on the one ſide not farre from him, a great troupe of the enimies horſe, the which he durſt not attende, doubting his owne ſtrength, but turning head, followed expreſly the chaſe of thoſe that were before him, thinking to returne to the fight with greater aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as indeede he did: for turning his horſe, he went to charge them that came to encounter him in flanke; but finding him ſelfe ouercharged on euery ſide, wanting courage to withſtand them, and turning his horſes violently, preſſed by the enimie, he found no place of retrait among the ſquadrons, but ruſhing through the rankes of the Germaines, ſome part of the horſe entring amongſt the foote, bredde a great confuſion; and being vnable to relieue themſelues, they wrought no other effect, but diſordered their friends, who were after leſſe able to reſiſt the enimies horſe and foote, that came to charge them: On the other ſide of the armie, where ſtoode the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd roiall, and the reſt of the horſe, which ſet forwarde ſomewhat ſlower, they made a great ſlaughter of Moores, (although the King were not preſent, being gone towarde the vanguard) whom they purſued euen vnto their artillerie: But being ſuccoured by one of the ſquadrons that were behinde them, the Moores returned furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vnto the fight, ſo as in ſhort time it hapned vnto the Portugals that were in that part, as to their other horſe, whoſe ſucceſſe was ſo much the woorſe, for that on the outſide they were charged by the Moores, and within, their foote were diſordered by their horſe, who had the charge on the other ſide, and all amazed, fledde; ſo as in a moment all was confounded, the Portugals horſe remained diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and diſperſed, ſhewing ſmall courage, and leſſe diſcipline: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were full of Nobilitie, and men of reſolution; yet were there many yoong men ſent by their fathers, who not expecting they ſhoulde come to fight, were the cauſe of this diſorder: ſo as in one place you ſhoulde ſee men of one ſquadron both fight valiantly and flie away cowardly not being purſued: yet the Commaunders of the

horſe, and ſome others, turning face to the enimies, they both by words and effect encouraged the reſt, and ſlewe ſome that fled: But as their number was ſmall, and the amaſement great, they preuailed little. In the vantguard (where the King was a looker on) they made great reſiſtance, killing aboue two thouſand Moores, but they were in ſo great numbers, that the Italians and Spaniards who fought on that ſide (not being ſuccoured by any others) after they had encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the enimies with their daggers, were in a manner all flaine, not ouercome, but wearie with killing. The ſmall order they obſerued to inueſt the enimie, was hurtfull vnto them; for the front being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of diuers nations, who contented to make ſhewe of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they did not one ſtay for another, and the Germaines more flegmatike, remained behinde; ſo as their forces diſmembred, wrought not that effect they had done vnited: yet notwithſtanding the valour of thoſe men, the firſt charge of the horſe, eſpecially of the Affricanes, commanded by <hi>Edward de Meneſes,</hi> ſtrooke a great terror<note place="margin">Molucs feare.</note> in the beginning vnto <hi>Mulei Moluc;</hi> for ſeeing his men flie (although he were ſicke to the death) mounted to horſe in choler, going towards them that ranne away, to ſtaie them, and encourage them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the preſſe encreaſed, and the ſhot of the Chriſtians drewe neere, he made ſhewe to march himſelfe foremoſt, either to retaine his men by ſhame, or by the hazarde whereunto hee ſhoulde thruſt himſelfe: But his greateſt fauorites came about him, ſome holding him by the ſtirrops, ſome by his gowne, and ſome by the raines of his bridle, beſeeching him not to hazarde himſelfe. But he perſiſting his reſolution, and they to ſtay him, he growe in choler, laying holde of his ſworde to diſperſe them, at what time being ſeaſed with a cruell fit of his diſeaſe, he ſwouned, and had fallen from his horſe; but being taken downe by them about him, he was laid in his Litter, where putting his finger vnto his mouth in ſigne of ſilence, ſodainely, or (as ſome report) before he was laide downe,<note place="margin">Molucs death.</note> he gaue vp the ghoſt.

The Arabians who were not come with any intent to fight, but with a deſire to ſpoile the conquered, hauing firſt viewed ſome Moores runne away, that their Mercenaries grew fearefull, who kept their lodging, doubting ſome ill ſucceſſe; they fell vpon the Moores baggage, and ſpoiled it, putting to flight ſuch as kept it, who running euen vnto Feez, with many others of the campe, <q>gaue out that the Moores had loſt the fielde: ſo dangerous a thing it is in an armie to conduct a nation light and vnconſtant, who vpon the leaſt contrarie euent falles vpon his friendes.</q> But fortune who had hitherto beene doubtfull, although it ſeemed more to fauour the Moores then the Portugals, after the Italians and Caſtillians were defeated, remaining yet a good number of Germaines and aduenturers diſordred, did now ſhewe it ſelfe apparant in fauour of the Moores, and the victorie aſſured, hauing gotten their artillerie: For the Renegados who were in the ſecond ranke of the Moores, their orders being open, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any confuſion receiue the Andaluzians, and all thoſe that had beene broken by the vanguard and fled, who returning a freſh to charge the aduenturers and Germaines, they founde but weake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The arriuall of certaine Renegados that fled from the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies preuailed but little, bringing newes of the death of <hi>Moluc:</hi> For although ſome went vp and downe crying victorie, and publiſhing that <hi>Moluc</hi> was dead, thereby to encourage the ſouldiers; yet was there no meanes to draw the Portugals to imitate the example of the ſtrangers; but all fearefull without any courage, retiring themſelues, they ſtill loſt of the fielde: The ſquadrons of the maine battaile did not yet mooue, but vnfurniſhed of ſhot (who without keeping their places were crept foreward) did ſtande firme without ſuccouring of their friends, ſaying, that ſuch was the Kings commandement, and therefore charged by the Moores ſhotte on horſebacke, were miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie conſumed, when as their commanders finding their errors would<note place="margin">Frauncis de Tauora ſlain in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile.</note> haue drawne them forwarde, the ſouldiers were ſo amazed, that they coulde not doe it.

charge; but being dead his men grew more amazed then before, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for mercie without fighting, &amp; flying away without any reſpect of the King, who was come thither from the vantguard: they retired of all parts ſo farre backe, with ſo great a confuſion, and without conſideration whither they went, that all the ſquadrons in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed order came cloſe togither on all ſides; ſo as the horſe, ſouldiers, chariots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> munition, tents and pauillions, with their other baggage, came all confuſedly togither on a heape, and in ſuch a ſtraite, that many were troden downe in the preſſe, and ſmoothered vnder the horſe and chariots: So as this armie which did containe aboue three miles in compaſſe, was in a moment conſumed by the ſworde, and did ſo reſtraine it ſelfe through feare, that a ſmall roome might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it. The Duke of Auero, Embaſſador for the Catholique king, <hi>Aldana</hi> and ſome other chiefe men, hauing gathered togither ſome horſe, charged the Moores firſt on the one ſide, and then on the other, where they did ſee greateſt neede, but being diſordred and fewe in number, if they preuailed on the one ſide, they receiued hurt on the other: For at the ſame inſtant when as certaine of them attended the King towardes the rereward, whereas there needed ſuccours, there came a great number of Arabians againſt the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, who according to their cuſtome, to fall vpon thoſe, whom they ſee in route, charged that part with ſuch furie, that they ſlewe almoſt all the Germaines with their Captaines, and many men of<note place="margin">The death of the Duke of Auero, and of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dana, and the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of the Prior.</note> account: There the Duke was ſlaine with a ſhot, <hi>Aldana</hi> died like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: the Embaſſador of the Catholique King was hurt and taken priſoner, ſo was the Prior and the Marſhall of the field. Theſe being diſmounted, euery man fled; the Moores entring into the ranks of the Chriſtians, with their Cymiters cut them miſerablie in peeces: Whileſt this was a dooing, the fire fell by chaunce into the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall munition, which did endomage them no more then the Moores: for as they entred among their baggage, it conſumed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of them. The circle of the Barbarians horſe did no way guarde the paſſage towards the ſea, ſo as the Chriſtians that ment to flie that way, might eaſily doe it, but ſuch as thought to returne to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zille were either ſlaine or taken priſoners; for ſuch as eſcaped the Moores, being ignorant of the waies, and paſſage of the riuers, were either drowned, or fell into their handes, who made them ſlaues:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:9072:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
There were many drowned, deceiued with the riſing of the riuer, &amp; ignorant of their former paſſage; for whereas the riuers (and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Mucazen) doe ebbe and flowe, like the Ocean by the courſe of the Moone, filling it ſelfe with ſalt water, when the armie paſſed they were almoſt dry; but in their returne, the Tide (as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay) being full the riuers were greatly riſen, wherof the Portugals being ignorant, and vnskilfull of the Ford, fearefull, and chaſed by the Moores, they were ſwallowed vp; ſo as of a great multitude of Chriſtians, which were in this battaile, there eſcaped but one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, ſo well coulde the Barbarians execute their reſolutions. The King (who in the beginning when as <hi>Molucs</hi> artillerie firſt plaied, went through the armie in coach with <hi>Chriſtopher de Tauora)</hi> tooke his horſe, and as they ſay, went couragiouſly toward the vanguard, where remaining a while a looker on, ſending firſt one, then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to commaund what he thought was neceſſarie, he was light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hurt with a ſhot in the right arme towarde the ſhoulder, whereof making ſmall account, he went ordering thinges in all parts of the armie, leauing the triangle of horſe where his Standerd remained. But for that he was yoong, and depriued of the greateſt treaſure that Kings can enioy, I meane a wiſe man neere him in whome he ſhoulde truſt, when he did ſee his men begin to breake, and the Duke of Auero to go forward and retyre backe, he came furiouſly with certaine Gentlemen that were about him, to fight among the ſouldiers, encouraging his men valiantly by the effects, but with<note place="margin">The King of Portugall fights vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, but is vanquiſhed.</note> fewe words. Thoſe that behelde him fight, woondered at his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for although that they ſlewe three horſe vnder him, without any whit daunting him, yet was he neuer wearie to charge, ſtrike, and ſuccour all partes of the armie, where was greateſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: But being but a man, aided by fewe, he cannot reſiſt the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies furie; nor make his friends partakers of his valour. Manie of the Nobilitie which remained yet on horſebacke, ſeeing the armie in route, ſought the King in all parts to helpe to ſaue him: but the Standard which was carried before him as a marke to knowe him, was now taken, and the bearer ſlaine; and being deceiued with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſomewhat like vnto it, which <hi>Edward de Meneſes</hi> carried, they followed the one in ſteade of the other; ſo as the King remained as a man loſt, with ſome of his moſt truſtie ſeruants about him, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9072:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one Renegado, who laboured to ſaue him: Hauing in vaine ſought to fly, being aduiſed to yeeld with his armes, he would by no means agree vnto it. One amongſt them holding vpon the point of his ſworde a white napkin in ſigne of peace, went towards the Moores, as an Embaſſadour for the reſt to yeelde: but they either barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or wrathfull, tooke the meſſenger priſoner, and charged the reſt, who being fewe in number, wearied, &amp; without courage, they were all ſlaine. Some ſay, there grew a controuerſie amongſt them about the Kings owne perſon, and for that occaſion they ſlew him: They ſent after to ſecke his bodie, and by a notable example of the<note place="margin">The King ſlaine by the Moores, and carried to Molucs tent.</note> inconſtancie of this world, they carried it naked vpon a ſaddle pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, into the roiall tent of <hi>Moluc,</hi> where letting it fall to the ground, it was carefully viewed by the Nobilitie that was there preſent, &amp; a publike certificate made that it was he, keeping it aftewardes at Alcazer-Quiuer. <q>Such was the death of this vnfortunate King, wherein chaunced all things that might make him lamentable, his yoong age, the expectation of his vertues, the want of ſucceſſion, his violent death, and the impriſonment of his bodie. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with excellent qualities, but nothing profitable vnto him, wanting by reaſon of his vnripe yeeres, that predominante vertue of our actions: For all his reſolutions that did guide him to ſo raſh an end, were grounded vpon his magnanimitie, zeale to religion, liberalitie, thirſt of militarie glorie; of the diſpoſition of his body, and the vigour of his courage. It ſeemes that we may well ſaie of this vnfortunate yoong Prince, that which was ſometimes ſpoken of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; That Nature had giuen him vertue, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vices: For in truth <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had his vertues of nature, and his vices from his education.</q>

Thoſe whome idlenes had made curious, did note the diuerſitie of theſe Princes deathes, for being all loſt in one battaile, within the ſpace of ſixe houres, the one died of his naturall death; the ſecond by the ſword; the thirde was ſmothered in the water. When as <hi>Hamet</hi> ſee the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile wonne, he ranne towardes his brother, thinking to finde him aliue, and to reioice with him: but being come to his litter, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of his death. And although <hi>Moluc</hi> had left one ſonne,

               <note place="margin">Hamet proclaimed king of the Moores.</note> yet did they ſalute <hi>Hamet</hi> as their King, running through their campe with enſignes proclaiming of his name, according to their cuſtome: And for that according to the conformitie of the grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, the eldeſt (as it is ſaide) of the nephewes ſhould ſucceede, therefore <hi>Hamet</hi> was ſworne Prince. The Moores fell to ſpoile, and take priſoners, making a very rich bootie, by reaſon of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things the Portugals had brought with them into the campe; but eſpecially for the priſoners, which were in great number, and of great importance, for their wealth and nobilitie: beſides that the Moores make more account of one Portugall priſoner, then of any other nation, for that being delicate and not able to ſuffer, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for great ſums, as theſe gentlemen did afterwards; who by an example of ſmall patience, ſet themſelues at ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand duckats a peece and more.

The number of the dead, was not ſo great as of the priſoners; but for that the truth is hard to be verified, it hath bred diuers opinions in the Portugals: Some haue reported that the enimies were infinite in number; others haue bin more moderate; yet haue they augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted this point: Notwithſtanding there died three thouſand Moores, and as many Chriſtians, or more; amongſt the which were ſome<note place="margin">The names of the chiefe ſlaine in the battaile.</note> men of account: For beſides the Captaines of the ſtrangers, and the Duke of Auero, there was ſlaine <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of Portugall, Earle of Vimioſa; <hi>Lewes Coutigno,</hi> Earle of Rodondo; <hi>Vaſco de Gama,</hi> Earle of Vidiguera; <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of Norogna, Earle of Mira; <hi>Iohn Lobo,</hi> Baron of Aluito; <hi>Aluara</hi> of Melo, ſonne to the Marques of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara; <hi>Rhoderick</hi> of Melo, eldeſt ſonne to the Earle of Tentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel; <hi>Iamie</hi> brother to the Duke of Bragance; <hi>Iohn de Silueira,</hi> eldeſt ſonne to the Earle of Sorteglia; <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> of Tauora; and manie other of account, ſo as ſome noble families were there wholie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. <hi>Arias</hi> of Silua, Biſhop of Porto, and <hi>Emanuel</hi> of Meneſes, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Coimbra, died likewiſe: The Duke of Barſellos, with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie</hi> Prior of Crato, were taken priſoners. The newe King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gathered togither his armie, and the greateſt number of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9072:33"/>
priſoners he could get, reſolued to returne to Feez; where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in great triumph: For beſides the colours taken, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Captiues he led with him, he cauſed the bodie of <hi>Mulei Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamet</hi> to be founde out, and hauing flaied it, and filled the skin with ſtrawe, he carried it in triumph, to take from the Moores al the hope they had conceiued in him. After he ſtudied carefully to diſcouer<note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes of Hamet.</note> the Gentlemen that were priſoners, taking them from the Moores and Iewes, who had bought them for a ſmall price, to drawe from them a greater raunſome, as indeede he did: Whereupon hee was noted by ſome to be more couetous then valiant, ſeeming a great indiſcretion, that after ſo great and abſolute a victorie, remaining no reliques of an enimies armie, he ſhoulde ſo ſodainly betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to reſt. They woulde (being but twentie and fiue miles from the fortes which the Portugals held in Affrick) he ſhould preſently haue laboured to force them, and haue freed the Prouince from ſuch a curbe (being the opinion of the moſt expert) that if he had aduanced his campe, he had ſoone forced them, vnfurniſhed both with men and munition; and the Portugals that were there in guard remaining ſo aſtoniſhed, for the death of their King, that they could hardly haue made defence, and ſo much the leſſe hauing ſmall hope to be ſuccoured out of Portugall, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> hauing carried with him all the Nobilitie which were woont to defende thoſe places. So as vpon this diſcourſe, many ſaide, as was ſpoken to <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the ſame nation, that the Affricanes although they knowe ſometimes how to vanquiſh, yet coulde they not vſe the victorie: But all well conſidered, the Moore proceeded in this action, with more iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then others beleeued, for not ſuffering himſelfe to be carried away with proſperitie, hauing aduertiſement that the Realme of Feez (the which they had receiued from ſuch as had eſcaped the day of the battaile the handes of the vanguard of the Chriſtians and of the Arabians) was ſomewhat altered, ſeeing himſelfe newly King, he thought it more conuenient being armed to goe pacifie his people, and take aſſured poſſeſſion of the Realme, then to buſie himſelfe with newe conqueſts, and leaue the certaine in doubt for the vncertaine: Beſides, hauing well conſidered the conqueſt of theſe fortreſſes of the ſea, he did not eſteeme them eaſie, but of hard attempt: for beſides they wanted no garriſons, and that Portugall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9072:34"/>
was not yet ſo vnpeopled, but that it might ſoone be ſuccoured, he held it for moſt certaine, that King <hi>Philip</hi> for his owne priuate inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt would defend them with all his force, the which he might eaſilie effect by reaſon of the great number of galleies hee had prepared readie in Spaine, fearing perchance that which had happened. And for that he doubted the Andaluzians might haue ſome intelligence with the Turkes, and practiſe ſome treaſon againſt his perſon, hee cut off the head of <hi>Doali</hi> and ſome other Commaunders, and of ſome others of his traine. By this meanes <hi>Hamet</hi> got the name of a wiſe and conſiderate Prince, the which he preſerued, gouerning himſelfe with iudgement.</p>

               <hi>Diego de Soſa</hi> Generall of the armie at ſea, who as we haue ſaid, remained neere Alarache, hearing the noiſe of the artillerie, and the brute of the two armies, moſt aſſured they were in fight, he knew not what to doe: for although his commiſſion was there to attende the King, yet he doubted leaſt the viewe of the enimie might force him to change his reſolution, or that the way ſhoulde be ſtopped, and that he ſhoulde expect him in vaine, not reſoluing whether it were more expedient to returne to Arzille, or attend in that place: He made likewiſe a queſtion, whether he ſhoulde batter Alarache, (whereunto he was enclined) thinking by his cannon to giue the King a figne of his being there, and to trouble the minde of the Moore, while he was in fight; but he reſolued not any thing, detei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his blinde commiſſion, and the aduiſe of ſome other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines. The armie being broken, he receiued letters from <hi>Peter de Meſquita,</hi> gouernour of Arzille; and withall, newes of the ſucceſſe, in part falſe, writing vnto him that he ſhoulde returne with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to Arzille, and that King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> came thither to imbarke. And although this letter did not eaſilie mooue him, doubting that <hi>Meſquita,</hi> demaunded the armie more for his owne aſſurance then otherwiſe; yet being certified of the Kings death, he ranne alongſt the coaſt vnto Tanger: ſeeking to gather vp the remainder of the armie, and ſo after returne to Lisbone.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges paſſed in Affrick, the news came (but without good aſſurance) to the Gouernours the fourteenth of Auguſt, which did ſo amaze them, that for a time they knewe not what to determine, yet they kept it ſecret, reſoluing in the meane time to call the

It preuailed not for his iuſtification, to alleage, that if the Cardinall himſelfe did not perſwade the enterpriſe, yet at the leaſt he did conſent vnto it, and approoue it, which fault was greater in him, then in any other, that his perſwaſions ſhoulde be of more importance with the king, then all mens, ſeeing that for the preheminence of his place he alone might ſpeake cleerely, and force him, which others could not doe, fearing as ſubiects (and with reaſon) the indignation of a yoong king; the which (they ſay) he ought not to haue feared, both for his qualitie and his age, which ſhould neither yeeld to feare nor hope. He tooke the ſame courſe againſt <hi>Lewes de Silua,</hi> and many others that came out of Affrick, whereby it was apparent the King knew not abſolutely how to vſe clemencie, nor wrath: for neither did he pardon as a man of the Church, nor reuenge as a diſpleaſed Prince. This bredde an alteration in all the affaires of the Realme, neither was it ſufficient that ſuch as were aduanced to theſe newe offices, were men without experience, who by their ignorance did mightily trouble ſuch as did treate with them, but for that we eaſily encline to the woorſt, ſome of them vnder colour to ſeeme affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſeruants to their king, not onely prouided for that which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their charge, but examined the actions of their predeceſſors; finding therein a thouſand cauils, and preferring the appearance of the kings profite, before iuſtice, they diſannulled conuentions and lawes, to the great trouble and damage of many, and ſmall honour to themſelues, and then did they ſeeme to doe beſt iuſtice, when they did moleſt moſt, ſuch as <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had fauoured, and wrought quite contrarie to that which had beene formerly done: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if any thing were done by them that was abſolutely good, it was the diſannulling of the impoſt of ſalt, which <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>

The report of the Dukes words, did greatly mooue <hi>Ferrant de Silua,</hi> Embaſſadour for Portugall, and all the Portugals, being a ſpeech that did pearce their harts, proceeding from a perſon whom they helde enimie to their nation, for the olde grudges betwixt him and <hi>Ruigomes de Silua,</hi> a naturall Portugall, in great credite with <hi>Philip;</hi> beſides that, being a principall man of account, they feared leaſt he ſpake it with participation of the Kinges minde, and tooke<note place="margin">The diſcord that fell out for that one ſaid Philip did preceade Henrie.</note> it as a declaration of his meaning. In this time they ſpake diuerſly of theſe affaires: For although amongſt the Caſtillians, the Duke himſelfe, and one or two other principall perſons, had this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet in generall they did not beleeue it, neither had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that <hi>Philip</hi> ſhoulde inherite this Realme, but they ſuppoſed it did of right appertaine to the ſonne of the Duke of Parma. But the Portugals (who had better conſidered thereof, and whoſe lawes were more in fauour of <hi>Philip</hi> then thoſe of Caſtill) were amongſt themſelues better reſolued: neither was the Catholique King long vnſatisfied; hauing both in his owne Countries, in Portugall and other places cauſed learned men diligently to examine who was by right &amp; equitie the true ſucceſſour of this Realme, he began now to conceiue that after <hi>Henry</hi> the ſucceſſion appertained vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And nowe he founde, that it was not onely the generall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctors, but ſome amongſt them, yea of the Portugals the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, did maintaine that the King did preceade the Cardinal, and that theſe Realmes did appertaine to the Crowne of Caſtill. They alleaged (but with the authoritie of fewe Doctors) that the lawes of Portugall, and the Ciuill likewiſe, ordaine, that in caſe of Realmes, the inheritance ſhall goe to the neereſt kinſemen of the laſt poſſeſſour, prouided alwaies, that he be iſſued from the ſame ſtocke: That <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being the laſt, the Catholique King was the

neereſt kinſeman he had, and of the ſame race; for beſides that he was the eldeſt of the Nephewes of King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> he was brother to the Kings mother deceaſed, and preceaded the Cardinall a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, being brother to his grandfather. They did likewiſe renewe the auncient pretention of the Caſtillians, ſaying, that by right the Realme appertained vnto them, for that King <hi>Alphonſe</hi> the ſixth, coulde not by generall conſent, nor with any reaſon diſunite it from the Crowne; neither <hi>Alphonſe</hi> the tenth giue the Algarues to his daughter in dowry, nor free it of the tribute whereunto it was bounde. And although this laſt pretention to preceade <hi>Henry,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the King and his miniſters of force, yet he reſolued onely to follow the firſt, and to ſucceede the Cardinall, for deſiring to enioy the Realme with peace, <hi>Henry</hi> being already proclaimed king with the conſent of the people, he ſuppoſed he coulde not without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or without forces take poſſeſſion thereof: beſides the reſpect he bare vnto his vncle, and the hope of his ſhort life. Heere may be noted the hazard (if we may ſo tearme it) whereunto the King (if he had intereſt by his affinitie) did thruſt his heires, by the concealing of his right, fearing to offende that nation. For beſides that during the life of <hi>Henry,</hi> the Portugals ſhoulde haue leiſure to prepare againſt him, if they were not diſpoſed to yeelde to his ſubiection, and if he ſhoulde die before the Cardinall, his ſucceſſors were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this great inheritance, and <hi>Emanuel Phillibert</hi> Duke of Sauoy did preceade all the reſt.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were conſulting in Caſtill, the King of Portugall ſomewhat ſetled in his Throne, and the heate of his firſt inclination tempered, all the States of the Realme entreated him to prouide, that before his death a ſucceſſor were declared, that after his deceaſe they might not liue in ſuſpence: And therefore the Magiſtrate of the Chamber of Lisbone, being ſuperior to all others of the Realme, made great inſtance vpon this point, and one day all the officers being aſſembled, they went to courte, where one of them in the name of the reſt ſpake thus vnto the King; <q>Your<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the people of Portugall.</note> Highnes ſhall vnderſtande, with how great deſire and affection his people of Lisbone, beſeecheth the Lorde to graunt him a long life, for thereon depends all our good, hoping that in time it may alter many things which nowe holdeth vs in carefull conſideration:

The wounde of afflictions, which this Realme hath ſuffered, is yet ſo greene and ſo lamentable, as we will not at this preſent make mention thereof; It ſufficeth they are ſuch, as the memorie will neuer be extinct whileſt the worlde continueth: and although we be bound to lay the fault vpon our owne offences, yet may we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a parte to the negligence of the people, and of ſuch as at that time did gouerne the common wealth: But being expedient not to heape error vpon error, it ſeemes we ought with a liuely voice, and due humilitie, cry vnto your highnes, that (as a iuſt and holy king,) you woulde preuent the miſeries that hang ouer vs: It cannot enter into our thoughts to mooue you to marriage, being no iudges of your conſcience, and diſpoſition; but we may well ſay, if theſe two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations do allow it, why do you ſuffer the delay of one day? If you be reſolued not to marry, your Highnes ought with the like care to ſay vnto ſuch as pretend to the ſucceſſion, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a time prefixed they ſhoulde come to deliuer their reaſons; that if the ſucceſſor be a naturall borne, the people ſhal haue ſome brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the afflictions they ſuffer; if he ſhall be a ſtranger, it ſeemes conuenient they ſhoulde know it, and haue leiſure to aduiſe what to do: For if our ſinnes permit that the Lorde ſhall call away your Highnes, being in the ſtate we are now, what ſhall become of vs? being moſt apparant that all ſuch as pretend to haue any title, do conſult, arme, plot, and meaſure their forces, while the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines doubtfull, not knowing with reaſon vnto what part to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline: Your Highnes dying in this time before the deciding of the cauſe, we beſeech you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the oppreſſions they ſhal ſuffer, the ſpoilings, the murthers, the diſhonoring of women and holy things, and all other exceſſe, which is commonly practiſed in ſuch times, the which may be wholie auoided, by knowing who ſhall ſucceede vnto the crowne. We do ſolicite your Highnes to ſweare a Prince, (for it may be, he that at this preſent hath intereſt to this Realme, God may call him before your Highnes) but the contrary hapning we may plainly knowe who ſhall ſucceed, for heerein conſiſtes the quiet of this Realme: if you do it not willingly, or that there be any let, you ought to conſent that the people declare one, eſpecially they of the citie of Lisbone, vpon whom all Portugall dependes: The holie Ghoſt, who is the guide of kings, inſpire your Highnes,

that by his merits, the anger of God may be pacified, the which he powreth downe vpon vs for our offences, and grant that we may amend our liues, and preſerue your Highnes in health, for which all his people praie.</q> In this manner the officer of the Chamber ſpake in vaine, but foraſmuch as it ſeemed vnto the king (ouer ruled in this reſpect by the diuine power) that the remedie was not ſo eaſie, nor the matter ſo ſoone decided, as they ſuppoſed; he made anſwere, that it was a care grauen in his hart, the which he woulde effect with all poſſible ſpeede, reſoluing to haue regard vnto it.</p>
            <p>But this ſucceſſion gaue greater cauſe both to thinke, &amp; talke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie, and openlie in Caſtill then in anie other place; for the King reſoluing by all poſſible meanes to vnite Portugall, with his other Kingdomes, the Nobilitie did not willingly entertaine it, but did ſeeme that the greateſt from <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth forwards, had not taſted the greatnes of the King, leſſe reſpecting them, then had done the auncient Kings of Caſtill, making them march in one degree of equall iuſtice with their inferiours. The other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and common people were nothing enclined to this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Saying, that if this Realme were not ſeparated from the reſt of Spaine, they ſhoulde haue no meanes to marrie their Kings daughters, but into other prouinces, which were dangerous both for that the women did not inherite, and for the hereſies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the northren Regions bee at this preſent infected: Manie and of all qualities, (who holding Portugall as the Sanctuarie of Caſtill) were content with the ſeparation, remaining as an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red retreate for offenders. It ſeemed to the King that hee ſhoulde not onely ſend a ſufficient man thither to performe that office, but alſo that it was neceſſarie, that one of the chiefe of Spaine, and beſt acquainted with the affaires of State, ſhoulde goe to propound the cauſe of ſucceſſion: For this occaſion they named as it is ſaid <hi>Gaſper</hi>

and wiſedome, was thought the better, for beginning to feare they ſhould come to armes, it ſeemed that he beſt could treate of the ſucceſſion, and withall ſounde the Portugals forces, and what ſuccours they might drawe vnto them, and afterwardes if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, being a great captaine, coulde by his aduiſe vndertake the warre with greater aſſurance. Manie did approoue <hi>Anthony</hi> of Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo, for beſides the opinion, they had of his wiſedome, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted godly, religious, and otherwiſe vertuous, the which they ſuppoſed woulde make him more pleaſing vnto <hi>Henry.</hi> But in the iudgement of the moſt aduiſed, they preferred the Cardinall of Burgos, for beſides thoſe other good parts which he enioied with the reſt, he was thought moſt able to treate the matter of State; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, being a prieſt, and a Cardinall, they ſhoulde ſeeme to<note place="margin">The Duke of Oſſuna ſent to Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> ſende vnto <hi>Henry</hi> a companion. But notwithſtanding, there was not in Spaine any greater perſonages of like experience vnto theſe, to mannage a matter of ſo great importance, being the greateſt that euer was preſented vnto this crowne; yet the preferred <hi>Peter Girone</hi> Duke of Oſſuna; and although his qualitie (being great among the greateſt of the Realme) was woorthie of anie charge, accompanied with manie vertues, and ſome other particularities, that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the voiage; notwithſtanding, ſome did attribute this election to the ordinarie diſeaſes of the court, and to the reſpects which Kings Councels doe commonly vſe, inferring thereby that therein he was extraordinarily fauoured by <hi>Peter Faſſardo, Marques de los Veles</hi> his kinſman, at that time fauoured by the king. Some ſaid alſo (and it may be not without grounde) that it was not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſende anie perſonage into Portugall, whoſe wiſedome, and iudgement were knowne vnto the worlde, to the ende the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals ſhoulde not feare to treate freely with him of all matters, but it was neceſſarie they ſhoulde eſteeme him affable and curteous, to diſcouer eaſilie vnto him their minds; of which humour the reſt were not.

There hapned at the ſame time a matter which bred no ſmall woonder in this court, and in others likewiſe, the which for that it chaunced to a perſon of whom
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9072:43"/>
we are often to make mention, although it be ſomewhat from our purpoſe, we will not leaue to report. The Duke of Alua was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the kings commandement, to Vzeda, fiue and twentie miles from the court, for that <hi>Fredericke</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, being taken at Tordefillas, a village of that Realme, for that he refuſed to marrie with one of Queene <hi>Iſabella</hi> of Valoys her maides, to whom (as ſhe ſaid) he had promiſed, whileſt the king was entreated by her friends, to force him to marrie her, he by the aduiſe of his father, brake pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and was gone to Alua, to marrie with <hi>Marie de Toleda</hi> his coſen, daughter vnto <hi>Garcie,</hi> he which was Generall at ſea, the which hee effected, returning preſently vnto the ſame priſon. The Duke bare this affliction with great humilitie and conſtancie, ſo as all hatred ceaſing, his verie enimies did pittie his miſerie. This baniſhment was remarkeable, both for his eſtate, age, and the notable ſeruices he had done vnto this crowne, as alſo to ſee the integritie of the king, who notwithſtanding the neceſſitie he ſeemed to haue of his perſon in matters of importance, that drewe neere, could not cauſe him any thing to diſſemble the execution of that which he thought fit for iuſtice, or his reputation: It was alſo remarkeable for the great offices, which ſome Princes did in his fauour; but moſt of all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, who did inſtantly ſollicite his deliuerie by the meanes of his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> ſaying, that although he coulde not preſume of the kings iuſt intention, but that the Dukes impriſonment proceeded from ſome great cauſe, yet he coulde not in duty but performe this office: It was ſaide, this good will of the Pope towards the Duke, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the ſeruice hee had done vnto the Apoſtolique ſeate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made long warre againſt the Infidels and heretikes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for that which he had done againſt the Church it ſelfe, effecting that which was conuenient to his king, whileſt as enimie hee was contrarie vnto it, as he did defende it, being a friend, binding vnto him, not onely <hi>Paule</hi> the fourth, who was then Pope, but alſo his ſucceſſors. And it ſeemes ſtrange that the greateſt loue they ſay the Church had vnto him, ſproong from the warre which he made againſt it: The Deputies of Caſtill which were then in court, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, and although the king ſent them worde they ſhoulde be contented, and not ſue vnto him, for that he woulde not refuſe anie thing they ſhoulde demaund, yet this manner of demaunding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9072:44"/>
and denying ſerued for a great office. The King from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was in hope to make himſelfe peaceable Lord of the Realme of Portugall, although he were not ignorant of the ſmall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Portugals had vnto him, but hee let paſſe nothing which he thought fit to gaine their loues; and to this effect he did write to all the chiefe cities of the Realme, his pretention, offering and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but in the greateſt part his letters were not receiued in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. To the citie of Lisbone, he did write in this manner: <q>Moſt<note place="margin">Philips let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the citie of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</note> noble, and our welbeloued, although I haue appointed <hi>Chriſtopher de Mora</hi> to ſaie vnto you ſome things, which you ſhall vnderſtande from him, yet woulde I giue you to knowe by my letters, that there is no man in this world (more then my ſelfe) that hath felt the loſſe of noble king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> my nephew, and of his men: The reaſons for which I ought to haue this iuſt feeling, are eaſie to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hauing loſt a ſonne, and a friend, whom I loued tenderly, and in the ſame degree I held and hold all thoſe that are loſt with him, for I doe cheriſh and loue all them of this Realme as my owne ſubiects: And I thinke it is not vnknowne, the great diligence I vſed to diuert his iourney, as well perſonally my ſelfe at Guadalupa, as alſo before and ſince by my miniſters, whereof many of the principall of this Realme are good witneſſes: But not to reuiue ſo great a griefe, let vs lay apart the things which cannot be remedied, fixing our eies on the true conſolation, which is, that thoſe afflictions were giuen by the hande of God, and ſuffered by the greatnes of his prouidence: we ought likewiſe particularly to comfort our ſelues, that in this wretched and miſerable age, this Realme hath gotten for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour ſo Chriſtian and wiſe a Prince, as is the king mine vncle, whoſe rare vertues, and exemplarie life, giueth vs cauſe with reaſon, to expect that he will ſettle the preſent affaires in ſo peaceable an eſtate, that we ſhall proceede in all things with the mildenes and gentlenes I wiſh, for the loue I beare to all, and ſingularly for the degree of amitie, and affinitie, which hath alwaies beene betwixt theſe two crownes, and betwixt my ſelfe and the Lords of the ſame Realme, being all of one bloud, and my ſelfe and my children, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes of noble king <hi>Emanuel,</hi> being nouriſhed and brought vp by the Empreſſe, and Ladie my Mother. For theſe cauſes and conſiderations, I haue as great reſpect to the king mine vncle, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9072:44"/>
as great cauſe to wiſh him a long and happie life as your ſelues: But the affaires of the ſucceſſion of this Realme, being in the eſtate you know; I haue with great conſideration, and due aduiſe examined the right, which it hath pleaſed God by his ſecret iudgments to giue me: And cauſing this action to be viewed by men of great learning, and conſcience, both within mine owne Realme, and without; all doe finde, that without doubt the ſucceſſion thereof doth rightlie appertaine vnto me; and that there liues not any at this day that can with reaſon contradict me, by manie and cleere grounds, being a male, &amp; the eldeſt, as it is apparently knowne. And hauing reſolued to make this point knowne to the noble King mine vncle, with loue and due reſpect, I haue earneſtly entreated him, that it would pleaſe him preſently to declare it, as he is bounde, for the diſcharge of his conſcience, and for the bond he hath to doe right and iuſtice; but moſt of al for that it concernes the preſeruation, peace, reſt, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and proſperitie of theſe Realmes, and of all the ſubiects thereof, the which hee ought both chiefly to care for, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, ſeeing that beſides the ſaide effects, it ſhall cauſe an other of greater importance, which is that which concerneth the ſeruice of God our Lord, &amp; the aſſurance &amp; encreaſe of our holy Catholike faith. I thought good to doe the like office to this citie, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vnto the fidelitie, whereof it hath alwaies made profeſſion, &amp; being the chiefe of theſe Realmes, aſſuring you therwithall, that he that ſhall inherite, is no forreine king, but a naturall borne, as I haue ſaide before, ſeeing that I am nephew and ſonne to your naturall Princes, iſſued of the ſame bloude, and will be alwaies a father to euerie one of you, as you ſhall finde when it ſhall pleaſe God: But at this time I will entreate you, that with your wiſedome, and great experience, you woulde conſider and note wherein I may honour and fauour you, not onely to conſerue your liberties, and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges both ingenerall, and particular, deſiring that all other cities of the Realme, ſhoulde vnderſtande the ſame, whereof I praie you to giue them notice, being requiſite that euerie one ſhoulde know the loue and affection which I beare to all, and it ſhall be iuſt, that in knowing it, you conforme your ſelfe to that which is the will of God, whoſe iudgements and determinations no man may reſiſt, but we ought to beleeue that what he determines is for the beſt: So
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9072:45"/>
as truſting, that both this citie, and the reſt, when time ſhall require, will doe that whereunto they are bound: I haue nothing to ſay, but that beſides the feeling which I haue had of miſeries paſt, I haue beene in particular grieued for the loſſe of ſo great numbers of the Nobilitie and Commons of this Realme, whereof that battaile was the cauſe: And therefore I require you to aduiſe, what I may do for thoſe that remaine yet ſlaues, and write vnto me: for although I both haue, and daily had that care, I haue thought fit and coueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, yet ſhall I be glad to vnderſtande your aduiſe, that all thinges conuenient might bee performed for their deliuerie, and reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that whatſoeuer ſhall concerne you, I will deale in it with the loue of a father, as you ſhall know more particularlie by the effects, when as occaſion ſhall ſerue to make triall thereof, the which you ſhall vnderſtande by <hi>Chriſtopher de Mora,</hi> to whom I referre you. </q> The Catholique king ſent this Letter by the ſaide <hi>Mora,</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the Magiſtrate of the Chamber, who going for that intent preſented it vnto them: But being troubled, they doubted that in receiuing thereof, they ſhoulde offende againſt the Crowne, ſo as refuſing it, they willed him to take it with him, and deliuer it to the King, the which <hi>Mora</hi> denying, it remained ſtill with them vnope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And leaſt they ſhoulde be ignorant of the contents, he drewe a copie out of his boſome, and read it vnto them publikely, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſing ſundrie copies throughout the citie. The orignall was by the Vereadures carried to the king: This did ſmally further <hi>Philips</hi> affaires, but rather hinder him, and was by the wiſeſt both of Spaine and Portugall, and alſo by ſome of the Kings Counſell, helde as a remedie not fitting the Portugals humour; who generally hating the Caſtillians, being newe and rude in this matter, it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable<note place="margin">The deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and returne of Iohn de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</note> they ſhoulde yeelde vpon a ſimple Letter. At this time there came intelligence, that he who had the charge of Embaſſadour of Portugall, was not onely liuing in Alcazerquiuir (although ſore hurt) but that the Cheriffe had releaſed him, &amp; was comming with the bodie of King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> to Ceuta, and from thence within fewe daies (being at Chriſtmas, in the yeere 1578) they vnderſtoode he was arriued at Ciuill, his comming was (by the beſt acquainted with the affaires of Portugall) held verie profitable, for returning to his charge, he ſeemed more ſufficient then anie other to treate of ſo

weightie a cauſe, being indued (beſides his good iudgement) with many other good parts, neceſſarie for the mannaging of ſuch a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines. For beſides that he had good experience of King <hi>Henrie</hi> his diſpoſition, and the humour of the Portugals, he was verie pleaſing vnto them, it may be, for that he was of the houſe of <hi>Sylua,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verie noble in Portugall, paſſed into Caſtill, during the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies betwixt king <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, and the maſter of the Auis, and being borne of a Portugall mother, they helde him for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman: Beſides that, with the fauour of King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> he was married in Portugall with <hi>Phillippa de Silua,</hi> heire to <hi>Aluaro de Silua,</hi> Earle of Portalegra, Lord Steward of the Kings houſe, and one of the principall Noblemen of the Realme: But whileſt that euerie man expected his preſent departure from Ciuill to Portugall, the King called him to Court, ſaying, that he woulde firſt inſtruct him by mouth, of his intentions, and of the preſent occurrents. In the<note place="margin">The Duke of Oſſuna arriues in Portugall, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> meane time the Duke of Oſſuna arriued within the Realme, who ſeeming to be ſent onely to performe complements with the king, he was lodged, and roially entertained at the charge of the Court, where hauing deliuered his ſimple legation, he went to Settuuall, to viſite <hi>Magdalen Girone,</hi> his ſiſter, widow to <hi>George d' Alencaſtro,</hi> Duke of Auero, but hee returned ſodainly, making ſhewe he had newe commiſſion to treate of the ſucceſſion, wherewith king <hi>Henrie</hi> was greatly diſcontented, being vnwilling to haue the preſence of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage ſo qualified, on the behalfe of <hi>Philip</hi> as it were a witnes of his actions, the which did likewiſe diſpleaſe all the Portugals, the rather for that (with <hi>Mora)</hi> he began to ſolicite the King to declare <hi>Philip</hi> ſucceſſour of the Realme, ſhewing vnto him formerly by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that his title was iuſt.</p>

The king hearing of this, hauing called the chiefe of his Councell one after one, and acquainting them with his reſolution, he ſhewed vnto them, that it was ſo conuenient for the libertie of the Realme, ſo as all difficulties accorded, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded not to make any election of a Prince at that inſtant, but the pretendents being heard, the King ſhoulde iudge to whom the Realme belonged, that he might be declared after his death: And

although God did ſuffer (it may be for a puniſhment to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals) that the King held this Councell for the beſt, yet experience<note place="margin">An Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador choſen to goe to Rome, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for Henrie to marrie.</note> did ſhewe, that it was the woorſt courſe they coulde haue taken, for to put the cauſe in proceſſe, did breed vaine hopes in ſome of the pretendents, which after were cauſes of great ruine to the crowne. And to the end the motion of the kings marriage ſhoulde ſeeme to be ſpoken with ſome grounde, they named vnto the eſtates <hi>Edward de Caſtelbianco</hi> to goe to Rome, and treate with the Pope for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation:<note place="margin">The nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of 5. gouernors, &amp; of the iudges of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> they did chooſe fifteene gentlemen vpon the backe of the rowle, whereof the King with his owne hand ſhoulde write fiue of them, which ſo choſen, ſhoulde gouerne the Realme, vntill it were decided who ſhoulde be King. There was alſo about this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Gouernours, no ſmall controuerſie betwixt the King and his Councell of eſtates, for that the king would abſolutely name the fiue, the Councell woulde not conſent vnto it, but they would do it: And when they were agreed that the Councell ſhould name fifteene, and the King chooſe fiue of them, there grew a newe diſcord among them; for the Councell deſired to know who ſhould be theſe fiue; ſome woulde not onely haue them publiſhed, but alſo during the Kings life put in poſſeſſion of the gouernment, that after they might be the better obeied: but notwithſtanding, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to keepe it ſecret, yet generally they coniectured (and truely) who they were. They choſe alſo fower and twentie Iudges vpon the backe of the rowle, of theſe the King did name eleuen, to iudge the cauſe of the ſucceſſion, if he ſhoulde not determine it before his death: This was held, and chiefly by the Caſtillians a fault of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the king ſhewing himſelfe to be ignorant, that his roiall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction did end with his life, and that this naming of Gouernours was to rule after his death, whereof they had an example with them, of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queene of Caſtill, who in vaine preſcribed lawes for the gouernment of the Realme after her deceaſe. In this ſorte the States ended, and ſoone after the Duke of Bragance, with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,<note place="margin">The oath to obey the elected Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours.</note> and the Deputies of the Realme, ſware obedience to ſuch as the king had choſen Gouernours, and to him that ſhoulde be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red king. It would not be forgotten the manner of oath the Prior tooke, for being called before the king, and commanded to ſweare to obey the forme aforeſaid, he anſwered that he would firſt ſpeake

vnto him: The King replied, that there was no neede, but that he ſhoulde ſweare, the which he refuſing to doe, the king grewe in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; whereupon caſting his eies vpon his friendes, that were about him, as who ſhoulde ſay, that he was forced to lay his handes vpon the Euangeliſt, againſt the opinion of many, who beleeued he ſhoulde rather commit ſome diſorder then ſweare. The Rowle of the Gouernours with the nomination vpon the backe of it was locked vp in a coffer, and deliuered to the keeping of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of the Chamber of Lisbone, the people whereof were male content, fearing it had beene giuen to the Caſtillians: The which<note place="margin">The diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of the people of Lisbone.</note> was apparant, for that a little before there came boldly to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie of the Nobilitie, before the whole Councell, two mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick officers, of thoſe that repreſenting the people, are imploied to the Magiſtrate of the citie. The one of them crauing audience, ſaid, <q>they had vnderſtoode, that ſome of the chiefe of that aſſemblie, neglecting their dutie and honour, had ſpoken ſlaunderouſly, and wrought againſt the publike good, and ſuretie of the Realme, which like good Portugals they reſolued to preuent, as before the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſame citie had done in the times of king <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, and of other kings: And therefore they required the whole Councell, (as the chiefe and principall member of the common wealth) to aide and ſupport them, that they might not looſe their honor and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, thorough partialities and priuate reſpects: They ſaide alſo that for this effect, and for the defence of iuſtice, and to chaſtice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Portugals, they were readie, with fifteene or twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, betwixt the citie and the countie, which they woulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble if neede were, in two howres, to burne the houſes of ſuch as ſhoulde ſpeake too boldly, or treate againſt the publike good and quiet of theſe Realmes, the which they would not put in execution, hoping to ſee them puniſhed, and the matter redreſſed by ſome other courſe: He concluded, that he thought it their dutie to giue this aduertiſement, that with more aſſurance, they might all treate of the common good, without feare of violence, or any preiudice, and to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe, (who ſuſpected in ſuch a cauſe,) make all things impoſſible, without ſeeking or procuring of any remedie.</q> Hauing ended this ſpeech, one of the wiſeſt of the aſſemblie made anſwer, that this counſell was acceptable, for the loue and affection

they had to the common good; but there was not any one amongſt them which did not deſire it with the like zeale, and therefore they ſhould reſt aſſured, that all things ſhould be handled with good order &amp; carefully: but notwithſtanding this anſwere, they returned with threatning. This aſſembly diſcouered to the Catholique King, not onely the intention of the Portugals in theſe affaires, but alſo of<note place="margin">Henrie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to marrie.</note> King <hi>Henrie</hi> himſelfe, for that it ſeemed vnto him, they rather held a forme of conſpiracy againſt him, then a councell of the ſtates. <hi>Henry</hi> encouraged by his followers, for a time intended to marrie, dayly conſulting with his phiſitions to ſee if he were apt for generation, which ſeemed ſtrange to all ſuch as had knowen him; for euerie man beleeued (conſidering the chaſt life hee had alwaies led) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had come yoonger vnto the Crowne, he would not haue taken any wife; and now talking of it being decrepit, of age, and a Prieſt, it ſeemed, the deſire to exclude the Catholique King, from the Realme preuailed ſo much, that it did eſtrange him from his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient diſpoſition. But honors breed in men alteration of manners, although his age made men thinke his inclination was rather forced in him then voluntarie: Some of the wiſeſt ſaid that the Catholique King ſhould haue a ſpecial regard, leaſt he were abuſed in this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; for although the age and diſpoſition of the ſaid <hi>Henrie</hi> might well aſſure him, yet the matter being of ſuch importance, he ſhould ſuſpect ſome ſuppoſed or adulterate childe, or ſome ſuch like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: But hauing (poſſibly) laboured at Rome that no diſpence<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King ſends a laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall.</note> ſhould be graunted to <hi>Henrie,</hi> he ſent into Portugall Fryer <hi>Ferrant</hi> of Caſtillio, of the order of preaching Friers, and an eloquent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, the cauſe of his voyage being vnknowne, I my ſelfe being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſearch the ſecret: It was generally thought he went to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the King from marriage, with many reaſons, and eſpecially ſaying, that in ſo dangerous a time by reaſon of the Heretickes which did raigne, when as Heretickes did tolerate marriage in men of the Church, if he now did it, being Prieſt and King, he ſhould<note place="margin">The preden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the Crowne of Portugall, cited to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their reaſons.</note> giue them a verie ill preſident; and this conceit of his going was confirmed to be true, hauing vnderſtood he was neither willingly heard nor preſently diſpatched. The pretendents had beene cited, which were the Catholique King, the Dutcheſſe of Bragance, the Duke of Sauoy, the Prince of Parma, and <hi>Anthonie</hi> Prior of Crato

to ſend &amp; ſhew their reaſons. The Catholike King did not anſwere in forme, although <hi>Henrie</hi> had written vnto him with his owne hand, but onely ſent a certificat with a Secretarie to his Ambaſſador in Portugall, that he had beene cited: Many diſallowed this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and all agreed that the King, cauſing the Duke of Sauoy and the Pryor to be cited, had not dealt therein iudicially, ſaying, it was a meane to breed contention, the Prior being manifeſtly a baſtard, and the Duke apparantly after King <hi>Philip.</hi>

            <p>Whileſt theſe things paſſed in Caſtil, the pretendents in Portugal both naturall borne and ſtrangers called by citation, framed their reaſons, and euerie man laboured to make the King capable of his right: The Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> pleaded for King <hi>Philip: Charles de la Rouuere</hi> for the Duke of Sauoy, <hi>Ferrant Farneſe</hi> Biſhop of Parma for <hi>Rainucius Ferneſe.</hi> The Queene of Fraunce was not cited, yet did not ſhe deſiſt from her pretention, by the meanes of <hi>Vrban</hi> of Saint Gelais Biſhop of Cominges, who had ſome difficultie to be

diſhonour of ſo many kings, woulde come by direct line to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Realme, offering to prooue by writing out of the auncient Regiſters of Fraunce, and by the auncient poſſeſſion of the Earle of Bulloigne, that ſhe was lineally deſcended from <hi>Robert</hi> ſonne to king <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the thirde, and of the Counteſſe <hi>Matilda,</hi> his firſt and lawfull wife, and that from that time to this, all the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of <hi>Beatrice</hi> the ſecond wife of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> haue vniuſtly reigned, from whom all the pretendents to the ſucceſſion drawe their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; and therefore they coulde haue no better intereſt then their predeceſſors. <q>King <hi>Henry</hi> ſeemed nowe more colde to determine the queſtion of ſucceſſion, then the importance of the cauſe, and the ſhortnes of his life required: He was greatly preſſed by the people, (who be naturally hard to pleaſe) ſeeing his ſlow proceedings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained<note place="margin">The peoples complaint againſt King Henrie.</note> by words and writings diſperſed without authors, and were well content their griefes ſhould come to the kings eares: They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that the loſſe of the warre of Affricke, partly reſtored by his comming to the Crowne, was nowe reuiued, ſeeing their hopes that he ſhoulde preuent their imminent dangers, ſucceeded vainely: They complained that the time which ſhoulde be wholie imploied to decide the ſucceſſion was ſpent in accidentall things, contrarie to their dutie, hauing no other care but to drawe into queſtion ſuch as the king hated, to ſearch by iuſtice things of ſmall moment, to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe money of the merchants to redeeme the Portugals that were in Affricke, to treate of newe impoſitions, to the oppreſſion of the people and ſuch like (ſome whereof, as the redemption of priſoners and that which concerns iuſtice, they could not reiect as euill) they blamed the time, and the meanes that was ſpent in them: Paſſing from this diſcourſe, &amp; hauing as it were a deſire to ſpeake ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, they touched the miniſters of iuſtice to the quicke, inferring they had corrupt conſciences, that the poore were perſecuted, the rich fauoured, that all puniſhments were pecuniarie or barbarous, expreſly inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to moleſt the poore innocents, &amp; giue autority to the rich culpable, who are ſeldome puniſhed: They ſhewed againe how much a briefe deciſion of the ſucceſſion did import, and that it was no ſound aduiſe to cite the pretendents, &amp; aſſemble the States, being tedious matters, alleaging that if the king to receiue the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had no neede of theſe things, neither had his ſucceſſour, but that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9072:51"/>
he ought to decide this cauſe by himſelfe, with the aduiſe of learned and confident Doctors, and according to that which he ſhoulde finde conuenient treate the accordes and capitulations, with the greateſt libertie of the Realme he coulde, giuing contentment to the excluded, and making of many members one body, thereby to auoide the bottomleſſe gulfe of ciuill warres. And in truth this was the wiſeſt and moſt Chriſtian reſolution of all others: They did not allow of the making of Gouenours, tearming them bodies without a head, ſaying, they coulde not after the kings deceaſe, effect any good, iudging there woulde be amongſt them diuerſitie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the people woulde be altered, the great woulde diſobey, and euery one of the pretendents woulde call himſelfe king, they did foretell the Realme woulde be deuided in factions, that one would follow one party, the other an other party, &amp; in the meane time the ſtrongeſt woulde preuaile by armes. The moſt aduiſed feared the forces of the Catholique king, being neere, and alwaies readie, and although ſome truſting in his modeſtie, beleeued after the death of <hi>Henrie</hi> he ſhoulde peaceably attend the ſentence, yet ſuch as (more practiſed in the affaires of the worlde) knewe that the encreaſe of kingdomes had neither end nor meaſure, that they be neuer giuen or taken away by the opinion of Doctors, they feared moſt of all; they termed it, a diueliſh temptation of thoſe, that perſwaded <hi>Henry</hi> to take a wife, or once to ſpeake of it, ſaying, they were not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie that God ſhoulde nowe worke miracles for the loue of them.</q> The king mooued with theſe reaſons, which were partly deliuered vnto him, began more vehemently then accuſtomed, to treate of theſe affaires. And foraſmuch as the Prior, hauing taken his oath to obey the Gouernours, was retired to Almada, a citie vpon the riuer of Tagus, right againſt Lisbone, where he made his vſual reſidence, the king doubting, that remaining there, and comming ſometimes to the citie as he did, he might encounter with the Duke of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and that as concurrents in one action, and competitors in preſent, there might growe ſome perillous contention, the which was doubted, hearing there was hatred betwixt them, for this cauſe he commanded the ſaide Prior, to retire himſelfe to his ſaid Priorie of Crato, the which he did, and likewiſe to the Duke (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what later) to withdrawe himſelfe: The Prior was there cited, not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9072:51"/>
(without permiſſion) to come perſonally to the court, but to ſende<note place="margin">The letters of the Prior to Henrie.</note> his Attourneies, wherewith being grieued, he did write vnto the king, thanking him that he had admitted him to plead, and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he was in a manner baniſhed. He ſaid, that he ought not to forbid him to aſſiſt in his owne cauſe, when as the Duke of Oſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Embaſſador for the Catholique king, and the Duke of Bragance were preſent at their pleas: For beſides the diſcommoditie hee ſhoulde haue in deliuering his reaſons, whoſoeuer ſhoulde ſee him baniſhed from the Court, whileſt they treated of ſo weightie a cauſe, woulde ſuppoſe him ſo farre in the princes diſgrace, as he ſhoulde not dare to maintaine his title: But all this preuailed not, for the king woulde neuer ſuffer him to depart from Crato, and although he did obey with difficultie, going often from place to place, yet would he neuer admit him to Court. The firſt proceſſe the king put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the file, was touching the ſatisfaction the Prior pretended to giue for his legitimation, wherein he had ſecretly all the pretendents oppoſite, deſiring to haue it tried firſt (as indeed it ought to be) for vpon proofe of his legitimation, he was either to be admitted or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ſucceſſion. And foraſmuch as Princes doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly execute that carefully which they do affect, for this reaſon and to the ende the ſentence he ſhoulde pronounce thereupon, ſhoulde remaine firme, he had obtained ſecretly at Rome a briefe from the Pope, by the which he gaue him authoritie, abſolutely to iudge the cauſe of legitimation, without any forme or proceſſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of King Henry againſt the Prior tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the truth thereof: So as hauing ſtrictly examined the witneſſes, he allowed ſome reaſons, and reiected others, and duely weighed the proceſſe. Finally, he came to ſentence, framed by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Popes owne motion, wherein was reported in a manner the whole proceſſe. The depoſition of the witneſſes which were fowre, two conuinced to be falſe, for they recanted, confeſſing they had beene ſuborned by <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the other two were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, being neere kinſemen, and diſagreeing betwixt themſelues: The words of the teſtament of <hi>Lewes,</hi> father to the ſaide Prior were annexed, wherein he called him baſtard, with many other reaſons, whereby he concluded, that he declared <hi>Anthony,</hi> (theſe be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wordes of the ſentence) not lawfull, but illegitimate. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the pretended marriage and legitimation, hee impoſed him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9072:52"/>
perpetuall ſilence, ſtill reſeruing to himſelfe power to proceede againſt the witneſſes, and himſelfe as he ſhoulde thinke conuenient: This ſentence being pronounced, the king ſent <hi>Edward de Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianco</hi> chiefe of the Sergeants to Crato, with commiſſion to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende the Prior priſoner: But ſome imagined this was rather a ſhew of the king to amaze him, then for any other effect, iudging as it hapned, that he would not be found.</p>

They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied<note place="margin">Against the Duke of Parma.</note> the reaſons of elderſhip, whereon <hi>Rainucius</hi> did ground him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaying moreouer, they might well graunt it without danger, for that the ſame Doctors which fauoured this lawe, do not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it ſhoulde take place, if the ſame perſon, from whom they woulde tranſport it did not enioy it.

               <hi>Rainucius</hi> coulde not aide himſelfe with repreſentation, being out of the degree wherein the lawes allow it, and therefore remained inferior to <hi>Philip.</hi> Againſt the Dutcheſſe, they alleaged that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes<note place="margin">Against the Dutcheſſe of Bragance.</note> appertaining to the ancient lawes of nations, the ſucceſſion ought not to be ruled by the Ciuill lawe full of fictions and ſubtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the which were framed by the Emperours many yeeres ſince: And although ſouereigne Princes did bring them in for the good gouernment of their ſubiects, yet had they not altered the ſimple naturall rules of the ſucceſſion, the which they affirmed ſhoulde be obſerued in this caſe, as it had beene before the birth of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> who was the author of theſe repreſentations. And although ſome Doctors woulde raſhly make the ſucceſſion of Realmes, ſubiect to ciuill inſtitutions, yet according to this conſideration they made <hi>Philips</hi> title vndoubtfull; and thoſe which helde this opinion were learned men, and more curious of antiquitie then are commonly our ordinarie Lawyers. But leaſt they ſhoulde ſeeme to take that courſe to auoide the lawes, they woulde alſo withdrawe themſelues within the tearmes of the Ciuill lawe, as if it were a matter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwixt two perſons for a priuate poſſeſſion. There did they prooue that in Realmes more properly then in any other thing, they ſucceeded by right (as they call it) of conſanguinitie, that is to ſay, hauing regard vnto the firſt inſtituter, and that following this law, they ſhoulde conſider the perſons of the pretendents, by themſelues without repreſentations or reſpect of their fathers, as if they were childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the laſt poſſeſſor, in which ſort <hi>Philip</hi> remained in ſtead of the eldeſt vnto <hi>Henry:</hi> They ſaid alſo, that if they ſhould yeelde that which the Dutcheſſe pretends, that they ſucceede not in Realmes by right of conſanguinitie, but by that which they call inheritance, hauing regarde vnto the laſt poſſeſſor, yet coulde ſhe not be equall vnto <hi>Philip,</hi> for that the repreſentation where with ſhe pretends to helpe herſelfe, doth not extend to the Nephew, but in concurrents with the ſame vncle, according to the moſt auncient, moſt approoued, and moſt grounded opinion. They added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that the ſucceſſion of kingdomes, not onely by the right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as is formerly related) but alſo by the ſame Ciuill lawe, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from al repreſentations, being not brought in by cuſtom: And although the Dutcheſſe may repreſent the degree of her Father,

notwithſtanding it were impoſſible ſhe ſhould repreſent the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of a male, being a harde matter that a woman equall onely in degree, and in all other things inferiour, ſhoulde pretend to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a man in adminiſtration of Realmes, and that her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate defect ſhoulde hurt her leſſe, then to <hi>Philip</hi> that of his Mother: It was therefore reſolued, that of all the Nephewes of king <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> he that ſhould be founde to be eldeſt, a male, and lawfull, ſhoulde precead the reſt, and this was the Catholique King. And<note place="margin">Against the people.</note> although the pretention of the people, and of the moſt Chriſtian Queene were held vaine, and onely mooued to trouble <hi>Philip,</hi> yet did they anſwere them formally. Againſt the people they ſaide, that they had no greater priuiledge of election within this Realme, then in the reſt of Spaine, the which all fall by ſucceſſion, when there is any lawfully deſcended of the bloud royall: And that in Portugal they haue leſſe libertie then the reſt, growing from the gifts of the kings of Caſtill, and from the conqueſt of the kings of Portugall: And foraſmuch as the people hath not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the realme to their firſt kings, there could not any thing chance whereby they ſhould name or chooſe one. And for that which they alleage of the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of king <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, they anſwered that not onely this reaſon did not ſerue them, but thereby it did appeere that the realme in that caſe was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsiue, hauing (leauing apart, that it was rather a violent crie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

They<note place="margin">Against the Queene mother of Fraunce.</note> pleaded againſt the moſt Chriſtian Queene, that her pretention was improbable, and preſcribed, ſeeing that the ſucceſſours of the Earle of Bulloigne, had neuer made any mention thereof, neither is it credible that ſince this pretention was incorporate to the crowne of ſo mightie a Realme, ſuch wiſe and mightie Princes, as were <hi>Frauncis</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, woulde haue forgotten to haue called it in queſtion. But the truth was, the Counteſſe <hi>Matilda</hi> left no children as it appeeres in her Teſtament, in the publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters of Portugall, making therein no mention to leaue any by

king <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> nor to haue had any, and viewing the antiquities of the Realme, they ſaide that a writer was abuſed, who reported that a yoong childe buried in the church of Saint <hi>Dominico</hi> in Lisbone, was her ſonne; and though it ſhould be ſo, yet doth it not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, ſince ſhe doth not affirme ſhe had any children, but that he died yoong. They did likewiſe prooue that <hi>Matilda</hi> had not any, by a formal requeſt found in the ſame regiſters, by the which all the Prelats of the Realme did beſeech Pope <hi>Vrbane,</hi> that it would pleaſe him to diſanull the curſe which he had laide vpon the Realme; and that he woulde approoue the marriage of <hi>Beatrice</hi> the ſecond wife of <hi>Alphonſe,</hi> that he would make their children legitimate, that there might be no hinderance in the ſucceſſion of this Realme; whereby they concluded, that if there had beene any lawfull children of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,</hi> they coulde not haue perſwaded the Pope to preferre the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards of <hi>Beatrice.</hi> They added that theſe reaſons were not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne in Fraunce, and that of late there had beene a booke prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the genealogie of the houſes of Medicy, and Bulloigne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vnto <hi>Katherine</hi> the moſt Chriſtian Queene, whereby it did cleerely appeere, that <hi>Matilda</hi> had left no children by <hi>Alphonſe</hi> her ſecond husband, hauing beene formerly married to <hi>Philip,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Philip Auguſtus</hi> king of Fraunce, by which marriage ſhe had one daughter named <hi>Iane,</hi> who ſucceded not her mother in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, dying before her without iſſue: So as <hi>Robert</hi> ſonne of <hi>Alix,</hi> ſiſter to <hi>Matilda</hi> came to the ſucceſſion, and this is that <hi>Robert</hi> from whom they would drawe the deſcent of the Queene Mother, being the Nephew, &amp; not the ſonne of <hi>Matilda.</hi> So as not being prooued by any meanes that <hi>Alphonſe</hi> the thirde had any children by his firſt bedde, but the contrary by many reaſons; they ſaide the Queene had no reaſon to pretende, neither had ſhe done it in time. <hi>Philip</hi>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9072:54"/>
of ſucceſſion in forme as they were commanded, deliuering in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the king an ample allegation of the reaſons of <hi>Philip:</hi> But for that in the beginning they had founde the kings thoughts ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Dutcheſſe of Bragance, they laboured long in vaine to make him capable of the iuſtice of their king. They vſed all meanes they thought conuenient, and heere in <hi>Mora</hi> perfourmed great offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not onely with the King, and his fauorites, but with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Noblemen of qualitie: ſo as many with liuely reaſons, giuing to one, offering to an other, by effects, wordes and writings, he drew all he coulde to the Catholique Kings deuotion: It ſeemed that this manner of ſounding the Nobilitie with money, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,<note place="margin">Philip pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Portugals.</note> did then ſerue to purpoſe. And although the courſe which the king helde, for the attaining of his pretention, ſeemed vnto him expedient, yet did he not ſo relie thereon, as (knowing the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals to be reſtie) he woulde omit force, for that ſeeing the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>Henry,</hi> he ſought to winne time, and ſo to prepare himſelfe, that if he ſhoulde chaunce to die, at ſuch time, when as the Portugals woulde not yeeld him the Crowne quietly, he might ſodainly take poſſeſsion thereof by force. But hauing learned by experience in the warre of Granado, the loſſe of Golette, and the defence of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, that one nation alone ſheweth not ſo great a courage, as vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with another, this competencie ſeruing as a ſpurre to animate them, he reſolued to prepare to warre, with the forces of diuers nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if he had beene certaine, that of neceſsitie he muſt winne this Realme by conqueſt. And although the generall opinion were, that fewe men woulde ſerue againſt the vnexperienced Portugals, and that he ſhoulde not finde any reſiſtance againſt his force, yet knowing that there is not any humaine force but may be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, hee reſolued to make an armie of fortie thouſand foote, conſidering, that although the Portugals were ſuch as it was ſaide, yet being at home, and by reaſon of the hatred and furie of the whole Realme, they might in one day drawe togither aboue ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand men for any expedition, and therefore it behooued him to be ſtrong. He therefore commaunds <hi>Inico Lopez de Mendoſa,</hi> Marques of Moundegiar, then Viceroy at Naples, to keepe in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines his Spaniſh foote, with the ſhips and munition for Portugall, he leuied nine thouſand Italians, vnder the commaund of <hi>Peter de</hi>

               <hi>Medicy,</hi> brother to <hi>Frauncis</hi> the great Duke of Tuſcayne, hee brought downe ſixe thouſand Germaines, with Counte <hi>Ierome</hi> of Lodrone: and although he might haue raiſed in Spaine a great number of men of all ſorts, yet truſting onely to his entertained ſoldiers, he leuied the greateſt forces he coulde, purpoſing to ioine to thoſe Spaniards that were but freſh water ſoldiers, ſome of thoſe that had beene in Italy, and ſuch as were come from the warres of Flaunders: But theſe things were effected with more eaſe and leſſe nombers then were appointed. For although the Viceroy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples did in the beginning very carefully prouide for it, yet after hee grew colde, abandoning all, hauing intelligence that the King had choſen to ſucceed him in his charge <hi>Iohn de Suniga,</hi> great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Caſtill, and that he ſhoulde returne into Spaine: yet the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were inrolled and conducted with armes and munition to Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar, and other places of Andelouzia thereabouts, from whence they marched after to the confines of Portugall, the number chiefly of Italians, being greatly diminiſhed, with hunger, and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, not without conſideration that nine thouſand men ſeeme much in Spaine. And although they arriued a yeere later then the king had commanded, yet came they ſooner then neceſſity required: for <hi>Henry</hi> yet liuing, they were long idle. But this preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was done like a valiant and wiſe Prince, maintaining an armie vpon the confines of his owne Realme, <q>without vſe thereof, during a mans life, attending his naturall death, when as no man is yet ſo neere death, but may liue ſome yeeres. </q> The Catholique King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the danger to be vnarmed, and <hi>Henry</hi> deceaſing before his expences, gaue this teſtimonie, not onely of his wiſdome, but of the great deſire he had to be aſſured of this Realme, wherein he did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount his owne nature, and the cuſtome of the Spaniſh nation, who by their long delaies, doe often faile in their enterpriſes: <q>The galleies and ſhips which had tranſported theſe men, went to Saint Marie Porte, where the whole nauie by ſea ſhould aſſemble.</q>

when as the cauſe of his legitimation was in queſtion before the King, by vertue of his holines briefe, miſtruſting what hapned, had by the counſell of <hi>Alexander Formento,</hi> then the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in the Realme, ſent to Rome, complaining vnto the Pope of the hatred his vncle did vniuſtly beare him, beſeeching him to reuoke the cauſe vnto himſelfe, and to be the onely iudge thereof, for that the King was ſuſpect vnto him: By reaſon whereof, the Pope ſaying that his<note place="margin">The ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries briefe.</note> firſt intention was not to make <hi>Henry</hi> abſolute iudge to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence incluſiue; he write vnto him by an other briefe, with defence not to proceede in the cauſe, for the which he appointed as newe iudges the ſaid <hi>Nuncio, &amp; George de Almada,</hi> archbiſhop of Lisbone, but not with authoritie to giue ſentence, but after due informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the proceſſe, to ſende it to Rome. This briefe was ſent to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that he might deliuer it vnto the King, the which he did, by an apoſtolike Notarie, fearing he ſhould haue refuſed it. <hi>Henry</hi> was greatly mooued that the Pope had reuoked the cauſe vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, both for that the execution of the ſentence did import, as alſo imagining he was wronged by taking the cauſe out of his handes, whereof before he had made him iudge. So as greatly diſcontented with the Pope, and his choler encreaſing againſt his Nephew, he woulde now vſe his roiall authoritie, and leauing to proceede as the Popes ſubſtitute; he began as King to proceed againſt the Prior. And although the <hi>Nuncio</hi> (it may be by the Popes commandement, or rather by his own inclination) was fauourable vnto him, ſhewing himſelfe very oppoſite to the Catholique King: yet <hi>Henry</hi> left not daily, yet coldly, to continue the cauſe of the ſucceſſion; for hauing cited him to courte, and he not daring appeere, he cauſed his edicts and proclamations to be ſet vpon the pallace gate, whereby he was cited to appeere within twelue daies. The Prior (who had ſoone a copie of this edict from his agents) was greatly diſpleaſed, to ſee the courſe the King held againſt him, yet durſt he not appeere, fearing if he fell into the kings hands, the hatred he did beare him woulde drawe him to ſome ſtrange concluſion; he reſolued therefore to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe labouring to appeaſe his wrath by letters, which he did write vnto him, complaining of the manner of his proceedings in<note place="margin">The Priors letters to Henry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He did aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate his baniſhment with no ſmall preiudice to his credite, at ſuch a time as his competitors were fauoured, inuironed with their kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and demaunded iuſtice face to face: He alleaged that his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes briefe which the king had obtained againſt him, was ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and full of diſcurteſies, nothing agreeing to the honor of his father: And although he had obtained an other contrary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whereby his holines had reuoked to himſelfe the knowledge of the cauſe, yet was he reſolued not to alter any thing, but to paſſe his daies in miſerie and ſorrow, whileſt the euill deſerued paſsion of the king ſhoulde continue: He lamented to haue beene forced to giue in his proofes within two daies, much more time being granted to any other that pretended; and that they had giuen no anſwere to many things he demanded. He complained grieuouſly of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and commandement, to apprehend him for ſubornation of falſe witneſſes, the which he denied, although he ſaide that in the kings publike ſeate of iuſtice, ſuch as had produced falſe witneſſes, were not greatly puniſhed: He ſeemed to be greatly greeued to be called diſobedient, &amp; a troubler of the publike quiet of the realmes, excuſing himſelfe with moſt vehement wordes: He lamented that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:9072:56"/>
the Realme was ruined, which his predeceſſors had woone, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and maintained: He made no mention of appearance, but ſaide it was lawfull for him as to theeues, to hide himſelfe and flie the face of iuſtice, adding, that if the faults wherewith hee is charged were ſuch, as the lawes of the Realme command the Church to redreſſe, for that he hath no ſure acceſſe, it woulde pleaſe his highnes to graunt that <hi>Crato</hi> ſhoulde ſerue as his ſanctuarie. And although (if his ſinnes ſo required) that being Nephew to the king, the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Realme, his humble and obedient vaſſall, it coulde not mollifie his vncles hart, he woulde craue at Gods hands, remedies for his afflictions: He required with humilitie that it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to appeale from his edicts vnto the king himſelfe, better inſtructed, demaunding copies thereof to contradict them, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that if it might not be graunted, yet at the leaſt his letter might be annexed to the proces, for if due reſpect would haue ſuffred him, he woulde haue cauſed it to be ſet vp in the ſame place of the edicts, for the diſcharge of his honor, and to make knowne to the worlde that he was vaſſal, nephew, &amp; faithful ſeruant vnto the king. </q> This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did nothing mooue the kings hart, but wrought the ſame effect with his choler, as a little water doth to a great fire: For being more incenſed againſt his Nephew, he proceeded ſtill againſt him. So as within ſhort time he pronounced a newe ſentence, not as a Iudge, ſubſtitute by his holines, but as an abſolute king, that it might not be ſubiect to any appeale, ſuppoſing by this meanes (ſeeing hee coulde not caſt him into priſon) he ſhoulde baniſh him the Realme.<note place="margin">Henries ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prior.</note> Wherin repeating his faults, his abſence, his contumacy, his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, with the premiſſes (as was) that he had made to drawe the Nobilitie &amp; people to follow his faction; he depriued him of all his iuriſdictions, preheminences, honors, prerogatiues, liberties, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what other recompence ſoeuer he had from the kings his predeceſſors, commaunding he ſhoulde be raſed out of the bookes, and not paide any thing, not holding him for a naturall borne, but a forraine to theſe Realmes. He pronounced the like againſt ſuch as ſhoulde aide him, lodge him, or any way treate with him: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to depart the Realme within fifteene daies, ſaying, it was expedient for the ſeruice of God, of him, and the peoples quiet. But notwithſtanding this ſentence ſo ſeuere, yet was it not of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:9072:56"/>
force to expell the Prior, for being wel beloued of his friendes, and common people, he remained ſafely in ſecret: And although for a ſhew onely he had retired him ſelfe into a monaſterie of Caſtill, yet he ſtaied not long there, onely to procure a certificate (as he did) of his departure: whereof king <hi>Philip</hi> being aduertiſed, he was aduiſed by ſome to take him priſoner, both to be aſſured of him, &amp; to pleaſe <hi>Henry;</hi> but he thought it not then conuenient, whereof after he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him, for <hi>Anthonie</hi> being returned againe into Portugall, it was generally thought that he was ill affected, and grieued with the king, for the ſentence he had pronounced againſt him. <hi>Henry</hi> grew fearefull he ſhoulde attempt ſomething againſt his perſon, which ſo encreaſed, that (beſides his ordinarie guard) he raiſed certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of ſouldiers for the aſſurance of himſelfe, and his Courte, a thing at any time vnſeene in that Realme. At this time the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors<note place="margin">Henrie changeth his opinion to the benefit of Philip tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſucceſſion.</note> of <hi>Philip</hi> had made <hi>Henry</hi> capable of his title: hauing laide before him, both the good and euill which might enſue, by giuing and taking from him the crowne; who being enclined to do iuſtice, mooued therewithall, &amp; with the feare of war, hauing wel conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the matter, and laid aſide all affection which made him inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Katherine,</hi> he reſolued with all his power to giue it vnto <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> by the beſt meanes he coulde deuiſe. And hauing imparted this his meaning to the Duke of Oſſuna, and <hi>Chriſtopher de Mora,</hi> he ſaid he woulde ende the cauſe by way of compoſition betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> and the Realme, without proceeding vnto ſentence: Prouided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that the Catholique king ſhoulde graunt certaine priuileges; not diſpoſe the offices of gouernment and iuſtice, but vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Portugals, and giue certaine graces &amp; exemptions, to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall good of the Realme. Heere plainly appeered the errour of <hi>Henry,</hi> who hauing cited all the pretendents, and brought the matters to tearmes of iuſtice, thought it after wards more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to come to compoſition with <hi>Philip,</hi> which ſhoulde haue beene formerly done, if it were to be done. Theſe capitulations were ſent vnto <hi>Philip,</hi> to Madrill, whom <hi>Henry</hi> entreated to keepe them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, as one that feared a contrarie diſpoſition in the people. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee were not ignorant, howe hard the quiet execution of this his will woulde be, by reaſon of the people, and ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of contrary faction; yet commaunded he it ſhoulde be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9072:57"/>
to the ſtates, with all the mildenes it might be. Some hold that father <hi>Leon Anriquez,</hi> of the order of Ieſuits, the kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, was rather the cauſe of this his vnexpected reſolution, then the practiſes of the Catholique kings miniſters, and that from him (in whom the King did greatly truſt) proceeded his firſt inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Dutcheſſe of Bragance, but fearing the indignation of <hi>Philip,</hi> he turned the thoughts of <hi>Henry</hi> to fauour his title. By means whereof in October 1579. he called againe the deputies of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and other eſtates, vpon colour to impart vnto them a matter of importance. <hi>Philip</hi> diſallowed this reſolution of <hi>Henry,</hi> to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the States, for being aſſured of the ſmall affection the Portugals bare him, he was moſt aſſured that aſſembling them togither, they woulde neuer agree to yeelde him the Crowne, and therefore hee aduiſed the King, without any other aſſembly, to declare a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, ſeeing in the laſt Eſtates held at Lisbone, the whole Realme had giuen him full power, the which if he would vſe in this controuerſie of the Realme, and not make any new conuocation of Deputies, he ſhoulde write to euery citie in particular his intention, and aduiſe, thinking it more eaſie to perſwade them deuided, then vnited in one body: But <hi>Henry</hi> not daring effect it, did ſollicite the comming of the Deputies. In Italy (ſeeing the Catholique King a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſemble ſo great forces) they made diuers coniectures thereof, they furniſhed the places of ordinarie ſuſpect, with newe garriſons: ſome beleeued he that had entred league with the Cheriffe, <hi>Mulei Hamet,</hi> that both iointly togither would attempt Alger, ſuppoſing the Moores had propounded this enterpriſe for feare of the Turkes, and that the king with his aide woulde expell them from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo necre neighbour vnto Spaine. The Pope vnderſtanding the contrarietie in Portugall, ſeeing the Catholique King prepare ſo greatly to armes, he commaunded <hi>Philip Sega</hi> his Nuncio in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillia to ſay vnto him, that although he knewe theſe preparatiues of warres, were againſt Infidels; yet ſeeing the eſtate wherein Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſtoode, it might bee ſuppoſed it was intended againſt that<note place="margin">The offers of Pope Gregory. <hi>13</hi> to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like King.</note> Realme, and being dangerous to come to armes, and to ſtirre vppe the humours which cannot be ſetled at pleaſure, hee offred himſelfe to be a mediatour betwixt him and <hi>Henry,</hi> and to ſettle this buſines peaceablie. The king accepted the Popes offer in generall words,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9072:57"/>
entertaining his Nuncio with delaies, without giuing him any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute anſwer, for that (as it was ſaide) many things did trouble his minde concerning this action. He conſidered of the one ſide that being of good yeeres, and his heires but yoong, enioying (except the ſtate of Flaunders) all his countries quietly, it was not fitte to ſtirre vp humours in Spaine; beſides, being fearefull to other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they woulde not willingly ſee him augment his dominions, he doubted (that in buſying himſelfe in Portugall) ſome woulde then take occaſion to breede ſome alteration in his territories, and therefore hee willingly gaue eare to any treatie of peace. On the otherſide he was not well aſſured of the Popes diſpoſition, ſeeming he ſhoulde preiudice his title, to put it to compremiſe: beſides, that to former preſidents, he woulde not willingly adde this of new, to acknowledge the Apoſtolike ſeate as a iudge of Realmes. He thought it leſſe danger to attend the ſentence of <hi>Henry,</hi> then of any other, for pronouncing it (hauing not acknowledged him for iudge) he was not bounde to obey, if it were in his disfauour, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill the right of armes; by reaſon whereof in this ſuſpence, he forbare ſtill to giue the Nuncio his anſwere, vntill that being better aſſured of the diſpoſition of <hi>Henry,</hi> he made anſwere, that his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt being ſo apparant, and the King ſo well enclined, there needed not any mediation, the which if it were requiſite, he woulde accept of this office, &amp; of the good zeale of his holines. The indiſpoſition of <hi>Henry,</hi> and the diſquietnes of his minde, did much afflict him, <q>ſo as he reſembled a lampe neere extinct, the which ſometimes yeelds a great light, ſometimes ſeemes quite out:</q> They feared he ſhoulde die of an accident which hapned, and therefore his Counſell thought good not to attende his death, for the declaration of the Gouernours, but to put them as it were in poſſeſſion, the which was partly executed. For the King being halfe dead, they brought vnto him the coffer wherein the Rowle was kept, with the names of the Gouernours in the great Church of Lisbone, and hauing opened it, they founde them to be <hi>George Dalmeda</hi> archbiſhop of Lisbone;<note place="margin">A publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors of Portugall.</note>

Many others alleaged, that although hee were a baſtard, yet they ought to giue him the Realme, being the neereſt allied of the bloud royall: Others in whom hatred to their neighbours preuailed more then any other inclination, ſaide, that whoſoeuer had intereſt to the Realme, yet ſhoulde they by no meanes giue it to the Catholique King, but rather come to armes, vaunting themſelues to be valiant. They added moreouer that they woulde demaund aide from Fraunce, and England, whereof they were aſſured, and hauing them, they doubted not to ſeate a King, at their pleaſures: There were ſome, yet fewe, but of iudgement, who comparing the forces of Portugall with Caſtill, founde they coulde not flie the yoke of the Catholique King, and although with great griefe, yet they hoped it might prooue a gentle amitie, and that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9072:59"/>
theſe Realmes vnited togither, Portugall might reape great profit, by the commerce &amp; traffique. Many ſpake after their owne humors, ſaying, that <hi>Anthony</hi> leauing the habite of Saint <hi>Iean</hi> ſhoulde marrie with the daughter of the Duke of Bragance, and being vnited togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they needed not to feare.

And ſome ſay, that <hi>Henry</hi> laboured to effect this, but <hi>Philip</hi> ſoone reſolued him, ſaying, that he coulde not do it, but to preiudice the Prince his eldeſt ſonne, fearing by this meanes to leaue a ſeminarie of diuiſion in Spaine betwixt his deſcendents. The perſwaſion of the Catholique Kings Agents, with the Nobility were of great effect, by reaſon whereof there were few Gentlemen, amidſt this diuerſitie of opinion, but either did willingly encline to the ſaid King, or corrupted held their peace, and retired themſelues from Court, auoiding all occaſion to declare themſelues. Of the fiue Gouernours choſen, three were drawne to the Catholique Kings deuotion; and although we ſhould not be amazed, to ſee the common people (who by cuſtome inconſtant and without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) holde the woorſer part, yet did it breed a woonder in many, that the Portugals in generall, euery one according to his qualitie, framed in their mindes a reſolution, contrarie to that which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they ought to haue done, in a matter of ſo great importance, in the which they ſhould haue taken greater conſideration: For that ſome diſcourſed without paſſion, that the Nobilitie (accuſtomed to be reſpected of the King) ſhoulde flie the obedience of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King, being credible, that <hi>Philip</hi> (according to his cuſtome) woulde with lawes and his power, keepe them vnder, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that the people ſhoulde embrace him, whom he doth equally fauour, yeelding them equall iuſtice.

But leauing the iuſtice and will of God aſide, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, examining the honors and blames, the loſſes and profits, which by the one or other meanes, might happen: as for honor, they ſhoulde not take for any diſgrace, and obedience which fell by lawfull ſucceſſion, alleaging that the States of Caſtill, (when as king <hi>Emanuell</hi> did inherite) being ſtrong enough to defende them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues if they woulde, receiued him curteouſly. And when as the Archduke of Auſtria, (although a Germaine) did ſucceed him, they did the like. They mocked at ſuch as ſaid that Caſtill ſhould be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Portugall, but not Portugal to Caſtill; proouing, that no Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall euer came neere this Court, but he was embraced &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie honoured; many of the principall houſes of Caſtill being iſſued from Portugall. They did contradict with liuely reaſons, ſuch as feared to be oppreſſed, like to the eſtates of Flaunders, Naples, and Millaine; ſaying that in Flaunders they had alwaies vſed the people with great kindnes, that they had beene gouerned by their owne nation, &amp; that the Spaniards had no charge there: That many of the principall had rebelled againſt the church of Rome, &amp; againſt their king, the which he woulde not ſuffer, that in this enterpriſe (more for that which concerned the good of the Church, then for any other reſpect,) the King had ſpent 50. millions of gold, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for enimies, both Germany, Flaunders, &amp; England, they could not take theſe countries from the Kings poſſeſſion, but hauing meanes (graunting free libertie of Religion) to be abſolute Lord, and to reape thereby great profit, he would not accept thereof, onely for the remorſe of his conſcience, preferring the ſeruice of God before all other reſpects: They ſaide that the Neapolitanes and Millanoyes had beene conquered by force, weake of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and enuironed with enimies, that they were not burdened, neither coulde he do leſſe then maintaine garriſons, inferring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that if they were peaceably inherited, they ſhoulde haue libertie like good and faithfull ſubiects, and maintaine with more force that which their fathers had gotten, without feare of any thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; but if they ſuffered themſelues to be conquered by armes, they ſhould be Neapolitanes, Millanoyes, and poſſiblie woorſe. They commended the Portugals, as faithfull, obedient, and indued with commendable parts, blaming the baſenes of ſuch as were not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9072:60"/>
aſhamed to thinke, they coulde be ill intreated of any prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. They ſaid, that ſince <hi>Philip</hi> was reſolute, and that hee had written to the cities of the Realme the aſſurance of his action, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in fourteene yeeres hee had neuer abandoned the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe in Flaunders being farre off, hauing ſo many kings oppoſite, and the Flemmings ſuing to be ſubiect vnder iuſt conditions, that it is not credible he woulde deſiſt from Portugall being ſo neare, ſo weake without ſuccours, and hauing ſo great an intereſt: they repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ioy the deeds of the Spaniards, ſaying, that when as Spaine takes armes, he doth impriſon the king of Fraunce, and the greateſt of Germanie; makes the Turke to turne his backe, takes from him Malta, diſſolues his armies, maintaines continually in Flaunders an armie ſounde and luſtie, breaking and diſperſing his enimies, and yet the Noblemen of Spaine remaine quietly in their houſes. From their valour, they came to the conſideration how Portugall woulde reſiſt ſo great a Monarch, entreating them with affectionate words to haue regard thereunto. They ſaide that the comfort of men of iudgement, was to ſee the ſmall force of the Portugals, for if it were greater, they might for a time make ſome reſiſtance, conſidering their obſtinacie, iudging that in the beginning of this warre, the kings of the Indies woulde preſently become Lords of the ſea coaſt, the Moores woulde aſſaile the places of Affricke, the French and Engliſh woulde attempt the Iſlands, ſome woulde vſurpe on one ſide, ſome of another, not onely to the loſſe of the Realme, but of all Chriſtendome. They brought in the example of King <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> ſhewing that he was loſt for not meaſuring his forces: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the conſideration had beene eaſie, many proteſting againſt it, and many foretelling the future euent, yet God tooke from them their vnderſtanding, as he doth from thoſe whom he meaneth to puniſh, and in this manner he hath depriued them of iudgement, who aduiſe to take from the Catholique King the ſucceſſion of the Realme. They compared the amitie of Caſtill with that of Fraunce, reporting the wrongs and pyracies, which the French being at ſea had daily done to Portugall, and the ſmall reckoning was helde of them that had complained, and contrariwiſe the concord and reſt which ſince the laſt peace made with the Caſtillians vntill that day, they had enioyed, without the breach of any one article, blaming
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9072:61"/>
the manner of the French, ſaying that they ſought nothing elſe but to be admitted, and after to become maſters; the which not ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they ſtriued to be admitted to plead, the equitie of their Kings cauſe, ſeeking alwaies occaſion to complaine. They added, that if the election were in the people, and that the Catholique king had no entereſt, onely to be free from the French, they ſhoulde vnite themſelues with Caſtill, that they might liue in peace, and bridle this French furie, which hath often throwne the Portugals aliue into the ſea, and ſlaine their gouernors and the Kings captaines, by their Kings commiſſion; for by this vnion, beſides the ſeruice of God, the French would feare and not ſpoile ſo boldly at ſea. They commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded king <hi>Henry</hi> as iuſt and holie, ſaying, that the beſt reſolution they coulde take, was to fall at his feete, beſeeching him that ſeeing the Catholique king was the moſt honorable, the moſt neereſt, and the eldeſt kinſman that he had, that in the name of God he ſhoulde ſweare him Prince, according with him of the moſt neceſſarie points, for the libertie of the Realme, and ſhewing themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeable to the bequeſt ſometimes made by king <hi>Emanuell:</hi> That they ſhould not looſe this occaſion during his life, but (laying aſide their obſtinate interceſſions) labour iointly to flie the warre, and not be forced to yeelde to Caſtill at ſuch time, when as it ſhoulde not be acceptable, perfourming the which they ſhoulde not onely preſerue their owne goods, but inherite others, ſeeing the greatnes of Caſtill doth indifferently admit all ſubiects Spaniards, to the greateſt dignities; bringing for examples, that the Archbiſhop of Toledo, and the office of the Preſident of the Councell roiall, which be the higheſt dignities ſpirituall and temporall, were not then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioied by Caſtillians. They proteſted that if they ſtopped their eares to the truth, and did open them to apparant lies, they ſhoulde feele within their owne home warre, with the murthers, ſpoiles, theftes,<note place="margin">The Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals anſwere to the Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> and burnings it bringes with it. On the other ſide the Portugals made anſwere to their letters, ſaying, they deſired no warre, but woulde defende themſelues againſt any that ſhoulde attempt it: They alleaged many reaſons of their iuſtice and force, with aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent examples of the holie Scriptures, whereas ſmall numbers in a iuſt cauſe haue vanquiſhed a great armie. They refuted that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God by the vnion of theſe Realmes would fortifie in Caſtill
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9072:61"/>
an arme of the church, ſhewing many grounds, wherby they ſhould iudge the contrarie, blaming the ſacke of Rome, and ſome other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthy actions of the Caſtillians. They laboured much to prooue that the Prior of Crato was legitimate, &amp; that King <hi>Henrie</hi> had bin a moſt paſſionate iudge in that cauſe. They ſpared not to touch the reaſons of the Dutcheſſe of Bragance, ſhewing that ſhe ought to precead the Catholique King in the ſucceſſion. They condemned the ſaid King, ſaying, that diſtruſting his Title he had prepared to armes: They ſhewed by a long diſcourſe, that the vnion of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall would neither breed them profit, nor honour, but loſſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour, were the conditions neuer ſo ample and good: drawing examples from Flaunders and Aragon, ſhewing that the behauiour of the Spaniardes in the Low-countries, had beene the cauſe that thoſe people had rebelled againſt God, and againſt their temporall Lord: <q>They did obiect that all nations ſubiect to the Catholique King, were reputed his ſubiects in matters of charge, and burthens of the warre; but in honours, recompences, and exemptions, they were vnknowen:</q> They valued not the Kings forces, ſaying, that if it were fearfull to other Prouinces, yet was it not ſo in Spaine, beeing apparent, that by reaſon of the barrennes of that countrey, he could entertaine no great Armies, neither durſt he for the weaknes of the places draw in mercenarie ſouldiers, bringing for example the war of Granado, where incountring but with fower diſarmed Moores, there was ſo great daunger with the loſſe of ſo many men. They added moreouer that the King had not at this day one Captaine of account, naming a number which were of the Seminarie of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth who were all dead, and not any other which had ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, imitating the Kings humour who loues reſt more then armes; by meanes whereof he had not augmented his Realme, but loſt Goletta, with the States of Flaunders, and had yet made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loſſes, had there beene other Kings liuing in this age, but that in Fraunce, England, and Portugall, the Scepters were in the hands of women and children. They concluded that it was not credible, that the Catholique King, notwithſtanding his threatnings, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared forces, woulde take armes in Spaine, for that his forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnited (he was in daunger vpon the leaſt contrarie euent) that ſome of his Prouinces would rebell againſt him, and that the French
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9072:62"/>
(being a ſtirring nation) would imbrace this occaſion: beſides that, being now old and the howres of his death vncertaine, hee ſhould conſider, that not inioying the Realme of Portugall in peace, and dying with an Armie in Spaine, hauing no heires but pupilles, hee ſhould leaue them in danger, not onely to be depriued of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Portugall, but alſo to be much troubled in Caſtill and his other Kingdomes of Spaine, labouring to prooue, that the Kings were not there beloued as in Portugall. Then began the yeere 1580. a yeere full of miſeries and afflictions for the Portugals, not onely by reaſon of the warre which followed, but alſo for the dearth and plague; for that the ſeaſon hauing beene verie drie, the fruit of the earth was in a manner all loſt, neither had the husbandmen in many places reaped what was ſowne; beſides there came not from Fraunce and Germanie ſuch quantitie of corne as was vſuall: But<note place="margin">The plague in Portugall, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> this miſerie was ſupportable in regard of the reſt, for neuer was the ſcarſitie ſo great, but things neceſſarie would be found for money: That of the contagion was moſt cruell, for hauing runne through Italy, Germanie, England, and a part of Fraunce, it came finally into this Realme, from whence it ſpread throughout all Spaine, but moſt of all in the citie of Lisbone, hauing begonne lightly the yeere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it increaſed at the entring of this ſpring, and ſo augmented all ſommer, but declined in the fall. This contagious mortalitie (ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it may be of God for our ſinnes) proceeded not from any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Aire, but from infection; and was brought into the Realme, by men and merchandiſe from countries infected, for the citie being a great part vnwalled, and of great traffique, it could not eaſily be guarded. The naturall inclination of the aire, the filch of the citie, their feeding of fiſh (which all generally do vſe) and the ill order, nay the great diſorder of the magiſtrate of the health, in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the ſicke from the whole, and in all other things touching his charge, did helpe to increaſe it. The ſuddennes wherewith it did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and kill in a manner all thoſe that did frequent the ſicke, as fire doth in powder, ſtrooke a great terrour in the citizens, their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and diets were moſt vncertaine: for although that many did phiſicke themſelues diuerſly, and were gouerned in ſundrie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet there died infinite numbers of all qualities, experience did teach that the application of lenitiue things, the drinking of Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes

horne, and the Bezars ſtone were moſt ſoueraigne remedies,<note place="margin">Bezar ſtone excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the plague.</note> yet to manie it did no good. The greateſt part of the Nobilitie, (and of ſuch as had ability to do it) retyred themſelues to their gardaines, and farmes in the countrey, where (although the whole countrey were infected) yet did they ſeeme to liue more aſſured, or at the leaſt out of the infection, &amp; from the horrible ſpectacle of dead bodies, which were howerly ſeene in the citie, where the mortalitie grew ſo great that there was nothing to be ſeene but Beeres with dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for the buriall whereof (the churchyards being full,) they were forced to vſe the ſtreets and fieldes.</p>

               <note place="margin">The States of Almerin.</note> At this time were aſſembled in the citie of Almerin where the king remained, all the Deputies of the Realme, being called thither: The citie of Lisbone made election of <hi>Emanuell</hi> of Portugall, and <hi>Diego Salema,</hi> who went not, but were reiected of the King, as ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and depriued of their offices, in whoſe place they made choiſe of <hi>Phoebus Moniz,</hi> and <hi>Emanuel de Soſa pacheco:</hi> The ſaid <hi>Salema</hi> was not beloued of the king, for that before as Vereador of the citie of Lisbone, he ſaide vnto the king, that they vnderſtoode he went about not onely to iudge to whom the Realme appertained, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to make a compoſition, the which he ought not to doe, without hearing the people: whereunto the King hauing anſwered, that the people was not capable of this matter, he replied, that he woonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king ſhoulde iudge this people incapable, whom he had held to be moſt ſufficient to raiſe him to the crowne, wherewith <hi>Henry</hi> was greatly mooued. This alteration of Deputies miniſtred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſcourſe vnto the worlde: for it ſeemed the King had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe againſt the people, and that not accepting their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Deputies, he woulde drawe by force from the States what he<note place="margin">Henry chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Deputies of Lisbone, and the cauſe.</note> pleaſed, but ſuch as knewe the true reaſon, and howe that <hi>Emanuell,</hi> and all thoſe of the houſe of Portugall, deſerued in this caſe to bee repelled, commended this act: Theſe were ſuſpect, foraſmuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> of Portugall, Biſhop of Guarda, brother to the ſaide <hi>Emanuell,</hi> alwaies eſteemed more then he was, woulde not onely precead his equals, but did ſcarce beare any reſpect vnto the Cardinall before he was king, whereof grew a great hart burning; ſo as the Cardinall to debaſe him, hauing drawne foorth a certaine information of his ill behauiour, libertie of life, and ill gouernment in his Biſhopricke,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9072:63"/>
ſent it to Rome, ſo as the Biſhop (as it were forced) went to his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to purge himſelfe. Hee was much grieued with this croſſe, for paſſing by the court of Caſtill, the Catholique King being infour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his voyage, woulde not ſuffer him to viſite him, although he were entreated: ſo as now although the Cardinall were come vnto the Crowne, their hatred continued, and hauing no other meanes of reuenge, then to oppoſe himſelfe to his reſolutions, ſeeing him enclined to giue the Realme to the Catholique king, he laboured all he coulde to let it, by meanes whereof, he ſeemed at one inſtant to be reuenged of two kings: for the effecting whereof, there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired togither the Biſhop; <hi>Emanuell</hi> his brother; <hi>Franncis</hi> earle of Vimioſo his nephew, (for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarieties, that both <hi>Alphonſe</hi> his father, and he had with the Cardinall) with other their kinsfolkes and friendes, fauouring <hi>Anthony</hi> Prior of Crato, they reſolued to make him king, truſting to the peoples humors.

that the ſucceſſion appertained vnto him, but that King <hi>Henrie</hi> made anſwere, he muſt be better enformed, &amp; heare the parties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the ſame ſecceſſion, entertaining him in this ſort vntill he had knowledge vnto whom it appertained by right, and being now ſatisfied, finding there yet reſteth ſome doubt betwixt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King and the Dutcheſſe of Bragance, he knew that making de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration by way of iuſtice, it might breed many inconueniences and troubles to the Realme, being alreadie expoſed to manie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: </q> And therefore he found no better courſe then to determine the ſucceſſion by way of accord, if he ſhould die before the King of Caſtil, for by that meanes he ſhould prouide for all things fit for the Realme, giuing ſatisfaction to him that ſhould haue the ſtrongeſt pretention: And although the matter were ſtill in doubt, yet the King had thought it the beſt courſe, as they ſhould well finde, and if they would conſider thereof, being of ſuch importance as his Highnes had thought it conuenient to impart it vnto them, and with their counſell to determine what ſhould be moſt neceſſarie, for the ſeruice of God and the profit of the Realme. That hee did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it vnto them, that with quietnes of mindes, and the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the diuine ſeruice and the common good, they ſhould treat and conſider of this matter, giuing the King preſent knowledge of their opinions: This Ambaſſage did greatly alter the councell, who expected an Ambaſſage from the King, whether he would admit their demand concerning the election, and ſeeing they treated with them of a matter halfe ended, laying aſide what the Ambaſſador had propounded, they reſolued to ſend backe to the King to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate an anſwere of their Ambaſſage, which done they profited no more then before: But to <hi>Phebus Moniz</hi> (one of thoſe which went, who poſſibly ſpake without reſpect) the King made anſwere, with great patience; That he ſhould haue come accompanied with cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; whereunto he replied, that it was reaſonable, ſeeing his Highnes would giue the Realme vnto the Caſtillians: Let him giue it to any Portugall whoſoeuer, they were all contented. The day following the Biſhop returned to the aſſembly, and without any anſwer to the Deputies demaund, hee ſaide vnto them in the Kings behalfe; That his Highnes vnderſtood that ſome of the Councell were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, ſuppoſing the accord whereof he had made mention ſhould

be betwixt the King of Caſtill, &amp; the Ducheſſe of Bragance; which being contrarie, he thought it good to explaine his meaning, that the accord which he laboured, was betwixt the King of Caſtill and theſe Realmes, and to let them vnderſtande that ſentence was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be giuen in fauour of the king of Caſtill, and therefore they ſhoulde conſider how much more fit it were to ende it by accorde then by ſentence, that they ſhoulde well conſider of that which he had ſent to be deliuered vnto them, for being a matter ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to the Realme, it was neceſſarie that all ſhould be capable. The Biſhop being departed, many of the Deputies grewe in choler, ſome of them ſaying, that the Biſhop (affected vnto <hi>Philip)</hi> had forged this Embaſſage of himſelfe, and that it was not credible, the King had deliuered it thus vnto him. Many ſpoke freely, and ſome ſought to interrupt him before hee had ended, ſeeming vnto them that the king not anſwering their demaunde, made ſmall account of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie, ſaying, that he coulde be no iuſt iudge of this cauſe, ſeeing he had declared his intention: But weighing better if they ſhould confeſſe that he had pronounced it as a king and iudge, they were bound to obey, they beganne to ſay, he had made no declaration, holding it in ſuſpence. They ſent to the aſſemblie of the Clergie, to let them vnderſtand what had paſſed, and to complaine, and to the King likewiſe, to demaund an anſwer, who (anſwering them that he woulde ſende) did preſſe them to reſt ſatisfied, and to commit the care of this reſolution to ſome fewe of them; whereunto the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties woulde not agree, fearing leaſt the authoritie of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents might force them, or corrupt the iudges, proteſting openly that they woulde neither conuent nor accord with the Caſtillians: But King <hi>Henry</hi> ſeeing the Deputies obſtinately forcing an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to their demaund, finding he coulde neither drawe them to compoſition, nor to compremit the matter to fewe, fearing if hee ſhoulde pronounce the ſentence, they woulde make ſome excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reſolued to make ſhort, to graunt that which they demaunded: For which cauſe he ſent backe the Biſhop the thirde time, who with a more pleaſing audience then before, ſaide vnto them in the kings behalfe. That ſeeing the accord he had propounded did not ſeeme pleaſing vnto them as vnto his Highnes, he woulde make no other motion, but woulde admit them to pleade the intereſt they had in

The Portugals were puffed vp with hope, by this permiſſion to elect a King at their owne pleaſure, and therefore many more haſtily then they ſhould, declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, proteſting they would rather yeeld to any then to the Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians: And not onely the common people, but many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſaid the ſame, whereof many ſhewing themſelues too ſeditious, were baniſhed the aſſemblies, whereas ſuch as ſeconded the Kings will (beſides the promiſes of the Catholike Kings Agents) were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured and rewarded by <hi>Henrie.</hi> The pretendents to the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were diſcontented with the Kings inclination, ſome complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, others diſſembled: The Duke of Bragance relied greatly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wiues Title: The Biſhop of Parma comming to the aſſembly of States, complayned publikely of the King with graue wordes, to whom <hi>Emanuell de Soſa</hi> made a wiſe anſwere, aſſuring him of the Kings intent to doe iuſtice: whileſt the matter ſtoode vpon theſe termes, the King grew ſo weake as he could not riſe from his bed,<note place="margin">King Henry ſicke.</note> giuing ſignes of a ſhort life, yet did he not leaue to the hower of his death to prouide for all things neceſſarie.

He was Biſhop, Gouernour of the Realme, Inquiſitor Maior, legate Apoſtolique, and King. But the more he mounted, the more he diſcouered his incapacitie; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelfe in greateſt matters to be ruled by his miniſters, not being able to determine the cauſe of the ſucceſſion.

that in ſo yong an age, he was ſo great a louer of his countries good, offering if need were to ſacrifice him for the ſeruice of the Realme: Yet this feare of the Dukes continued not long, for hauing written to his ſon that he ſhould labour to come away, or they ſhould make declaration of his ſtaie, he was ſuffered freelie to depart; for ſo the King had commaunded. Some ſay that <hi>Philip</hi> had long before this conſideration, hauing meanes to ſtay him, not onely in Spaine, but alſo in Affrique, but fearing to incenſe the Portugals, and deſirous to make the Duke his friend, he had procured his releaſe in Affrick, and ſuffered him ſafely to depart from Andoluzia into Portugall: yet the ſaid Duke of Barcellos or his father, by whoſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was directed, was noted of ſome ingratitude, for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited by <hi>Philip</hi> to paſſe by his court as deſirous to ſee him, the iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of the State of theſe Realmes preuayled ſo much that he did not ſatisfie his deſire, but tooke his direct way to Villauizoſa, fearing perhaps a new detention.</p>

But deſirous to ſatisfie his conſcience in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof, he had formerly the aduiſe of <hi>Diego de Chiaues</hi> of the order of preaching Fryers, being his confeſſor, and of ſome other principall Diuines of that order, and yet not well ſatisfied with their opinions, leaſt he ſhould ſeeme onely to follow the aduiſe of the dominical Fryers; he deſired likewiſe to treat with other orders of religious perſons, and to that intent he ſent one to acquaint the chiefe Deuines in Spaine with the cauſe, and to demaund their aduiſe: <q>This care perfourmed, not only with the chiefe prelates and readers in Diuinitie, but with the Ieſuits and the Fryers of Saint Francis, all agreede that the Kings right being ſo apparant he was not bound to repreſent it otherwiſe then out of iudgement to King <hi>Henrie,</hi> as he had done, and to make his councell and the reſt of the Realme of Portugall capable thereof, ſuch as with ſinceritie of hart would vnderſtand the truth, and by the mildeſt meanes, procure (as

But the King being aſſured of his right, prouided of forces, and ſeeming no blot to his conſcience, made anſwere that he was well pleaſed with the ſhew of zeale to the publike good of theſe realmes, and that he was perſwaded that what they had propounded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a good inclination: that he would haue bin glad their demand had bin ſuch as he might haue ſatisfied them, the which he wil do alwaies in matter that ſhall be iuſt, &amp; tending to the generall or particular good of theſe realmes.

The<note place="margin">The Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors prepare for defence.</note> Gouernors prepared to defend themſelues, for although the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them were not of that opinion; yet to content the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to pleaſe the other Gouernors and gentlemen of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar faction, it behooued them ſo to do.

that he ſhould name to euerie office: Frier <hi>Emanuel d'Euora</hi> being then Prouinciall, all the Religious went vnto him, ſaying; <q>That he was not iudicially choſen to that charge, and therefore he ſhoulde renounce his office, and they would chooſe another according to the Statutes:</q> The Frier (to whom this ſeemed of harde digeſtion) oppoſed himſelfe to their demaund, with many reaſons, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying many words, both of the one ſide and of the other, they did forceably put the Prouinciall priſoner in a Seller, vſing him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hardly in their choler: The kinſmen to the Prouinciall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this diſorder, ranne for remedie to <hi>Alexander Formento</hi> then Nuncio for his Holineſſe in that Realme, who vnderſtanding the reaſons of both parties (although the Religious proteſted he was not their Iudge) yet he commaunded the Prouinciall ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, and reſtored to his charge, citing ſome of the Religious men of the Monaſterie before him as ſeditious: The Friers (to whome this ſentence was ſignified by a publike Notarie) would not obey; So as the kinſmen of the Religious priſoner, crauing aide from the ſecular power, the Gouernours ſent the officers of iuſtice of the citie of Lisbone to the Couent, with three Enſignes of ſoldiers, to ſee this ſentence put in execution by force, who being come to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the Friers ſhut their gates, leauing the Church open; where notwithſtanding the grate of wood which ſhuts vp the great Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and the Sepulchres of kings was cloſe, they went into the quire ſinging their Letanies: But after the officers of iuſtice had knocked a while at the Couent gate, and no man opening it, entering into the Church they burſt downe the grate of wood, ſo as the ſoldiers comming into the Cloiſter of Friers, they laide hold of ſuch Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons as they met, with ſmall reſpect of their prieſtly order: And although the elders came with their Croſſes, Buls, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, it nothing preuailed, for they muſt of force deliuer the Religious man, and reſtore him to his former eſtate, the which they did, proteſting they had vſed violence, and that they woulde complaine to the Apoſtolique ſeate.

head with a Curtelax, by <hi>Anthony Soarez,</hi> whereof he died ſoone after: the which the Prior had cauſed to be done, for that <hi>Pyna</hi> in his office, had not onely ſpoken ill againſt him, but alſo laboured to draw the officers, and all the Councell of the Chamber, to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Kings deuotion: <hi>Anthonie</hi> deſired to reuenge himſelfe in this manner; and the offender (who knew better how to ſtrike then to flie) being hurt by the Sergeants, and retired into a Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the citie, was taken priſoner by the Iuſtice, and after ſome daies of impriſonment was hanged, and quartered, the which execution was done with trouble and feare, leaſt the people ſhoulde deliuer him: For the authoritie of the Gouernours declining, the miniſters of iuſtice were not reſpected: And for that they knew this murther was committed by the commaundement of <hi>Anthonie,</hi> the people were inclined to ſaue him. The Religious for the like reſpect (allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that the ſecular power could not iudge him being taken in the Church) came running likewiſe to the place of execution to ſuccour him: And had not <hi>Damain D' Aguiar</hi> (a ſeuere and reſolute officer) had the charge thereof, who ſuddenly put this ſentence in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was ſo great a concourſe of people, crying, and of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men with their croſſes, and excommunications, that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had been eaſily reſcued. Theſe diſorders diſpleaſed the louers of religion, and quietnes, who blaming ſomewhat the Friers, for not ſuffering their Prouinciall, quietly to ende the terme of his charge, yet did they attribute more fault vnto the gouernours, for ſuffering in ſuch a ſeaſon ſo publike and rigorous an execution, againſt the religious, and chiefly vpon a Monaſterie ſeated vpon the banks of Tagus, ſaying, that if for no other reaſon, yet ſhoulde they haue forborne, in reſpect that many Engliſh and French ſhips anchored there, whoſe men infected with hereſie, would reioyce to ſee the religious in the hands of Sergeants. The death of <hi>Pina</hi> was held for an indiſcreet and cruell reſolution of <hi>Anthony,</hi> for being but a matter of ſmall moment, to be reuenged by ſo foule an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vpon an olde man, alawyer, and of meane condition, he had thruſt himſelfe into an exigent either to be held vnthankfull in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Soarez</hi> to die as he did, or elſe to doe violence vnto iuſtice. But for that princes hate the executioners of their follies, for in their life doth liue the remembrance of their errors; euen ſo the Prior
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9072:80"/>
hated this man, after the offence committed, neither did he labour to ſaue him, although his death made him contemptible to the people. The ſaid prior was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Almerin, laboring the cauſe of his legitima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, &amp; ſolliciting the iudges to decide the ſame, who excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that they could not do it, (obſeruing the lawes of the realme) if he retired not himſelfe 25. miles from the Court, that in ſo doing they would looke into the cauſe: But for that the Duke of Bragance and the Ambaſſadors of other princes were there preſent, he would not depart, &amp; for this reaſon the matter ſurceaſed: at this time <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> of Portugall, who remained at Belem, laboured ambitiouſly that <hi>Iohn Teglio,</hi> one of the gouernours, his brother in lawe, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to himſelf in opinion, (principally in the excluſion of <hi>Philip,)</hi> ſhould be ſent to Belem, with authoritie from the other gouernours to prouide by his preſence for all things neceſſarie, ſeeming a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hard to effect at Almeryn: The other gouernours deſirous to be rid of his companie, and not daring to contradict any thing that ſeemed to concerne the defence, gaue him authoritie, and ſuffered him to goe to Belem: There he conſulted with <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with ſome difficultie, the money borrowed of the merchants, he reſolued (for the gathering together of a greater ſumme) to ſell the iewels of the Crowne, the which were there, and therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be brought foorth, he dealt with ſome merchants vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the price. The Duke of Oſſuna was then returned into Caſtill, leauing <hi>Mora</hi> in Portugall, with the other Ambaſſadours that were Lawyers, who vnderſtanding the iewels were vpon ſale, the ſaide <hi>Mora</hi> in the name of the Catholique King, required the ſaid gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours not to ſell them, as appertaining to the King, proteſting both againſt them and the buiers, that they ſhould be bounde to reſtore the price at their owne charge, ſo as they found not any that woulde deale with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> being at Merrida as it was ſaide, hauing by a long prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation required the gouernors to deliuer him the poſſeſſion of the Realme: The Biſhop of Coimbra and <hi>Emanuel de Melo</hi> returned<note place="margin">The anſwer of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique king to the Portugals.</note> the ſecond time, making the like propoſition to the King as they had done at Guadalupa, offering to put the cauſe to arbitrement, and complaining he had giuen them too ſhort a time to reſolue: But <hi>Philip</hi> being now well reſolued what he would doe, and infour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9072:80"/>
of the aide the Portugals demaunded from other princes, he made them the like anſwere as before: Many iudged the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe Ambaſſadours to be ill grounded, ſaying it was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely thing to require the King to make himſelfe ſubiect to the iudgement of nominated iudges, ſeeing that King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe (who with more appearance of reaſon, might pretend to be lawfull iudge in this cauſe) did neuer require the King to acknowledge him for iudge, neither did he euer declare him contumax, in the cauſe debated with the pretendents for not acknowledging him.</p>
            <p>The Catholique King came to Badagios the 20. of May, where the Portugall Ambaſſadours laboured to perſwade him, making ſuite, that before the taking of armes he ſhould admit an aſſemblie to the eſtates, but they were no more admitted to audience; the king reſolued to ſend his anſwere vnto the gouernors, and to publiſh it throughout the whole realme in the name of his Councell, the which he did as followeth: <q>That experience had taught that by two examples of the eſtates laſt held at Lisbone, and at Almerin, they wrought no good effect, in fauour of the apparant right of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, but in the one, and the other, they had ſtill laboured to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it, ſeeking lets, and delaies, which might haue bred the loſſe thereof, and therefore it ſeemed a treble error to attend againe a new aſſemblie of theſe eſtates: That they haue no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that his Maieſtie had giuen them too ſhort a time to reſolue, accounting from the day of the receipt of his letters the xiij. of March, (by the which he required them to ſweare him) ſaying they made no good computation, if they ſuppoſed he were diſpoſſeſſed of the realme, but from the time that he demaunded it, appertaining vnto him from the hower of King <hi>Henries</hi> death: but that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie had expreſſely contained himſelfe a moneth and a halfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making of any motion, to the ende they ſhould not looſe the thanks, by calling him to the ſucceſſion whom God had called; and might haue leiſure amongſt themſelues to make cleere this bond by which they were tied, and giue ſatisfaction, making the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents capable of reaſon, to the ende they ſhould not hinder the publike quiet, and that they might be interceſſors for them and for the realme, which courſe the king himſelfe had taught them: That their excuſe might be taken in two ſenſes, ſaying, they coulde not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:9072:81"/>
receiue his Maieſtie but in a generall aſſemblie of eſtates, their meaning is, either that they cannot doe it by right, or that they may not doe it, for that they dare not: In the firſt caſe they are deceiued, for there needes no aſſemblie of eſtates, when a king makes his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie vnto the realme, although he ſucceede not to his father, but to his kinſeman; neither were they neceſſarie when as <hi>Henry</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his nephew. In the other caſe that they cannot doe it, becauſe they dare not; the excuſe is good, but not to binde the king, neither in iuſtice, nor conſcience, to deſiſt from taking the poſſeſſion of his goods, if the delaies make the meanes difficult. That this deceit ſhould grow from the opinion they haue conceiued, that in the end, all that they can doe for his Maieſtie, is to conſigne him the realme by accord and compoſition; not remembring that he receiued it not from their hands, but from God and by his owne right, ſo as theſe words of capitulations, tranſactions, and accords be neither proper, nor fit; for if they looke vnto the preſeruation of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and priuileges, they ſhould not be called accords, but bonds, the which his Maieſtie muſt accompliſh, as lawfull king of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: And if they referre it to that which is newly to be graunted them, much leſſe doe they deſerue that name, but rather of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, greatnes, and meere grace, whereunto his Maieſtie, for the bountie and loue he beareth them will binde himſelfe, with all the aſſurance they can demaund, ſo as the eſtates were neceſſarie, when as the realme might diſpute vpon theſe graces, and chooſe another king whom they pleaſed; but hauing no authoritie, but to intreate for the augmentation of theſe fauours, the eſtates had nothing to doe with his entrie: That they deliuered all theſe things onely to make plaine the matter, with the rigour of truth, without any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Maieſtie, to refuſe ſuch graces, as had beene offered on his behalfe, or to giue the aſſurance they ſhould require for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof; neither doth he ſtande vpon the meanes, termes, or words which ſhall be requiſite, to giue full contentment to the realme, although they be in effect the ſame with capitulations and accords: That as the inconueniencie they alleage wants ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and reaſon, ſo thoſe which are preſented in his Maieſties name were ſo preciſe and neceſſarie, as they admitted no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, although that he deſired to ſatisfie their demaunds, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:9072:81"/>
ſought to doe by effect in any thing he could. That it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the armie now marching and approching ſo neare, it cannot turne head, nor entertaine it ſelfe, for that the victuals in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are conſumed, and that which they haue in ſtore would be ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; beſides it is a dangerous matter to entertaine an armie obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo long time at ſea, and therefore were moſt reaſonable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of this burthen: That although his Maieſtie be eaſily perſuaded that the greateſt part of thoſe which require him to ſtay, doe it with a good and ſincere intention, yet can they not denie but another ſort of people deſire and labour to hinder him by the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that may happen, and to cauſe him to looſe the opportunitie, wherein he might imploy his galleys vpon the coaſt of Portugall, knowing the ſeaſon for veſſels that goe with oares to bee quickly paſt: That ſince his Maieſtie came from Madrill, he hath ſought all poſſible delaies, hauing (as they know) ſpent three monethes in his voyage, to the end they ſhould want no time, to vnderſtand, agree, and accommodate themſelues; but although the time had beene continued a whole yeere, it is apparant the buſineſſe had beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing aduaunced, hauing ſpent ſo many daies in ſuperfluous reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, during which they might haue aſſembled their eſtates, and forgotten them: And whereas on the one ſide they offer to holde them with breuitie, on the other ſide (being now the moneth of Iune) his Maieſtie vnderſtandeth, that neither the Prelates, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, much leſſe the Deputies of townes are arriued, and that the elections are not yet made in many cities, hauing intelligence that they delay them by cunning and ſubornations; whereby it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that theſe eſtates would rather breede a confuſion, then any good effect: And although the ſmall fruit they may hope for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, be euident; yet doe they not beleeue his Maieſtie will hinder them vntill his entrie into the realme; but being entred, hee will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine that which ſhall ſeeme fit for the ſeruice of God, of himſelfe, and of the generall good of this crowne, bee it by meanes of the eſtates or otherwiſe, ſeeking alwaies the moſt profitable, for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſubiects of the ſame realme: That his Maieſtie cannot (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſhould ſhut his eies) reſt fully aſſured of their propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſeeing his good ſubiects in theſe realmes, oppreſſed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, vnder colour of an vniuſt reſiſtance, which they cal defence,

and thoſe onely perſecuted, and ill intreated, which follow his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and acknowledge the truth of his Title, whereas contrariwiſe thoſe which are paſſionate and ſlanderous perturbers of the peace, good and publique quiet, are fauoured: That to conclude, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie would haue their workes conformable to their wordes, for otherwiſe they cannot blame him, if he proceede cunningly: And that they may vnderſtand with how great reaſon he diſtruſteth their delaies, he did ſignifie vnto them, that he had certaine and late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe from many prouinces, that at the ſame time when as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him with faire words to ſtay and attend, they did with great inſtance demaund ſuccours from other nations, making ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes moſt hurtfull to the good of the Church, and the peace of all Chriſtendome, although God would not ſuffer them to trouble it: That although with the helpe of God his Maieſtie would ſoone enter into Portugall with mightie forces, yet ſhould they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he came to make warre againſt them, but would labour all he could that none ſhould receiue hurt, but ſuch as did oppoſe themſelues obſtinately to his iuſt poſſeſſion, hoping they would not any waies hinder him, but would willingly make eaſie all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, to the end that by their good ſuccours, his Maieſtie might this ſommer turne his force againſt infidels.</q>

They iudged Settuuall (whither they had called the eſtates, although with ſmall hope to holde them) more fit then any other, being a walled towne and a port of the ſea, and therefore deſired to withdraw themſelues thither: They had deuiſed (at the leaſt three of them) to aſſiſt the Catholique King, for his entrie into the realme,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9072:82"/>
in deſpite of ſuch as ſhould prepare for the defence, eſteeming this ſtrong place fit for that effect, there to bring in the kings armie at ſea, and ſo to fruſtrate the fortification which <hi>Emanuel</hi> of Portugall had made in the mouth of the riuer of Tagus: but they could not bring their purpoſe to paſſe, for the deputies of the laſt eſtates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, diſcouering their intention, ſaid, it was fit they ſhould all ſtay at Saint Arem, ſo as fearing to giue greater cauſe to ſuſpect, they coulde not depart: They added moreouer, that leauing the Prior there with the deputies, in a time when as the Catholique king ſhould begin to take armes, they might in their abſence vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of defence erect a tyrannie. So as ignorant what courſe to take, or how to redreſſe things, they did (being friends) by their irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more hurt to the Catholique king, then they coulde haue done being enimies: for the king (hoping theſe woulde haue deliuered him the crowne) proceeded ſlowly with his armie. At that time it chanced that <hi>Iohn Gonzalez de Camera,</hi> Earle of Caglietta, died of the plague at Almeryn, ſo as the Gouernors tooke this occaſion to depart from thence, and went to Settuual, with the Duke of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, the Agents of the Catholique King, and others of their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for hauing created captaines, &amp; placed a garriſon, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the gates to be guarded. The Catholique King hauing aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his armie neere to Badagios, &amp; receiued aduertiſement that his nauie was at Saint Marie porte, ready to ſet ſaile, before they ſhould enter into Portugall, not yet well ſatisfied with the diligence he had vſed (as it is ſaide) with many Diuines; deſired to conſult againe in the Vniuerſitie of Alcala, where the profeſſion of Diuinitie flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth moſt in thoſe realmes, vpon his entrie in armes into the realme, and the propoſition made by the Portugall Embaſſadors: And to that effect hauing aſſembled all the doctors, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">The dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Catholique King vpon his entrie by force into Portugall, made by the Diuines of Alcala.</note> aboue thirtie, hauing made their praiers and ſupplications vnto God, in their ſacrifices; and the matter conſidered by euery one apart; it was diſputed of in three ſeſſions: For although the matter were not hard to decide, yet was it graue and new: All, without any diſagreement, concurre in opinion with the firſt, with whom the King had conſulted, &amp; without viewing of their reaſons, they ſent a publike decree vnto the King. There was propounded vnto them three articles: I he firſt, that the King being certaine to ſucceed by
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9072:83"/>
right, after the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> to the realmes of Portugall: whether he were in conſcience bound to ſubmit himſelfe to any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall iudge, or arbitrator, who might adiudge him the realmes, or put him in poſſeſſion thereof. The ſecond was, that the realme of Portugall refuſing to acknowledge him for their Prince, vnleſſe he woulde firſt ſtande to iudgement with the pretendents: Whether he may of his owne authoritie, take poſſeſſion thereof by force, againſt ſuch as ſhall make reſiſtance, preſuppoſing that there is no doubt or ſcruple of conſcience in his title whatſoeuer? The thirde was, that the Gouernours of Portugall, alleaging that they and the whole realme, haue ſworne not to receiue any for King but him that ſhoulde be iudicially ſo declared, and that they may not receiue the King otherwiſe, the rather for that the pretendents complaine and offer to ſtande to iudgement: He deſired to know if the ſaide Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, and the whole realme, may pretend this oath for an excuſe not to receiue him for King. <q>To the firſt they anſwered, that the King was not bound in conſcience, to ſubmit himſelfe to any Iuſtice or arbitrement, ſeeing that he had of himſeife priuate authoritie to adiudge vnto himſelfe thoſe realmes, and to take poſſeſſion: They excluded (eſpecially from this authoritie of iudging,) all Princes, and ſuch as might pretend to take any knowledge thereof. And firſt humblie ſaluting the Pope, and the Apoſtolike ſea, they denied, that this iuriſdiction did appertaine vnto him, the cauſe being meerelie temporall, and nothing concurring where by his holines ſhould vſe that indirect authoritie which he hath in temporall cauſes, ſo farre foorth as they concerne the ſpirituall good: They ſhewed he was not bounde to the cenſure of the Emperour, for that the Kings of Spaine were ſoueraignes, not acknowledging the Emperour in any thing, and much leſſe to any other King. They prooued he was not ſubiect to the common-wealth, nor the realmes of Portugul, ſaying, That when as common wealthes doe chooſe their firſt King vpon condition to obey him and his ſucceſſors, they remaine ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to whom they haue transferred their authoritie, no iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction remaining in them, either to iudge the realme, or the true ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, ſeeing in the firſt election, all the true ſucceſſors were choſen: Being therefore moſt apparant there is a true ſucceſſour; it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that the common wealth of Portugall hath no iuriſdiction to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9072:83"/>
iudge of him that doth truely ſucceede, and that the King hath as great a warrant not to be ſubiect to the cenſure of this common wealth, as he hath to be true ſucceſſour. And as touching the eleuen perſons of the fower and twentie which King <hi>Henry</hi> had named; they ſaide that <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe coulde not be iudge of him that did ſucceede after him, for that after his death the office of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring iuſtice was expired, and all his authoritie and iuriſdiction paſt vnto his lawfull ſucceſſor. Againſt arbitrators they ſpake little, onely that the bond of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>premiſe had no place, when as the equitie of the cauſe was not doubtfull, as it was ſuppoſed. They anſwered them which ſaide, that the King had no intereſt to the realme of Portugall as King of Caſtill, but as kinſeman to King <hi>Henry;</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof, he coulde not in this caſe challenge the preheminence he hath as King of Caſtill, ſaying, that this imaginarie diuiſion cannot bee made in the perſon of the King, for it is ſo annexed to the dignitie royall, that his perſon cannot be wronged, but the dignitie woulde ſuffer. And ſeeing the Prince may lawfully make war vpon an other Realme, for iniuries done to his brothers and friends confederats, with greater reaſon may he do it, in taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Realme which appertaines lawfully vnto himſelfe. They made anſwer to ſuch as ſaid, that (obſeruing the ciuill &amp; canon law) a matter litigious, ſhould be iudged where it happeneth, and therfore this ſhoulde bee decided in Portugall, ſaying, that theſe deciſions ſpeake of particular perſons, who haue their ſuperiour Iudges, and not of ſoueraigne Princes and their dependancies. To the ſeconde article, they anſwered with more reaſons then vnto the firſt, ſaying, the King was not bound to any thing but to ſignifie vnto the Gouernours his Title and certaine intereſt to the Crowne, and if notwithſtanding this demonſtration, they ſhould make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then the King by his owne authoritie might take poſſeſſion of the Realme, (vſing if neede required) force of armes, for that in this action it can not bee termed force, but a naturall defence of the Realme which is his owne, and a iuſt puniſhment of Rebels. To the third, they ſaid that this oath could not binde them that had vndertaken to obſerue it, ſeeing it is moſt certaine, that neither in Portugall nor elſe where, any iudge may determine this cauſe with the King.

That the hope of victorie was in all humaine conſideration certaine, both in regard of his iuſtice, and force, as alſo for the weakenes of his aduerſaries: That the difficulty to vndertake it by a miniſter was great, and proper in that caſe; the King not entering into Portugall to ſubdue cities, but to winne their harts; not playing the part of a conquerour, but of lawfull Prince; who entreth with neceſſarie forces to ſuppreſſe the ordinarie alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of realmes, newly gotten, as he had proteſted to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and eſtates of the realme; that ſuch offices for ſo important cauſes coulde not be committed but to the perſon of the eldeſt Prince, being a commiſſion vnfit for any childe or nephew, much leſſe for a captaine Generall, being a Caſtillian of nation, moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious both by nature, and for the great and important affaires which he had mannaged; beſides being for his owne particular hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9072:84"/>
to the Portugals: They ſaide it was moſt certaine if the King entred the realme in perſon, of friends he ſhoulde make faithfull ſubiects, of newters friends, and of enimies newters; where as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the Duke woulde make his friendes newters, his newters eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and his enimies obſtinate rebels: With theſe reaſons and others, ſuch as iudged the Kings preſence neceſſarie in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, fortified their opinions: On the otherſide it was ſaide, that when the reſolutions of the one ſide haue ſo great difficultie, as they draw neere to impoſſibilities, there is no diſputing what is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but of force they muſt obey neceſſitie: that the queſtion of the Kings entring into Portugall was of this nature, ſeeing that by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers accidents the ſtrength of the armie was ſo weakened, that it was both in quantitie and qualitie moſt different from that which had beene ſet downe, for there wanted aboue ſixe thouſand ſouldiers<note place="margin">The Kings army wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.</note> of them which had been leuied, the number of the Spaniards which came out of Italy was greatly diminiſhed, and there wanted halfe of thoſe that were new raiſed, and the bands that came from the lowe Countries could not arriue in time. If theſe which were the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the armie had beene ioyned, and the number appointed in the beginning aſſembled, the King might wel haue perfourmed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe in perſon, for then had he made the way open for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of men &amp; munition, from the frontiers vnto Settuual, leauing garriſons in al places to receiue &amp; conduct them. But wanting horſe and foote neceſſarie for the action, there was no other remedie but to runne the fortune of two great daungers: The one was to conduct all the victuals with the armie, which would cauſe a new and monſtrous forme of Campe, wanting horſemen to couer their carriages: The other of no leſſe importance was, that the life of theſe men depended vpon the inconſtancie of the ſea and winde, which ſhoulde conduct the armie from Andelouzia to Settuuall, with the other victuals and munition to ſerue the want of thoſe whom they tranſported. And although the Duke conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe with the number of his ſoldiers, he did it truſting to his owne dexteritie, and the ignorance of his enimies: And if he hoped to ſurmount theſe dangers, he grounded his opinion vpon the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals vnskilfulnes to preuent him, entertaining him behinde with continuall skirmiſhes to conuoy him, the which if they could effect
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9072:85"/>
were dangerous, for there by they ſhould force him to turne backe and fight with diſaduantage of the place, where they might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, or ſtaied from paſſing the armie ouer the riuer of Tagus, the which were to put a battaile in compremiſe, for the humours which might daily ariſe; beſides there were ſome difficultie to ioine the two parts of the armie, the one being at ſea, the other at land, &amp; vneaſie to ioine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at a limited time, &amp; the delay of 20. daies would hinder the effect for a yeeres imploiment; ſo as they concluded that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of war, nor of ſtate, the King ought to hazard his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this enterpriſe, <q>for that neither induſtrie, nor fortune be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrants for the ſafety of Princes, who ought not to ground their reſolutions vpon an others weakenes, but vpon their owne proper forces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whileſt that matters in Caſtill ſtoode on theſe termes, and that the Portugals grew daily more arrogant and confuſed, it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with ſmall inſight how this realme ranne headlong into ruine:<note place="margin">Confuſion in Portugall.</note> For al being confounded with vanitie, no man knew what he would do, no man was reſolute what he ſhoulde execute, and if any were yet blinded, they knewe not what courſe to take: The Gouernours being at Settuuall, aſſembled the eſtates, being amazed to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Duke of Alua was in fielde, reſolute to inuade the realme preſently: On the otherſide that <hi>Anthony</hi> was at Saint Arem, incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Deputies, that they ſhoulde not go to the Eſtates, practiſing the diſorder which hapned after. The Duke of Bragance preſſed them, ſhewing his griefes in publike, it may be for not proceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humour. The Embaſſadors of the Catholique King gaue them no time to breath. <hi>Iohn Teglio</hi> was at Lisbone, preparing for defence, with whom they had no good intelligence: They deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to content all men, yet feared the peoples furie; they laboured much and prouided for nothing. The cities cried for armes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues, or to haue permiſſion to yeeld; they anſwered in generall tearmes without any effect; they receiued letters from the Duke of Alua, who accuſed them of crueltie, ſaying, they obſerued not the cuſtome of all nations, which is,<q> that when an armie enters maſter of the field, they commaund all places which cannot defend themſelues, to yeeld, to the end they may auoide the violent courſe of warre, to ſlaie all ſuch as make reſiſtance,</q>  whereas not vſing of

this rigour they ſhall be forced to bring the cannon before euerie cottage, and make the warre perpetuall, &amp; yet this letter neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to ſet a reſolute order to any towne. They were wel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to giue the realme to the Catholique King, yet coulde they not conclude for the effecting thereof. They feared in a manner to be ſtoned if they diſcouered this intention, and therefore they woulde not hazard themſelues, looſing daily all hope to bring the matter to that paſſe, that the King ſhould acknowledge the crowne from them as they pretended: Beſides the King being wholie of an other minde, they knew not what they could do, if they had would. The people (who flatter themſelues much and endure little) ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the defence was eaſie, euery man ſhewed himſelfe a lion, for the defence of his owne houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet woulde they not go armed to fielde. Thoſe of the houſe of Portugall, and the other aduerſaries to the Catholique King, were in no leſſe confuſion then the Gouenours; for hauing beene obſtinate in their opinions, they found they had mooued the indignation of <hi>Philip</hi> againſt them without profite: And although they were more confident in the defence then they ought to be, yet did they feare the kings proteſtations, by the which demaunding poſſeſſion of the realme, he threatned ſuch as ſhould withſtand him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Agents of the Catholique King laboured to ſuborne thoſe as they had the reſt, yet it preuailed not, <q>for being in the beginning obſtinate, confident in the midſt, and diſtruſtfull in the end to obtaine pardone, they woulde neuer agree: </q> yet left they not to hope, that the more they proceeded in the defence, the better they ſhoulde let the King vnderſtand their forces, and might compound with greater aduantage: And for that the warres conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the Gouernors ſuppoſed, that in this forte the King ſhoulde acknowledge the crowne from them: But he being well enfourmed of all theſe matters, and hauing treated with many frontier townes of Portugall to yeeld, hauing imparted vnto them the equitie of his cauſe, by ample allegations, entreating them not to be the cauſe of the ruine of the realme, hauing cauſed <hi>Peter de Velaſco,</hi> ſoueraigne<note place="margin">The taking of Eluas.</note> iudge of Badagios to write to ſome particulars, he firſt attempted Eluas as neereſt vnto him: The Citizens fearing they ſhould either in deed or worde be firſt ſet vpon, attended daily this Embaſſage; They were deuided as it often happens into two contrarie factions;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:9072:86"/>
the one enclined to the obedience of <hi>Philip;</hi> the other, vnder colour of liberty, &amp; fidelity to the Gouernors, would by no meanes receiue him for their Lorde. The heades of the firſt partie were <hi>George Paſſano,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rodrigo Paſſano</hi> brothers, followed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Citizens, whom they call Eſquires: On the other ſide was <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny de Melo</hi> captaine of the citie, whoſe opinion was followed by the greateſt part of the Nobilitie, but in farre leſſe nnmber then the reſt, whereas euery man ſpake his minde openly. <hi>Diego de Meneſes</hi> had beene there a little before to fortifie the citie, and ſeeking to enlarge their ditches, he found it a matter of ſome difficultie, ſo as he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without effecting any thing, ſaying, that he would returne with armes, which the Gouernours ſhoulde ſende; whereof failing, the Citizens knew well they coulde not reſiſt. True it is, that the King had long before prepared their mindes by the meanes of Frier <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> of Fonſeca, a preaching Frier, kinſeman to the <hi>Paſſani,</hi> a noble familie, and well followed, enclined from the beginning with al their followers to the deuotion of <hi>Philip:</hi> he vſed all meanes to drawe the reſt vnto him; yet the day of Th'annunciation of the bleſſed Virgin, this religious man preaching, labouring to perſwade the people to the Kings obedience, they did not willingly heare him: So as now when he ſought to take poſſeſſion thereof, hauing diſpatched many meſſengers to the Biſhop, and <hi>Anthony de Melo,</hi> in the ende he ſent <hi>Peter de Velaſco</hi> with letters to the principall of the towne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation to receiue this citie to his obedience. Being arriued at Eluas the xvij. of Iune, with eighteene men vnarmed, although the gates were ſhut by reaſon of the infection, yet was he preſently let in by the iudge of the towne, and going to the church of pittie, he cauſed the Biſhop, the Magiſtrate of the chamber, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to be aſſembled, to whom he deliuered the letters which the<note place="margin">The Kings letters to them of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas.</note> King had written, containing in ſubſtance, that the matter being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant that the ſucceſſion of the realme belonged vnto him, he had ſent the ſaide <hi>Peter</hi> with procuration to receiue it vnto his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if they woulde yeeld it, adding vnto his kinde wordes many offers: And although the Biſhop, <hi>Melo,</hi> and the Magiſtrate of the chamber, receiued theſe letters and read them, yet the Nobilitie did not accept them ſo eaſilie, for that ſome feared to commit an errour, and others debating who ſhoulde receiue them, they did
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9072:86"/>
not accept them, yet they agreed that Frier <hi>Anthony de la Cerda,</hi> Prior of the Monaſterie of Saint Dominick ſhoulde receiue the letters for the Nobilitie, and bring them to the cathedrall church; ſo as all letters being read, <hi>Melo</hi> and the Magiſtrate (who preceaded the reſt) demaunded eight daies libertie to conſult, and to giue their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, intending in the meane time to ſende to the Gouernours: the which <hi>Velaſco</hi> would not graunt, but ſaide vnto them, that he woulde preſently returne, wiſhing them to aduiſe, and not to cauſe the armie which his Maieſtie had ſo neere to march to their loſſe: yet they ſent <hi>Gaſpar de Britto</hi> to Stremos, where <hi>Diego de Meneſes</hi> generall of that prouince remained, to aduertiſe him of what had paſſed, remaining thus in ſuſpence vntill the next day. When as the <hi>Paſſani</hi> enformed of <hi>Melos</hi> intention, contrarie to their will and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, reſolued to kill him, if he refuſed to yeeld, and had alreadie incenſed the people againſt him, cauſing many to giue out pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that they woulde be Caſtillians: <hi>Velaſco</hi> went after to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell to perſwade <hi>Melo</hi> in priuate, to make the matter more eaſie, and not to ſhewe himſelfe (without reaſon) enimie to the King: But it was in vaine, for he ſaide, that he had receiued this place from the Gouernors, and that he woulde not yeelde it to any man without their commandement: If it were adiudged to appertaine vnto the King, he woulde preſently yeelde. Standing vpon theſe tearmes, there appeared by the commandement of <hi>Velaſco</hi> about the towne ditches, neere ſixe hundreth horſe armed, who ſeaſed vpon the wels and conduits of water, which ſerued the inhabitants for their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, putting the Portugals into great feare; ſo as nowe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began to crie, and to curſe <hi>Melo,</hi> and all thoſe that woulde not yeeld obedience vnto the king. Some yoong men induced by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> partiſans, ſeeing into what danger the captaine had brought the ſafety of the citie, reſolued to kill him: and going to the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall church where they were all aſſembled, they attended at the doore to effect it when he ſhoulde come foorth; but diſcourſing with the Biſhop who perſwaded him, ignorant of the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was, a nephew of his named likewiſe <hi>Anthony de Melo,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the caſtell in what danger his grandfather was, came foorth with certaine Harguebuſiers to his ſuccour, and came in time before he was yet iſſued out of the church: Old <hi>Anthony,</hi> ſeeing this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9072:87"/>
yoong man enter armed, was amazed, not knowing the cauſe, but vnderſtanding it afterwards, and withall the hazard whereunto he was brought by ſuch as did watch for him, he ſent to <hi>Velaſco</hi> that he ſhoulde compound with the magiſtrate, that as for him he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to yeeld obedience to king <hi>Philip,</hi> by meanes whereof all was pacified, for the Magiſtrate had alreadie yeelded: At the taking of their oathes the Citizens (ill aduiſed) required <hi>Velaſco</hi> that in the Kings name, hee ſhoulde graunt vnto the citie many priuileges and exemptions of cuſtomes and impoſtes, throughout the realme, with many other things of importance: And hee liberall of that which he could not giue, graunted all that was demaunded, but theſe promiſes were not obſerued by the King, ſaying (as it was true indeed) that <hi>Velaſco</hi> had exceeded his commiſſion. Theſe things ended, they were aduertiſed that <hi>Gaſpar de Britto</hi> whom the citie had ſent to <hi>Diego de Meneſes</hi> was returning with three hundred men, horſe and foote, ill appointed, to guard this place; to whom they preſently ſent word that he ſhould turne back, and hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the Caſtillian horſe of himſelfe, he fled with al his troupes. The day following (the vſuall ceremonies perfourmed) in proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a newe King, <hi>Velaſco</hi> returned, hauing ſtaied there but three daies: The principall of Eluas went after to Badagios to kiſſe the Kings hande, of whom they had better reception then he is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to giue vnto ſuch people, ſending <hi>Garcia de Cardenas</hi> nephewe to the Duke of Alua, to the citie, to thanke the Citizens for their good wils.</p>
            <p>Eluas being reduced, <hi>Peter Velaſco</hi> for the ſame intent tooke his<note place="margin">The reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenza.</note> way towards Oliuenza, whither he had before written, labouring that <hi>Nugno Aluares,</hi> ſonne to the Earle of Tentuguell, being cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the place, ſhoulde depart, the which he eaſily obtained: for the Citizens who had their affections enclined to the Catholique King, were reſolued to yeelde vnto him, hauing entreated the King that it woulde pleaſe him not to make this place the firſt whereof he ſhoulde take poſſeſſion, ſeeing that he had woone their harts, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rather to deſerue leſſe by obtaining late, then to be accuſed of inconſtancie by haſtening much: For this cauſe they not onelie thruſt foorth <hi>Nugno Aluarez,</hi> but alſo <hi>Diego de Soſa,</hi> a knight of the order of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who had ſucceeded in his place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:9072:87"/>
The newes of all this and of the ſucceſſe of Eluas came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to Saint Arem, whereas <hi>Anthony</hi> remained, labouring with the people to be proclaimed King: He was alwaies impatient in his pretention, notwithſtanding the perſecutions that king <hi>Henry</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon him, labouring ſtill by all meanes poſſible to aſpire to the crowne, intreating, threatning, and ſuborning. He treated by his Agents with the Catholique King, in diuers manners: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſeemed iealous of the Duke of Bragance, and would ioine with the King againſt him: Sometimes he treated to reſigne his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to <hi>Philip,</hi> if he would make him a good compoſition, carrying himſelfe as his hopes increaſed or diminiſhed: So as it hapned vnto ſuch as mannaged his affaires with the king, when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue concluded a matter, they found their authoritie reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. The King in the end, cauſed <hi>Chriſtopher de Mora</hi> to talke with him, and to make offer of all he ſhould demaund, for the great loue he bare vnto him, without naming either ſumme or any thing elſe whatſoeuer, but for that he hated <hi>Mora,</hi> he would not by his meanes treate of this matter of agreement. Notwithſtanding when as the Duke of Oſſuna deliuered vnto the Gouernors a copie of the kings<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique king his letter vnto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie.</note> minde, as is before ſet downe, he deliuered vnto <hi>Anthony</hi> a letter from the King, wherein he did write vnto him: That foraſmuch as he was not ignorant many yeeres ſince of the good will he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies borne him, the which he had laboured to make ſhewe of in all occaſions, he was aſſured he woulde not prooue ingrate, but ſhew himſelfe anſwerable vnto that whereunto reaſon did binde him, &amp; the neerenes of bloud that was betwixt them: He ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that hauing vnderſtoode the right and apparant title hee had to the realmes of Portugall, he entreated him moſt hartely to ſhew himſelfe one of the firſt to receiue, and to ſweare him for his King and naturall Lord, as God had appointed; that by his example the reſt might do that whereunto they were bounde, aſſuring him that for his owne particular, he woulde holde that regard of him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and grace him, as was conuenient, referring the reſt to that which the Duke of Oſſuna and <hi>Mora</hi> ſhoulde deliuer vnto him. But this letter wrought no effect, for he then ſaide vnto the Duke, that he woulde neuer agree, making anſwere vnto the King that he could not ſatisfie him, for that being vnder the peoples protection,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9072:88"/>
he muſt gouerne himſelfe according to their mindes; and therefore vnderſtanding that the Caſtillians began to enter within the realm, he made haſte to diſpatch this buſines with the people &amp; the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and making his profite of the poſſeſſion the King tooke, ſeeing the neceſſitie they had of a commaunder to make reſiſtance, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced<note place="margin">Anthonie proclaimed King of Portugall.</note> them to chooſe him Protector, or King: And although this reſolution was made by the moſt ſeditious and arrogant, who by force ſeeke to execute what they pleaſe, who woulde needes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime him King, yet were there many that woulde not yeeld vnto it, many helde it more fit to call him Protector. The Prior himſelfe was not well reſolued of this point, ſuffring himſelfe to be ledde (as in all other his actions) by the greateſt number, and his moſt fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; who to induce the people to performe this acte, in deſpight of ſome that woulde not aſſent, being then in queſtion to builde a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe a little without Saint Arem, where there ſtandes a ſmall chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell dedicated to the inuocation of the Apoſtles, they ſpred foorth a rumour that <hi>Anthony</hi> ſhoulde go thither the 19. of Iune, to lay the firſt ſtone, and that all the people ſhoulde worke in that fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, labouring in ſuch an aſſembly to effect their deſires. But there needed no great arte, for the people deſirous of innouation, ranne all thither that morning. The Biſhop of Parma being innocent, and he of Guarda ofſet purpoſe, came to the chappell where maſſe was celebrated, in the midſt whereof they exhorted the aſſemblie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and with darke ſpeeches to make an election: But <hi>Anthony</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuing ſoone after, making his praiers a little without the doore of the chappell, the two Biſhops went out to meete him, with their Rochets to hallow the foundation of the fortreſſe, but the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was no ſooner begun, but that <hi>Anthony Barachio</hi> an impudent fellow, (holding a handkerchiefe vpon the point of his ſword) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Anthony</hi> King, being followed with great noiſe, and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations almoſt of all the companie, who to aſſure themſelues of ſuch as were not of that faction, or to ſhew a certaine valour drewe their ſwordes: At that time <hi>Anthony</hi> faining a certaine modeſtie, or thruſt forwarde by his owne irreſolution, cried no, no, and ſtept forward as it were to ſtay the people. <hi>Peter Coutigno,</hi> captaine of that place with choler woulde haue ſtopt their cries, ſaying that the Prior deſired not to be called king; but this preuailed nothing, for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:9072:88"/>
               <hi>Baracchio</hi> bending his piſtol againſt the captaine, put him to ſilence; by reaſon whereof he departed. <q>

            <p>In the meane time <hi>Velaſco</hi> was come to Oliuenza, where ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring without ſtay by night the xix. of Iune, he was lodged by <hi>Diego de Vaſconcellos</hi> at the requeſt of the <hi>Paſſani</hi> of Eluas, and hauing the day following, requeſted the magiſtrate, and the Nobilitie, to aſſemble themſelues in the Church of Pitie, there to receiue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine letters from the king, being all aſſembled, he deliuered them; the which were publikely read, finding them full of curteſies: The concluſion was to ſweare him king; <hi>Velaſco</hi> preſſed them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere briefly.

they began to oppoſe themſelues, and without making anſwere to the letter, they ſent with all ſpeede to the gouernours, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after going to the lodging of <hi>Velaſco,</hi> they ſaide vnto him, that they could not giue anſwere, in a matter of ſo great importance, without good aduiſe and aduertiſing of the gouernours, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fower daies libertie, whereunto <hi>Peter</hi> anſwering, that he could giue them no longer time then the next day morning, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnſatisfied, ſaying that they feared nothing, for that God would ſuccour them: where with <hi>Velaſco</hi> diſcontented, woulde haue ſent <hi>Fratyn,</hi> an Italian Ingeneur (who was then with him) to the Duke of Alua to requeſt him to ſende ſome troupes of ſoldiers within the view of the place to terrifie them; yet being aduiſed by his friendes that were Portugals, and finding the people affected to the king, he ſtaied: The faction of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At this time <hi>Anthony</hi> was gone from Saint Arem to Lisbone: the Gouernors ſeeing that ſucceed which they had long foretolde, did fortifie at Settuual, with the Duke of Bragance, and the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors<note place="margin">The gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors neglect the defence of Liſbone.</note> of the Catholique King, fearing the new King would march to them. They neglected the defence of Lisbone, ſuppoſing that <hi>Peter de Cugna,</hi> captaine thereof, and <hi>Iohn Teglio,</hi> who as is ſaid, was at Belem with their procuration, woulde prouide for it, as they had commanded them, and had ſent two officers of Iuſtice, to perſwade the Citizens to make reſiſtance: But the ſaid <hi>Teglio</hi> (who it may be with greater zeale then iudgement) was one of thoſe that woulde haue the cauſe determined, vnderſtanding that <hi>Anthony</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed king, was greatly diſcontented, for that of force hee muſt leaue the gouernment, and make his peace with King <hi>Philip,</hi> with greater difficultie, if he ſhoulde now ſeeke it: Beſides that, <hi>Anthony</hi> did not acknowledge the crowne from him, and therefore greatly mooued, ſeeming alſo vnto him, that as Gouernour he did wrong his companions, (they being at Settuual and he at Belem) to ſuffer the Prior ſo eaſily to become Lord of Lisbone without blowes; he treated touching the defence thereof, being perſwaded thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Magiſtrate, who requeſted him to enter the citie to that end, proteſting that if the Prior tooke poſſeſſion it ſhoulde not be their fault, which coulde not hinder it, but his who could and would not: By meanes whereof, although but coldly, he aſſembled many companies of peaſants thereabouts, the which he ſent for the guard of the citie, and to hinder the Priors entrie. He commaunded <hi>Peter de Cugna</hi> to take care for the defence thereof, being reſolute not to enter himſelfe, and hauing called to Councell, the Gentlemen that were preſent, they reſolued to ſend with ſpeed to <hi>Anthony, Diego de Soſa,</hi> and <hi>Frauncis de Meneſes,</hi> entreating him not to enter into Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, nor to call himſelfe King, but onely Protector, being a name more fit for all occaſions that might happen: And although they went with this commiſſion, yet many aduiſed <hi>Teglio,</hi> that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe demonſtrations, he ſhould not hinder the courſe

of the Priors good fortune, ſo as wauering in his opinions, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing in any thing, he was cauſe that the ſouldiers or peaſants that were raiſed about the citie, hauing neither order nor commiſſion from the Gouernors, knew not what to do, whether to accompanie the Prior, or hinder his entrie; for that <hi>Emanuel</hi> of Portugal who had proiected to make the Prior King, laboured to preuent all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and hauing reſolued, he purpoſely made their executions vaine. <hi>Peter de Cugna</hi> ſaide, that if <hi>Iohn Teglio</hi> woulde not oppoſe himſelfe in perſon, that he woulde not accompliſh it being his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; whereunto <hi>Teglio</hi> replied, that it was the captaines dutie, either of them excuſing themſelues vpon the other, both with ſeuerall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>The Prior drew neere to Lisbone, but he was in danger neuer to come there, for neere to <hi>Sacaben</hi> which is ſixe miles from the citie, ſtaying in the fielde to ſpeake with <hi>Frauncis de Almeda</hi> his friende, there was a Harquebuſe diſcharged at him, wherewith <hi>Frauncis</hi> was ſlaine, and no man able to diſcouer from whence it came, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it was intended againſt the Prior himſelfe.

There were fewe at that time within the citie, both by reaſon of the plague, and for that many helde not themſelues in ſafetie, ſeeing the realme in diuiſion, on the one ſide the Catholique king entred with a mightie armie, on the other ſide were the Gouernors in a manner conformeable to the ſaide King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laſtly was the Prior being poore alone, &amp; ill aduiſed, made King, by a handfull of the baſe people: So as there was not any of the Iuſtice or Nobilitie that went to viſite him, and of the ſuperior magiſtrates there was but one Vereador to be founde, the reſt being hidden: Notwithſtanding, he went to the pallace vpon the riuer, wherof he tooke peaceable poſſeſſion, as alſo of the Arcynal and ſtorehouſe of armes, he created a newe purueior, and newe officers of Iuſtice, and newe Vereadors, ſupplying all other offices that were voide: From thence he went to the Towne-houſe to be proclaimed King with ordinarie ceremonies, all the principall of the citie being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, to whom <hi>Emanuel Fonſequa Nobrega,</hi> a doctor of a bolde

But be as ioyfull and willing to this acte as you pleaſe, be my wordes neuer ſo ſuperfluous, yet encouraged by dutie and loue, I muſt briefely deliuer vnto you my aduiſe; I will not make any particular repetition of his afflictions, nor with what iudgement he hath ſurmounted them being infinite, and the time ſhorte: Let it ſuffice you to vnderſtande as you doe, that by a fatall deſtinie he hath alwaies encountred againſt the proud arrogancie of this world: For as vertues be (by reaſon of our ſinnes) moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hatefull to princes in this age, and vices cheriſhed, as vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and nobly minded, he hath alwaies beene hated and oppreſſed: So as ſometimes tearming him a baſtard, ſomtimes preferring thoſe whom he ſhoulde precead, they laboured by all meanes to blemiſh that glory that did ſhine in him.

He made many offers to the Duke of Bragance, and to the Marques of Villa Reale, entreating all other Noblemen to come vnto him to conſult of matters concerning the realme: But the Duke perſwaded likewiſe by the Deputies of the realme, to compound with <hi>Anthony,</hi> woulde not do it, the Marques went not,<note place="margin">The flight of Teglio.</note> and fewe others did acknowledge him.

The Prior ſeeing theſe men, whereof he helde ſome of them to be his confident friendes to flie, to carrie away the money, and to ioine themſelues with the Gouernors his aduerſaries who began to fortifie Settuual, diſcouered plainly that they had intelligence with the Catholique King: that they woulde entertaine themſelues in that place, vntill the galleis of Italy, which they vnderſtood had beene trimmed at Saint Marie Porte, ſhoulde
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:9072:92"/>
arriue in thoſe quarters, to giue them entrie at Settuual, whereby might enſue his ruine, for that the Catholique King entring there with a great armie, the citie of Lisbone ſhoulde be in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and therefore hauing firſt impriſoned ſome that were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected vnto him, and demaunded money in loane from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, he reſolued with what ſpeed he could to recouer this place, either by loue or force, induced to make this haſte by the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Triſtan Vaz de Vega,</hi> captaine of the fortreſſe of Saint Iulian, at the mouth of Tagus, to whom hauing written, he made anſwere that he coulde not conſigne him the caſtell, nor hold it in his name, alleaging that he had taken an oath not to deliuer it but to ſuch as had put it into his hands, which were the Gouernors; ſo as <hi>Anthony</hi> reſeruing this for a ſecond enterpriſe, hauing haſtily and by force aſſembled the peaſants about the citie; the artiſans, ſlaues, and other people gathered togither, which in all came not to fifteene hundreth, he tranſported them to the other ſide of the riuer: but before he himſelfe would paſſe, he ſent <hi>Frauncis</hi> of Portugal, Count of Vimioſo to Settuual, to treate with the Gouernors, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to yeelde to his obedience; to whom he did likewiſe write, that they ſhoulde not diſhonour and vndoe themſelues, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rather to giue the crowne to a ſtranger, then to him who was their countreyman, that they ſhould come vnto him, and he would freely forgiue all things: But the Gouernors truſted neither to this letter, nor to the wordes of the Earle, being greatly bounde to the Catholique King, whereof ſome of them as fauorites to king <hi>Henry</hi> had aſſiſted to the ſentences that had beene pronounced againſt him: Therefore conſulting with the Embaſſadors of the Catholique King, they reſolued to defend themſelues vntill the comming of the kings armie, the which they expected howerly. But this practiſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, for the windes were ſtill ſo contrarie, that the galleis coulde not arriue, the which the Duke of Bragance conſidering he woulde not attend but departed: The Counte of Vimioſo, deſirous to expell them from thence, hauing incenſed the people to ſedition, &amp; aided by the guard of Halberdiers of the court, he tooke armes, and became maſter of the Porte, many ranne armed to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors<note place="margin">The flight of the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</note> lodging, threatning with iniurious words to kill them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being feared and amazed, not onely the Gouernors, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

the Embaſſadors of the Catholique King, and all the Nobilitie of the citie, which followed <hi>Philips</hi> faction, ſome fledde ſecretly out at the windowes, ſome by ſea, ſome by land, except the Archbiſhop of Lisbone, and <hi>Iohn Teglio,</hi> who onely remained, the one truſting in his calling, the other in the workes which he had formerly done in fauour of the Prior, and in his kinſemen. The Embaſſadors retired themſelues the next day into Caſtill. This act in truth was full of compaſſion, for although the Gouernors for their irreſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and priuate intereſts deſerued puniſhment, yet mens harts were mooued to ſee theſe graue olde men, in whom not two howres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the roiall authoritie remained, faſtned to ropes creepe out at windowes, to auoide the furie of a yoong licentious man, who had mutined the people, and the guard it ſelfe againſt them: Such of the Nobilitie as abandoning their houſes in thoſe partes, retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, were <hi>Fernand de Norogna, Peeter de Meneſes, Edward de Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bianco,</hi>

He ſaide that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the realme had made offer vnto him, that they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Anthony</hi> to leaue the title of King, and vnite himſelfe with him, for the defence of the crowne, and that in the end they ſhould agree: And that the ſaid <hi>Anthony</hi> had ſent to make great offers vnto him, the which he woulde not accept, not ſeeming reaſonable vnto him. He requeſted his Maieſtie to commaund the armie not to endo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage his countrey: Heerein he ſpake truth, for although he were a quiet and religious man, yet the Philipins ſaide, that although he had beene otherwiſe, the King had no cauſe to feare his forces, for albeit he had many ſubiects, yet were they not all obedient vnto him. That the Nobilitie abhorred his rule more then any other, and that ſome of his kinſemen did him more hurt then good, by reaſon of the emulation amongſt the Nobilitie. He relied much on the equitie of his cauſe, yet feared he to bee forced by the kings power, which he ſaw prepared, ſuppoſing he would not receiue iudgement in the cauſe from any man. This feare had induced him to write to all the great Potentates in Chriſtendome, ſhewing his reaſons, and demaunding ſuccours. The like office had he done with ſome Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9072:93"/>
at Rome. He had ſent into Fraunce diuers copies of his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, to the end they might be diſperſed into England and other places, making great inſtance to the two Queenes to ſuccour him with mony, munition, &amp; captaines: But his weakenes being knowne to both, although hee gaue them to vnderſtande he went to ioine with the Gouernors in defence, they returned him nothing but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous words. And ſome ſay, that not content to vſe this diligence, to ſuch as were enuious of the kings good, he did likewiſe write to his enimies and rebels, deſiring to treat with the Prince of Orange, and the Duke of Alançon. <q>Theſe things cauſed him more loſſe then profite, as it happens commonly to thoſe that will contend with mightie Princes, and builde their foundations vpon the ſuccours of their enimies ill willers, who wil not commonly declare themſelues, except their companion be ſtrong.</q> Heereupon it grewe, that the King returned to the ſaide propoſitions ſo ample, and artificiall an anſwere: for (as it was reported) ſome of his letters had beene ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by the Agents of the Catholique king, and ſome other, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe he had written to Rome, were ſent to the King by them, to whom he had written them. He anſwered, that he reioiced, that<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique kings anſwere to the Duke of Bragance.</note> in time he had auoided the ſedition at Settuual, being troubled with the danger and indignitie he might haue ſuffred: That he knewe it to be true that in the perſuite of the right of <hi>Katherine,</hi> he had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelfe with due modeſtie, but by refuſing to agree with him were growne the inconueniences wherein now they were, the which he would gladly they ſhould rather haue foreſeen, then haue made triall of, with ſo great diſquietnes, and diſhonor vnto themſelues, for the which he was ſory in regarde of the neerenes of bloud, and affection, he bare vnto the ſaid <hi>Katherine;</hi> That his offer to yeelde him his right was acceptable vnto him, but he woulde haue them to vnderſtand that there was no neceſſity, to adde new actions to thoſe which God had giuen him, apparant to all the worlde. That he had then wiſhed for two reaſons they coulde haue accepted of his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, in recompence of their pretention: The firſt was, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by this meanes, he ſhoulde not haue beene forced to enter ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the realme, and to make warre vpon his owne ſubiects, which is one of the things that doth moſt trouble him: But that good which might haue beene reaped by compoſition, was nowe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9072:94"/>
extinct by their ſlacknes, ſeeing that his armie was alreadie entred the realme: The ſecond reaſon was, the deſire to encreaſe and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his houſe, to do good to his children, to auoide the ruine of the eſtate, and the hazard to ouerthrow it, whereof there was yet ſome remedie, for being ſo deſirous of his good, that onely was ſufficient to mooue him to doe them good: He ſaid moreouer, that he was much amazed to heare him confeſſe with his owne mouth, that they had daily practiſed with <hi>Anthony,</hi> that they treated with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell who had committed ſo horrible a crime, aduiſing him in ſigne of loue, heereafter to abſtaine from all ſuch treaties, ſo contrarie to that fidelitie whereunto they were bounde, and ſo vnwoorthie of their authoritie and reputation, ſhewing likewiſe, that he marueiled they woulde ſuffer themſelues to be informed from the Deputies, who promiſed to cauſe <hi>Anthony</hi> to forſake the title of a king, which he hath vſurped, as if it were an offence capable of repentaunce, whereas they ſhoulde well vnderſtand, that they be ordinary prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes and diſcourſes of rebels, to deceiue them as they had formerly done: And whereas the Deputies call it an accord or vnion for the defence, let them take heede that it prooue not a league, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, framed to make him partaker with <hi>Anthony</hi> his offence, from the which God had yet preſerued him: He concluded that he would alwaies giue a gentle audience to that which ſhoulde be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his behalfe, with intention to doe him all the grace and fauor poſſible in his demaunds. This anſwere being receiued, the Duke ſent certaine gentlemen to treat an agreement with the king, the which continued long, making vnſeaſonable demaundes on the Dukes behalfe: Notwithſtanding the King deſiring that before they proceeded further, he ſhoulde acknowledge and ſweare him for his Lorde: The matter remained in ſuſpence with ſmall content to the Duke, who found not onely the hope of his Iuſtice to fall out vaine, but likewiſe not to be fully reconciled to the king, who tooke poſſeſſion of his countries, hauing alreadie loſt Villauizoſa, one of his chiefe places, and of great importance, where hee made his aboad, although he had well fortified it.</p>

with captaine <hi>Ciſneros,</hi> who was in the Dukes campe, treated<note place="margin">The taking of Villaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſa.</note> to deliuer vnto him in the night, one of the gates of the caſtell, the which deſcends into the ditch, thereby ſecretly to bring in the kings forces, the which he did effect. The night appointed for this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe being come, the Duke commanded <hi>Sanches d'Auila,</hi> to go with the ſoldiers he had about Eluas, and take poſſeſſion of the fortreſſe, who hauing taken their Harquebuſiers behinde them, marched ſo that night, that in the morning they came to Villauizoſa, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the gate that was promiſed them, they founde that although it were open, yet coulde they not enter, for that being farre from the ground, the ladder which they had brought was too ſhorte, and coulde not reach vnto it, ſo as in diſpaire to put it in execution, the day growing neere, they were readie to returne, fearing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered. But as many times thinges are fitted to the violent courſe of fortune, the Caſtillians founde within the caſtell ditch an other ladder, which the ſoldiers within the forte had by chance left there, the which bounde to that they brought, reached vnto the gate, ſo as all the ſoldiers entred the caſtell, without being diſcouered, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neither guard nor centinell, but were all laide to ſleepe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a mightie armie of enimies within tenne miles of them, ſo as in this manner the Duke of Bragance loſt the beſt and ſtrongeſt furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed place he had.</p>
            <p>Many were then of opinion, the King ſhoulde not go in perſon with the armie, for although ſome helde it was neceſſarie he ſhould<note place="margin">Reaſons why the King ſhould not goe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> goe, alleaging the former reaſons, yet ſuch as helde the contrarie opinion, added vnto their reaſons, that throughout all the way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Lisbone, and in the citie it ſelfe, they died moſt violently of the plague, although the aire did not ſeeme corrupted, that it was not conuenient to hazard the life of a Prince, who was a pillar of the Church, and Lord of ſo many Realmes. That they might anſwere vnto the reaſons of conueniencie, which was ſpoken againſt this opinion, that it was like vnto all other humane things which haue two reaſons, for waighing the one it importes much, and regarding the other, they ſeeme light: The importance of the enterpriſe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great, conſidering the valour of the realme, and his intereſt; but if you conſider that they oppoſe againſt the perſon of ſo mightie a king, that of <hi>Anthony</hi> a rebell, who doth ſcarſe deſerue the name
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9072:95"/>
of a tirant, and that with the Duke of Alua, and ſo many Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Italians and Spaniards, you compare the Count of Vimioſo, yoong, without experience, and all the reſt of their traine, and that againſt ſo valiant ſoldiers of all nations, there come peaſants gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red togither from the villages about Lisbone, and the ſlaues of Ethiopia, you may eaſily iudge the great indignitie the king ſhoulde ſuffer being preſent in this expedition. They alleaged the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the hope of good ſucceſſe; for although it ſeemed a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eaſilie to be effected, conſidering the qualitie of the enimies, yet regarding the difficulties alleaged, the matter was in ſuſpence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the examples of King <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt of Caſtill, &amp; <hi>Alphonſe</hi> the fifth of Portugall, either of them entring at diuers times with an armie, into other countries, and both returned flying and broken. As for the ſweete content it ſeemed the Kings entrie ſhould bring, and contrariwiſe the ſharpenes of the Duke of Alua, they ſaide it was well conſidered; yet the King remaining at Eluas, or in any other place vpon the frontiers, hee ſhoulde giue a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. This opinion ſeeming the better, and with moſt grounde, not onely pleaſed the King, but bred ſuch an impreſſion in the mindes of many, that it paſſed the limits, <q>for that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations of ſafety are limited with feare, ſo as they began to apprehend too much, ſaying, the king was not ſure at Badagios, and that he ſhoulde retire himſelfe to Ciuill, vnder colour to diſpatch away the armie, ſeeing it had already entred the realme:</q>  for the Duke marching from the frontier, the King ſhoulde lie open to all attempts of the Portugals, who might make their courſes euen vnto the walles of the citie. That <hi>Anthony</hi> ſeeking to make this diuerſion, he might eaſilie effect it with ſo great force, as the king ſhoulde be conſtrained to retire himſelfe with ſmall authoritie, and recall his armie, although it were about the wals of Lisbone; yet woulde not the king by any meanes heare ſpeake thereof, but perſwaded ſuch as were of that opinion, that for a worlde, no, for his owne life, he woulde not retire a foote backe, but was reſolued to ſtaie in Portugall, in ſome place of the frontiers, which ſhoulde be thought moſt conuenient, and for that<note place="margin">The Kings army entred into Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</note> effect reteined certaine troupes for his guard.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Alua who had aſſembled his armie at Cantigliana paſſed the 27. day of Iune, by the kings commandement, the ſmall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:9072:95"/>
of Caya, which diuides the two realmes, entring into Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall with great quantitie of munition and baggage, by reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he carried with him aboue ſixe thouſand chariots, and fiue and twenty peeces of canon, and paſſing vnder the walles of Eluas, there was nothing to be done, being already yeelded: In three daies march he came to Stremos, receiuing all places thereabouts to obedience, which might be amazed at the bruite of the armie: But for that he laboured to aſſure the kings perſon aboue all, being entred two daies iourney within the countrey, he ſent backe <hi>Peter Manrique de Padilla</hi> a knight of account, and well experienced in the warre, with two companies of men at armes, and <hi>Peter d' Ayala</hi> Marſhall of the field, an old ſoldier, with a regiment of Spaniards, who lodged at Eluas, aſſuring thoſe quarters from all reuolutions that might be feared: within Stremos was captaine <hi>Iohn Dazeuedo</hi>
               <note place="margin">The taking of Stremos.</note> Admirall of the realme, yoong and hardie, who put himſelfe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and was cauſe that the armie made longer ſtay there, then at any other lodging: He (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the gouernors were yet at Almeryn) had obtained by the meanes of <hi>Martin Gonzales de Camera</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what allyed vnto him, the Captainſhip of that place, and after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written vnto by <hi>Anthonie</hi> as king, he would not obey him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he did not acknowledge any other ſuperiour then the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, to whom he had giuen his oath: At this time the Duke being arriued, he ſent vnto him <hi>Peter de Luna</hi> a captaine of horſe, with letters from the king, requiring his obedience, but he refuſed to yeeld it, for the ſame reaſons he had giuen to <hi>Anthonie;</hi> he truſted more to the defence of the place, then the force thereof would war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and the rather for the diligence of <hi>Diego de Meneſes,</hi> who when he had ſpeech of the fortifying of Eluas, ſeeing it could not be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, he had retired himſelfe to Stremos, thinking there to make head, and hauing animated the people to defende it, he promiſed them great ſuccours; ſo as all agreeing with the Admirall, they were reſolute to fight. At this time <hi>Chriſtopher de Mora,</hi> who went from Settuual to Badagios, paſſing through the citie, he perſuaded the <hi>Landini,</hi> chiefe citizens to yeeld obedience vnto the king, and for that it was eaſie for them to turne the people as they pleaſed, they induced them ſoone to obey: So as the Admirall remained alone in his obſtinacie, within the caſtell with ſome of his friends and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:9072:96"/>
familiars, and although they laboured to bring him to obedience, yet would he not yeeld, excuſing himſelfe, that it appeered not vnto him, that the king was heire to the realme; neither did the comming of the Prior <hi>Ferrant de Toledo</hi> ſonne to the Duke of Alua preuaile; who diſcouering him to be a man of ſmall conſideration, made offer vnto him, that the Duke ſhould be bound, that whenſoeuer it ſhould appeere that the realme appertained not vnto <hi>Philip,</hi> hee ſhould reſtore him to the place he now enioyed: neither preuailed it to let him vnderſtand that he could not reſiſt, making anſwere obſtinately, that when he had done his laſt endeuour, hee woulde abandon the place with the loſſe of his life, ſeeming that he coulde not otherwiſe ſaue his honour. But this reſolution laſted little, for diſcouering from the caſtell, that the Duke had already planted his artillerie, that thoſe of the citie which had promiſed to defend him, were all againſt him, and that ſome Caſtillian ſoldiers were entred the citie, being all amazed, he reſolued to retire himſelfe, and leaue the fortreſſe, wanting courage to defend it; but in iſſuing foorth the Caſtillians tooke him priſoner, and led him to the Duke, who was in doubt whether he ſhould puniſh him corporally, to terrifie the reſt by his firſt example; but he pardoned him, and ſent him priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Villauizoſa, writing vnto the king, that he tooke pitie of him, being yoong and without experience. When the magiſtrate and the citizens had taken their oath, and done the accuſtomed cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to obey the king, the armie marched towardes Mounte maior by the way of Arraialos, leauing Euora on the left hande, a citie of importance, but then greatly afflicted with the plague: But to the ende it ſhoulde not remaine behinde vnyeelded,<note place="margin">Euora yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> the Duke ſent thither <hi>Henry de Guzman</hi> with twentie horſe to take poſſeſſion thereof, both for that hee knewe it was vnpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, as alſo vnderſtanding that <hi>Diego de Caſtro</hi> (who was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine there) and the principalles of the citie (who were retired to their gardens thereabouts) deſired to yeeld their obedience, by reaſon whereof, the ſaide captaine and Magiſtrate being aſſembled togither a mile from the citie vnder the Portall of our Ladies church, there <hi>Conſtantine de Brito</hi> a Notarie, receiued a publike acte, whereby they deliuered the citie to his Maieſties obedience, the which they all aſſigned.

The black Negroes to whom (for the great number there is of them in the citie of Lisbone) armes were defended, were ſodainely all armed, and as it were free, commaundement being made, that all ſuch as woulde ſerue in this warre vnder captaines, likewiſe Moores aſſigned for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, might do it againſt the will of their maſters, and without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for which cauſe, all the ſlaues being aſſembled, and conceiuing the Kings commaundement to be more in their fauour then it was, ſhaking off the yoke, leauing their patrons, they ranne vnto the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, where taking horſe and armes by force where they found them, they committed a thouſand inſolencies. They coined money in the name of <hi>Anthony,</hi> a quarter leſſe then it was woont to be, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of the crowne was waſted, for beſides that he extorted from the treaſurers what he coulde, he laide handes vpon the iewels of the crowne, and vpon that moſt renowmed (by the Portugals) ſaddle and furniture for a horſe, inriched with ſtones brought from the Indies, which was of great value. The money which <hi>Henry</hi> had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered togither for the raunſome of the Portugals, which were ſlaues in Affricke, was conſumed and wholy ſpent: And this liberty proceeded ſo farre, that they ſought into religious houſes, for the money which they thought had beene there laide in guard, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing founde ſome, although it appertained to friendes, and faithfull perſons, to orphans, and pupils, yet was it ſeaſed on, without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or weight, togither with the ſiluer veſſels of the ſame churches, the which was violently carried away in ſome places, and in other places with the conſent of the religious men themſelues: Neither were the iewels and treaſure which <hi>Marie</hi> the couſen of the ſaid <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie</hi> left, more aſſured, being giuen to godly vſes, for the good of her ſoule: For notwithſtanding he were greatly bound vnto her, yet he tooke them, &amp; conuerted them to his own vſe.

He preſently ſent a trumpet to ſignifie vnto them of the towne, that he was come in the name of the Catholique king to take poſſeſſion thereof as his owne, that they ſhoulde open him the gates, threatning them if they did otherwiſe, with all the miſeries that did followe warre, offring both to the inhabitants and to the ſouldiers, to leaue their perſons and<note place="margin">The taking of Settuual.</note> goodes free, if they would obey.

They attended at Settuual the armie at ſea with great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For beſides that the ſhort ſeaſon for galleies to liue in that ſea began to weare away, if they had made any longer ſtay, the armie at land had preſently fallen into great want of victuals and munition: For this reaſon the Duke deſired to make himſelfe with all ſpeede maſter of the fortreſſe, &amp; therefore he greatly entreated <hi>Mendo de la Mota,</hi> (for ſo the captaine was called) to conſigne it vnto him; the which he refuſing, the Duke added ſome promiſes in the Kings<note place="margin">The arriuall of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of Saint Crux, with the armie by ſea.</note> name, but they preuailed not: And for that <hi>Aluaro de Baſſan</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of S.

hauing with great labour made his platformes, to plant fower peeces of cannon, and to lodge his footemen for the force thereof, to the end the galleies hauing no other porte of retreate, ſhould not be forced by the windes to runne any other courſe, whereof he gaue the charge to <hi>Proſper Colonna:</hi> But the artillerie was no ſooner planted, whereas it might annoy one of the gallions, that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched neerer land then the reſt, the which being ſubiect to the Caſtillians cannon, which ſlew three or fower of their men, they preſently hoiſed ſailes, entring the porte to yeeld, where they were in great danger; for thoſe within the tower ſeeing them goe to the enimie, diſcharged all their artillerie againſt them: <hi>Colonna</hi> turned<note place="margin">The yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the fortreſſe.</note> the artillerie againſt the forte, and beginning to batter, the aſſieged fainting, chiefly hauing viewed the armie at ſea, yeelded, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to depart with their liues, and bagge and baggage, the which were ſtricter conditions then had beene formerly offered. But the Duke although hee were well pleaſed with the ſucceſſe, yet did he not ſeeme to allow that <hi>Proſper</hi> ſhoulde receiue it with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſeeing they had indured the cannon, ſeeming that the aſſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that had not obeied vpon the firſt ſhotte of the cannon were not woorthie of pardon: Then the galleies drew neere, and hauing quietly taken the other two gallions, they entred within the Porte.</p>
            <p>They had ſome intelligence at Lisbone of the taking of Settu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, yet not aſſured thereof, but by heareſay and coniectures; ſo ill was the Prior informed, that by this meanes hee was ſubiect to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue<note place="margin">Three poore women cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuual.</note> many lies: whileſt he was yet in ſuſpence, three poore women with their haire about their eares, came to the palace, weeping and crying, that for the loue of God he would cauſe their husbands to be ſuccoured, who alone fought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wals of the citie againſt the whole armie of the Duke of Alua, not being reſcued by the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor any other, being all traitors: And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that we more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beleeue what we deſire (although it be not likely) then what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon telleth vs, he beleeued that what theſe women had reported was true, and mooued with their teares and lamentations, turning to the<note place="margin">Anthonies care to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour Settu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual.</note> Counte of Vimioſo, who had alreadie made offer to goe, without any further aduiſe, hee commaunded him to aſſemble what forces he coulde, and for the honour of the Portugals bloud, goe ſuccour that place. To that end they aſſembled the whole people by ringing

of the bels with other diligence; ſo as they imbarqued ſome by loue, ſome by force, ſome armed, ſome vnarmed, without knowledge who ſhoulde leade them, howe they ſhoulde march, or what they ſhould do: Feare did nothing reteine them, for as yet they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeene the enimie in the face, and therefore not onely the youth ranne thither, but old men armed with heades and handes ſhaking, imbarqued, themſelues not preſſed there unto (being freed by their age) but vpon a certaine naturall hatred: Many religious men ranne through the citie on horſebacke with their naked weapons in hande, incouraging the people to imbarque. The women of baſe condition made the aire deafe; the churches were full of ſighings and lamentations, which they powred foorth with their fooliſh praiers, whereby it ſeemed they knewe not what they demaunded, for they praied for Chriſtendome, as if they had beene beſieged by Infidels: It was the 19. day of Iuly, the heate being extreame, and theſe poore wretches who were imbarqued, (attending the courſe of the water, burned with the ſunne, not yet a ſpan from the banke) began to ſuffer thirſt, ſo as many repented, and would gladly haue returned if they could. But they remained in this eſtate vntil fowre of the clocke in the afternoone, reckoning after the French man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: at what time <hi>Anthony</hi> going alongſt the riuer, reioicing to ſee ſo many readie to do him ſeruice, there arriued a Carauell from Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuual, which brought certaine newes of the ſucceſſe; the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it pleaſed theſe people, who (halfe dead with ſuffring) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarqued againe, yet it greatly diſpleaſed the Prior, who hauing beene there in perſon, and furniſhed it with armes and munition, as much as he coulde poſſiblie, and as he thought was conuenient, he had conceiued an aſſured hope, that it ſhoulde holde out long, but ſeeing it nowe ſo ſhamefully loſt, he grewe amazed: And although<note place="margin">The counſell of Anthonie and his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</note> he durſt neither in worde nor deede, make ſhew of any feare, yet as it were foretelling the miſchiefe he was greatly troubled with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: <q>And for that in the counſels of ſuch as be afflicted, ſuch ſeemes alwaies beſt, as cannot be executed, hauing loſt the occaſion, he began now to conſider, that he had done ill in not following the counſell of ſuch as aduiſed him not to take vpon him the title of King, for with the name of Protector which he might haue taken, it ſeemed vnto him that he might at al times haue made an honorable

peace.</q>  But that nowe being king proclaimed and ſworne with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it in ſo many places, although he had not ſuffered any one to kiſſe his hands, nor taken the ſcepter, it ſeemed vnto him difficult, and almoſt impoſſible to leaue the title but with his life, yet hauing well conſidered by the euents, that his affaires were weake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, he found the enimie to be mightie, and ſo farre aduaunced in the enterpriſe, that he had no meanes to ſtaie him, nor make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh armes: He founde himſelfe abandoned, as a man may ſay, of the whole realme: For the Duke of Bragance the greateſt of all the nobilitie, hauing made an agreement with the Catholique king, had retired himſelfe expecting the euent: The Marques of Villa Reale, who had giuen him hope to ioine, appeered not, and almoſt all the other great perſonages of the realme, and a great part of the Nobilitie, had followed the examples of theſe, for that ſome went openly to Badagios, to acknowledge the Catholique king for their Lorde; ſome others ſtaied, to ſuite themſelues according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents, ſo as the leaſt part came to him, and theſe were ſuch men, as neither loue, nor their owne deſires, but feare, ſhame, and their owne priuate conſiderations had drawne vnto him; for ſome filled themſelues with vaine hopes, by reaſon of the great familiaritie they had with him; ſome others being preſent, coulde not but followe him; and others for the rigorous commaundements he had made, that euery man ſhould come and acknowledge him, came feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof ſome ſtoode more in awe then others, for ſuch as had their goods and perſons any thing retired, made ſmall account of his commaundement; and ſuch as were neere, as more ſubiect to the execution thereof, came of force, faining great affection: From theſe counterfeit lookes of the rebellion of cities, of the retraite of<note place="margin">Anthonies feare.</note> ſome to Badagios, of the report daily made vnto him, of thinges which bred doubt in him, ſometimes of the fidelitie of one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of an other: he grewe iealous that he ſhoulde one day be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered into his enimies hands, by ſuch as he fauoured moſt, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant their perſons from the great danger wherein they were: And this iealouſie did ſo encreaſe, that he impriſoned <hi>George de Meneſes,</hi> captaine generall at ſea, hauing wrongfully beleeued, that he had treated to yeelde the armie to the enimies, and to conduct them within the Porte of Lisbone. Heereunto they added that halfe the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9072:101"/>
realme was loſt, for all that part of Tagus towards Andelouzia was poſſeſſed by the Caſtillians, and if there were any corner thereof where they had not beene, as at Begia, and ſome other places of the realme of Algarues, either they made no reckoning thereof, or they had compounded; and the other moitie of the realme, where the enimies had not beene, was almoſt all in ſuſpence, for the citie of Porto which is the principall, and almoſt all the reſt which lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the riuers of Doro and Migno, did not yet fully obey, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſince they were come to armes, to ſee who ſhoulde haue the better, onely Coimbra was more at his deuotion then all the reſt, and ſhewed it ſelfe more of <hi>Anthonies</hi> faction then the whole realme; for in the beginning of Iuly it began to riſe, at the perſwaſion of <hi>Iohn Rodrigues de Vaſconcellos,</hi> a gentleman and a prieſt, whom <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> had ſent thither, expelling <hi>Peter Guedez</hi> gouernour thereof, who fledde with the <hi>Corygidor</hi> in great hazard of his life, and if the plague had not then afflicted the citie, the diſorders had beene grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet this was but one citie onely: whereas contrariwiſe Saint Arem, the firſt place where he was proclaimed king, beganne to riſe againſt him, for the pacifying whereof, he ſent <hi>Emanuel de Sylua,</hi> one of the firſt moters of this popular humour which made him King; ſo as he had ſcarce any citie remaining but Lisbone, whereof he had no great confidence, although the common people by their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med braggings, ſhewed him great affection; in this ſo apparant danger hee founde not any of ſo many Potentates enclined to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him, who in reaſon ſhould not willingly haue ſeene his enimie aſpire to ſuch greatnes. So as afflicted with theſe thoughts, he had<note place="margin">The reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, and of his counſell.</note> eaſily followed the counſell of an accorde, although the fidelitie of the Portugals, and the name of King woulde not ſuffer him, yet hee had no man about him that coulde perſwade him, but was cured by contrarie remedies: For taking counſell with <hi>Diego Boteglio</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his familiar, who had followed him in all his diſgraces; and with thoſe of the houſe of Portugall; although his flight, if he would haue attempted it, were ſtopped, and ſmall hope of victory in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, yet coulde he not agree and yeeld to fortune, but reſolued to<note place="margin">The Biſhop of Guarda ſeconds An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</note> defend himſelfe: In which reſolution he was confirmed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Guarda, who as a bolde man woulde haue his opinion paſſe in all things: For he ſaide the Catholique king was not ſo mightie
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:9072:102"/>
as was ſuppoſed, that his Spaniſh ſoldiers, were new and vntrained, that he woulde not drawe foorth of Italy his trained men, fearing that being buſied in Spaine, the realme of Naples, or the ſtate of Millaine ſhoulde reuolt: That the Italians and Germaines were few in number, for beſides there were many dead, it was not ſafe to bring any great numbers into Spaine, a prouince that is weake, and hatefull to all other nations: That at this preſent when as the brute ſhould be of his taking armes, the States of Italy, of Nauarre, and of Arragon woulde rebell: That the Turke woulde deſcend vpon his realme of Naples: That Caſtill it ſelfe being greeued and ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with impoſtes, woulde reuolt: That Fraunce, England, and a part of Germany, would come preſently with many men to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, or at the leaſt in aſſailing the other prouinces of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique king, diuert the warre, ſaying, it had not yet ſucceeded, the time being too ſhort to giue them notice of his election, or receiue an anſwere: That the realme was mightie enough of it ſelfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelfe, on this ſide the riuer, vntill his friends had meanes to ſuccour him: Theſe things being deliuered vnto him by his friends with ſo great efficacie, and faining to haue receiued aduiſe, they did ſomewhat encourage <hi>Anthony,</hi> beſides that, the deſire to raigne makes the vnbeleeuing, credulous: Theſe men beſides their afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide priuate paſſions, although they did well vnderſtand the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the realme, and the lightnes of their reaſons, were blinded with two things, whereby they perſwaded <hi>Anthony</hi> from compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The counſell of Anthony ill grounded.</note> The one was, that knowing the offence to the Catholique king to be ſo great, that although they ſhoulde obtaine their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet ſhould they neuer receiue grace nor fauour, but remaine ſtill in feare of their liues: The other was to enioy in the meane time the gouernment of the realme, the which in a manner was all in their hands, attributing vnto themſelues the principall offices, ſo as for the affection they ſhewed vnto the crowne, it ſeemed that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> bare them reſpect, and in a manner ſubiection, ſo as the feare of life, and the ſweetenes of rule, made them obſtinate. Amidſt theſe doubts, the Prior was not without hope of ſome ſuccours from Fraunce, for that <hi>Frauncis Baretto</hi> being firſt of all ſent by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, and then the Conſull of the French by himſelfe, with ſome little money, he expected at the leaſt one of them ſhoulde appeare
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:9072:102"/>
with men, although the Gouernors had ſent <hi>Baretto</hi> more to pleaſe the peoples deſire, with this ſhewe, then for any will they had hee ſhoulde worke it in effect, being diſpatched with ample commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they daily by their meſſengers reſtrained, and in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked them, ſo as he effected nothing of importance: And although that <hi>Anthony</hi> had written vnto him, yet was it late, and the Conſull of the French hauing receiued money, ſtaied ſtill in Fraunce to take his pleaſure, ſo as they expected ſuccours from thoſe parts in vaine, chiefly by reaſon that the Agents of the Catholique king laboured greatly that court, to keepe the Portugals from their deſire. True it is, that when <hi>Anthony</hi> founde them ſo ſlowe in comming, and that the Catholique Kings galleies were maſters of the ſea, he began to be out of hope. Then grew a confuſion and diſorder in all thinges, and foraſmuch as their mindes were greatly troubled, all without reſt, and all terrified, it chaunced that the night following the daie, when as they had receiued newes of the loſſe of Settuuall, by reaſon of the flight of ſome Caſtillian marchants, who held not themſelues<note place="margin">An allarum at Lisbone.</note> ſecure within the city, they tooke an allarum, with great amaſement, crying that the enimie entred by many places, and as there was no ordered diſcipline, nor any man that knew what they ſhould vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, the feare was ſo great, the confuſion ſuch and ſo vnreaſonable, the running of people vp and downe to demaund what it was, and to ſeeke for flight, adding thereunto the terror of the night, in ſo great and well peopled a citie, that there coulde not be ſeene a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confuſion. And although at the riſing of the ſunne hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the truth, this feare vanquiſhed, yet did there a greater ſeaze vpon euery mans minde: for vnderſtanding in trutth the Duke to be ſtrong, they began to heare newes of the ſoldiers inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, which disbanded and drewe daily neerer, giuing no ſmall aſtoniſhment to ſee certaine Negro ſlaues returne wounded, who hauing raſhly paſſed with their enſignes to the other banke, were ill entreated by ſome horſe and ſhot of the enimie: They founde that <hi>Anthony</hi> made no preparation, neither had he any forces to reſiſt, gouerning himſelfe with ſmall iudgement, and therefore he neither knew how to fight, nor which way to flie, neither yet how to yeelde himſelfe: He was daily in counſell with his men, but as he ſuffred himſelfe to be gouerned by many, whoſe authorities were equall,

and their opinions diuers, ſo did he neuer reſolue any good thing,<note place="margin">Anthony of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</note> as it hapneth often in the like accidents. They then propunded more plainly then before the treatie of an accorde, and although ſome, who before did ſeeme braueſt, ſhewed themſelues nowe more milde, yet for that the Counte of Vimioſo being a yoong man, perſwaded to warre, no man durſt contradict him: He affected the charge of generall, but hee knewe not by what meanes to diſplace <hi>Diegode Meneſes,</hi> who enioied it, ſo as contrarying one an other, they prouided ſlowly for things neceſſarie, whereunto was a great hinderance, the credite that <hi>Anthony</hi> gaue to <hi>Edward de Caſtro,</hi> a rich yoong man, to whom he was bounde, hauing furniſhed him with money, who deſirous to ſhew himſelfe valiant, obtained a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to aſſemble what horſe he coulde vnder his cornet, imploying him in matters of greater authoritie, then was fitte for his baſe qualitie.</p>

For this cauſe the King hauing intelligence of his departure from Rome, deſirous to take poſſeſſion of the realme before his arriuall, hee commaunded throughout all Spaine where he ſhoulde paſſe, that he ſhoulde be entertained and receiued with all poſſible pompe, whereof the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat taking no heede, he accepted of all their kindnes.

To goe to Almeryn hee conſidered that he ſhoulde finde no barkes, being all drawne to the other ſide; if hee carried any with him, they were but few, and to builde them there, it was a matter of long delay, and the largenes of the riuer woulde not ſuffer him to make a bridge: And although poſſible in ſome places hee might wade through, yet the march was long being aboue threeſcore myles, that to doe it in ſo hotte a ſeaſon, in a drie countrie, without water, with a great armie, and much baggage, was a painfull thing: It might prolong the warre, and looſe their reputation by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backe, beſides they doubted reſiſtance vpon the paſſage in thoſe parts: To goe to Almada and ſende the galleies within the riuer, it was a Counſell approoued of the greateſt part, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Lewes Douara,</hi> ſaying, it was a moſt aſſured thing, that from the banke they might batter the enimies armie with their cannon, paſſing their armie eaſily, and ſo become maſter of the citie without any loſſe, proouing that neither the rocke of Saint Iulian, nor the fort of Cabeſa Secca, coulde greatly endomage their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies.

And for that <hi>Diego de Meneſes</hi> was at Caſcaies preparing for the defence, the galleies being within view of the citie, they made ſhew to turne their prooes to that place which is called S.

thither, as a conuenient place for deſcent: They made this ſhew to draw <hi>Meneſes</hi> from all other parts to come thither, to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the which ſucceeded happily for the Duke; for ſuch as were<note place="margin">The diſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking of the Dukes armie.</note> in guard in other places, aſſembled themſelues there: The galleies hauing a while runne this courſe, the caſtell of Caſcaies diſcharging ſome cannon ſhot againſt them, turning their ſtems to the place which they call the old ſhoare, which was rough and vnacceſſible, finding it vnfurniſhed, it was eaſie to diſimbarque; although before hee were in ſome doubt whether he ſhoulde proceede or returne backe, both for that the winde was growne contrarie, as hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered vpon the hilles ſome armed men, doubting the ſucceſſe woulde be but badde, yet he reſolued to paſſe on.

            <p>The firſt ſoldier that went a ſhoare was a Hargabuſier, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing choſen a place of leaſt danger, turned his face to the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, leauing behinde him ſufficient ſpace to fourme a ſquadron: Two others which followed him were on each ſide, a little behinde him in equall diſtance, making a triangle equilaterall, beſides theſe two came three others, and then ſixe, and ſo the number ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they went in ranke, the one greater then the other, ſtretching foorth themſelues behind the point of this triangle, making the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſtill greater without looſing the forme, ſo as it grewe to as great a proportion as the place coulde conteine, the which were all put into this forme, after whom the Duke diſimbarked.

So as amazed with the death of ſome of their men, all the reſt began to retire, with no ſmall diſorder towards Caſcayes, from whence <hi>Meneſes</hi> ſaide they ſhould returne to charge the enimie: by reaſon whereof the Duke remained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the fielde with greater facilitie then he expected; the which was a great ſigne that all the other things ſhould ſucceed fauorably, ſeeing in this of ſo great importance, hee had ſo happie ſucceſſe.

He anſwered, that the time was nowe come when as they ſhoulde aide him with men, entertained at their owne charge, which doing, he hoped with many others which hee had aſſembled, God woulde giue him the victorie: but the magiſtrate excuſed they coulde not do it, for the great charge they had beene at by reaſon of the plague; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he replied, that within two daies howſoeuer, he woulde frame his campe, and march againſt the Duke: For this cauſe, hauing let<note place="margin">Anthonie marcheth towards Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with his men conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly.</note> paſſe the fourth day of Auguſt, moſt vnhappie to the Portugals, for the loſſe of the battaile in Affrick, and hauing left ſome of his moſt precious things in certaine religious houſes, he commaunded that all ſoldiers which had beene long before inrolled, and all the people of Lisbone without exception of perſon whatſoeuer, ſhould march towards Belem; the which was executed with great rigour, forcing many to go in perſon: For although the hatred againſt the Caſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were in generall, yet the tailor, the ſhoemaker, the handicrafts men, and the peaſants, who bragged, that they alone woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the whole world, did not willingly leaue their houſes, but fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting daily, they choſe rather to encounter with wordes then bullets, beſides, being accuſtomed to an other trade, and vnfit for warre, they had not beene trained to ſhoote in a Harquebuſe, vnapt to carrie, much leſſe to mannage a pike: So as of this forced and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuarie people they had aſſembled eight or ten thouſand at Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, whither in the ende <hi>Anthony</hi> went, who ſtill doubtfull, and ill aduiſed, without any reſolution, expecting what time woulde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile him. The reſolution whereon he moſt depended was, that if the Duke came againſt the citie, to meete him vpon the waie, with ſome aduantage if he coulde, and giue him battaile, propounding like a deſperate man, either to vanquiſh or to die: yet ſoone after, when the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was preſented, he could neither effect the one nor the other. His troupes lay not encamped, but were diſperſed heere and there, within the houſes of that ſmall place, vnder the porches of the monaſterie, and other ſuch like, without either forme or

He had no captaine of experience, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall of the fielde, nor ſergeant that coulde commaund the ſoldiers, lodge them, and put them in battaile if neede were. <hi>Sforce Orſin</hi> a yoong man, and valiant, but of no great experience, was come out of Italy, at the brute of theſe warres, yet being a ſtranger and alone, he was not obeied, neither did they greatly truſt him: The priuate captaines of companies had no experience, and there was ſo great want of men, that ſome friers were made captaines of the Moores, and of the ſcum of the people, carrying in one hande their croſſes,<note place="margin">Religious men deuided into factions.</note> and in the other their armes. It is not to be forgotten (as a thing not accuſtomed) the mutinies growen in religious houſes, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deuided into factions, fewe were affected to the Caſtillians, few remained newters, and infinite were thoſe that affected the rule of <hi>Anthony,</hi> for the fauouring of whoſe cauſe, they committed manie diſorders: The prieſts were no more temperate then the reſt, many whereof hauing left their prieſtly habite, were gone to field armed: In this confuſion <hi>Anthony</hi> remained three daies at Belem, whileſt the Duke approched ſlowly: The fourth day, hee conſidered that although there came ſtill vnto him ſome ſoldiers which had beene leuied in all the cities of the realme, yet the armie diminiſhed dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that the inhabitants of the citie left him, who hauing their houſes neere, not accuſtomed to the diſcommodities of warre, fled from him, therefore he ſent to Lisbone, commaunding vpon great puniſhments to bring vnto him by force, al ſuch as ſhould be found armed, or vnarmed, defending that no man ſhoulde retire to anie other place, but where he was, deſiring that as well the cowardes as the valiant, ſhoulde runne the like fortune with him; ſuppoſing (as king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> had done to his loſſe) it were poſſible to force men to fight that were both vnskilfull and vnwilling: And foraſmuch as his onely hope conſiſted in the peoples fauour, to the ende they ſhoulde follow him more willingly, he graunted vnto all (but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe of his traine, free libertie, the which carrying with it confuſion, was cauſe of great harme; for as the whole citie was filled with Negroes and Peaſants, the quieter ſorte had more feare of the people the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the enimy, yet was there not ſeene any one to powre foorth his hate, or commit any priuate reuenge, of ſmall or great importance, not for that there are not many diſſentions and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

But this aduiſe being diſallowed of the greateſt part, hee retired himſelfe by the counſell of <hi>Sforce Orſin</hi> to Alcantara, a mile<note place="margin">Anthonic retires to Alcantara.</note> neerer the citie, putting a riuer betwixt him and the enimie, the which hauing the banks high on that part, ſerued him as a fortreſſe. And although this retraite was rather cauſed, by the inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wherewith hee went to Belem, then by any newe feare of the enimie, yet was it iudicious, the place being ſtrong by nature, and fitte for <hi>Anthonies</hi> intent, who deſired not to retire farre from the citie, to keepe it in obedience.</p>
            <p>The Catholique King who remained ſtill at Badagios, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Dukes proceedings, being on the one ſide glad, and on the otherſide troubled to ſee this people attende the ſcourge of warre, beſides that he did incenſe them againſt him, whom he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much to entertaine as friendes, for this cauſe hee ſought all meanes poſſible, as he had euer done, to winne them with the leaſt ſhewe of hoſtilitie; and therefore he thought it good to graunt a generall pardon to all portugals, that had beene imploied in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt him, ſeeking by clemencie to make his enimies friends, the which he publiſhed, being thus in effect: <q>That being informed that in the rebellion that <hi>Anthony</hi> had raiſed, vſurping tirannouſlie the name of a king of Portugall, many of them which had followed his faction, had done it, being oppreſſed, forced, and deceiued, and<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique kings pardon to the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</note> that ſeeking to prouide that ſuch ſhould not be puniſhed with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and that the people more eaſie to be abuſed then the reſt; ſhoulde not bee chaſticed with that rigour which lawe doth inflict; his pleaſure was, That al ſuch (as leauing the part of the ſaid <hi>Anthony</hi> and embracing his, as of their King, and naturall Lorde,) ſhoulde

Some were of opinion that the Prior in whom deſire of rule was of more force then religion, or other reſpect whatſoeuer, ſhould (finding al hopes loſt) procure that this citie (which is in a manner the whole realme) ſhoulde remaine as a praie to the auarice and voluptuouſnes of the Caſtillians, deſiring that the Portugals being forced to yeelde, the realme ſhoulde be ſo entreated by the Catholique Kings men, as there might remaine no hope of peace or amitie; to the end, that if heereafter he ſhoulde pretende the recouerie of the realme, the people (in regard of the hatred that ſuch loſſes engender, togither with their naturall inclination) ſhoulde remaine ſtill enimie, and be

more willing to yeeld to his deuotion: For this cauſe he ſought dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with all his force to reforme the magiſtrate of the chamber, and to place men, in whom he had great affiance, as well to haue entire into the citie if need were, as alſo to diſpoſe of things at his pleaſure: But foraſmuch as the greateſt part of thoſe magiſtrates were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicke men, in whom feare hath a more intereſt, then the reſpect of a King, he did not greatly truſt them: When he was proclaimed king, there followed him a gentleman of Caſtill, who ſerued him as the firſt vallet of his chamber, ſeeing the warres to grow betwixt the Portugals and Caſtillians, hee craued, and obtained leaue to<note place="margin">A treatie of agreement with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</note> retire himſelfe into his countrey.

Hee arriued at ſuch time as the Duke was emcamped before the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:9072:110"/>
rocke of Saint Iulian. Now did there lighten foorth a great hope of peace, the which ſoone after vaniſhed away: For although the Duke ſeemed to be well pleaſed with this practiſe, yet may we well ſay, it did not content him, ſeeming happely vnto him, that being ſo farre aduanced, hee ſhoulde haue more honour to conquer it by armes, then by agreement. For which cauſe he returned <hi>Carcamo</hi> to the Prior with this aunſwer: That he was glad of his reſolution to<note place="margin">The anſwere of the Duke to Anthony.</note> ſerue his maieſtie, but there was no reaſon to ſende an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to the States,<q> ſeeing hee helde not the crowne from them but from the people, to whom if hee pleaſed hee woulde ſende, and grant the like graces vnto them, which other cities had receiued by their yeelding. Theſe words were deliuered him in writing, but by mouth the Duke added, that he had beene an affectionate ſeruant to <hi>Lewes</hi> his father, and that as he had now taken armes to depriue him of the realme; ſo woulde he take them in hande againe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer him an other, ſo as it were not any of thoſe that belonged to his King and Lord.</q> 
               <hi>Carcamo</hi> was not yet without hope to conclude the buſines, but nowe the Spaniſh grauitie hindred the effect of ſo great importance: For the Duke ſuppoſed he ſhoulde not giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Anthony</hi> any greater title then Seignory, and hee that was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Excellencie to Highnes, held himſelfe contemned, and ſo much diſdained it, that both for the cold anſwere, &amp; for this reſpect, he was aſſured the Duke would haue no agreement: He therefore made anſwer by mouth, that ſeeing he woulde not agree, if his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would obey him, and be conformable to his will, they would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanquiſh or all die in that place. Vpon this anſwere, the Duke (repenting his manner of writing, or it may bee, fearing the King woulde not like of this kind of proceeding,) ſent backe <hi>Carcamo</hi> to ſay vnto <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he ſhould ſend one by ſea, or by land, and he woulde ſende another, and that in the midde way they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all thinges: But the Prior who had ſmall confidence in the Duke, being greatly mooued, made no other replie; but that Kings were Kings, and captaines, captaines; but that victories came from the hands of God: ſo as the Duke diſpairing of the matter, deuiſed for his diſcharge, that <hi>Anthony</hi> had ſent him worde, that he deſired to conferre with him by night in a barke; and the better to induce men to beleeue it, he went publikely to lie aboord in a galley, and being

He willed her to ſay vnto the captine of the forte, that he had done ill to make ſo ſmall account of the Dukes meſſage, and that he ſhoulde not wilfully caſt himſelfe away; ſhe deliuered her ambaſſage, &amp; being returned with her daughter to the campe, ſhe ſaid vnto the Duke on the behalfe of <hi>Triſtan Vaz,</hi> that he defended himſelfe, hauing not as yet ſeene any meſſenger from him, whom he woulde haue heard and entertained, and that if he woulde aſſure him vpon his word, he woulde go to the campe to ſpeake with him.

But as the words of the magiſtrate did nothing mooue the Prior, no more did the ſpeeches of the Prior alter the inward minde of the Magiſtrate, ſo as all remained in ſuſpence, euery man with his owne intentions: True it is, that as well the ſaide Prior as ſome of the magiſtrates, had eaſily agreed with the Duke vpon certaine conditions: But the Priors will was forced by thoſe of the houſe of Portugall, and eſpecially by the Biſhop, and the Citizens, by many new officers, who had their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in perpetuitie; the which were woont to bee graunted but for a time: Theſe men arrogating to themſelues more authoritie then was giuen them, woulde not ſuffer the execution of any thing, but what pleaſed themſelues: But for all this <hi>Anthony</hi> was not without feare that the citie woulde rebell againſt him to his vtter ruine, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in fewe, he coulde finde no better remedie, then to place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at the gates of the citie, and in the armie at ſea, a number of religious men of diuers orders, to guarde the entrie with the ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to keepe the keies, truſting deſeruedly more in them, then in the captaines that were there imploied: For in the aſſemblies and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9072:112"/>
counſels of State that were often held, there appeered more hatred againſt the Caſtillians, and more will to fight in the religious men then in the ſecular.</p>
            <p>The Duke was now returned to the ſame lodging of Oeiras, a place both by nature and arte ſtrong: For beſides the great number of artillerie and rampiers, the countrey was rough &amp; ſtony, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the horſemen could hardly fight, in whoſe force the Portugals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied much: He made no ſhewe to diſlodge, for ſuppoſing now (as in effect it was) that from thence he helde all the realme aſſieged, and principally with his galleies, hee ſuppoſed that both the Prior and the citie, would ſoone yeelde vnto him: <q>Beſides that, to march on, conſidering his craftie nature and ſlowe diſpoſition, and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals armie being ſo neere, he thought it not conuenient; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with all poſſible deuiſes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querour without fighting;</q> and had now almoſt corrupted the captaines of the galleies, and of the tower of Belem, who ſhoulde ſoone haue deliuered vnto him both tower and armie; the which had been effected, if <hi>Anthony</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had not gone in perſon, who hauing diſpoſſeſſed in a manner all the captaines of their charges, and placed others, without giuing them reſpite to execute their practiſes; <q>but he was nowe growen ſo iealous of euery man, finding in all men ſo great feare, and ſo little faith,</q> that hee knewe not whom to truſt, if he were not a religious man, a marriner, or of the baſer ſort. And for that it ſeemes alwaies to ſuch as feare that they are betraied, it hapned that fire being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by chaunce in certaine ſtraw which lay about the caſtell wals of the citie, where his roiall tapeſtrie lay, he grewe ſuſpicious that this fire had beene ſome ſigne vnto the enimies, and that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſtrangers whom he had placed there in guard, had made it, for that they woulde not goe to fielde to fight, and this feare was ſo violent, that without examining the fact, without conſidering they were Flemmings, whoſe nation for the moſt part were the moſt obſtinate enimies, that euer the Catholique King had, thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde by his owne feare, and that of <hi>Emanuel Soares</hi> one of the newe Veriadors of the chamber, hee diſplaced the ſtrangers from thence, and being not yet well aſſured, hee commaunded that all ſtrangers ſhoulde depart the citie, and ſoone after he decreed, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were not executed) that they ſhoulde be ſpoiled.

The Duke in the meane time preſented himſelfe on the right banke, oppoſite to the Priors armie, vpon the hils where hee had planted his cannon; where viewing the Portugals ſcattered in their lodging, hee founde himſelfe deceiued in his conceaued opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that vpon the allarum giuen they ſhoulde ranke themſelues into ſquadrons: Hee now perceiued that this intent to batter their rankes with his artillerie could not ſucceed, as hee had preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and diſordering them to charge them on all ſides, ſuppoſing in this manner he ſhould eaſily breake them: But hauing changed his reſolution, according to the occurrants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being willing to hazard a battaile, he did endomage them all he coulde with his cannon, and ſo did the Prior likewiſe on his part: He commaunded <hi>Proſper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> to attempt the bridge with his men, that were in the ſquadrons on the right hand, ſtriuing to paſſe it, and to winne as much ground as he could: He gaue order to <hi>Sanches d'Auila</hi> with two thouſande Harquebuſiers, which he had drawne out of his middle Battalion, hauing paſſed the brooke aboue whereas the bankes are loweſt, and eaſieſt to aſcend to draw the enimie to combate, with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage he could: charging them in flanke euen vnto their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: He gaue commiſſion to <hi>Ferrant</hi> his ſonne, who taking a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compaſſe, ſhoulde paſſe the brooke, whereas the bankes were not high, vnto the other ſide with his horſe, and go againſt the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but if he ſhoulde not iſſue foorth of his lodging, as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they ſhould then aſſaile them on all parts at one inſtant, hee remaining behinde with the reſt of the foote, to ſuccour where need ſhould require, in a place more eminent then the reſt, from the which he might diſcouer both armies, where hauing left his ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons a little behinde him, he ſate him downe, viewing howe the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault woulde ſucceed, &amp; making neceſſarie counterſignes: <hi>Proſper Colona</hi> came to the bridge before that either <hi>Sanches d' Auila,</hi> or the horſemen could attaine to the other banke, it may be for that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued them to make a longer march, or for that the Italians (as the Duke ſaid) to winne honor, made too great haſte: They found it not vnfurniſhed, for the Portugals had there planted their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of moſt eſteeme, who at the firſt aſſault made great reſiſtance: For although the Italians fought valiantly, yet was it long ere they preuailed any thing; for the place being narrowe, defended and

ſoldiers being firſt entred, were expelled by the Spaniards, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent thither by their commaunders, vnder colour to preſerue them being friends, they committed greater exceſſe then the other, being enimies, would haue done; for the Italians being departed, the Spaniards hauing ſearched out the moſt ſecret things, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, they carried them by night into the galleies, and into their houſes. <q>The diuerſitie of nations which were at the ſpoile, cauſed more reſpect to the women, and holy things then had beene otherwiſe; for the Spaniards moſt inſolent in other countries, were here againſt their nature very continent, leaſt by their example the Italians and Germaines in Spaine ſhoulde grow woorſe.</q> The boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mooueables and other precious things, which this citie in ſo many yeeres peace, and by the traffique of the Indies had gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">The number that were ſlaine in the battaile.</note> togither was infinite. The number of ſuch as were ſlaine in the battaile was ſmall, in regard of the little defence they made, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there died not aboue a thouſand of the Portugals, and not aboue a hundreth of the Dukes armie, of ſo ſmall force were the peoples armes, ruſted with eaſe. The Duke when the citie was yeelded, came himſelfe in perſon for the defence thereof; where hauing made ſome ſtay in one of the houſes neere the ſuburbes, hee returned to lodge from whence the Portugals were departed. <hi>Anthony</hi> hauing dreſſed his wounde at Sacabem, ſixe miles from Lisbone, marched eaſily toward Saint Arem: The Duke ſtanding doubtfull whether he remained ſtill within the citie, or were fled, for that the Portugals for his better ſafetie gaue out falſe rumours. This victorie was of great importance, and had beene greater if the Prior had beene taken priſoner, for in his ſafetie, the realme (which ſhoulde haue beene in quiet) remained in ſuſpence, all men ſuppoſing that he ſhould repaire his forces, and trie his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune<note place="margin">The Duke blamed.</note> a newe. The Duke was blamed of many for not vſing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diligence, ſaying, it was a great errour, in all other things to haue ſet ſo good an order, and to haue omitted it in this of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſome did attribute it vnto negligence, others vnto malice, eſpecially for that <hi>Anthony</hi> had made ſo great a ſtay betwixte Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabem and Saint Arem; ſo as he might eaſily haue ſuppreſſed him, and this was the iſſue of the battaile of Alcantara.</p>
            <p>In the meane while the ſhips which came from the Indies, were
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:9072:117"/>
diſanchored from the Ilands of Terceraes, &amp; ſailed towards Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, ill aduertiſed of what had paſſed. And for as much as they had former intelligence of their arriuall at the Ilands, it was thought good they ſhoulde ſtaie there, being valued at three millions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubted they ſhould be loſt: For on the one ſide the Duke had ſent ſome ſhips armed to ſeeke them, on the other ſide the Prior had ſent certaine carauels with aduiſe to go to Penichie, a place vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coaſt twentie miles from Lisbone, towardes the north, and therefore it was feared they coulde not eſcape the one, or the other, either to be taken by the kings ſhips, or to follow the direction of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and in what ſort ſoeuer, they ſhoulde bee loſt: For falling into the hands of the Caſtillians they ſhoulde bee ſpoiled, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Penichie, the Prior woulde become maſter of priuate mens goods, and imploy them for the neceſſitie of the warres. And ſome ignorant of <hi>Anthonies</hi> commiſſion, ſuppoſed they ſhould either go to Fraunce or England, and that the Prior (finding the weakenes of his force, by the euent of this battaile) ſhoulde followe them; notwithſtanding fortune did ſo ſecond the beginning, that two daies after the battaile, they appeered in ſafetie, without any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of theſe troubles within the realme, or any encounter vpon the way; ſuch was the Catholique kings good fortune, that they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued ſafe at Lisbone; where he receiued what appertained to the crowne, and deliuered to euery priuate man his owne.</p>
            <p>All this while they were in ſuſpence at Badagios, expecting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this enterpriſe ſhoulde be ended by armes or agreement, and ſo doubtfull euery man was, for that there appeared on either ſide great difficultie; the rather, for that the Duke could not ſtay long from entertaining one of theſe parties ſo different. But the xxvj. day of Auguſt, in the morning, there arriued a Spaniſh merchant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any letters from the Duke, who brought newes of the ſucceſſe: This man following the Spaniſh campe, when he ſaw the Priors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in route, preſently paſſed the riuer in a ſmall barke, and tooke poſte before him that brought aduertiſement from the Duke, who preſenting himſelfe vnto the King, deliuered what hee had ſeene, whereof he receiued ſuch contentment as may bee ſuppoſed: This newes was preſently ſpred throughout all the court, with the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ioy of all men, and to the great honour of the Duke, and with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:9072:118"/>
ſuch kinde of commendations, as the force of truth doth vſually draw vpon the ſodaine, euen from the mouth of enimies: But the confirmation of theſe newes, ſtaying longer then was conuenient for the neerenes of the place, and the importance of the action, they began to doubt with ſo great perturbation, that there was no leſſe ſhewe of their generall deſire, then of their receiued content: The which was after confirmed by the Arriuall of <hi>Ferrant de Toledo,</hi> the Dukes nephew, whom he had diſpatched with a priuate relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely of the ſucceſſe, but alſo of the reaſons which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to fight, and his direction giuen vnto the captaine,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of the Duke of Alua.</note> the which was generally approoued of all, with no ſmall honour to the Duke, ſaying, that he had now ſatisfied mens mindes, who held him alwaies to be too cunning and watchfull, to aſſure his enterpriſe by aduantages of lodging, and ſtratagems, auoiding the battaile by all meanes poſſible without great aduantage, following amongſt the auncient Captaines <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> and amongſt the later <hi>Proſper Colonna</hi> the elder, whom he ſought to imitate: And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Dukes proceeded from his two reſolutions: The one to paſſe from Settuual to Caſcaies, and the other to fight at Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantara, ſeeing in the firſt he alone did contradict his counſell, and conteſted both againſt ſea and enimie: And in the ſecond he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to fight dangerouſly with the Portugals, within their owne trenches, hauing a well peopled citie behinde them; and againſt the aduiſe of ſome of the principall of the armie. They did highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to haue kept Lisbone from ſpoile; and at one inſtant to play the conqueror and protector, attributing vnto him for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect more honour, then to haue retired his armie from the wals of Rome in the yeere 1557. hauing not fought there, vnto the gates of the citie, as he did at Lisbone.</p>
            <p>But theſe reaſons with other, were daſhed by a ſodaine cruell acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which ſo troubled the mindes of all men, as there was no time to thinke nor ſpeake of any thing, the which was that vpon the newes of this happie ſucceſſe, the king fell moſt dangerouſly ſicke, the which ſo encreaſed, being brought to that point, that there was ſmall hope of his life, and euen his Phiſitions themſelues almoſt gaue him ouer: vpon this ſubiect was all their diſcourſes, for the king dying, it was ſuppoſed that the protector of Chriſtendome
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:9072:118"/>
ſhoulde faile, and if there were any doubt, that his death in time <note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique kings ſicknes and the diſcourſe vpon it.</note> might cauſe any alteration, it was then moſt of all to be feared: for beſides that the affaires of Flaunders were troubleſome, the humors of the French ill diſpoſed, Portugall yet in ballance to incline to a contrarie partie, and the reſt of Spaine was not well aſſured: The opinions were diuers what courſe to take, but all was confuſed, and all full of feare. The Duke of Alua whoſe opinion many of the better ſort did follow, thought it fit, that the king dying, the Queene with the prince ſhould preſently enter into Portugall, and goe to Lisbone, thinking by this meanes with the forces he had there readie, not onely to keepe the realme in peace, but alſo to aſſure the other eſtates of Spaine: He now laboured to ſtabliſh the affaires, for depriuing from the office of the magiſtrate of the chamber of Lisbone, ſuch as had been inſtalled by the Prior, he reſtored ſuch as had bin before; calling them vnto him, he ſaid; it was now time that in the cities behalfe, they ſhould ſweare obedience vnto the king, and proclaime his name in the publique ſtreetes, with accuſtomed ceremonie; whereunto they willingly offered themſelues, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding leaue for this cauſe to make publique feaſtes, and that withall, the priuileges of the citie might be confirmed: Whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,<note place="margin">Lisbone ſweares obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the king.</note> that there was then no neede, but they ſhould reſerue it, vntill the prince were there preſent to be ſworne, whome his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie had reſolued to ſend vnto the citie to be bred vp amongſt them; and as for their priuileges, they were very ſmall, that he woulde graunt them more amplie. So as the eleuenth day of September in the Dukes lodging, they tooke their oath in forme, and the next day after dinner, the magiſtrate going thorough the citie with the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard and their Attaballes, they proclaimed the name of King <hi>Phil p</hi> after the accuſtomed manner; yet with a weake voice, and ſmall aſſemblie of people. And as in the proclaiming of other kings there appeered nothing but feaſts and ioy; here was nothing to be ſeene, but ſecret ſighes and hidden ſorrow with flatterie: The Dukes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was lodged vntill the tenth of September betwixt the citie and Alcantara, at the ſame lodging where the Portugals had lodged, without any reſolution what to doe, ſtill expecting ſome newes of the Prior. At which time there grew (as a companion to warre) not<note place="margin">A contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Catar.</note> onely in the campe, but likewiſe in the citie a contagious infirmitie
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:9072:119"/>
of Catarre, ſo dangerous, that it did no leſſe harme then the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent contagion; few were free from this diſeaſe, and many of them died, eſpecially of the ſoldiers, for that to a new diſeaſe, ordinarie remedies helpe little: <hi>Anthonie</hi> ſoone after arriued at Saint Arem, where the magiſtrate of that place, (being the ſelfeſame,) who a little before with ſo great ioy had proclaimed him king, would not giue him entrie, ſo are mens mindes turned with fortune; yet hauing promiſed to depart preſently, they ſuffered him to enter vpon that condition, and the day following, he went towards Coimbra.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Prior aſſembles new forces.</note> At this time the Prior with his traine tormented the inhabitants of the prouince betwixt Doro and Mignio, aſſembling men of warre by force, and for that many (doubting ſiniſter euents) feared that in ſauing of him they ſhould preiudice themſelues, he forced obedience vpon greeuous paines, which he impoſed vpon ſuch as followed him not: So as ſome for feare of their perſons, others of their goodes, came vnto him; yet were there others, who of their naturall inclination would not leaue him vntill death: In this ſort, he gathered together fower or fiue thouſand men, with the which he held the citie of Coimbra in awe, ſo as it could not yeelde to the Catholique king: Hee went with them to Auero, where hauing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:9072:119"/>
found ſome reſiſtance, he vſed his greateſt force: For hauing with ſome ſmall peeces of artillerie battered the wals, he gaue a confuſed<note place="margin">Auero ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> aſſault; but profiting little, his friends within did ſo weaken the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by words and force, that the Priors men entred: The ſuccours which <hi>Pantaleon de Sada</hi> brought from Porto, comming too late: There he impriſoned diuers perſons, he ſlew, ſpoiled, and ruined all he could: By theſe actes (which ſeemed vnto them moſt glorious) his peaſantlie ſoldiers were growne to that arrogancie, that armed with hookes, and ſtaues, they threatned to goe to Lisbone, to free the realme from the hands of the Caſtillians: And this fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption was not a little furthered with the newes, that <hi>Anthonie</hi> had of the kings ſickneſſe, whome they gaue out to be dead, being attired all in blacke the better to perſwade them.</p>
            <p>The Duke was well aduertiſed of all theſe things, finding ſtill more plainly of what importance the flight of <hi>Anthonie</hi> was: There wanted not ſome that charged him to haue forborne too long, in ſending men after him, yet hauing care to aſſure that which did more import; he would not deuide his forces, vntill he did ſee an end of the kings infirmitie, who hauing long laboured in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of death, he began with an vniuerſall ioy to recouer, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing daily the ſignes of health, he grewe well; wherewith feare which troubled the mindes of men being taken away, they began to talke againe of the victorie, and of the Dukes actions: But this commendation which was attributed vnto him (as it hapneth in all worldly actions) continued little, and rarely ſhall you finde ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant an example of the inconſtancie of the people, and the force of enuie as this was: for ſodainly his praiſes were turned into mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, and open ſlaunders, ſearching ſo many reaſons to deface the Dukes merits, as two daies before they had alleaged to extoll his actions. The Dukes reprehenſions grew from the proper mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters<note place="margin">The Duke blamed.</note> of this warre, or from ſuch as followed the enterpriſe, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him for the diuerſitie of their opinions, or for their own priuate practiſes, or elſe (as ſome would haue it) deſirous to creepe into the kings fauour by like reports, did write that the ſacke had beene very great, and freely ſuffred for three daies, whereunto they woulde attribute the Portugals diſobedience, and their diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Caſtillians, labouring to prooue, that if the Duke
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9072:120"/>
had pleaſed, by his authoritie hee might haue ſtaied it, but being partaker with his kinſemen (who were more imploied to ſpoile then to fight) of a good part of the bootie, hee did tolerate it; leauing outrages and thefts vnpuniſhed, although complaints were made vnto him. That the termes of conqueſt, taking of cities, and route of armie, were vaine and vnproper, ſeeing that in no place they had founde any reſiſtance; and that this multitude of Portugals, as ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people (deceiued by their prieſts in confeſſions and preachings) could not be termed an armie, nor their route called a victorie: And ſo blinde is enuie, that two armies encountring with many peeces of great artillerie, fighting on the one ſide for the paſſage of a bridge, on the other ſide in their trenches, the Portugals foote and horſe broken, the enimie put to flight, the ſtandard roiall taken, with many other coulors, and aboue a thouſand men ſlaine, and yet they woulde not haue this a battaile: Some which did charge him with negligence ſaide, that ſeeing hee had an intention to diſlodge this armie (after he had attempted the bridge &amp; the trenches) he ſhould haue ſtretched foorth his horſemen further on the left hande, to cut off the enimies way, and to take him priſoner, if he woulde flie; but to keepe himſelfe ſo farre off as he coulde not ouertake him, was an vnexcuſable faulte in ſo great a captaine: Others ſaide, that it was not credible, but he ſhoulde haue taken him, if hee had pleaſed to place his horſe in a conuenient place for that purpoſe, which euerie ignorant captaine woulde haue conſidered, but that hee willingly ſuffered him to flie; that by meanes of <hi>Anthonies</hi> libertie, the warre ſhoulde not ſeeme to be ended, a thing which captaines doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wiſh, preferring their owne authoritie, and their priuate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, before the publike good: Others did adde that if hee would haue taken him after his flight, and the battaile woon, hee might well haue done it, for making no haſte to flie, he might ſo ſpeedily haue followed him with his horſe as the importance of his perſon did require.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Dukes excuſes.</note> Amongſt ſo many accuſations, fewe durſt ſpeake for the Duke, yet ſome of his friendes laboured to iuſtifie him, ſaying, that time, place, and deſire to aſſure the victorie, doth often hinder the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe things which the captaine wiſheth: That it was not then conuenient to follow the Prior: For conſidering the ineuitable
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9072:120"/>
diſorders of the ſoldiers, in ſending many, hee had contrarie to the kings pleaſure waſted the countrey, and if hee had ſent fewe, they had not beene ſafe; and therefore he deſired to temper this heate of victorie in the ſoldiers mindes, meaning after to ſende a part of the armie in good order, but when as hee ment to effect it, the Kings ſicknes hapned, whereof he deſired firſt to ſee the iſſue, before he woulde bee vnfurniſhed of his forces. That touching the inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the enimies campe with his horſe, beſides that they had no ſufficient number to do it, it had not beene the reſolution of a wiſe captaine to make a fearefull enimie deſperate; and to force him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fight or become a priſoner. Touching the ſacking of the ſuburbes, they ſaide it was no ſmall good happe to haue ſo many houſes without the wals of the citie; for otherwiſe they ſhould hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue kept the ſoldiers from ſpoiling it, and that it was in a manner neceſſarie for the ſauing of the citie to haue ſomething <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o quench this deſire, which they had brought with them. And as there was ſome difficultie to ſaue the citie from the ſacke, ſo was it impoſſible to keepe the ſuburbes from ſpoile, ſeeing the battaile was giuen within the limits thereof. They laughed at ſuch as ſaide the Duke was partaker of the ſpoile, ſeeming vnto them a matter farre from his qualitie. They ſhewed that although they woulde not haue it ſaide that the battaile were glorious, but vnwoorthie, againſt a ſmall number of ſeditious monkes, apoſtates, and fugitiue ſlaues, yet coulde it hardly be concealed, for it coulde not be denied but that <hi>Anthony</hi> had a great number of men in a ſtrong lodging, amongſt the which were many of the Nobility, and that which moſt ſupplied their want of experience, paſſionate againſt the Catholique king, and moſt affectionate to the Prior; that in armies where ſuch things happen, it is not credible they ſo eaſily yeeld or flie of themſelues, if they be not encountred with a captaine that is both valiant, &amp; of iudgement, who by force or cunning doth breake them &amp; put them to flight. They did prooue by liuely reaſons that it was not credible that the Duke with a reſolution ſo hurtfull to his king, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the enterpriſe &amp; ſeeke to continue his commaund, by meanes of the warre, ſaying, that although in auncient common wealthes, noble citizens were deſirous to be imploied in expeditions, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernments of armies, to free themſelues from the ſubiection of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:9072:121"/>
Senate; yet was it not ſo in the gouernment of later princes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch as be neere the king haue more authoritie, then ſuch as bee retired. They added vnto theſe reaſons, the conſideration of the Dukes age, fidelitie, and experience, with auncient and newe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; concluding it was likely, that without any priuate ſubiect, hee had laboured with his beſt endeuour wholie to ſerue the king: But although he were vehemently defended, yet could they not wholy roote it out of the mindes of men; ſo is the chance of this worldly Tragedie toſſed vpſide downe, that the captaine which the weeke before had beene triumphant and glorious, lay now in his bed ſicke with ſorrow, ſlaundered with his Prince, and his armie halfe defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, languiſhing with hunger and want, infected with the plague, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for exceſſe and violence; ſome part whereof was true, and ſome falſe: ſo as the ſoldiers were troubled, melancholy, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; and although with the inſolencie of conquerors, yet ſeemed they like men vanquiſhed: They commaunders of the armie were likewiſe in diſpaire to reape any recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their ſeruice, ſo as the captaines which reſolued to plant them ſelues in Portugall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue great recompence by confiſcations, were deceiued of their hopes: For the King who had an other meaning, reſolued to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all the wrongs the Portugals had done him, and not onely to pardon their diſobedience, but alſo reward and cheriſh them as his children. It was generally ſpoken, that vpon the Priors defeate and yeelding of the citie of Lisbone, the King ſhoulde preſently go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon, and by graunting rewardes and pardons, labour to winne the Portugals loues, and to qualifie that bitternes which the ſpoile and inſolencie of the ſoldiers had bredde. But although there had beene already ſpeech of his going to Eluas, and that he deſired to make his entrie as king of Portugall; yet did he not effect it, for that as it is ſaide before, the plague was diſperſed into many parts of the realme. He laboured to become maſter not onely of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces within the realme, but alſo of all others that depended thereof: when as the armie began firſt to enter the realme, he had ſent into Affrick to demaund obedience of thoſe places, but for as much as <hi>Anthony</hi> had preuented him by former letters vnto the captaines, his buſines being in better eſtate, then they prooued afterwardes, the inhabitants woulde not agree to acknowledge <hi>Philip;</hi> by reaſon
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:9072:121"/>
whereof, the battaile being woone, he ſent againe vnto them; for<note place="margin">The yeelding of the places in Affricke which the Portugals held.</note> being of great importance for Spaine, he feared, that remaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Priors commaund, he ſhoulde raſhly diſpoſe of them ſo as promiſing recompence to the captaines, they did acknowledge him for their Lord, but with greater facilitie in one place then in an other; ſo as without any innouation, hee confirmed the ſame cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and the ſame garriſons.</p>

At this time there arriued at Viana one part of thoſe horſe which perſued him, hauing intelligence of his being there, againſt whom the citie put themſelues in armes: But the captaine ſaying vnto them, that if they refuſed to obey, they ſhould be ſpoiled by the armie which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched, and would arriue that day or the next, they grew amaſed, and yeelded vpon condition, to haue their liues and goods ſaued. Vpon the view of theſe horſemen, the Prior finding himſelfe in ſo<note place="margin">The taking of Viana.</note> great danger, in a place of ſmall truſt, and diſarmed, reſolued rather to conteſt againſt the waues, and windes, then againſt the enimie; and therefore he imbarked with the Biſhop, and ſome other of his traine, hoping, that whileſt the citie made reſiſtance, hee lying there concealed, ſome ſmall winde woulde driue them from the lande: But fortune (to ſpeake after the common phraſe) ſeemed not yet wearie of him, for the ſea ſwelled more, and the windes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and continued ſo long, that the Caſtillians being entred, and demanding for him, they had intelligence he was in the ſhippe, making preparation to go take him, wherof they ſeemed to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But the Prior vnderſtanding thereof, ſeeing into what danger he was now brought, hauing deuided his treaſure (which was not great) to ſuch as were about him, hee attired himſelfe like a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and accompanied with the Earle and Biſhop, and ſome of his other fauorites, with the moſt pretious things that he had, he tooke
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:9072:127"/>
boate in great danger of drowing, landing vpon the other banke of the riuer of Minio, the which is directly againſt the citie. The which the Caſtillians diſcouering, made haſte to purſue him: But<note place="margin">Anthonie ſaues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on the other ſide of the riuer Minio, in danger to be taken.</note> for as much as the riuer is not to be paſſed there, before the Caſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans could embarke, he had time to ſaue himſelfe, looſing all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and ſome things of price, yet had hee all his moſt precious iewels ſowed in his garments. True it is that ſince there was found in Caſtill ſome peeces of the rich capariſon, where of I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a ſouldiers poſſeſſion, who ſaid, he had then taken it from one of the Priors ſlaues; but the King ſuſpicious that <hi>Anthonie</hi> had beene his priſoner, and deliuered for that ranſome, kept him long in priſon. It ſeemed that Fortune did accompanie the Prior to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue him, it may be for ſome greater affliction for this Realme, for at the ſame inſtant he left his boate, and went to lande, there arriued on the ſame ſide that other troupe of horſemen that purſued him, who had eaſily taken him, if they had once ſuſpected he had beene there; but diſcouering on the other ſide a troupe of horſe, imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to paſſe the riuer, not able to diſcerne (by reaſon of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) whether they were friends or enemies, nor for what reaſon they paſſed, they were in doubt what to doe, during which time the Prior retired himſelfe: And although by their approch they found by their colours who they were, yet before the one could vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the others reſolution, the time was ſpent and they effected nothing.</p>
            <p>The king did now beginne to recouer his health, after ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a ſickneſſe, at which time Queene <hi>Anne</hi> his wife fell ſicke of a<note place="margin">The death of Queene Anne.</note> rotten feuer, the which in few daies brought her to another life; wherewith the king was much grieued, being a Ladie wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his humour, and indued with ſingular bountie. Hauing recouered his former health, forbearing to enter the realme, vntill<note place="margin">The King enters into Portugall by the citie of Eluas.</note> all were reduced to his obedience, ſeeing now the Prior to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and to hide himſelfe, he went to Eluas the firſt citie of the realme, where the Portugals receiued him with great ioy; for that in this citie and others, bordering vpon Caſtill, their hatred is not ſo mortall againſt the Caſtillians, as in other places: There he did open the barred hauens, that is, he diſanulled the impoſts, which were paied, as well in Caſtill, as in Portugall, of all ſuch merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:9072:127"/>
as paſſed from realme to realme; the which amounted yeerely to 150000. duckats; he ſet a tax of 80000. duckats vpon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors perſon, as a rebell and diſturber of the quiet of the realme: He proclaimed a parliament at Tomar, the fifteenth day of Aprill, where he would aſſiſt in perſon, with the generall opinion and great hope of all men, that all Portugals that had offended, ſhould there receiue their pardon, and the obedient haue reward; and that to all in generall, he would giue great recompences, graunting to the cities of the realme whatſoeuer they demaunded. There remained neither citie nor place, within the maine land of Portugall, that had not yeelded their obedience to the king of Spaine: For after the Priors flight from Viana, all was in the Caſtillians power; the places of Affricke were obedient, and ſo was the Iland of Madera; as for the places further off, time would not yet ſuffer them to haue any certaine newes.</p>

After in the month of Nouember in the yeare 1580. they returned to Terco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, giuing an account of their charge, adding that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Anthonie</hi> had beene broken at Alcantara, yet he began in the Prouince betwixt Doro and Mynio with 30000. men, to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon the Caſtillians: And although they had after intelligence of <hi>Philips</hi> abſolute victorie, and of the flight of <hi>Anthonie,</hi> yet they continued firme in their opinions, wherein they were daily confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for that (as it is ſaid before) the Kings miniſters had neglected to ſend vnto them; whereas contrariwiſe <hi>Anthonie</hi> and the Earle of Vimioſa did ſtill ſolicite them by curriers and letters to continue firme: the ſaid Earle, hauing ſent <hi>Anthonie Scalyn</hi> a Frenchman vnto them with letters, whereby in the Priors name hee did commende their good affection; they ſo far paſſed the bounds of ioy, as they receiued him into Angra in proceſſion, and vnder a cannapie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting him to the Church of pitie, where the ſaide Fryer <hi>Melchior</hi> preached, applying their intentions to the will of God: and Fryer <hi>Blaiſe Camello</hi> did ſing Maſſe, who in his prayer, with a lould voice praied for two Kings, that is, <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Anthonie,</hi> ſaying vnto the people which demaunded newes of <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> that the fourth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt he would ſatisfie them.

thoſe parts, as no ſhips can liue aboue three or fower moneths in the yeare: This enterpriſe was then ſuppoſed to be of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance then it had beene, not ſo much for the qualitie of the place, as for the ſituation, beeing an vnauoydable paſſage for the ſhips that come from the Indies, and the new found lands, as well from the Eaſt as from the Weſt, where the Frenchmen harbouring, they might greatly endomage Spaine: for this conſideration the King ſent <hi>Ambroſe d' Aguiar,</hi> with a letter and ample pardon in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to all offendors, if leauing the part of <hi>Anthonie,</hi> they would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<note place="margin">The reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inhabitants of Terceraes</note> his.

The richer ſort regarding their priuat profit would obey, for hauing all their rents in corne, the which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſend vnto the realme, they could not make ſale in any other place; but being few, and not daring to ſpeake their mindes, they deliuered it doubtfully: The poore, (who finding the leſſe corne were tranſported from the Ilands, the better cheape they ſhoulde buie it,) not caring to haue any trafficke with Portugall, would by any meanes follow the voice of <hi>Anthonie.</hi> Many kindled with rage, aduiſed they ſhoulde ſuffer <hi>Ambroſe d' Aguiar</hi> to enter the citie, and after caſt him in priſon and puniſh him as Ambaſſador to a Tyrant. Some held they ſhould ſend him away without anſwere: Some of the chiefe (who feared they were not comprehended within the pardon) did what they could to preiudice the Kings part, for diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to obtaine it, they laboured that no man ſhould follow his voice, but ſo to wrong <hi>Philip</hi> as they ſhould loſe all hope euer to bee reconciled: wherein they preuailed ſo much, as that <hi>Ambroſe d' Aguiar</hi> (who was appointed to be Gouernor of the Iland of Saint Michaell) was ſent backe. They cauſed a Maſſe to be ſaide, where all the people did ſweare to die for <hi>Anthonie:</hi> In which humor they were ſtill confirmed by falſe reports that were blowen abroad: For although the Prior were yet hidden in Portugall, yet the ſhippes which came from Fraunce, and England, to trafficke at the Ilands, to the end they might be the better fauored and receiued, brought newes that he was in their countrey, raiſing a great Armie.

ſteps vp a Smith of the baſeſt ſorte, who followed by the multitude, plaied the Southſayer; ſaying that the tenth of March without all doubte, King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> ſhoulde come into that Iland. The day being come, with great expectation of the people, there appeered a great ſhippe at ſea, the viewe whereof, did ſo much alter this people, that the Smith crying, this was the ſhippe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King was; euery man ranne to the ſhoare to ſee him, as as it were expecting <hi>Sebaſtians</hi> landing. But although the ſhippe followed an other courſe, not drawing any thing neere to the Iland, yet the people left not their vaine hope, but ſome of them affirmed, that the ſhippe had put three men into their cockboate, <q>the which were entred into the couent of Saint Frauncis, ſuppoſing it ſhoulde be King <hi>Sebastian, Christopher de Tauora,</hi> and the Cheriffe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this lie might eaſily be deciphered, yet their offences would not permitte it, but running from one ſcruple to an other, it ſeemed they were deſtinate to liue in ſuſpence:</q> for theſe friers of Saint Frauncis, againſt the truth of prieſthoode (vnderſtanding the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples opinion, that the King was in their couent) did confirme it, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them to vnderſtand it was true, and the better to induce them to beleeue it, ſeeming on the one ſide to keepe it very ſecret; on the other ſide ſhewing they had gueſts of importance, they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſecretly (but ſo as it might be knowen) to borrow beds of ſilke, ſiluer veſſels, and other things fit for a kings ſeruice: They cauſed alſo garments to be made, and kept their gates more ſtrictly then of cuſtome, ſaying in their ſermons, that they would giue them two naturall kings; and ſome hearing them in their maſſes to praie for <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> ſuppoſed he was in their monaſterie, and not <hi>Sebastian,</hi> ſeeing that ſince his departure from Viana, there was no certaine newes of him. In this Iland <hi>Ciprian de Figueredo</hi> (ſometimes ſeruant to the Counte of Vimioſo) being ſent thither for iudge, was become ringleader of all the reſt: This man (being contrary to the Caſtillians, and agreeing with the monkes) did countenaunce their practiſes, remaining in their couent, from morning vntill night: He confirmed the people in their fooliſh beliefe, that the King was there. This nation was not well ſetled in matters of religion, for growing inſolent by their libertie, ſome preachers attributing vnto themſelues more authoritie then they had, promiſed abſolution,

and many things which they ought not, making ſhewe they would builde a church after their owne faſhion, and for that the leſuites<note place="margin">The Ieſuits walled vp at the Terce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raes.</note> had oppoſed themſelues, or at the leaſt were not of one conſent, they were walled vp within their monaſterie.</p>
            <p>And although theſe Ilands were not al obedient, being a ſlow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, yet the warre ſeemed as then in a manner ended, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> hauing great forces in Spaine, knew not how to imploy them; &amp; foraſmuch as the ſoldiers (returned from the warres in the lowe Countries) were now vpon the way, comming from Italy towards Portugall, with ſome others newly leuied, they ſaide the King (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome fewe forces thereunto) might raiſe a great armie to bee imploied vpon that occaſion, for the which they vnderſtoode the Pope as carefull of his charge, had renewed the practizes to bende theſe forces againſt England, the which woulde not obey the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſea, and therefore hee propounded to king <hi>Philip,</hi> that if hee<note place="margin">The Popes offer against England.</note> woulde leuie an armie and ſende it to this conqueſt, he woulde aſſiſt him in this enterpriſe with the treaſures of the church; offring to graunt vnto him Croiſades, exemptions, and ſubſidies, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him of a million of golde, which hee ſaide was due vnto the church, for the reuenewes he had receiued of the Archbiſhopricke of Toledo, by title of ſequeſtration, when as the Archbiſhop was ſuſpended from his charge. But the King hauing newly taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the crowne, ſeeing the Portugals not well quieted, ſought firſt to pacifie the realme, before hee woulde vndertake any other enterpriſe: Notwithſtanding at the Popes motion, who ſaide, that arming in thoſe parts, hee ſhoulde not onely keepe Portugall in awe, but all Spaine and Fraunce likewiſe.

the ordinarie officers, to examine the accounts of the armie, and to ſigne the warrants for paiments, it ſeemed a ſleight charge for ſo great a perſonage; the which miniſtred matter of ſuſpect, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo ſimple a ſhewe, there was hidden ſome myſterie of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and the generall opinion was, that he came to cenſure both the armie, and the Duke himſelfe: And although the Duke ſhould haue beene beſt informed, yet he made no ſhewe to know it, but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the Doctor, admitting him to the Councell of warre, and to other graue matters, which did not concerne him: The reſt of the Captaines &amp; Spaniſh ſoldiers, which could leſſe diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, ſpake with more libertie, and leſſe patience then the Duke; ſaying it was a new<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Dukes ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> manner of Iuſtice, neuer heard of; ſeeing that of neceſſitie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie muſt bee betwixt the captaine generall and his armie; or betwixt the armie and the enimie, not able to diſcerne which ſhould be the contrarie parties, for it ſeemed the ſoldiers, neither could nor ought to make themſelues parties, againſt their Commaunder, neither ought the enimies to be admitted againſt a conquering ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.

But for all this diſcourſe, they did not greatly weigh the Dukes offences, ſuppoſing in the ende that his greatnes and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie ſhoulde protect him: Their owne priuate intereſt did moſt of all trouble them, looſing all hope of recompence for their former ſeruices, ſaying, that for this laſt and notable exploite, they did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee puniſhment prepared then rewards: <q>They imagined the king did not well conceiue howe they had conquered him a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in eight and fiftie daies, after the ſame manner (to followe their owne phraſe) as the kingdome of heauen is woone, that is to ſay, in faſting, with bread and water, and without taking from any man; the which they ſaid, being furniſhed with nothing but bisket, &amp; hauing no libertie to ſpoile any towne:</q> They could not endure to

ſeemed curteous, &amp; altogither enclined to Portugall, &amp; had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great rewards; yet in particular (whether it were his fault or any others,) they yet ſee no recompence.

The Eſtates were now ended, and the king deſirous to goe to Lisbone, but for that the preparations, and triumphs which the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie pretended, were not yet ready, he went to Almada, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the citie, vpon the other banke of Tagus, to giue them time to finiſh their preparations: At what time the King hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that thoſe of the Ilands of Terceraes, notwithſtanding the letters which <hi>Ambroſe d'Aguiar,</hi> had carried ſtoode firme in their firſt reſolution of defence, hee ſent <hi>Peter Baldes</hi> with fower ſhips, ſixe hundreth Spaniſh foote, and ſome cannon, with comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to aſſure himſelfe fully of the Iland of Saint Michaell, which was obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; to ſpoile the ſhips which ſhould come from the Indies, &amp; not to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt any thing by land vntill he had ſent a greater ſupply of men.

The Catholique king complained to the moſt Chriſtian king, that he had receiued the Prior his rebell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fraunce; of the ſuccours giuen to Cambrey, and blamed the marriage with England, labouring to diuert it all he coulde, ſaying, that he ought by no meanes to yeelde vnto it, for the difference of religion.

            <p>Whileſt theſe things were determined in Fraunce and the low Countries, the king (who remained ſtill in Portugall) ſought to giue<note place="margin">The kings recompence to the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals.</note> contentment to the Portugals, who hauing long, and with impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie ſought for recompence, were in the ende all in a manner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched, giuing vnto many of them orders of knighthoode, much of the reuenewes, and all the offices that might bee giuen, to the great griefe of the Caſtillians, who ſaide, that this realme with more right appertained vnto <hi>Philip,</hi> ſeeing he had inherited it, bought it, and conquered it. This diſtribution was made by the two Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with great bountie, yet wrought it no good effect in the Kings fauour, neither was it acceptable; for finding two kinde of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, which ſought for reward; that is, thoſe to whom <hi>Philip</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> and the Gouernours, had promiſed money and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to follow his partie; and ſuch as faithfully without promiſes, yea, refuſing them, had loially ſerued him: It was in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to equall their recompences, ſo as one of the parties ſhould not be diſcontented; but they proceeded ſo, as ſome were grieued, and others proude: For beſides the errors that were committed by reaſon of the ignorance of the officers, being more eaſie to promiſe then to performe; the kings Agents had made large offers not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to ſuch as coulde helpe, but alſo to many of ſmall meanes, and leſſe countenance.

He did appoint (as it hath been<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Mary comes to Lisbone.</note> ſaide before) that his ſiſter <hi>Marie,</hi> widow to the Emperour <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> the ſeconde, being then in Germanie, ſhoulde come into Spaine, with <hi>Margaret</hi> her daughter: And although the diſcourſe of her comming were diuers, for that ſome ſuppoſed ſhe ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine at Madrill, with the kings daughters; others, that ſhe ſhould come into Portugall, where the King woulde leaue her as Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the realme, to go vnto the States of Aragon, whereunto he was called; yet in the ende ſhe came vnto Lisbone: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whether the rumours of Fraunce increaſed, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the King woulde not depart; or that it was not fitte that of an Empreſſe ſhe ſhoulde become Gouerneſſe of a ſmall realme, the King for that time did not depart, neither did ſhe gouerne at all.

to ſend forth his galleies; that certaine troupes of foote were come out of Fraunce vnto the <hi>Marquiſat</hi> of Saluſſes; the King thought it expedient to arme, both to performe this enterpriſe of the Ilands, as for the guarde of many places, where he might be endomaged: He thought it a hard thing, and vnwoorthie, to ſuffer the ſtates of the Low-Countries, to be wreſted from him by the Duke of Alan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon, without reuenge: He did foreſee that the charge would bee verie great, and that he was furniſhed with little money, and leſſe credite; for by meanes of the decree he had made againſt the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, he was cauſe of more hurt to himſelfe, then to his creditors. The prouiſions it behooued him to make were all forced, for hee could not doe leſſe then prouide for Italy, as well in regarde of the French as of the Turke: Hee muſt of force entertaine an armie in Portugall, for although the Realme were in ſhew quiet, yet the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals being of a ſtirring humor, he could not auoide to arme a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie ſufficient to encounter the Fleete: He thought it neceſſarie to prouide for Flanders, if not wholy to recouer thoſe eſtates, yet for feare he ſhould looſe more. But that which troubled the King more then all the reſt, was the ſhippes which hee expected this yeere from the Indies, and New-found lands; fearing that the French hauing the aduantage of the Ilands, might ſpoile them, finding that ſome Pirat had not onely paſſed into that ſea, but alſo threatned to aſſaile the Iland of Saint Michael, and that of the Maderes: And<note place="margin">The kings order in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring.</note> therefore the King began to preuent all theſe dangers in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

The Catholique kings affaires went ſlowlier forwardes then the importance of the cauſe required, for that it ſeemed the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards were not yet well aſſured, whether the French woulde turne againſt Portugall, and not goe to the Ilands; yea, ſome beleeued, that making ſhew to do ſo, they woulde take their courſe for Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſeeming more to importe wholie to aſſure thoſe countries, and to expell the Catholique Kings forces, then to vndertake an other enterpriſe of greater difficultie: And the aſſurance of this opinion did helpe the Fren<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch, for it did diuert or at the leaſt deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Spaniſh forces, and was cauſe that in Spaine they prepared not their armies with ſuch expedition as was conuenient: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing after aſſured intelligence, that the French prepared to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the ſhips that came from the Indies, and the newe founde lands, the prouiſion for Flaunders went ſlowly forwarde in Italie: And in Spaine they made greater haſte of their nauie, for the which there was want of ſailers, and other neceſſaries, yet with ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they had prepared in Andelouzia about twentie ſhips and twelue galleies.

blaming him to haue beene too ſlacke in the diſpatch of the Armie; beſides going, in Flemmiſh ſhips, and with Germane ſoldiers, little acquainted with the ſea, increaſed theſe doubts: yet outwardly theſe men ſhewed a great confidence, grounding the reſts of their hopes, vpon the qualitie of the Spaniſh ſouldiers, and the greatnes of their ſhips.

But they remained not long in theſe doubts, for they had no ſooner appointed ſome to diſcouer ſome better anchoring place, the armie being vnder ſaile, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſcouer towards the towne certaine ſhips, the which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtill in number came againſt them, iudging what it was, as in

truth it was the enimy, laying aſide what they had treated of, hauing aſſembled <hi>Peter</hi> of Toledo, the marſhall of the Campe generall, the Marques of Fauara, <hi>Peter Taxis</hi> Commiſſarie generall, <hi>Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Bouadiglia</hi> Marſhall of the field, and ſome other gentlemen and Captaines, they called a new councell, where it was propounded,<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues to fight.</note> whether they ſhould fight or take any other partie. The Caſtilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an armie had no place of retreat, to returne backe they could not, without great danger, to get the winde of the French there was no meanes, for with their lighter ſhippes, and eaſier to turne into the winde, they might chaſe, flie, fight, and retire themſelues from fight at their pleaſure: So as the Spaniſh Captaines framing their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to the neceſſitie, the matters ſtanding ſo as the free election remained not in them, reſolued to fight: <hi>Anthonie</hi> hauing (by the letters, which the Marques had written to <hi>Ambroſe d'Aguiar,</hi> taken in the carauel with <hi>Aguirre)</hi> intelligence what forces they had, and what they expected, and with all of his intention, for this cauſe he had reſolued with <hi>Strozzi, Briſſac,</hi> and the Counte <hi>Vimioſo,</hi> that it was fitteſt to fight with this armie, conſiſting of ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſhips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the other part which they expected ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue; and therefore hauing imbarqued with all poſſible ſpeed, they came in battell againſt the Marques, hauing firſt laboured but in vaine to take the Caſtel by new threatnings. Then did the Marques<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques order for his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</note> appoint what order hee would haue the armie keepe in the fight: Vpon the right ſide of his gallion called S.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:9072:151"/>
it were in ſigne of Battell; the French bent towards the citie, and the Catholique armie turned to ſea, not hauing any intelligence of what had paſſed at lande, neither ſhould he haue had it ſo ſoone by any other meanes, if the ſame night <hi>Iohn de Caſtillio,</hi> who had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Laurence Noghero</hi> in the caſtell, had not aduertiſed the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques what had happened in the Iland, and aſſured him that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe held yet, both to the ende he ſhould haue care to ſuccour it, and to haue ſuccour from thence if need were: For this cauſe he ſent by night one of the patrons of the Biſcaine ſhips in a boate with his letters, aduertiſing him of all the ſucceſſe ſince the arriuall of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie,</hi> vntill that time. He ſaide that the enemies armie conſiſted of eight and fiftie ſaile, whereof eight and twentie were great ſhippes, with ſixe thouſand fighting men, that if the Catholique armie were not ſtrong enough to encounter them, he ſhould retire vnder the fortreſſe, where the one might ſuccour the other: The Marques made anſwere vnto him by the ſame meſſenger, that he ſhould be of good courage, that his Maieſties armie was ſtrong enough to vanquiſh the enimie, as he hoped to doe the next day: So as the morning being come, the French came with great ioy to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spaniards, who for that effect had put themſelues againe in battell, but although the French had both wind and ſun fauourable vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet the calme was ſo great as they could hardly approch; ſo as the two armies continued one againſt the other vntil the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, when as the winde growing ſomewhat ſtronger, the French began to make ſhew to charge the Spaniards: But ſeeing them in order without any ſhew of feare, they did not effect it, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vntill night, ſayling equally towards the Iland of Saint Marie, fiftie miles from that of Saint Michael towards the ſouth, ſometimes vpon one boord, ſometimes vpon another, the French making of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſhew to ioyne with them, being in their power to doe it, the wind being fauourable to them, and contrarie to the Spaniards: But night being come, the French reſoluing in any ſort to fight, the day following they ſent ten ſhips alongſt the Ile, with intent to follow the enemies armie, and to charge them in the dawning of the day on both ſides, but the winde grew calme and they could not ſayle. The day following, which was the fower and twentith, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards likewiſe deſired to fight, although it ſeemed with ſome diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:9072:151"/>
wanting that part of their armie, which was prepared in Andelouzia; yet they greeued to haue their enimies before them not being able either to flie or fight but when they pleaſed, the which increaſed their deſire, and thinking it would ſo fall out by changing of their ſailes from one ſide to another, imagining the French would alſo follow the like aduantage: but although the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did then make more apparant ſhow to charge them, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet nothing followed, but only the generall ſhips, with others that were neereſt vnto them on both ſides, ſpent many volleies of great ſhot, whereby the French had greateſt loſſe by one of their ſhips which ſunke preſently: Hauing ſpent the whole daie in this ſort towardes the euening, the Marques, to trie if hee could get the winde, commaunded all his fleete, vpon the nights approch, ſhould turne towards the Ilande of Saint Michaell, to get the winde of the enimie, giuing them to vnderſtand that the Admiral ſhip that night (leaſt the enimie ſhould diſcouer their intent) ſhould not carrie his ordinarie light, but about midnight diſcharge a cannon, to draw the reſt of the ſhips neere vnto him: This order was giuen, and duely<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques gets the wind of the French armie.</note> obſerued, by all the fleete except two Eaſterlings, who not being aduertiſed by the negligence of him that had the charge, ſtrayed ſo farre from the fleete, that hauing loſt the ſight they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it, and hauing within them fower hundred Germaine ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; it ſeemed this armie decreaſed dayly both in number of ſhips and men: And for that the winde grew ſomewhat high, the Marques thought it conuenient after midnight hauing diſcharged his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, to hang out his lanterne as he did, the which ſucceeded well, for the getting the winde of the enimie: yet this deuiſe preuailed little, for vpon the breake of the day, it was the feaſt of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Apoſtle the fiue and twentith of the moneth, whom the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards call vpon in their battels; they diſcouered the French armie ſcattered a farre off, as well to ſuccour the ſhippe that did ſinke, as alſo to repaire ſome other hurts receiued the day before by their cannon: But ſome affirme that the French woulde not willingly fight vpon this Saints day: And although the Spaniards might well haue charged them, yet did they forbeare, for that the ſhip of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher D'Eraſſo</hi> which had his maſt craſed ſtrooke ſailes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a peece; ſo as finding that it was wholy broke, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced

The French had deuided amongſt them the Spaniſh ſhips, where with euery one ſhoulde grapple, but it was a matter that coulde not ſucceede, for the winde, the ſea, and the order which had beene ſo often altered, hindered that reſolution: The gallion Saint Mathew ſtaied ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what behinde, the which was cauſe it was firſt ſet vpon, for the captaine and admirall of the French, with other three ſhips turning their prooes vpon her, went to charge her, and the captaine with great dexteritie to auoide the ſhotte, ioyned with them towards the prooe, and boorded the gallion from the middle forwarde, leauing place for the reſt to approch, the which inueſted her rounde with a great ſtreame of fire and ſhotte: <hi>Lopo de Figueroa</hi> being vnder their lee, not able to vſe his ſailes as he woulde, ſeeing ſuch, and ſo great ſhips come to charge him, ſtaied for them. There beganne a cruell fight, their artillerie did much harme, eſpecially the Spaniſh, being the biggeſt, ſo as two of the French ſhips being ſorely beaten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and with their ſmall ſhotte, after ſome fight, fell vpon the galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which remained betwixt the captaines ſhip the admirall and an other, who being ſuccoured with freſh men in ſmall boats from the other ſhippes, troubled <hi>Figueroa</hi> much, eſpecially hauing his ſhippe fired by the enimie in many partes: But being a man of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, accompanied with expert ſoldiers, hee made an honorable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and with great reſolution preuented all inconueniences. He remained in this eſtate aboue two houres without any ſuccour, at the ende whereof, a Biſcaine ſhip of <hi>Peter Garagarza,</hi> wherein were two companies of Spaniſh ſoldiers, drawing neere, ſuccoured him much: The Marques ſeeing in what danger this gallion was, would gladly haue ſuccoured it, but he could not ſo ſodainly performe it, as neede required; for being forced to returne backe, and ſaile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the winde, a matter impoſſible, but by turning on the right and on the left to gaine a little way, hee feared in the meane time ſhe ſhoulde bee vanquiſhed: Againſt the ſaide gallion Saint Martin, wherein the Marques was when as the Saint Mathew was

Another ſhippe, wherein was <hi>Michael de Beneſa,</hi> paſſed on forwarde, and valiantly grapled with the French captaine on the outſide, ſo as the gallion Saint Martin wherein the Marques was, could not approch neere any one of the enimies chiefe ſhips, being enuironed with his friends, ſo as he was forced to turne about and paſſe on: The French admirall defended himſelfe with great courage againſt the three ſhips; that of <hi>Villaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioſa</hi> which fought in the prooe, did end omage him greatly, but the captaine thereof was ſlaine; that of <hi>Oquendo</hi> which fought in the ſterne had boorded her, with his men taken priſoners and enſignes, and began to ſpoile: But the captaine finding that his ſhippe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſhotte, was in danger of ſinking, fell from her to repaire her leake, ſo as being in a manner freed from the enimie, hee tooke his<note place="margin">Mounſier Briſac flies.</note> courſe towards Saint Michael, yet hee coulde not get thither, but ſunke by the way, being ſpoiled by the artillerie; and Mounſieur <hi>Briſac</hi> ſaued himſelfe in a ſmall boat: But theſe two armies did not ſo ioine as it was expected; for that the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch army, although they had a full wind, yet would they not willingly grapple with the Spaniards as they might haue done; but many of them ſtoode idle, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging only their great ſhot: And although ſome of them laboured to boord <hi>Frauncis de Bouadilla,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher d' Eraſſo,</hi> yet the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie kept them off, ſo as they durſt not approch: A Biſcaine ſhippe wherein were captaines <hi>Michael de Cardona,</hi> and <hi>Peter Pardo,</hi> boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a French man, which was fallen from the S.

wherein was the company of <hi>Lewes de Gueuara,</hi> boorded an other, and after a long fight vngrapled herſelfe, and one or two ſhips more boorded her, and the reſt fought paſſing onely by, and diſcharging their artillerie. The gallion Saint Mathew made a great reſiſtance, two of thoſe ſhips which had fallen from her, battered with the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, ſunke; and although the generall of the French were ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with many men, yet was he ſo beaten, that they within began to yeeld, but for that there were many Spaniards dead, and manie hurt, ſo as there remained within the gallion not aboue ſeuentie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men to fight, <hi>Lopo de Figueroa</hi> would not ſuffer them to enter, &amp; make the victorie abſolute, the which the French finding, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing preſently a new ſupply of three hundred men, they vngrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hoping to ſaue themſelues: But the Marques who ſtood vpon his guarde, ſayling firſt on one ſide, and then on another, preſſing the enimie with his artillerie and ſmal ſhot, when he ſaw his ſhip fall off, he charged her, and ſo did another Biſcaine ſhip on the other ſide, wherein was Captaine <hi>Baſtida</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Viuero;</hi> but the fight continued not aboue one hower, at the ende whereof the Spaniſh generall became Maſter of the enimies ſhip with the loſſe of aboue 300.

by reaſon of the night, purſued them not, fearing for that they were better ſailers he ſhould not boord them, and being ſeparated hee ſhould be forced to diuide his armie, the which he would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly doe; beſides he ſhould be conſtrained to leaue the gallion Saint Mathew behinde him in danger, being vnable to ſayle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tackling, ſailes and anchors, the which the enemie had burnt and throwen into the ſea: There was one thing woorthie the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, that being within this gallion a Prieſt called <hi>Iohn de Iaem</hi> Chaplein vnto the Marſhall of the fielde, a man which had ſeene<note place="margin">Aprieſt dies for feare.</note> the warres, during the fight being vnder the loweſt decke of the gallion, when he ſaw ſo much wilde fire caſt by the French, hearing their ſhot, and finding the hurt the cannon did, hee died, onely of feare and amaſement, hauing receiued no wound: The Spaniards recouered one of their carauels with horſe which had beene taken, and had taken more of their French ſhips, if they could haue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with mariners to conduct them; but for this cauſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall (which was caſt away) abandoned, and ſome others torne and abandoned by the French were not kept; for this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Marques burnt two, which had been abandoned and ſome<note place="margin">The number of the dead in the battel.</note> others ranne vpon the Iland: In this battell the French loſt ſeuen or eight of their beſt ſhips, and there died in the fight aboue two thouſand of their men, with many hurt; as for the Spaniards there died about two hundred, and aboue fiue hundred wounded: The Portugals, pertiſants vnto <hi>Anthonie,</hi> ſay, that the French fought not at all, for that the Captaines were corrupted by King <hi>Philip,</hi> and<note place="margin">Edward de Caſtro be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed by Anthonie.</note> this opinion encreaſed, for that after <hi>Anthonie</hi> cauſed <hi>Edward d' Caſtro</hi> to loſe his head in the Iland, ſuppoſing him to be the meanes thereof, but they were deceiued; for although that <hi>Caſtro</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed many things vnto the Kings miniſters, when as they deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him out of priſon, whereunto hee was committed when they tooke him flying out of Portugall, yet could he neuer effect any; but the cauſe of his death was for certaine practiſes begun after this defeate, and for that he had committed murther vpon the perſon of <hi>Anthony Baraccio</hi> a deere friend vnto the ſaid Prior, and one of them that had proclaimed him King.

            <p>The Marques as it is ſaide, the day being ended, reſoluing not to purſue the enimie, he drew neere to the Iland of Saint Michael to repaire his ſhippes, to looke to his hurt men, and to water; but the winde being contrary woulde not ſuffer him, keeping him three daies off at ſea, the fourth he drew neere to Villa Franca, where he landed his hurt men, and prouided what he needed, the inhabitants of all parts of the Ile hauing yeelded their obedience.

ſuppoſing that he had expreſſe commaundement from the King, whom likewiſe they excuſed, for hauing ſo determined, ſeeing it was not to bee preſumed that ſo many perſonages of importance, ſhould come with ſuch an armie and remaine priſoners, eſpecially knowing that <hi>Philip</hi> by his owne inclination was not cruell: yet on the other ſide, they conſidered, that the King in his minde ſhoulde haue conceiued a cruell diſdaine againſt the French, ſeeing that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow of amitie, peace and alliance, Kings writing daily one to the orher, greeuing and reioycing at their troubles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, did not onely aide his rebels, but alſo tooke his countries, and ſent ſo great an armie to endomage him: <q>And although that Princes do vſually diſſemble, and counterfeit in many things,</q>  yet it ſeemed the French vnder a new kinde of diſſimulation, would make warre, whereby they did inferre that this execution did nothing diſpleaſe the King.

To remaine there, he ſaw it a thing not able long to ſubſiſt with ſo great garriſons, not hauing wherewithall to pay the ſouldiers, nor in a manner how to furniſh<note place="margin">The depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie for Fraunce.</note> his expences: He reſolued therefore with ſuch ſhippes as he had to depart for Fraunce, but firſt would goe towardes the Madera, and the Iland of Canarie, that by ſpoyling of ſome weake places, hee ſhould content the ſouldiers with ſome weake pray. For this cauſe hauing prepared about thirtie ſaile, he not onely ſhipped his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but with a new deuiſe he commaunded all the citizens which he ſuſpected, and all religious perſons affected to the contrarie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as the Ieſuits and others to imbarke, making this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt rigorous to thoſe that could leaſt obſerue it, to the ende they ſhould redeeme this voyage with money: But all as vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in ſea cauſes, excuſed themſelues with liuely reaſons and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties; but it preuailed nothing, making anſwere to the yoonger, that he had neede of them for his guarde, and to the olde, for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; ſo as many ſought to content him with money as hee deſired, euerie one according to his abilitie, by meanes whereof they were freede from his commaundement. But this inuention was ſoone counter-checkt by another, for many deſired to leaue the Iland &amp; to imbarke, not with intention to follow the armie, but to ſaile into Spaine: Some of the Captaines of the ſhippes, vnderſtanding their mindes, agreede with the Portugals, not to deliuer any money to <hi>Anthonie</hi> for their ſtay in the Iland, but paying them the like ſumme and much leſſe, they would land them in Portugall, ſo as many tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to the French, and Engliſh, not paying any thing to <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> imbarked with them, agreeing for a certaine ſumme to be ſet on<note place="margin">Emanuell de Silua ſtaies at the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres.</note> land. <hi>Anthonie</hi> departed with this armie from the Terceres, leauing <hi>Emanuel de Silua</hi> in his place, with fiue hundred Frenchmen vnder the charge of <hi>Baptiſte Florentin,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> a French man their Captaines: He arriued at the Iland of Saint Michael, where hauing ſtaied long thereabouts, fearing the Spaniſh garriſon there, he durſt not land, being forced to leaue it by a ſtorme that roſe: Then ſome of his Engliſh and French ſhips, left him, keeping promiſe with the Portugals, that were imbarked with them.

            <p>It was giuen out in Spaine, that the faction of <hi>Anthony</hi> and the French againſt Portugall, was daſhed; and that they had weakned their forces, yet did they not diſmiſſe their hired ſhips: At that time two galliaſſes being arriued from Naples, it ſeemed the king would aſſemble a great armie for the next yeere, and make himſelfe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Lorde of the Ocean, both in reſpect of the affaires of <hi>Anthony,</hi> as to aſſure his ſhips, from the Indies, and newe founde landes, from the French and Engliſh, and to force the Iland. The Catholique King deſired to returne into Caſtill, both for that he was called by<note place="margin">The amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of pardon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Portugals.</note> the ſtates of Arragon, and to finiſh the marriage of his daughter with the Emperour; as alſo for other buſiness of the realme, and was vpon the point to effect it, in Nouember 1582. but he woulde firſt extend his pardon graunted at Tomar to ſuch as had followed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony:</hi> For this cauſe hauing excepted the religious perſons and tenne others, hee pardoned freely all the reſt that ſhoulde preſent themſelues within a certaine time; but this wrought no effect, for there came fewe, and many ſaid, that the King being yet diſpleaſed, could not make a free pardon. This departure was after ſtaied by the newes of the death of <hi>Diego</hi> his eldeſt ſonne, who as hee had beene ſworne Prince of Portugall, at the eſtates of Tomar, hee woulde likewiſe that the ſame oath ſhoulde bee made in the perſon of <hi>Philip</hi> his ſecond ſonne being then ſicke.

            <p>This Iland is ſcituated as is ſaid in the fortith degree of latitude, and three hundreth &amp; forty two of longitude; it hath fortie miles in circuite, extending it ſelfe in length from the eaſt vnto the weſt, ſo as it is not much aboue twelue miles broad; &amp; although it be rough<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Terce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</note> for the moſt part and ſtony, yet is it in a maner all inhabited towards the ſouth, for the commoditie of the ſhoares it is more populous then the reſt, for comming from the weſt, you firſt diſcouer the citie of Angra, a place in a ſmall boſome of the ſea, but not greatly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the windes, where of it takes the name, for Angra in their language is a boſome: Ioyning to this citie there is a caſtell begun in the time of King <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> and made defenſible for the garde of this porte: Sixe miles towards the eaſt, neere vnto a dangerous ſhoare, which they call the port of Mole, is Saint <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> a place ſmally inhabited, and three miles farther is that of Piaggia, ſo called being the beſt landing place of all others. This place is neere vnto Punta de la Serra, which is the laſt promontorie towards the Eaſt, behinde the which turning to the North, is another place which they call Agua Alua, ſixe miles from that of Piaggia.

Hee commaunded fower galleies to lie before the towne, to ſerue as a bridle for thoſe ſhips, and to keepe them from comming foorth, the which was helde too much ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening, ſome holding opinion that he ſhould in diſſembling giue them meanes to depart, rather then to force them to diſpaire: Hee ſodainly ſent a trumpet to lande, offering to all ſuch as were in the Iland a generall pardon in his Maieſties behalfe, if they woulde yeeld, but approching to land, he was vnkindly kept backe by their artillerie: The pardon concerned the ſucceſſion of the King to the crowne, the diſobedience of the Iland, and the clemencie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, he offred vnto all ſuch as were naturall borne, their liues and goods, if they woulde yeelde obedience, and to ſtrangers, ſhips to tranſport them into their countries, with their goods, armes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: But being not able to publiſh it by this meanes, he ſent two Portugals ſecretly to land, who deliuered a copie thereof to <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel de Silua;</hi> but making no account thereof, hee concealed it, leaſt others ſhould ſee it, ſuppoſing (it may be) that it was nowe too late to vſe it, and therefore hee not onely refuſed to accept of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but alſo threatned to hange them that brought it, if they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the cauſe of their comming, leaſt the Ilanders ſhould likewiſe embrace it.

There was within the forte (whither theſe men marched) three enſignes of ſouldiers, whereof<note place="margin">The firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault giuen by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques his men.</note> two were Portugals, and one French, which made in all but two hundred men, againſt whom all theſe ſouldiers marched, running furiouſly without order to the aſſault, for that the ſeat and the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the enemy, gaue them neither place nor time to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in order. The French reſiſted valiantly, but for that they were fewe preuailed little: In the beginning they ſlew a Captaine and an enſigne bearer of them without, with fiue and twentie or thirtie other ſouldiers; but ſome within being wounded, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the French ſlaine, one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of Portugals left the

Neere vnto them the

Portugals had gathered together aboue a thouſand oxen, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to force them againſt the enimie, to breake them, and to make proofe of that which they had tried two yeeres paſt, againſt <hi>Peter de Baldes</hi> his men: but <hi>Chattes</hi> did not allowe of this ſtratageme, holding it for a refreſhing to the enimie without any profite; for it was not likely that that which had caſually chaunced againſt ſixe hundreth men, woulde ſucceed in the like ſort againſt twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, whereupon they ſent them backe. As the Marques had viewed this troupe of beaſts, hauing reinforced the point of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie with Germaine pikes, commaunding them, that if they came, they ſhoulde quietly ſuffer them to come on; ſo paſſed this day, the French not ceaſing to diſquiet the enimie with certaine peeces of artillerie, they had planted vpon thoſe hils: Then did <hi>Emanuel de Silua</hi> reſolue to flie, the which hee coulde not eaſily effect, for that euerie man kept a watch ouer him, and therefore hee cauſed a falſe brute to be ſpredde abroad, that he had threeſcore ſaile of French ſhips at ſea which came to their ſuccour; and ſeeming that he would<note place="margin">Silua his flight hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> ſende to meete with them, he cauſed the prepared barke to goe out of the port, that it might attend him at Altary; but when they came at the mouth, the artillerie from the fortes woulde not ſuffer them to paſſe, either ignorant of their intention, or for that the authoritie of <hi>Silua</hi> began now to decline, ſo as returning backe, the flight of <hi>Emanuel</hi> was preuented. During this time, the Spaniards were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed for water, beeing forced vntill then to furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from their armie, whereof the French had great ſtore, and therefore the Marques conſulted that night to amend (if it were poſſible, the next morning) the ſeate of their lodging, <q>the which was helde ſomewhat difficult; but for as much as both good fortune and badde hath no limits, he found leſſe difficultie then he expected;</q> for the ſame night the greateſt part of the Portugals vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Emanuel de Silua,</hi> terrified with the skirmi&amp;;sh of the day, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the enimies ſeeming too great, hauing abandoned the French, retired themſelues confuſedly to the mountaine, although woorthie of admiration; for being the very ſame obſtinate rebels which eſteemed themſelues ſo great warriors, as they would neuer heare motion of accord, peace, nor pardon, it ſeemed ſtrange that now, when as (laying a ſide words) they needed effects, they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

But the Marques hauing ſoone diſcouered the enimies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques takes S.

This ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being nothing fortified to the lande lay open, and therefore was abandoned, not onely of the ſoldiers, but alſo of the inhabitants themſelues, who fledde as well out of the caſtell as the towne. The armie arriued there after great labour, for the ſeaſon being verie hot, the countrie drie, not finding vpon their march one droppe of water, the ſoldiers endured much, and ſome of them (eſpecially of the Germaines died for thirſt. Being arriued, the ſpoile of the citie<note place="margin">Angra put to be ſpoiled three daies.</note> continued three daies, although the houſes were for the moſt part emptie, ſo as the greateſt number of men that were founde there, were priſoners, whom they ſet at libertie: By meanes of their entrie into the citie, all the other fortes were taken, for being onely made againſt the landing, they were towards the lande open and indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:

The bootie both at land and ſea, was not verie great, for beſides the artillerie they found not any thing of great importance. The ſlaues which were in number aboue fifteene hundred was the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence they got: The citie being ſpoiled and other places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the Marques deſired that the inhabitants ſhould returne to their houſes; for although the ſouldiers which were retired into ſome place of the mountaines, had carried with them ſome priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners both men and women, the which after they deliuered freely, yet the greateſt part returned not; and therefore he cauſed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proclamation to bee made, that euerie man (ſome excepted) ſhould freely returne vnto his houſe; but the Portugals beeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtfull they were few that came at that time, although after by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle<note place="margin">The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques ſends to Fayall.</note> and little they grew more confident. Things being reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this eſtate, although the French remained ſtill in the mountaine, the Marques thought it fit to ſend vnto other Ilands to force them to obedience, eſpecially to Fayale where there remained a garriſon: For this conſideration hauing imbarqued in his galleies and ſome other ſmall veſſels 2500. foote drawen out of all nations, hee ſent them to the ſaid Iland, vnder the conduct of <hi>Peter de Toledo.</hi>

            <p>Whileſt theſe went vnto that other enterpriſe, the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Iland of Tercerae, although they had ſomewhat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelues in the mountaine, being ill prouided of victuals and munition, &amp; woorſe ſuccoured by the Portugals, reſolued with<note place="margin">The French compound with the Spaniards.</note> the moſt honourable conditions they could to make their compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the Marques: <hi>Mounſieuer de Chattes</hi> remembred that he had knowen beeing in Malta, <hi>Peter de Padiglia</hi> a gentleman that came with the Marques an expert Marſhall of the Spaniſh campe, to whom (remembring their familiaritie) he did write his minde, demanding free paſſage not only for himſelfe and his troupes, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, Armes, artillerie, and enſignes; but alſo would haue paſſage graunted for all Portugals that would imbarke with him. This let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:9072:169"/>
in ſome ſort pleaſed the Marques, being in hope to come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement &amp; to remaine an abſolute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querour without effuſion of more bloud, before the ſea ſhoulde grow more rough: But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ſeemed vnto him vnreaſonable, refuſing to heare talke of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Portugals to be tranſported into Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

It is ſtrange to ſee the confidence of theſe men, the which (nothing terrified by examples) did induce them to cruell exceſſe, and yet did not force them to fight it out vnto death: but the Portugals vnexperienced, do not account of dangers they ſee not, and when they ſee them, they feare them more then they are to bee feared. There was no more to be done in this iland; ſo as hauing ſpoiled it, leauing <hi>Anthony</hi> of Portugall for Gouernour, with two hundreth ſoldiers, <hi>Peter de Toledo</hi> returned with his galleies and other ſhips to the Terceres, where the reſt of the Ilands of Saint George, Pico, and Gratioſa came to yeeld their obedience. The Marques hauing agreed with the French, cauſed a diligent ſearch to be made for <hi>Emanuel de Silua,</hi> who intituled himſelfe counte of Torres Vedras, Gouernour and Generall of the Ilands, but being retired to Altary, and finding that ſuch as had the charge of certaine boates, in whom fortune had

more force then loialtie, had broken them againſt the rockes, hee founde all hope vaine for his ſafetie, hauing no meanes to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by the French compoſition, being attired in a baſe habite hee hidde himſelfe in the mountaines.<q> But it ſeemed the heauens had decreed, he ſhould ſuffer puniſhment for his offences,</q>  by the hands of his enimies, for that a mooriſh ſlaue, who hoped by that meanes to ſaue himſelfe, diſcouered him to a Prouoſt marſhall, who ſeeing him before his eies, knewe not what he was; ſo as hauing taken and<note place="margin">Emanuel de Silua taken, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with others.</note> brought him to the citie, he was kept with ſome other of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall rebels and ſeditious, vntill the proceſſe of their death were made, by the auditour, in the name of the King and the Marques, as generall of the armie, ſpecifying all their faults that were executed vpon the priſoners. The Germaines firſt put themſelues in battaile in the chiefeſt part of Angra, keeping the entrie of euery ſtreete, and there cauſing a fire to be made, they did burne all the money they founde to be ſtamped with the coine of <hi>Anthony,</hi> the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was not little in quantitie, yet was it nothing woorth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part of baſe mettall, with ſmall mixture of ſiluer: After they cutte off <hi>Emanuel de Silua</hi> his head with a ſworde, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Germaine faſhion, to the generall griefe of all the aſſiſtants: For being of a louely countenance, and hauing in this laſt houre with great reſolution confeſſed himſelfe culpable, and to haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued this puniſhment; hee demaunded pardon of one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <q>of all ſuch as preſent or abſent he thought to haue wronged, ſaying, that he alone had bin the cauſe of the miſerie of this Iland,</q>  &amp; that he alone ought to ſuffer the puniſhment; the which ioined to the contrition he ſhewed, did mooue the harts euen of his enimies: And in truth we may well ſaie that he framed himſelfe to the ſpeech of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant, <q>that to leaue a tyrannie they muſt not ride poaſt, but ſtaie vntill they be forced, for in truth he attended vntill hee loſt his head.</q>  His head was ſet vp publikely in that place, from the which that of <hi>Melchior Alphonſo</hi> was taken, whom a little before he had put to death, for being affectionate to the Catholique king: <q>And it was obſerued, that being required by the kinſemen of the dead, to take it from thence, he made anſwere it ſhoulde be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when his ſtood in the place, which he ment ſhoulde be neuer; thus do men ſodainly foretell their owne miſeries.</q>

who as we haue ſaid ſpoiled the Ilands of Cape Vert, and Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Vieira (who with the title of Embaſſador to his Maieſtie, had betraied ſuch as truſted in him, did likewiſe loſe their heads. They<note place="margin">The French men ſent to the galleies.</note> did hang many, and many (eſpecially of the French) taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before the capitulation, were ſent to the galleies: The Marques was commaunded to diſpatch with all ſpeede, and to goe with his armie to Cales, and ſome ſaide the King woulde turne his forces againſt Affrick, and ſeaſe vpon Alarache, and poſſiblie attempt the like vpon Algier, being fitter to vndertake thoſe enterpriſes in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne then in any other ſeaſon of the yeere: And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left <hi>Iohn de Vrbina</hi> with two thouſand Spaniſh foote for the guard of the Ilands, he failed with the fleete and the reſt of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers towards the porte of Andolouzia: and in the meane time both in Caſtill, and in Portugall, they made greatioy for this victorie, with publike feaſts, but not ſo great as was the griefe of <hi>Anthony</hi> his followers, whereof many (hoping that the ſtrength of this Ilande ſhould yet be a ſubiect for <hi>Anthony</hi> to returne into the realme) were diſcouraged, ſo as there remained no grounde, whereon to ſettle their hopes, although many expected that <hi>Anthony</hi> ſuruiuing <hi>Philip,</hi> the eſtate of things might ſo change, as they might yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the accompliſhment of their deſires.</p>
