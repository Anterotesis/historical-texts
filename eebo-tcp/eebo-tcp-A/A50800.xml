         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I May be juſtly aſhamed to appear in print near ſo great an Authour, whoſe Work is received and entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſuch univerſal Applauſe, that it comes to be reckoned among the Patterns of Hiſtorie. But many do ſtill complain of one Defect, that his Hiſtorie being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten chiefly for his own Countrie, thoſe things that relate to the Conſtitution and Government there, are rather hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſuppoſed to be underſtood, then fully opened.</p>
            <p>This has made many deſire a clear Account of thoſe things; and the Humour of writing the <hi>preſent State</hi> of Kingdoms being now common to moſt Nations, many have wiſhed to ſee the preſent State of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Therefore the quick Sale of this excellent Hiſtorie encouraging the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller to give the World a Fourth Edition of it, he was earneſt with me, to write ſuch an <hi>Appendix</hi> to it as might adde ſomewhat to its value and ſale.</p>
            <p>He was importunate to find out one who would write a Continuation to it: but I knew well, that both my Abilities in writing and my Informations were too defective to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture on ſuch a Work. And the Bookseller receiving a full ſatisfaction to his deſign in the <hi>Memoires</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (from which, though it be not a full Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of all that paſſed, yet it is hoped the World will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more light about the late Troubles then has been yet publiſhed,) there remained nothing to be done, but to give the <hi>Succeſſion of the Biſhops</hi> from the time where the former Hiſtory ends, with the Account of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:46492:4"/>
Orders</hi> and <hi>Houſes,</hi> the <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi> and the <hi>Learned Men</hi> that flouriſhed in them, together with the true State of that Kingdom in its <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Supreme Courts.</hi> Which I have endeavoured to doe as fully as ſeemed needfull. I did not adventure on ſo hardy a Work without communicating it to Learned and knowing Perſons, by whoſe directions I have now finiſhed theſe Sheets.</p>
            <p>I have long ſearched into thoſe things, and have uſed all the endeavours that were poſſible, to get any Miſtakes that might have crept in with ſuch a variety of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rectified: ſo that I am very confident there are no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Errours in matters of fact in the Account that follows.</p>
            <p>I once intended to have publiſhed a Collection I have made of the <hi>Noble Families</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But hearing there was a Perſon of Quality ingaged in it, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to write from very authentical grounds an Account of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I have ſtifled that part of my Collection.</p>
            <p>If my Style or way of writing be not according to what the Reader expects; as I need great Allowances for my Defects, ſo I know upon what Diſadvantages I appear after ſuch a Grave and Maſculine Writer. So that, as when one comes out of a very lightſom place, where his Eyes were filled with Brightneſs, into a darker Room, it appears quite dark unto him; I have no reaſon to wonder, if after ſo clear a Light, all my Informations look like Night and Darkneſs.</p>

               <p>AFTER that Cardinal <hi>David Beaton</hi> was murthered in his Caſtle of <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> by <hi>Normand Leſlie</hi> and his Complices, <hi>James Hamilton,</hi>

Chriſti</hi> 1546.</note> Duke of <hi>Chattel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rault,</hi> Governour of the Realm, did nominate his baſe Brother <hi>John Hamilton,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Paſley,</hi> to the place; who thereupon was elected by the Canons, and ſoon after confirmed by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third: who, fearing that <hi>Scotland</hi> would follow the example of <hi>England,</hi> in caſting off the Yoak of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, was glad to gratifie the Governour in that particular.</p>
               <p>About this time, the Eſtimation of the Clergy began to decreaſe,<note place="margin">1556.</note> becauſe of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Lives and groſs Ignorance; which induced divers of that number to relinquiſh their Order, and to make open profeſſion of the Truth: multitudes alſo of Monks and Friers, leaving their Cloiſters, began to exhort the people to renounce the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Fopperies and Superſtitions, and to ſubmit to the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> every-where crying out againſt the Corruptions of the Church. The Prelates, in ſtead of compoſing matters calmly, took the contrary courſe, exerciſing great Severity againſt them, and cruelly burning ſuch of the <hi>New Religion</hi> (as they termed it) as fell into their hands: thoſe who fled they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with the higheſt Cenſures of the Church, Burning them <hi>in Effigie,</hi> and Curſing them by Book, Bell, and Candle. But all this Cruelty ſerved to no purpoſe; for the death of <hi>Walter Mill</hi> (who was the laſt Martyr that ſuffered for Religion) was the very bane of Popery in <hi>Scotland</hi>; mens minds being now wholly alienated from the Clergy,<note place="margin">1558.</note> and their Conſciences convinced, that the Doctrine of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did neither allow ſuch cruel Principles, nor countenance ſuch bloudy Practices.</p>

and <hi>Hume</hi>; who ſeiſing upon the Priſoners, ſent them to ſundry places, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop with a ſtrong Guard to <hi>Striveling,</hi> where he was publickly hanged on a Gibbet erected for that purpoſe, 1570. He was the onely Biſhop that ſuffered by form of Juſtice in this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1571.</note>At this time the Rents of this Biſhoprick were by the Regent conferred upon the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> for ſome years, as a recompence of his great charges in his Embaſſy to <hi>England.</hi> That Earl, that he might enjoy them legally, made choice of <hi>John Douglas,</hi> Provoſt of the New Colledge of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> (before a <hi>Carmelite</hi> Frier, and Chaplain to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi>) to be Titular Biſhop; who was, with much oppoſition of the Presbytery, (for at that time there was no Chapter,) admitted and inſtalled, 1572. This Biſhop ſate little above two years, and died at <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> 1575.</p>
               <p>After his death, the Earl of <hi>Morton,</hi> then Regent, did prefer <hi>Patrick Adamſon,</hi> his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Saint Andrews.</hi> This Biſhop was ſorely vexed by thoſe of the Kirk-party, who proſecuted him with the higheſt Cenſures of their Church, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated him (very informally) for not ſubmitting to their Judicatory: but the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was afterwards compounded, and the Biſhop relaxed. He was a man of great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but an ill Adminiſtratour of the Churche's Patrimony. He ſate fifteen years, and died at <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> 1591.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the See continued void, and the Profits thereof were by King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth beſtowed on the Duke of <hi>Lennox,</hi> till the Parliament 1606. wherein the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties of Biſhopricks (in former times annexed to the Crown) were reſtored; the want of which had rendered the Biſhops of unſerviceable both to Church and State. About this time, <hi>George Gladſtanes,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cathnes,</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Saint Andrews</hi>; a man of ready utterance, and of great invention, but of an eaſie nature, as appears by his being induced ſo eaſily to leaſe out his Benefice for ſo many Ages to come, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Succeſſours. But in this he was not ſingular, for the reſt of the Clergy, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, did let Leaſes of their Benefices, to their Friends and others, for Hundreds of years, and that for a pitifull pittance. Which Extravagancy was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reſtrained by the wiſedom of King <hi>James,</hi> when he was of age: for he enacted, That Biſhops ſhould let Leaſes for nineteen years, Rectours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their Life-time and three years, and other Beneficed perſons for their Life-time and three years, with conſent of their Patrons. Biſhop <hi>Gladſtanes</hi> governed the See ten years, and dying at <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> 1615. was interred in the South-Eaſt Iſle of the Pariſh-Church.</p>
               <p>Upon his death, <hi>John Spotiſwood,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi>; who procured to this See (whoſe Rents were almoſt wholly alienated by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours) the Revenues of the Priory of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> then in Lay-hands, as alſo the reſtauration of three hundred pounds of <hi>Engliſh</hi> money <hi>per Annum,</hi> of a long time ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the Crown-rents. The Office of the Chancellary in the State, conferr'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by that Glorious <hi>Martyr King CHARLES</hi> the Firſt, he diſcharged to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Royal Maſter, and the Churche's advantage. He was a perſon of rare En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, and in all things compleatly qualified for his imployment. Yet did he not eſcape the hard meaſure which other Loyal Subjects afterward taſted of; for by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters he was forced to retire into <hi>England,</hi> where he met with entertainment more ſuitable to his worth. He ended his days in a good old age, and was honourably inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Abby, <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. after he had governed the See twenty four years.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1637.</note>About this time our long Peace, and the Plenty which did accompany it, made us wanton, our Proſperity puft us up with Pride, we were Enemies to our own welfare, weary of our preſent eſtate, too much deſirous of Revolutions, and greedy of Novelties. Our private Diſcontents begat Jealouſies and Animoſities, which (ſince they could be no longer ſmothered) muſt needs burſt out into a flame. We were afraid of we knew not what; nothing but the Preſervation of Religion muſt be the Pretext, and the Cloak to cover the Knavery which was afterwards acted: and notwithſtanding the Satisfaction given unto us by the <hi>Beſt of Kings,</hi> in laying aſide the Book of Common-Prayer, Book of Canons, and High Commiſſion; yet ſtill we continued diſſatisfied. All the Favours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon us by the <hi>Beſt of Princes</hi> could not ingage us to continue in our Duty and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to Him. All the good fruit we brought forth was, our ingaging in a moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and horrible Rebellion, ſuch as former Ages could hardly parallel. Like <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dog, we would neither be at reſt our ſelves, nor ſuffer our Neighbours, and ſuch who continued firm in their Allegeance to His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to be at quiet, and live in Peace. Alas! we metamorphoſed our plough-ſhares into ſwords; the Son roſe up againſt the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46492:6"/>
Father, Brother againſt Brother; Pariſhes were divided, Shires went into Factions; yea, the whole Kingdom was divided againſt it ſelf, ſheathing the Sword in its own bowels. Which way ſoever we look'd, we ſaw nothing but that which might conſume our eyes, and grieve our hearts. If towards the Church, 'twas rent by Schiſm; the Biſhops, and many of the Reverend Clergy, were thruſt out, impriſoned, plundered, and baniſhed; the <hi>Houſe of Prayer</hi> made (in the moſt literal ſenſe) <hi>a Den of Thieves.</hi> If towards the State, we ſaw the Anointed of the Lord impriſoned, arraigned, and, under colour of Juſtice, moſt barbarouſly murthered, by thoſe who ſlew him, like the Heir in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that they might ſeiſe on his Inheritance. Alas! when Church and State were come to this paſs, the caſe of the poor Land muſt needs be deplorable. We ſaw the Loyal Subjects, under the names of Malignants, Traitours, and Rebels, impriſoned, baniſhed, and miſerably butchered; their Eſtates and Lands forfeited and ſold; their Houſes garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, plundered, and burnt; and their Poſterity almoſt reduced to poverty and miſery. Alas! how quickly did our after-games of Loyalty vaniſh through our own Diviſions? Was there any poſſibility of proſpering, ſo long as we continued Traitours to our ſelves? When we had almoſt ruined our ſelves by our own inteſtine Diviſions, we became a Prey to a Tyrannical Crue of Uſurpers: and to compleat our Miſeries, our Eſtates, our Friends, yea our very Conſciences groaned under the grievous burthen of that inſupportable Yoak, which our own Sins had prepared, and other mens Sins had put on. Nine years did we groan under the Tyranny of theſe Uſurpers; till it pleaſed Almighty God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us in mercy, and to free us from the Houſe of bondage, bleſſing us, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Calamities and Miſeries, with Peace, by the miraculous Reſtauration of our <hi>moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Sovereign</hi> to the Throne of His Anceſtours; whom God long preſerve, for the Good of this Church and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now the face of Affairs began to change, and His <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1660</note> that He might ſettle the Kingdom, ſummoned his Firſt Parliament to meet at <hi>Edinburgh, January</hi> the firſt 1661. giving a Commiſſion under the Great Seal to <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> to repreſent His Perſon therein. In the Firſt Seſſion, the Solemn League and Covenant was condemned, as an unlawfull and wicked Oath, impoſed on the Subjects by a prevailing Faction, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Authority; the pretended Triennial Parliaments from 1640. to 1649. with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1638, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were annulled; the unjuſt Tranſactions at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> 1646. and 1647. condemned; Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Ingagement 1648. approved; the pretended Forfeitures of the Marqueſſes of <hi>Huntly</hi> and <hi>Montroſs,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Forth,</hi> Barons of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garey, Haddo, Dunerub, Delgaty, Harthill,</hi> and others, who had ſuffered for their Loyalty, and all Acts made in prejudice of Lawfull Authority, were reſcinded.</p>
               <p>In the Second Seſſion, the Hierarchy was reſtored, which had ſuffered an Eclipſe for twenty four years. Dr. <hi>James Sharp,</hi> Profeſſour of Divinity at <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1662</note> (who had been Profeſſour of Philoſophy in <hi>Saint Leonard</hi>'s Colledge,) was preferred Archbiſhop of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who now governs the See.</p>

               <p>The firſt Biſhop thereof was <hi>William Forbes,</hi> Doctour of Divinity, one of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> (before, Principal of the Mariſchal Colledge of <hi>Aberdene,</hi>) a very worthy Perſon. His Works ſhew him to have been a man of vaſt Learning and ſound Judgment. He ſate but a little while, and died at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> about the year 1634.</p>
               <p>Upon his death, <hi>David Lindſay,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Brichen,</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The Fury of the rude Multitude fell heavy upon this Biſhop, even to the manifeſt danger and hazard of his Life, upon the firſt reading of the Book of Common-Prayer in <hi>Edinburgh, July</hi> 1637. He was thruſt out, with the reſt of the Biſhops, by the Covenanters, 1638.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George Wishart,</hi> Doctour of Divinity, was, upon the Reſtitution of the Hierarchy, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. promoted to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> This worthy man was 1638. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher at <hi>Leith,</hi> and for his Loyalty had very hard meaſure from the Covenanters, being thrice plundered of all that he had, and thrice impriſoned in a filthy ſtinking Gaol. But being delivered from thence, he went beyond Sea with the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> 1646. He was a perſon of great integrity, and well ſeen in Hiſtory. Having in his time ſeen many Changes and Alterations, from better to worſe, and from worſe to better, he had his <hi>Nunc dimittis</hi> in peace, at <hi>Edinburgh, Anno</hi> 1670.</p>
               <p>Upon his death, <hi>Alexander Young,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> was preferred to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who now governs the See.</p>
               <p>The Cathedral-Church is that of <hi>Saint Giles,</hi> (of old a Collegiate Church,) a vaſt and magnificent Structure. It is at preſent divided into four Partitions, three whereof are allotted to God's publick Worſhip.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. <hi>George Halyburton,</hi> Preacher at <hi>Perth,</hi> was preferred to the See; a very worthy perſon: he ſate little above two years.</p>

               <head>Biſhops of ABERDENE.</head>
               <p>THE Biſhoprick of <hi>Aberdene</hi> ſuffered very much by Biſhop <hi>William Gordon</hi>; for he alienated the Profits thereof, and in a ſhort time brought the Revenues of that See almoſt to nothing. And indeed this Benefice was at his death ſcarce worth the accepting. About the year 1579. <hi>David Cunninghame,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Saint Nicolas,</hi> was preferred to the See. This Biſhop was a grave, learned, and wiſe man; imployed by King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth in an Embaſſy to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> wherein the Biſhop did faithfully diſcharge his truſt, to his great commendation. He died about the year 1603.</p>
               <p>Unto him ſucceeded <hi>Peter Blackburn,</hi> Rectour of <hi>Saint Nicolas,</hi> who governed the See about twelve years, and dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. was buried in <hi>Saint Nicolas</hi> Church in <hi>New Aberdene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon whoſe death, <hi>Alexander Forbes,</hi> (of the Houſe of <hi>Ardmurdo,</hi>) Biſhop of <hi>Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Aberdene.</hi> He ſate little above three years, and dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. was buried in the Cathedral-Church.</p>
               <p>To him ſucceeded, upon King <hi>James</hi>'s Nomination, and the Chapter's Election, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Forbes</hi> of <hi>Corſe.</hi> This worthy man, at the earneſt importunity of the Biſhops of <hi>Aberdene</hi> and <hi>Murray,</hi> did enter into Orders in the forty eighth year of his age, <hi>An.</hi> 1612. and was preferred to the Benefice of <hi>Keath</hi> in <hi>Strath-Yla</hi>; in which ſtation he continued ſix years: and after the death of Biſhop <hi>Alexander Forbes,</hi> at the importunity both of the Clergy and Laiety, he did accept of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Aberdene.</hi> He was in great eſteem and favour with King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> being Privy Councellour to both Kings. In his old age he was much troubled with the Palſie. Seventeen years did he faithfully and wiſely govern the See, and died in his houſe in <hi>Old Aberdene</hi> 1635. in the ſeventy firſt year of his age, being interred in the South Iſle of the Cathedral-Church, near the Sepulchre of Biſhop <hi>Gawan Dumbar.</hi> His Commentary upon the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and a Diſcourſe of the Miniſterial Office, do ſhew his Learning and Judgment.</p>
               <p>Upon his death, <hi>Adam Bannatyn,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dumblane,</hi> was tranſlated to <hi>Aberdene,</hi> who being thruſt out by the Covenanters, retired into <hi>England,</hi> where he died ſhortly after. His houſe in <hi>Old Aberdene,</hi> for magnificence in all things like a Palace, was plundered by a Regiment of the Covenanters, and afterwards quite demoliſhed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Uſurpers.</p>

The Roof was laid on, and the Floor paved with free-ſtone, by Biſhop <hi>Lindſay, Anno</hi> 1445. Biſhop <hi>Spence</hi> adorned the Chancel with many brave Ornaments 1460. Biſhop <hi>Elphingſton</hi> did perfect the great Steeple, (which was a mark for Sailours in thoſe days,) and furniſhed it with coſtly and tunable Bells, 1489. Biſhop <hi>Dumbar</hi> did perfect the two leſſer Steeples, cieled the Church, and built the South-Iſle, 1522. And his Succeſſour, Biſhop <hi>Stewart,</hi> built the Conſiſtory-houſe <hi>Anno</hi> 1539. This glorious Structure (being near nineſcore years in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) did not remain twentie years in its integrity, when it was almoſt ruined by a Crue of ſacrilegious Church-robbers: for <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. the Barons of <hi>Mernis,</hi> accompanied with ſome of the Towns-men of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> having demoliſhed the Monaſteries of the Black and Gray Friers, fell to rob the Cathedral, which they ſpoiled of all its coſtly Ornaments and Jewels, and demoliſhed the Chancel. Having ſhipped the Lead, Bells, and other Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, intending to expoſe them to ſale in <hi>Holland,</hi> all this ill-gotten Wealth ſunk (by the juſt Judgment of God upon Sacriledge) not far from the <hi>Gridle-Neſs.</hi> The body of the Cathedral was preſerved from utter ruine by the Earl of <hi>Huntly.</hi> Afterwards, <hi>An.</hi> 1607. the Church was repaired, and covered with Slate, at the charge of the Pariſh, and ſo continues yet in pretty good repair.</p>

               <p>HAving given an account of the Succeſſion of the Biſhops in their ſeveral Sees, let us take a ſhort view of the ſeveral Courts, ſubordinate to them, wherein is exerciſed Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46492:10"/>The Firſt and Loweſt (which is in every Pariſh) is called <hi>the Seſſion.</hi> It conſiſts of the chief and moſt grave men of the Pariſh, who are termed <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> In this ſmall Court (whereof the Miniſter is Preſident) all Fornicatours, Adulterers, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Swearers, Prophaners of the Lord's-day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are convented, and put to make publick Confeſſions of their Sins, and Profeſſions of their Repentance, according to the degree or hainouſneſs of them. For Fornication, they make publick Confeſſion in the Church three ſeveral Lord's-days; in the laſt of which they receive Abſolution. For an Adultery, they make their Profeſſion of Repentance, for half a year, every Lord's-day; and for ſix Lord's-days they ſtand in ſackcloath at the Church-door half an hour before Morning-prayers: and then in the end receive Abſolution. And for other Faults, they doe penance according to their ſeveral degrees. The Deacon's Office is, to collect the Money for the uſe of the Poor, to delate Delinquents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that of the Elder is, to be carefull of the Fabrick of the Church, to aſſiſt in the cenſuring ſcandalous perſons, and to wait on the Miniſter at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Court ſitteth once a week.</p>
               <p>The number of the Pariſhes in <hi>Scotland</hi> is uncertain: I conjecture them to be about a Thouſand.</p>
               <p>The Next Court is called <hi>the Presbyterie,</hi> conſiſting of twelve or twenty Miniſters, more or leſs. That ſits once in two or three weeks. The Moderatour or Preſident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is choſen by the Biſhop. In this Court are diſcuſſed Appeals from Seſſions, and other difficult caſes. Here are convented all thoſe who refuſe to ſubmit to Church-Diſcipline, and all ſuch as apoſtatize to Popery or Quakeriſm; who, if they remain obſtinate, are proſecuted with the Cenſures of the Church. Here alſo all ſuch as enter into Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are examined, and an account taken of their Learning, and other Qualifications, in a courſe of many ſeveral Trialls; as making Homilies, Sermons, and Common-places; which hold two or three months: and then they are returned to the Biſhop well qualified, who upon that proceeds to ordain them.</p>

               <p>A Third Court (whereof the Biſhop is Preſident) is <hi>the Provincial Aſſembly,</hi> or <hi>Synod.</hi> In this Court are diſcuſſed all Appeals from Presbyteries, and all other difficult caſes. From hence are iſſued Warrants for viſiting of Churches. Here alſo the Lives of Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Miniſters are tried, who, if found guilty of crimes laid to their charge, are either depoſed, ſuſpended, or excommunicated.</p>
               <p>The Sentence of Excommunication cannot be pronounced againſt an obſtinate perſon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46492:11"/>
but after a long Proceſs of near a years continuance, and many Citations, and much pains to bring the Scandalous perſon (againſt whom onely it is denounced) to a due ſenſe of his Sins, and a willingneſs to ſubmit to the Cenſures of the Church: and then it muſt be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and approved by the Biſhop. The Provincial Synod meets twice in the year, in <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Higheſt Eccleſiaſtical Court is <hi>the General Aſſembly;</hi> which, as its Conſtitution and Authority was ſettled in King <hi>James</hi>'s Minority, was made up of two Miniſters Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from every Presbytery, and one Lay-Elder, a Commiſſioner from every Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Burrough, one from every Univerſity, and one from the King. Theſe had the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority about all Church-matters; and how much trouble they bred King <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Par.</hi> Car. 2.</note> the former Hiſtory has fully diſcovered. A ſhadow of this ſtill remains: for the Supreme Eccleſiaſtical Court is declared to be a National Synod made up of Biſhops and Deans, and two Members from every Presbytery, one of whom is of the Biſhops nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a Commiſſioner from every Univerſity. But nothing is to be propoſed but by the King or His Commiſſioner: nor can any thing that they doe be of any force, till it be ratified by the King. But as the calling of this Synod is wholly in the Crown, ſo there is little need of it, ſince the King's Supremacy is ſo large, that He needs not their concurrence, to adde their Authority to any thing that He ſhall think fit to doe about Church-affairs.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops of <hi>Scotland</hi> take their places thus: <hi>Saint Andrews, Glaſgow, Edinburgh, Galloway</hi>; the reſt according to the Seniority of their Conſecrations.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Containing a ſhort account of the ſeveral OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS of RELIGIOUS PERSONS in <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> together with a Catalogue of their Convents, ſuppreſſed at the Reformation.</head>
            <p>IN the Infancy of Chriſtianity, when Perſecution was grown ſo hot, that moſt Cities and populous Places were viſited therewith, many Godly men fled into Deſarts, there to live with more ſafety, and ſerve God with leſs diſturbance. Theſe were called <hi>MONKS.</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ſolus,</hi> becauſe living alone by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Their Houſes were either Caves, Grots, or little Cells; what would Hide and Heat, Cover and Keep warm, ſerved them for Cloaths; Herbs and Roots were their Diet, and Water their Drink. In theſe Solitary places they ſpent their lives conſtantly in Prayer, Reading, Meditating, and ſuch like pious employments. They vowed no Poverty, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, or Obedience. Thus continued they during the heat of Perſecution; and when Peace was reſtored, they returned to their former Dwellings, reſuming their Callings, which they had not left off, but for a time laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Afterwards there ſprung up another ſort of Monks leading a ſolitary life, when no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution forced them thereunto. Theſe conſidering the inconſtancy of humane affairs, that though they had Proſperity for the preſent, it might be ſoon changed into a contrary condition, if either the reſtleſs endeavours of Satan took effect, or ſinfull Chriſtians were rewarded according to their deſerts, and prompted alſo thereunto by their own Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick diſpoſitions, choſe a lone life, and lived in Deſarts. Afterwards they were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together to live under one Roof, becauſe their Company would be chearfull in Health, and needfull in Sickneſs one to another. They ſuſtained themſelves by their Labour, (for every one had a Calling whereby to gain his Livelihood,) and relieved others by their Charity; and very ſtrict were they in their Lives and Converſations. But afterwards, Monks having ſufficiency turned lazie, then getting waxed wanton, and at laſt endowed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46492:11"/>
with ſuperfluity became notoriouſly vicious; and ſo they continued till they were finally extirpated.</p>

            <p>We proceed next to the Monks of the Order of <hi>Saint Antony,</hi> whoſe Original was from Saint <hi>Antony</hi> an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who about the time of the later Perſecutions, not long after <hi>Decius,</hi> retired into the Deſarts, where he lived the beſt part of an hundred years, and became the Father of an Eremitick life, wherein he educated all thoſe Diſciples that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him. After whoſe Example other Orders were ſet up. About the time of the Wars in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> his Body was tranſlated from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Mota,</hi> (now called <hi>Saint Antony</hi>) a Town in the Province of <hi>Viennoys</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where it was honourably laid up in a Church built to his memory, and became famous for miraculous Cures. Among which, <hi>Gaſto,</hi> a Nobleman of that Province, and his Son <hi>Girond,</hi> being heal'd of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Plague, dedicated themſelves and all that they had to Saint <hi>Antony,</hi> wholly devoting themſelves to the curing and attending of the Sick that came thither. To whom ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after eight more joyned themſelves, who combined into a Society. This was about the year 1121.

               <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1297. who preſcribed unto them Rules, and conferred upon them their Privileges. They obſerve the Rule of Saint <hi>Auguſtine's</hi> Order, and as the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Badge of their Order, wear about their Necks the letter T in Gold or Silver hanging upon their Breaſts, and carry a little Bell about with them.</p>
            <p>The Monks of this Order had onely one Convent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <hi>Leith,</hi> but who was the Founder thereof, I cannot learn.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthuſians</hi> were inſtituted by Saint <hi>Bruno,</hi> a Native of <hi>Colein,</hi> who being a <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Doctour of Divinity, and a Canon of <hi>Rheims,</hi> abandoned the World, and with ſix Aſſociats began his auſtere Eremitical courſe of life on the <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Mountains, in the Dioceſe of <hi>Gratianopolis,</hi> with the Licence of <hi>Hugh</hi> then Biſhop thereof.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Second, and died <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1101.

            </p>
            <p>This Order was inſtituted by Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> about the year of our Lord 1120. Their Office and Vow was, to defend the Temple and the Holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to entertain Chriſtian Strangers that came thither for Devotion, and to guard them in ſafety when they went to viſit the places of the Holy Land. Their Habit was a White Cloak, with a Red Croſs, and a Sword girt about them. They were ſuppreſſed by Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> the Fifth, about the year 1310. and their Lands were (by a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil held at <hi>Vienna</hi>) conferr'd on the Knights of the Order of <hi>Saint John of Jeruſalem,</hi> called alſo <hi>Joannites,</hi> and after Knights of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Malta,</hi> where they live at this day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Templars</hi> and their Succeſſours (ſpoken of before) had onely one Houſe in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was the Hoſpital of <hi>Saint Germans</hi> in <hi>Lothian.</hi> This Houſe was diſſolved <hi>Anno</hi> 1494. and the greateſt part of its Revenues by King <hi>James</hi> the Fourth conferr'd upon the King's Colledge of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> then newly founded by Biſhop <hi>William Elphing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though I cannot give an account in what year every particular Monaſtery in <hi>Scotland</hi> was founded, yet their general Diſſolution was about the year 1560.</p>
            <p>There was alſo a Convent of <hi>Red Friers</hi> at the mouth of <hi>Teviot</hi> near <hi>Kelſo</hi>; but by whom built, I cannot learn.</p>

                     <p>In <hi>October</hi> the Students begin to convene. They wear a Red or Scarlet Gown with hanging Sleeves; but thoſe who are Burſars, a Black Gown with a Girdle. Their time of continuance at the Univerſitie is four years. They are ranked into four Claſſes.</p>
                     <p>To thoſe of the firſt Claſs is taught the <hi>Greek</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>The Students of the ſecond Claſs do learn Logicks and Metaphyſicks.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe of the third Claſs (who at the year's end are Bachelours of Arts) do learn E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks and General Phyſicks.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and higheſt Claſs do compleat their Courſe with Special Phyſicks and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</p>
                     <p>The time of the Commencement of Maſters of Arts is in <hi>July</hi>; the manner thus.</p>
                     <p>Before the day appointed, thoſe who are to receive their Degree do publiſh their <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> inviting all Learned men and Scholars to come and diſpute.</p>
                     <p>At the day appointed, great preparation is made, the <hi>Candidati</hi> are apparelled in Black, with Black Gowns, and at ten of the clock all go into the publick School, where the Profeſſour of Philoſophy or Regent, who is to conferre the Degree, makes a long Speech (beginning with a Prayer) to the Auditours: which being ended, the Diſputes begin, and continue till four or five of the clock. Then they take a little refreſhment, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Graduation, (Laureation.)</p>
                     <p>The Regent doth tender to the <hi>Candidati</hi> the following Oath:
<q>Ego, A.B. coram Omniſcio &amp; Omnipotenti Deo, Religionem &amp; Fidem, unicam &amp; ſolam Orthodoxam, in Eccleſia Scoticana palàm propoſitam, profeſſurum me, &amp; ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Pontificiorum &amp; aliorum quorumcunque Haereſibus longè abhorrentem, ſpondeo, voveo, juro. Inſuper, Univerſitati buie, almae Parenti, cui banc Ingenii culturam debeo, liberaliter relaturum me nutritiam quam potero, eâdem fide ſolenniter promit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Quòd ſi fidem ſciens &amp; volens fefellero, arcanorum cordis receſſuum Scrutsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Deum, ultarem &amp; vindicem non recuſo. Ità me adjuvet Deus.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the Oath one of the <hi>Candidati</hi> aſcends the Desk, and the Regent taking into his hand a Hat or Cap, with theſe following words doth give him his Degree.
<q>Ego eâdem authoritate, quam Summi ac Potentiſſimi Principes Almae buic <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitati ampliſſimam indulsêre, te A.B. in Artibus Liberalibus, &amp; Diſciplinis Philoſophicis, Magiſtrum creo, proclamo, conſtituo, renuncio: tibíque poteſtatem do, Legendi, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi omniáque id genus alia committendi, quae bîc, aut ubivis Gentium, Artium Magiſtris concedi ſolet. Et in ſignum manumiſſionis tuae, Caput tuum hoc Pileo (<hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Cap on the Scholar's Head</hi>) adorno: quod ut tibi felix fauſtúmque ſit, Deum Optimum Maximum precor. Inſuper, Librum hunc tibi apertum trado: ut Ingenii tui aliquod ſpecimen coram celebri hoc coetu edas, rogo.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Graduate hath a ſhort Speech to the Auditours, and ſo the Ceremony is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46492:18"/>
with clapping of hands, founding of Trumpets, ſhouting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus are all the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didati</hi> graduated one after another. The ſame way almoſt is uſed in all the Univerſities of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the Graduation of Bachelours and Doctours of Divinitie, Law, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, I can give no account.</p>

                        <hi>William Forbes,</hi> Doctour of Divinity, Principal, was a perſon of rare Endowments, vaſt Learning, and a celebrated Preacher. He was the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and indeed a moſt holy perſon, of whom all that ever knew him give this Character, that they never ſaw him but they thought his heart was in heaven. He was indeed a fit pattern to all that ſhould come after him.</p>

                        <hi>Robert Baron,</hi> Doctour and Profeſſour of Divinity, was a perſon of incomparable worth and Learning. He had a clear apprehenſion of things, and a rare facultie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the hardeſt things to be eaſily underſtood. He is well known by his Book <hi>De objecto formali Fidei,</hi> and his Metaphyſicks and other ſmall Treatiſes: there are many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Manuſcripts of his that are not yet publiſhed: and he bare the greateſt ſhare of that famous Debate <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. between the Doctours of <hi>Aberdene</hi> and the Covenanters.</p>

                        <hi>Alexander Reid,</hi> Doctour of Phyſick, was bred here: he grew very famous in <hi>London,</hi> and left a great part of his Eſtate to pious uſes in and about the places of his Education.</p>

                        <hi>Duncan Liddell,</hi> Doctour of Phyſick, was a perſon much eſteemed for his learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as his Book <hi>De Febribus,</hi> and ſeveral other Books which he wrote.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 4. Of the GOVERNMENT and LAWS of <hi>SCOTLAND</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been governed by Kings in as long a Succeſſion as any Nation in the world. The King is an abſolute and unaccountable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and (as the Law calls him) <hi>a Free Prince, of a Sovereign Power;<note place="margin">15. Par. Jac. 5. c. 25.</note> having as great Liberties and Prerogatives by the Laws of this Realm, and Privilege of His Crown and Diademe, as any other King, Prince or Potentate whatſoever.</hi> So that it is delivered as a Maxim in the Heads of our Law,<note place="margin">Title 8. by Sir <hi>John Skeen.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That all Juriſdiction ſtands and conſiſts in the King's Perſon, by reaſon of His Royal Authority and Crown, and is competent to no Subject, but flows and proceeds from the King having Supreme Juriſdiction, and is given and committed by Him to ſuch Subjects as He pleaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> deſcends by Inheritance, the Heir female not being excluded; and the undoubted Right to it has been for above three hundred years in the Family of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> and is now in the Perſon of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, whom God long preſerve.</p>
            <p>Upon the death of a King, the next Heir is preſently King and the Coronation is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſolemn Inſtalment in that which was his Right before. All the difference between our Kings before and after their Coronation is, that they hold onely Conventions of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but no Parliaments, before they are Crowned: of the diſtinction of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhall be given afterwards.</p>
            <p>When a King is Crowned, he ſwears the Oath appointed to be taken at the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which before the Reformation was no other then the Oath ſet down in the Roman Pontifical to be ſworn by Kings; for there is no Proviſion made about it in our Laws:<note place="margin">1. Parl. Jac. 6. c. 8. Anno 1567.</note> but at the Reformation it was enacted, That all Kings at the time of their Coronation ſhould make their faithfull Promiſe by Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Oath is to be found in that Act, and to it the Reader is referred.</p>
            <p>The Prerogatives of the Crown are great; the Power of Peace and War, the Power of raiſing and arming the Subjects, the Power of the Mint, the Nomination of all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, both of the State, and of War and Juſtice, (except ſome Sheriffs that are ſuch by Inheritance,) the Power of Calling, Adjourning, (Prorogation is not in our Law) and Diſſolving of Parliaments, the giving the Votes of Parliament the Authority of Laws, the executing of the Law, and the pardoning of Offences, are clearly and onely in the Crown.</p>
            <p>But to theſe, other great Additions have been made in the two Parliaments held ſince His MAJESTIE'S Reſtauration. For whereas the Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical affairs was always in the Crown ſince the Reformation; yet in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth the Power of the General Aſſembly was raiſed very high by Law, which was the chief foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the late Troubles; it being pretended, that it was contrary to Law for the King to introduce any thing into the Church without the conſent of a General Aſſembly. It was therefore enacted in Parliament,<note place="margin">Act 1.2. Par. held by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdail.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That the External Government and Polity of the Church was wholly in the King's power; and that his Orders ſent to the Privy Council, and publiſhed by them, about all Eccleſiaſtical matters, Meetings and Perſons, were to be obeyed by the Subjects,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46492:21"/>
any Law or Practice to the contrary notwithſtanding.</hi> So that in all matters that relate to the Chuch-Government the King's Power is abſolute.</p>
            <p>The Second Point is about the <hi>Militia.</hi> By the ancient Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">The Laws of Alex. 2.1. Par. Jac. 1. cap 4. 13. Par. Jac. 2. cap. 57.</note> all the King's Subjects were to aſſiſt him in his Wars. Upon which a great enlargement of the King's Prerogative was grafted of late by two <note n="b" place="margin">1. Parl. Car. 2. third Seſſion, Act 25. 2. Par. Car. 2. Act 2.</note> Acts of Parliament; the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> offering to the King, <hi>to raiſe and arm Twenty thouſsand Foot and Two thouſand Horſe, and to furniſh them with forty days Proviſion, to march into any of His Majeſtie's Dominions of</hi> Scotland, England <hi>or</hi> Ireland, <hi>for ſuppreſſing any Foreign Invaſion, Inteſtine Trouble or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or for any other Service wherein His Majeſtie's Honour, Authority or Greatneſs may be concerned.</hi> And theſe Forces, by another Act, <hi>are to give due Obedience to all ſuch Directions as they ſhall receive from His Majeſtie's Privie Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third Point is the Ordering and diſpoſing of Trade with Forein Nations, <note n="c" place="margin">1. Parl. Car. 2. third Seſſion, Act 26.</note> and the laying of Reſtraints and Impoſitions upon Forein imported Commodities; which is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Prerogative of the Crown.</p>
            <p>With theſe Sacred Rights is the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> cloathed.</p>
            <p>The King's Revenue conſiſted anciently moſt in the Crown-Lands which could not be alienated but by Act of Parliament, and in the Wards and Marriages of the Vaſſals of the Crown. But moſt of theſe have been of late years given away, and moſt of the Tenures of Lands are changed, although there has been no general Law for taking away the Wards. The Revenue is now raiſed out of the Cuſtomes and the Exciſe. The laſt is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this King for life, but the former is in the Crown for ever. The reſt is raiſed out of what remains of the Crown-Lands and the Wards.</p>
            <p>The Perſons neareſt in bloud to the King are, firſt, all the Iſſue of King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi>; which are ſo well known to every one, that they need not be repeated. Next to them are all that are deſcended from the Daughter of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, (ſince whom, till the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> no Collateral Branch ſprung from the Royal Family of whom any Iſſue remains,) who was married to <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and had iſſue, firſt, <hi>James,</hi> created Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> whoſe Son was the Duke of <hi>Chaſtelberault,</hi> from whom by two Sons and two Daughters are deſcended the Families of <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Abercorn,</hi> and the Families of <hi>Huntly</hi> and <hi>Launderdail.</hi> And by an Act of Parliament, ſigned by all the Three Eſtates, (the Original whereof is yet extant,) in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Chaſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berault's</hi> Family is declared, next the Queen and her Iſſue, the rightfull Heir of the Crown. The Siſter of King <hi>James</hi> the Third bare likewiſe to the Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> a Daughter, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> from whom deſcended the Family of <hi>Lennox.</hi> There is no other Branch of the Royal Family, ſince it was in the Line of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> except the Earl of <hi>Caſſils</hi> his Family, whoſe Anceſtour, the Lord <hi>Kennedy,</hi> married King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's Siſter, from which Mariage that Family is deſcended. And ſo much of the Royal Family.</p>
            <p>The Chief and Supreme Court is the High Court of Parliament, which is made up of Three Eſtates. The Firſt is the Eccleſiaſtical, that of old conſiſted of the Biſhops and Mitered Abbots, but ſince the Reformation conſiſts onely of Archbiſhops and Biſhops. The Second Eſtate is the Nobility, who were anciently divided into the Greater Barons and the Leſſer, (for every man that holds Lands of the Crown with a Privilege of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Court, much like the Lord of a Manour in <hi>England,</hi> is called a Baron,) and all were obliged to appear perſonally in Parliament, (for Proxies were never allowed by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi>) and give the King Counſel. This proved a very heavy burthen to the ſmall Barons, upon which they deſired to be excuſed from their attendance in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament:<note place="margin">Parl. 7. c. 101.</note> and this was granted to them as a favour in King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's reign. And though by that Act they might have ſent two or three, or more, to repreſent them from every Shire;<note place="margin">Parl. 11. Jac. 6. c. 113.</note> yet they made no uſe of that for above 150 years: but King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, to balance the Nobility, got them reſtored to that Right; ſo that ever ſince there are two ſent from every Shire, who are Commiſſioners for the Shires. The Third Eſtate is the Burroughs, every one of which chuſeth one Commiſſioner; onely the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> as the Metropolis, chuſeth two. The Parliament is ſummoned by Proclamation made at the Head-Burrough of every Shire 40 days before they meet; upon which the Shires and Burroughs meet about their Elections. Every man that holds Lands of the Crown, that in the Rolls of the Taxation (the ancient Name of Subſidies or Aſſeſſments) are valued at 40 ſhillings <hi>Scotiſh</hi> mony of Taxation to the King, which will be in real value about Ten pounds Sterling a year, is an Electour, and may be Elected, ſo he be rightly veſted in the Land, or (according to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> terms) infeoft and ſeiſed, and be not at the King's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46492:21"/>
Horn, (that is, under an Outlawry.) The Electours ſubſcribe the Commiſſions they give, and ſo their Commiſſioner is returned: and if there be croſs Elections, the Parliament is the onely Judge. In the Burroughs the Common-Council of the Town makes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
            <p>When the day comes in which the Parliament is to be held, the <hi>Regalia,</hi> the Crown, Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and the Sword of State, which are kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> are brought down in State to the King's Palace, and are to be carried by three of the ancienteſt Earls that are upon the place, bare-headed, before the King or His Commiſſioner. In the great Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King's Palace all the Members of Parliament do mount on Horſeback with Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Burgeſſes ride firſt, the Commiſſioners of the Shires next; then the Lords, Viſcounts, and Earls, in their Robes, the laſt of whom do carry the <hi>Regalia,</hi> the Lion Herauld, with ſome Heraulds and Purſevants riding before the Honours; laſt of all, when the King is preſent in perſon, rides the Lord Chancellour, bearing the Great Seal: but this is not done before a Commiſſioner. After theſe rides the King or His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, with the High Conſtable (who is by Inheritance the Earl of <hi>Arroll</hi>) on his right hand, with a white Batton on his hand; and the great Mariſchal (who is alſo by Inheritance the Earl <hi>Mariſchal</hi>) on his left hand, with a ſilver Batton in his hand. If the King be preſent in perſon, the Marqueſſes and Dukes ride after the Earls; but if His Commiſſioner onely be there, they follow him at ſome diſtance. At the outward Gate of the Parliament-houſe they all alight off their horſes, and the Earl Mariſchal receives and conducts the King to the inner Gate, where he is received by the High Conſtable, and led into the Houſe where the Parliament is held. The Throne is raiſed ſix ſteps high, with a State over it; and there the King, or the Commiſſioner in His abſence, ſits. And in the firſt ſtep under him, on a Bench, ſits the Lord Chancellour, with other Officers of State on both hands of him. In the next ſtep under theſe ſit the Lords of Seſſion, or Judges. On the right hand of the Throne is the Biſhops Bench, that riſes up three ſteps and rows of Benches. On the higheſt the two Archbiſhops ſit, and in the lower ſteps ſit the Biſhops according to the dignity of their Sees. On the left hand of the Throne there is another great Bench of three ſteps and rows of Benches, on which ſit the Nobility ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their precedency. In the middle of the Floor there are two Tables; on the one of them the <hi>Regalia</hi> are laid, and in two great Chairs by them ſit the Conſtable and the Mariſchal: at the other Table ſits the Lord Clerk of Regiſters with his Deputy-Clerks, who are the Clerks of the Parliament. There are alſo Fourms placed on the floor: thoſe on the right ſide are for the Commiſſioners of the Shires, and thoſe on the left hand are for the Commiſſioners of the Burroughs.</p>
            <p>When all are placed, the Parliament is fenced (as the phraſe is) in the King's Name. Then the King ſpeaks to them, (if He be preſent,) ſitting in His Robes, with the Crown on His Head, all ſtanding up bare-headed: but when a Commiſſioner repreſents Him, he is in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sute, and ſtands and ſpeaks alſo bare-headed, (nor is the Commiſſioner covered but when there is pleading at the Bar, but continues bare-headed, as all the Members are,) and tells them the reaſon for which they are called together; which is enlarged upon by the Lord Chancellour. Then they goe about the chuſing of the Lords of the Articles, who are Eight for every State, who have been choſen in different ways. Sometimes the Biſhops did chuſe the eight Lords of the Nobility, and the Nobility eight for the Biſhops; at other times the Biſhops did chuſe their own eight, and the Nobility their eight: but now it is ſettled by an Act of Parliament, that the King or His Commiſſioner names eight of the Biſhops, the Lords chuſe eight for themſelves: and thoſe ſixteen do chuſe eight Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for the Shires, and as many Commiſſioners for the Burroughs. Theſe Thirty two are the Committee of Parliament to prepare Matters. When a Bill is drawn by them, it is brought into the Parliament. And anciently all theſe Bills were brought in the laſt day of Parliament, on which the Members ride in the ſame State as they do the firſt day: and the Bills being read, they were put to the Vote of Parliament, and either were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or not: and then being approved, were preſented to the King, who by touching them with the Sceptre gave His Aſſent to them, which alſo is done by His Commiſſioner in His abſence; if he refuſed to touch them, they were of no force. But of late times matters have been at full length and freely debated in Parliament. They ſit all in one Houſe, and every one anſwers diſtinctly to his Name, and gives his Vote, which is in theſe Terms, <hi>I approve,</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> onely thoſe who are not ſatisfied one way or another. ſay, <hi>Non liquet</hi>; which is a great eaſe to thoſe who are conſciencious, and a common refuge to the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Politician: the major Vote carries it. No Diſſents or Proteſts are allowed in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46492:22"/>
publick Acts, but are accounted treaſonable; but in private Acts, that relate to mens Properties and Rights, any one may proteſt for his Intereſt. After all buſineſs is ended, the King or His Commiſſioner makes a Speech to them, and diſſolves them.</p>
            <p>A Convention of Eſtates is made up of the ſame Members that conſtitute a Parliament, but can make no Laws; onely that can lay Impoſitions on the Subjects: they do not ſit in ſtate, and have been moſt uſed before the Kings were Crowned. The Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is Preſident in both theſe Courts, and the Votes are taken and numbered by the Clerk of Regiſters. And whatever Acts are paſſed in Parliament or Convention, are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſoon after their Diſſolution at the publick Mercat-Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Herauld, (who is at preſent Sir <hi>Charles Erskin</hi> of <hi>Cambo,</hi>) with a great deal of ſtate and Ceremony;<note place="margin">Par. 8. Jac. 6 cap. 130</note> after which they are obligatory on the Subjects. And ſo much for the Parlaiment and the Three Eſtates, whoſe Authority is ſupreme: and it is Enacted, <hi>that none of the Lieges ſhall preſume to impugn the Dignity and Authority of the Three Eſtates, or to ſeek or procure the Innovation or Diminution of the Power and Authority of the ſame Three Eſtates, or any of them, in time coming, under the pain of Treaſon.</hi>

            <p>The Supreme Court of Judicature about the Property of the Subject is called the <hi>Colledge of Juſtice,</hi> or the <hi>Seſſion</hi>; which was anciently an ambulatory Court, but was ſettled as it now is by King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 1532. to conſiſt of fourteen, who are called <hi>Senatours of the Colledge of Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Lords of Councill and Seſſion,</hi> and a Preſident; to whom are added the Lord Chancellour, and four extraordinary Lords, who are of the chief Nobility. The extraordinary Lords have no Salary, and are not obliged to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but when they come, they have a Vote. This Court ſits from the firſt of <hi>June</hi> till the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> and from the firſt of <hi>November</hi> till <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-Eve, and from the firſt of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> till the laſt of <hi>February</hi>: they ſit from 9 a clock in the Morning till 12, all the days of the Week except Sunday and Monday. There is an Outer Houſe, and an Inner. In the Outer there is a Bench, where one of the Senatours ſits a Week, (and all of them except the Preſident have their turns in it,) who hears all Cauſes originally; and where the Caſe is clear, he gives Sentence: But if it be difficult, or if either party deſires it, he reports it to the reſt of the Senatours; who either ſend out their Anſwer by him, or if it be very intricate, and the parties or either of them deſire it, do appoint it to be heard before themſelves. This is a Court of great diſpatch. But beſides the Judge on the Bench, there is a Side-Bar, to which one of the Judges comes out weekly by turns, as in the former, and receives and anſwers all Petitions and Bills. The Inner Houſe, where all the reſt of the Senatours ſit, is a Court of great State and Order. The Senatours ſit in a ſemicircle in Robes: under them ſit their Clerks, who write the moſt material heads of all that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the Bar, where the Pleadings are long and very learned. When the Senatours have (after all the parties are removed) reconſidered their Arguments, they give their Sentence, and the major Vote carries it. Their final Sentence determines the buſineſs, there lying no Appeal from them, (onely the Parliament, as the Supreme Court, may review and repeal their Sentence:) and they are called <hi>Decreets,</hi> from the Latin <hi>Decreta.</hi>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:46492:23"/>No man can have a Right to any Eſtate but by his being ſeiſed of it, which is done by the delivery of Earth and Stone; upon which an Inſtrument is formed called a <hi>Saſine,</hi> and this muſt be regiſtred within 60 days, otherwiſe it is of no force: by which means all ſecret Conveyances are cut off: for if no Saſine be paſſed upon them, or if theſe be not put in the publick Regiſters, (which every one may ſearch,) the Conveyance is of no force.</p>
            <p>All Bonds have a Clauſe in them for inſerting them in the publick Regiſters; and they being regiſtred, without any farther action, by a charge of ſix days the Debitor muſt make payment, otherwiſe Writs called <hi>Letters of Horning, Caption and Poynding,</hi> are given out: by the firſt of which the party is under Outlawry and Rebellion, and forfeits to the King his perſonal Eſtate; and if he continues a year under it, the Life-rent of his real Eſtate: in which the Creditor is to be preferred for his intereſt, the reſt goes into the Exchequer. By the Letters of Caption the party is ſeiſed on, and put in priſon: nor is his Houſe a place of ſecurity, but may be ſearched for him. By the Letters of Poynding the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Goods may be diſtrained, where-ever they can be found.</p>
            <p>A third Inſtance, to which I ſhall adde no more, is, that any Creditor may ſerve a Writ on his Debitor, called <hi>Letters of Inhibition,</hi> by which he can make no Diſpoſition of his Goods or Eſtate, till the party be ſatisfied; and all is null that he does after that, if theſe Letters be returned and regiſtred within 21 days after they are ſerved, otherwiſe they have no force.</p>
            <p>The next Supreme Court is the <hi>Juſtice Court,</hi> where all Criminals are tried. It conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted anciently of a Lord Juſtice General, and a Lord Juſtice Clerk, who was his Aſſiſtent. The Earls of <hi>Argile</hi> had this Office by Inheritance: but King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt agreed with the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and gave him the hereditary Juſticiarſhip in the <hi>High-lands,</hi> for which he laid down his Pretenſions to the other. The Juſtice General is not bound to ſerve in perſon, but might doe it by Deputies, and he commonly named two: but the Parliament changed this <hi>Anno</hi> 1669. and appointed four of the Judges to ſit in this Court with the Lord Juſtice General and the Lord Juſtice Clerk. All Trials for Life are in this Court, which ſits every Friday in the time of Seſſion in the afternoon. Here all the Subjects, Peers as well as Commons, are tried: nor is there any difference between the Trial of a Peer and of a Commoner, but that the greater part of the Peers Jury (called by the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Law an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize</hi>) muſt be Peers. Fifteen make a Jury. The Foreman, who is called the <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Aſſize,</hi> gathers and reports their Votes: the major Vote determines the matter. The preſent Juſtice General is the Earl of <hi>Murray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Supreme Court is the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> That conſiſts of the Lord Treaſurer, (or the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, when it is in Commiſſion,) the Lord Treaſurer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, and ſome Aſſiſtents, called the <hi>Lords of Exchequer,</hi> who have little power, the Lord Treaſurer and the Lord Treaſurer Deputy carrying all matters in it as they pleaſe. Here all the King's Grants, Penſions, Gifts of Wards, Letters Patents, and ſuch like, are to be paſſed.</p>
            <p>And theſe are the Supreme Civil Courts.</p>
            <p>The Seat of thoſe Courts is <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which has been long the chief Seat of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and though the making of Circuits for giving Juſtice has been oft begun; yet the charge it puts the Country to is found a greater inconvenience, then the bringing up all their Affairs to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to theſe Supreme Courts there are other inferiour Courts. And,</p>
            <p>Firſt, there are many Regalities in the Kingdom, where the Lord of the Regality has a Royal Juriſdiction within his grounds, and power of Life and death, beſides many other great Immunities and Privileges. This began chiefly in Church-Lands; for all the Biſhops and moſt of the Abbots had theſe Regalities granted them: ſome of the ancient and great Peers likewiſe got the ſame power beſtowed on them, but many more have lately got their Lands erected into Regalities.</p>
            <p>The Judge is called the <hi>Bailif of the Regality,</hi> who ſits as often as there is cauſe. Moſt of the Bailifs of the Biſhops are ſo by Inheritance; for theſe were given by the King, ſince a Church-man cannot give a Commiſſion <hi>in Cauſa Sanguinis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo in all the Shires of <hi>Scotland</hi> Sheriffs, who are the Judges in all matters of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> in Thefts, and in all leſſer Crimes, as likewiſe in Murthers, if the Murtherer be taken in hot bloud, as they call it, when the perſon is newly ſlain. But though there lies no Appeal in any Court in this Kingdom, yet there is ſomewhat equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to it; for the Supreme Courts by a Writ called an <hi>Advocation</hi> may take any Cauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46492:23"/>
out of the hands of inferiour Judges, and order it to be brought before themſelves.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the Sheriffs were anciently ſuch by Inheritance: and it being in this Kingdom no matter of charge, but of profit, it gave the Hereditary Sheriffs ſo great a power in their Shires, that our Kings of late have thought ſit to agree with many of thoſe Sheriffs for their Rights, by which it comes to paſs that divers of them are now in the King's gift. The Sheriffs may either ſit and give Judgment themſelves, or doe it by a Deputy; which they moſt commonly doe, except in ſome greater caſes.</p>

            <p>Beſides theſe, every man that holds a Barony of the King has a Baron-Court, in which leſſer matters are alſo judged, and they may Fine and Diſtrain. Anciently theſe Baron-Courts might judge of Life and death; but that is now out of uſe.</p>
            <p>For all the other particulars that relate to the Regalities, Superiorities, and other things of the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuch as are curious may find full ſatisfaction in that moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Work of <hi>Craigs de Jure Fendali,</hi> written in <hi>Latin,</hi> and Printed at <hi>Edinburgh in Folio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Military Government in <hi>Scotland</hi> of every County is not lodged in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the Regiments of Foot are commanded by Colonels, and the Troups of Horſe by Captains, named by the King, without any dependence upon one Lord Lieutenant: nor are there Deputy-Lieutenants, but the Lieutenant-Colonels and other Officers are named by the King, as is uſual in an Army.</p>
            <p>The Court of Admiralty ſits in <hi>Leith,</hi> the chief Sea-port of this Kingdom; but has not much buſineſs, except in times of War to judge of Prizes. The preſent High Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is His Royal Highneſs, <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Burroughs of <hi>Scotland</hi> are of three ſorts; either Royal Burghs, Burghs of Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46492:24"/>
or Burghs of Barony. The former have Commiſſioners in Parliament, and beſides are a State apart, for they meet yearly in a Convention called the <hi>Convention of Burroughs,</hi> to which a Commiſſioner comes from every one of them. There they make Laws for themſelves about Trade, and other things relating to their Corporations. They hold theſe Meetings in a Circuit around the chief, or, as they call them, <hi>the Head Burghs:</hi> and at the end of one Convention, they name the time and place for the next.</p>
            <p>In theſe Burghs there is a Provoſt, who has the chief Power; and there are four Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs that are next to him in the Government: there is alſo a Dean of Gild, who is the chief Judge among the Merchants, likewiſe a Treaſurer, and a Common Council; the one half of which is choſen yearly by the Merchants, the other half by the Tradeſmen; who have likewiſe a Court of their own, in which there is one from every Trade, who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Deacon</hi> of the Trade, and a <hi>Deacon Conveener,</hi> who is their Preſident, and calls a Meeting of them when he pleaſes. Thoſe Deacons are choſen yearly by all the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their Trade, and have a little Juriſdiction over them. There are in moſt Burghs great Animoſities and Factions between the Merchants and Tradeſmen.</p>
            <p>The Burghs of Regality are the Towns where theſe Lords hold their Courts. The chief Magiſtrates are named by the Lord, the reſt they chuſe themſelves. They have alſo great Freedoms, little inferiour to the Royal Burghs; onely they have no Commiſſioners in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Burghs of Barony are Mercat-Towns, where the Lord of the Barony names ſome of their Magiſtrates, and the Corporation chuſes the reſt. In all theſe Burghs the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy is no matter of burthen nor charge, but of Power and Advantage; from whence ariſe great Factions almoſt in them all.</p>

Authour ſent over to the Printer, a Dedication of his Book to His moſt <hi>Sacred Majeſtie,</hi> at that time Prince of <hi>Wales:</hi> and the Copy of that Dedication, written with his own hand, is yet in the cuſtody of his Son, the Reverend <hi>James Gordon,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Rothinay.</hi> Thus much I thought fit to ſay in vindication of that worthy Gentleman, who was one of the moſt learned perſons of the Age he lived it.</item>

                  <hi>Dempſter,</hi> in his <hi>Apparatus</hi> to the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Hiſtory, has promiſed a great many things to the World which he never performed: ſome have thought, that he onely amuſed people by the undertaking he mentions in that Book: Others believe that he knew of a great many <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Manuſcripts beyond the Seas, which were carried thither by Monks and Friers at the Reformation. In moſt Religious houſes there was a Chronicle written of the times, divers of which I have ſeen, that yet remain in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome written in rithme, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> ſome in proſe: but there cannot be much made out of them, they being full of Legends and Idle ſtories. There are beſides, very conſiderable Manuſcripts in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that relate to private Families; but give an account of ſeveral publick Tranſactions: as, the Hiſtory of the Families of the <hi>Drummonds,</hi> the <hi>Gordons,</hi> &amp;c. But for a publick Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Kingdom, there is little more to be expected of paſt times, then what hath been already publiſhed: for as when <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt conquered <hi>Scotland,</hi> he carried the Records and Regiſters of that Kingdom with him to <hi>London,</hi> ſo in the late Invaſion, <hi>Cromwell</hi> thought it a very valuable pledge of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation to ſend up to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> all the publick Records, Rolls, and Regiſters of the Kingdom, which lay there till His MAJESTY's happy Reſtauration: after which, by the KING's Orders, they were ſent down by Sea, to be laid up in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; but the Ship that was loaded with them was caſt away near the Holy Iſland. So they were all irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſunk and loſt: Therefore we muſt rely upon the credit of our ancient Hiſtorians, ſince there are no means left to correct them by.</item>
