            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THere is no ingenious man that is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the Curioſities to be met with in the World, who hath not either ſeen ſom</hi> Tranſmutation of Metals, <hi>or at leaſt heard ſo many witneſs that they have ſeen it; as to be perſwaded that there is ſuch Thing as the</hi> Philoſophers-Stone, <hi>or</hi> Powder of Projection. <hi>Only there he ſome great men (as his Highneſs Prince</hi> Rupert, <hi>who hath ſeen the Projection at</hi> Frankfort, <hi>in</hi> Germany) <hi>who ſeem to queſtion whether ſuch Pouder or</hi> Tincture <hi>is prepared with Profit. But this Doubt is hereby now fully cleared and reſolv'd, from the great quantity of this</hi> Tincture <hi>left buried by the Abbot Founder of the Church it was found in: (as this</hi> Relation <hi>informs you) for it is not credible that the Abbot was Maſter, before</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45810:3"/>
               <hi>he had done the Work, of ſuch an immenſe Treaſure, as he must needs have had to draw ſo much</hi> Tincture <hi>from: which could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted (if the Preparation thereof is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profit,) from a leſſer quantity of Gold than it gives or yield again in the</hi> Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>ſo that the ſame quantity of Gold as it yields again muſt have bin ſpoiled to make it; which it is not credible an Abbot of</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>was Master of, as is ſaid. And, for the Truth of this Relation, beſides that, it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested by many men of great Quality, good parts, Probity, and Modeſty, by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror himſelf; by Count</hi> Walleſtein <hi>who was Reſident here a year ago; and by Dr.</hi> Becher <hi>at preſent in this City. It is ſo publickly known through all parts of</hi> Germany, <hi>chiefly about</hi> Vienna <hi>where this was tranſacted, that to doubt, or deny it, were as abſurd, as if one denyed that the West-Indies have bin found out of late years, or that there be ſhips at Sea, becauſe he hath ſeen neither.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:45810:4"/>

Whence I am glad to Obſerve, That all the Fryers are not quite ſo black as ſome make them; and to ſee that among them, as well as among other Sects ſome good men are to be found who make Conſcience of an Oath, and keep it tho to their loſs.

            <p>And in order thereunto, he did not ſcruple to learn the Magick Art, if any one had been ready to inform him therein: wherein Fortune ſeemed to favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, for there was an old Woman, a Cow-keepers wife, living before the Gate of the Town, and Fortreſs, who was skilful therein, and he came to be acquainted with her upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The yonger Monks and Students, as they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are allowed ſome ſet daies, every week, to walk out of the Gates of the City, to enjoy the open Air and to refreſh their minds, ſuppoſed to be wearied with ſtudy; In theſe Relaxations one Company diſperſed it ſelf here, another there, as they think fit for their Divertiſment. But Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> (for ſo I ſhall hereafter call him) made uſe of this Occaſion, alwayes to viſit the ſaid old woman, and upon the pretence of drinking New milk, to interogate her concerning her Art. And in a ſhort time he got ſo much into her Favour as to obtain from her a ſmall Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball marked with certain Figures or Characters, which was of that Virtue, That, if it was laid upon the Ground, it would preſently run to the place where any Treaſure was hid: (This Ball I afterwards ſaw often in his Cuſtody, and handled it with my hands.)</p>
            <p>It happened afterwards, That, as the Cuſtom is for the old Fathers when they grow weak, to have ſome young Fryers to aſſiſt them; ſo, Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> was aſſigned to attend an ancient Father, who was a Cabaliſt, and a lover of Magick, in which ſtudies, at any Vacancies, he ſpent his time. He often told Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> That there was a Vaſt Treaſure hid in the Church of their Monaſtery; to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45810:5"/>
whom <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> replyed. That he had got a Ball which, he was aſſured, had the Virtue to diſcover hidden Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And, thereupon he ſhewed him the Ball, and the Characters impreſſed thereon, which the old Father did ſeriouſly conſider, and much valued them.</p>
            <p>A while after, as they two were walking alone in the Church, afore day, after Mattens, they Tryed the Ball, by laying it down in ſeveral Places, but found no effect; At laſt, placing it near a certain Pillar old and ruinous, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew its Efficacy and Virtue by its often running thereto: This they Interpreted for a certain Indication, That the Treaſure was there hid; but how to come at it was the Queſtion. They had neither Leave, Means nor Opportunity to break down this ſtony ſtructure, neither did they certainly know at what height or deph thereof the Treaſure was laid in it. So that upon theſe Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements they were forced to let it alone.</p>
            <p>But it happened afterwards, That, a great Tempeſt ariſing, The whole Church, and eſpecially this decayed Pillar, was ſo ſhaken and ſpoiled, that to prevent its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Abbot was neceſſitated to order it to be demoliſhed. And in regard the old Father, whom Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> attended, had skill in Architecture, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Infirmities could not be otherwiſe ſerviceable to the Monaſtery, he was therefore appointeed to overſee the Maſons; which Office he and his Aſſiſtant Fryer <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlaus</hi> did willingly undertake, and were very ſedulous in theit Attendance, and diſcharge thereof. When the Pillar was almoſt all pulled own, They found therein a Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box, of a reaſonable bigneſs, which the old Father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſnatch'd up and carryed it into his Cloyſter, and immediately opened it: Where, at the Top, he found a piece of Parchment, on which there was ſome Inſcription and Writing: I once had a Copy of it, but I loſt it amongſt my other Letters; But this I remember, It contained the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45810:6"/>
number of the years wherein the Church was built, and the Name of the Abbot the Founder thereof, who had been an Envoye at <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> I do alſo remember, That amongſt other Writings, there was this Motto, AMICE, TIBI SOLI, which I Engliſh thus, <hi>Friend, to thy ſelf alone.</hi> Under this Parchment there were other Letters laid, marked with Characters, which contained Directions how to multiply the Powder, as the Inſcription ſhewed: and under them there were four Boxes full of a red Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>When the Boxes were opened, Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> was quite out of Heart, having loſt his preconceived hope of ſome great Treaſure therein: for he verily believed that, if there were not old <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieces of Gold yet ſome Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or other precious ſtones muſt have been lodged there. And finding no ſuch thing, but four Boxes of darkiſh colored Powder, he was ſo impatient at the Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that, if he had been the ſole Manager of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he had thrown away Boxes, Powder and all: For at that time he was ſo little acquainted with Chymiſtry, that ſo much as the Name was not known to him, and he had ſcarce heard of the word <hi>Tincture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the old Father was not ſo Tranſported, but told him, That perhaps ſome Medicinal Virtue was contained in the Powder, and that the Characters in the annexed Papers might poſſibly diſcover its Uſe, and therefore he was reſolved to ſtudy ſome Books, to find out what thoſe Characters meant: In the mean time he would carefully keep the Box.</p>
            <p>Not long after, The old Father ſent Fryer <hi>Wence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus</hi> into the Kitchin of the Monaſtery, to ſee if he could find an old Peuter diſh or Plate, which was no longer fit for uſe, and if he could, to bring it to him; which he accordingly did, who thereupon cauſed a Coal-fire to be made, and put a Crucible into Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> hand,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45810:6"/>
to place therein; This was the firſt Chymical Operation that ever Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> performed in all his Life, and for which he was ſo unfit, that he plac'd the Crucible up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, ſo that the old Father himſelf was forced to ſet it in its right Poſture. They put the Pewter Plate broken and folded together into the Crucible, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently melted, the Father took out ſome of the Pouder (ſo much as would lay upon the point of a Knife) which was in one of the four Boxes, and wrapping it in a little wax, he caſt it into the Crucible upon the Pewter, and commanded his Aſſiſtant Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> to blow up the Fire, adding theſe Words, <hi>Now I ſhall ſee whether I have well decyph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red the Characters, and whether I have found out the uſe of this Pouder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as ever the Powder was caſt in, the Pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtood ſtill, came to a ſuddain Congelation. Then the Fire was ſuffered to go out, and the Crucible to wax cold, which being broken, there was found a ponderous maſs of Metals, very yellow and variegated with red lines: Upon which the Father made Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> to go out into the Town, upon pretence of getting a Book to be bound, and wiſhed him to go to ſome Gold-ſmith, and ſhew him this Maſs of Metal, alleadging to him, That he had ſome ancient Roman Coins of Gold, which he had melted down, but for want of a ſufficient Fire and other Defects, he had not done it exactly; and therefore he deſired the Gold-ſmith to melt it over again, and caſt it in an Ingot; The Gold-ſmith gratified him therein, and Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> at the Command of the Father took off a ſmall piece, which he Preſerved, and then asked the Gold-ſmith, What the reſt was worth? Who, after he had weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tryed on the Touchſtone, did value it at Twenty Ducats (which are worth two Crowns a piece) at which Rate Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> ſold it to him, and receiving the Money, returned joyfully home. The old Father did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45810:7"/>
deſire the remaining Portion of the Gold, which he had reſerved, but ſuffered Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> to injoy the Ducats, yet with this Advice, That he ſhould diſcover it to none in the Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>But Fryer <hi>Werceſlaus,</hi> though he had not been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ſo much Money a long time, was not ſatisfied therewith, but entertained various thoughts in his mind, whether he ſhould by Flight free himſelf from that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and Slavery he was in, whileſt he had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſo much Caſh? Or elſe, whether he ſhould ſtay ſo long there, till either by Flattery or Craft, he had got the Copper Boxes from the old Father. To the firſt of theſe Cogitations he was edg'd on, by the eagerneſs of that Deſire he had to leave the Monaſtery: But then, the great Heap of Gold which he might make with the Powder, as he well conjectured, if he could get it into his hands, did ſomewhat abate his Fervor, and perſwade him to ſtay. For, though he was yet altogether ignorant of Chymiſtry, yet the precedent Tryals had given him ſo much Light, That he was fully perſwaded, The Box con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and was worth a vaſt Treaſure; and, though at that time, the Rareneſs of the Powder, and the multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it had very ſmall Influence upon his Thoughts: yet, becauſe he had a ſhare in finding of it out, by means of his Ball, he therefore thought that half of it at leaſt did belong to him.</p>
            <p>But there was another thing which more perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind, and that was the Fear, That the old Father, either out of a Principle of Devotion, or of Vain-Glory, ſhould diſcover the whole ſtory of the Buſineſs to the Abbot, and by that means ſhould make away all the Pouder: and he was rather inclined to theſe Cogitations, becauſe he had obſerved, That the Father, who before had been more remiſs in hiding the Box, now of late was ſo ſolicitous to preſerve it, that he kept it continually in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45810:7"/>
his Desk, and ſcarce ever ſtirred from it, except when he was to go to Church with Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being moved with theſe Conſiderations, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to demand boldly ſome Quantity of this Powder of the old man? The Anſwer he received, was, That he was yet too young to know how to diſpoſe of, and to keep well this Powder: beſides, he wanted no Money whilſt he was in the Monaſtery; and, if he ſhould procure a ſumm by means of this Powder, in his preſent Condition, it would be very prejudicial both to his Soul and body, and he might become thereby of all men moſt miſerable: Moreover (proceeds the Father) This Powder may have many other Virtues and Operations which are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known both to you and me, and therefore I will farther ſtudy the Writings annexed to it, and hereafter I will be mindful of you, but at preſent I will not part with any of the Powder, only you ſhall have every week two Crowns allowed for your Divertiſements: thus the Father; But this fair ſtory ſounded not well in the Fryers ears, who had a private Deſign (unknown to the oldFather) to leave the Monaſtery</p>
            <p>In the Interim it happen'd, That as they two were returning from Mattens, early in the Morning, the old Father complain'd of a Cold he had got, &amp; a great Rheum in his head, and deſired Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> to go to the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and fetch him a Cup of Sack, he did ſo, and upon his Return he found the Father taken with a Fit of an Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy, and Speechleſs: whereupon, the firſt thing he did was to find out the Key of his Desk, and taking from thence the Copper Box, he carryed it to his own Cell, and hid it there. This being done, he rang the Bell in the Fathers Cell to call up the Monks, who came flying with all Diligence to bring him ſome Remedies, but they were all too late the Father being quite dead: Hereupon his Desk was preſently ſealed up, and ſolemn Ceremonyes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45810:8"/>
to the occaſion were performed over his dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But who more inwardly joyful than Fryer <hi>Wenceſlans,</hi> from whom Death had removed his Rival, and made him to be Maſter of all the whole Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he began to deliberate with himſelf how he might make his Eſcape out of the Monaſtery with moſt Safety and leaſt Suſpicion. But herein many Difficuties did accrew: He was grown a little deboiſt and prodigal by the Opportunity of the 20 Ducats abovementioned, which he had to ſpend; and by that means he had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Emulation of his Fellow Fryers, who did urge the Pryor and Superiour, That, the old Father being now dead, and ſo Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> diſcharged from his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him, he ſhould for the Future be bound to a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter Diſcipline, both in reference to his Studies, as alſo to his frequenting the Church. Moreover his Ducats were all ſpent, and no opportunity offerd to make another Tryal, or if he had, he could not have ſold the Product of it.</p>
            <p>In this Anxiety he reſolved to open his mind to another Monk, a Comrade of his, one Fryer <hi>Francis Preyhauſen,</hi> That ſo they might mutually conſult together what was beſt to be done: for you muſt know this Fryer was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> as having entred into the Colledge at the ſame time; and, being alſo a young man, was weary of a Monaſtical life, as well as he.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were in Conſult, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a Solemn Diſputation in the School of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Where among other <hi>Theſes,</hi> Fryer <hi>Francis,</hi> under a Moderator, was obliged to maintain, That Mettals can not be tranſmuted: And it chanced to be the turn of Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> to be the then Opponent: But, as he had made no great Proficiency in his Studies, ſo Fryer <hi>Francis</hi> eaſily bafled him, and expoſed him to the laughter of the Auditory; ſo that in a great Paſſion he broke out into theſe Words, <hi>VVhy do you laugh? I can practically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45810:8"/>
               <hi>the thing to be true?</hi> To whom the Moderator with great Indignation, anſwer'd; <hi>Hold thy peace, thou Aſs, wilt thou alſo be an Alchymiſt? I ſhall ſooner be able to turn thee into an Ox, than thou to tranſmute the Metals.</hi> Herewith Fryer <hi>Wence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus</hi>'s mouth was ſtop'd.</p>
            <p>When the Diſputation was over, Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> took occaſion to confer with Fryer <hi>Francis;</hi> when they two were alone together in the Garden belonging to the Monaſtery, Fr. <hi>Francis</hi> thus accoſted him, <hi>You have this day publickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Diſputation,</hi> That you were able to tranſmute Metals; <hi>'Twas unadviſedly ſpoken of you, whether it be true or falſe; if it be true, and it come to the Abbot's ear, you will not enjoy your Liberty very long: Beſides, there is a great muttering in the Monastery, That the old Father and your ſelf, found a Treaſure in the Church, and, That the Maſons ſaw a Copper box, and that a Monk of the</hi> Auguſtine <hi>Order ſold ſome Gold to a Goldſmith, and that you did take from the Kitchin a Pewter plate; Moreover, the ſuddain Death of the old Father is not without ſome Suſpicion; and altho you may alledg, That the money was ſent you by your Friends, and it were true, that they did ſend you ſome, yet it being probable that ſome came another way, for which and other reflections, you would never ſcape Scot-free out of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, 'twas well the Moderator took you for a Buffle-head. But, if what you have affirmed be falſe, you do ill again that way, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that which you are not able to demonſtrate. I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly deſire you to declare unto me, as to your intimate Friend, the whole truth of this Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> fell down at his Feet, humbly beſeeching him to ſwear not to diſcover what he ſhould reveal to him, but to afford him his help and aſſiſtance, and then he would diſcloſe that to him, which, upon their ſtealing away from the Monaſtery, would procure great wealth to them both, and advance them to high Dignities; and that they would equally ſhare the Happineſs between them, and run alike hazard in all things. In a word, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45810:9"/>
Bargain was ſoon made, and they without loſs of time, went into F. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Cell, where they took their mutual Oaths one to another. And then F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> declared the whole Intregue and the procedure thereof to F. <hi>Frar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> withal deſiring him upon the firſt occaſion to go into the City to buy there a pound of Lead, which being brought to him, he chang'd it into Gold, obſerving the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod the old Father had obſerved before: The tranſmuted Gold was carryed back by F. <hi>Francis</hi> into the City, and there ſold to a Jew, for an 100 Ducats, though it were worth more, his pretence was as the former, that it was melted down out of ancient Coin and Meddals. Having receiv'd this Money, and thus made a ſtrict League and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with F. <hi>Francis,</hi> and the Art being now found true for the ſecond time, they were more intent upon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Eſcaping out of the Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>But that which retarded their Reſolution, was the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, it being then Winter; and a very hard one too, for they well underſtood, that they could not then ſafely take ſo long a Journey as they were to undergo, if they would by their Flight elude the ſearch, (which would be made without doubt with all diligence poſſible after them) and avoid the puniſhment uſually inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch an occaſion. Hereupon they thought it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to deferr their intended flight till the Spring fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and they were the rather induced thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had found means to paſs that time merrily, by getting now and then a Cup of Wine, and a couple of roaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pullets, which F. <hi>Francis</hi> (who was well verſt in that Trade) knew well how to get, and to convey into their Chamber. But becauſe F. <hi>Wencelaus</hi> had as great a mind to taſte of Womens Fleſh as of that of Poultry: and had lighted on a certain <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Drab fit for his purpoſe, he cauſed therefore ſome mans Apparel, with a Periwig, and ſutable Accoutrements to be made ready for her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45810:9"/>
Having thus diſguiſed her Sex, they gave her the Name of Seignior <hi>Anaſtaſio,</hi> &amp; ſhe came often to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, on pretence, That ſhe came from <hi>Vienna,</hi> to viſit her Coſin F. <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> pretending he was her Kinſman; this laſted a while, but the Viſits of this Seignior <hi>Anaſtaſio</hi> was ſo frequent, that at laſt, he was obſerved to come into the Monaſtery ſometimes, and not to go out again, by reaſon of his ſtaying all night in the Cell of F. <hi>Wence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus,</hi> who did thus live for ſome weeks in diſhoneſt Love with him: and, when he went either to the School or to the Church, he alwayes carefully carryed his Key with him.</p>
            <p>But a matter of that Nature could be kept cloſe no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſome Rumour of it came to the Ear of the Abbot or Prior, ſo that one Morning as F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> was at Mattens before day, The Abbot demanded of him the Key of his Cell, which he was forc'd to deliver, (but how willingly, any one may gueſs.) The Abbot immediately, with the Pryor, and ſome other Monks went to his Cell and there found Seignior <hi>Anaſtaſio</hi> naked in the Bed.</p>
            <p>At this ſight there was a general Conſternation on all ſides, none knew what courſe to take, F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> his mind was more in his Chamber than in the Chappel can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out his Mattens; as for Seignior <hi>Anaſtaſio,</hi> ſhe was doubtleſs as much at a loſs; for, to run without her Cloaths out of the bed before ſuch venerable Company, was no wayes thought convenient, and, as for the good Prelates, they were alſo uncertain how to ſteer; ſome adviſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the matter to the Magiſtrate, that ſo <hi>Anaſtaſio</hi> might be thruſt out of the houſe by the Secular Power; others feared, That if they took that courſe, they ſhould dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from their Rights and Priviledges; and, if Seignior <hi>Anaſtaſio</hi> ſhould chance to be whipt, and to be put into the Stocks for diſſembling her ſex, the noiſe of ſuch a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45810:10"/>
thing would affix an indelable Character of Infamy upon their Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>After ſome Deliberation, they concluded, That preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Anaſtaſio</hi> ſhould put on her Clothes, and, after a ſevere Reprehenſion, ſhould be ejected out of the houſe, in the Morning before day. And, as for Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> he was called from Mattens, and ſhut up in his Cell, the doors being well bolted and barr'd on the outſide, until four Walls were prepared to encloſe him, which were already built, only ſomething was defective in the Door, which was ſupplyed the next day.</p>
            <p>Whilſt this was a doing, Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> found Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſecure his Copper Box, and to gather together the Pouder, and by means of a Rope to let them both down at a window to Fr. <hi>Francis,</hi> who ſtaid there on purpoſe to receive them; and withal he conveyed down a Letter to him, the Contents whereof was, To deſire the ſaid Fryer <hi>Francis</hi> not to forſake him in his Diſtreſs, but to uſe his utmoſt Endeavour to contrive a way for his Deliverance, withal minding him not to violate his Oath about the POWDER, but to keep it ſafe, for as yet, to his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, it was intire.</p>
            <p>The next day, Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> was kept Faſting, and in the evening his Back was ſcourg'd with many cruel laſhes, and afterwards he was ſhut up cloſe within four walls, and for a Month fed with nothing but bread and water; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, the Severity of the Stripes he underwent, the Diſaſter of Seignior <hi>Anaſtaſio,</hi> and the hazard of the loſs of his Powder did ſo afflict him, that he was even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deſpair; but this did ſomewhat relieve him, that he carried a ſtring with him into the Dungeon, and caſting it out at the hole, received ſometimes both Letters and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals from his Comrade F. <hi>Francis:</hi> and indeed the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Condition of Fr. <hi>Wencenſlaus</hi> did ſo affect his heart, that he bent all his Endeavour to excogitate ways how to free
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45810:10"/>
him; at laſt an happy opportunity offered it ſelf upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lichtenſtein</hi> was a great Favourer of Chymiſtry, and he had a Steward of his houſe at <hi>Bruna,</hi> to whoſe Friendſhip F. <hi>Francis</hi> had inſinuated himſelf, and by him ſent a Letter and ſome of the foreſaid Pouder to the Prince, in which he related the lamentable Condition of Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> and implored his Aid for his Deliverance.</p>
            <p>The Steward having ſent the Letter, and going to <hi>Felis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> the Princes ſeat, was ſcarce arrived but that the Prince beſtovved upon him a more profitable office than that which he had before, and this Meſſage concerning Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> was ſo favorably receiv'd, That he ſtrictly injoyned him to return ſpeedily to <hi>Bruna,</hi> and to aſſiſt Fr. <hi>Francis</hi> to the utmoſt in order to the Deliverance of Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus.</hi> And to that purpoſe he Committed his own Seal to his Cuſtody, to be made uſe of for that End, if there were occaſion.</p>
            <p>Thus the Steward returning home, did preſently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with F. <hi>Francis</hi> to deliver F. <hi>Wenceſlaus;</hi> and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from his Priſon and Cloyſter, to hide and ſhelter him a while in the houſe of his Maſter the ſaid Prince of <hi>Lichtenſtein:</hi> untill ſome convenient opportunity could be found for his paſſage out of the Town, and for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to the Prince of <hi>Felisburge.</hi> In order whereto Fr. <hi>Francis</hi> took Care to provide a falſe Key, fit to open the Dungeon, which he more eaſily did, becauſe the Padlock was on the outſide of the Door: and on a certain day, when Mattens were ended, he brought his Project to its deſired Effect, for he opened the Door, and took out Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus,</hi> locking the Door again; and diſguiſing him with a Cloak, Coat, and Periwig which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for that Purpoſe, he conveyed him through a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the Garden of the Monaſtery, to <hi>Lichteſtein</hi>'s Houſe, where he ſhut him up in a Chamber, locked the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45810:11"/>
door, and Sealed it up in two places with the Princes own Seal and a Labell appendant.</p>
            <p>The next day when the Monaſterys Porter, according to his Cuſtom, was carrying his Bread and Water, about noon, to F. <hi>VVenceſlaus,</hi> Lo, he was not to be found! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a great Tumult was raiſed in the Monaſtery, and from thence the News flew to the Count <hi>de Collebrat,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Precinct, who preſently commanded the Gates to be ſhut, and ſearch to be made in all houſes, not excepting <hi>Litchtenſtein</hi>'s houſe it ſelf. When they had diligently ſearched every Corner of this latter houſe, at laſt they came to the Chamber that was ſealed up: Here the Steward of the Houſe interpoſed, and told them, That that Room was the Cloſet of the Prince, which he had ſealed up himſelf with his own Seal, and therefore, it could not be opened without great danger and hazard of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his high Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Whereupon they deſiſted; and F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> remained hid there for ſome weeks, untill at length he found means, in a diſguiſe to eſcape out of the Town in the morning ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the very firſt opening of the Gates, and ſo was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, with other officers, in the Princes own Coach, to <hi>Felisburgh.</hi> Being arrived there, he was courteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and well treated by the Prince, before whom he made a notable demonſtration of his Art.</p>
            <p>But the Prince ſoon found, that a man in his Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and of his Abilities, could not be long concealed in his Court, becauſe the Abbot of <hi>Bruna</hi> having ſent Spies after him, would certainly find him out, and would alſo obtain a Mandate from the ſupream Conſiſtory at <hi>Vienna</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Whereupon (though, as ſome think, the Princes Intent was to gain the whole Tincture from him) he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there obtain a full Diſcharge from his Monaſtical life, and to ſecure himſelf from the Abbot, which favour he profered to obtain for him by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45810:11"/>
means of his Agent there: And to accommodate him for his Journey, he gave him a Bill of Exchange for 1000 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and withal provided an <hi>Italian,</hi> his Chamberlain, to bear him Company on his way.</p>
            <p>But you muſt know Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> had ſent away his Comrade Fr. <hi>Francis</hi> (who privately had made an Eſcape) to <hi>Vienna</hi> with the Tincture enjoyning him to get him a private Loding there, to abſcond himſelf for a while, till he could commodiouſly contrive his Journey to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the <hi>Italian</hi> Chamberlain and he began their Journey, and when they were about half a Daies Journey from <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Chamberlain on a ſuddain pick'd a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with him, and holding a Piſtol to his Breaſt, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to kill him, unleſs he would deliver him the Tincture.</p>
            <p>F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> being thus unexpectedly aſſaulted, was much abaſhed, and calling God to Witneſs, proteſted, That the Tincture was not, for the preſent, in his hands, but that he had ſent it before by his Companion F. <hi>Francis</hi> to <hi>Vienna</hi> whom the ſaid Chamberlain had himſelf ſeen to undertake that Journey a few daies before.</p>
            <p>The Chamberlain was the rather induced to believe his aſſeveration, becauſe upon Search both of him and his Portmantle, he found nothing at all of the Tincture therein. Hereupon, They came to Terms between them, F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> was to give the Chamberlain 100 Ducats, and an <hi>Amneſty</hi> to be for their ſuddain falling out, and ſo they agreed and bid one another, Farewell.</p>
            <p>The Chamberlain, being a Covetous <hi>Italian,</hi> was glad of the Money, and F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> was glad to be rid of him, having eſcaped ſuch an hazard, and being now likely to attain <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he arrived in the Evening of the ſame day, and told his Companion F. <hi>Francis</hi> what had hapned to him in every Circumſtance, upon the way. He being a ſubtle man, did eaſily perceive by his Relation, what vvas the Myſtery of his deſigned Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45810:12"/>
and that his Bill of Exchange was but a meer Colluſion, whereupon they both reſolved to take another courſe for their ſafety, in order whereto, by means of a Saxon whoſe name was <hi>Gorits,</hi> a crafty fellow, and a Clerk in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they came acquainted with one Count <hi>Schlick,</hi> a perſon of great ſagacity, then living at <hi>Vienna,</hi> a great Favourer of Chymiſtry, but had lately received ſome affronts from the Court, he was very glad of their acquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and preſently took F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> into his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brought him to his Houſe, where he made ſome Tryalls, and withal gave him ſome of the Tincture, that he himſelf might make one.</p>
            <p>But as for F. <hi>Francis,</hi> he always lodged abroad. After ſome Weeks, Count <hi>Schlick</hi> told F. <hi>VVenceſlaus,</hi> that he could no longer ſecure him after that rate at <hi>Vienna,</hi> for both the Clergy and alſo the Prince of <hi>Lichtenſtein,</hi> had an ill Eye upon him, for his ſake; and being already disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at Court, he ſhould run a further hazard, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing of him nevertheleſs he would ſhew him what courteſy he could, and if he pleaſed, he would ſend him to one of his own Country-Houſes and Caſtles in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where he might remain in greater ſecurity, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he prepared all things for the Journey. F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> did eaſily perceive the intention of the Count, for before he had obſerved, that the Counts Footmen did obſerve him as narrowly as the Monks had done in the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and therefore perceiving what was to be done with him, he made his Eſcape through an Arch in the Wine Cellar, built after the <hi>Italian</hi> faſhion, the day before he was to go to <hi>Bohemia</hi> (a place deſigned for his perpetual Impriſonment) and retired to the lodging of his friend F. <hi>Francis,</hi> to whom having related what had hapn'd to him again, upon deliberation they both agreed to extricate themſelves out of all theſe hazards, and to acquaint the Emperour with the whole matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:45810:12"/>
And to introduce them into his preſence, they knew none more fit than a Spaniſh Count called <hi>de Paar</hi> (whoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named <hi>Peter,</hi> was <hi>Hereditary</hi> Poſt maſter, in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Hereditary Country) he was a great Alchymiſt, a Factious and Seditious man, and one much troubled with the Gout, yet he had found means to creep into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours favour: therefore this gain unlookt for was no leſs acceptable to him, than to the others before, for he had heard a great while before of F. <hi>VVenceſlaus,</hi> and had an extream paſſion to be acquainted with him, and fancied that he ſhould ſee ſtrange things in him, as King <hi>Herod</hi> did of Chriſt, whoſe firſt, he acted the part cunningly enough, as you ſhall preſently hear. They agreed together, that F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> ſhould abide <hi>Incognito</hi> at his Houſe, where he was as much obſerved as at the Houſe of Count <hi>Schtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he made another ſmall Tryal, whereupon Count <hi>Paar</hi> went to the Emperour, and diſcovered to him the whole Buſineſs. But his Imperial Majeſty who (by reaſon of the great &amp; weighty concerns of the Empire, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not much regard or value Learning, as his Father did, except what contributes to his Recreation, as Plays, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and the like, but alſo had a particular averſneſs from Alchymy, holding that for a meer Impoſter, which did coſt his Royal Father and his Uncle the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> ſo much expence, both of Mony and Time) gave no great heed to the Propoſition made by Count <hi>Paar,</hi> eſpecially it having been related to him, that this F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> was a fugitive Monk, and had led a diſſolute life; and moreover by Report was accuſed of Magick.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Count <hi>Paar</hi> having heard this Repartee of the Emperour, being a ſubtil man, and eaſily foreſeeing thoſe Objections would be made, had armed himſelf againſt them: upon which he thus replyed to his Imperial Majeſty; <hi>That he did confeſs, that there was a great weight in all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made by his Majeſty, yet without preſuming, being ſo means a perſon, to Impoſe upon his Imperial Majeſty, it ſeemed to him,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45810:13"/>
               <hi>that though the Caſe were extraordinary, yet nevertheleſs the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of common Reaſon were to be obeyed, which doth adviſe ſometimes to conſider of things, abſtracted from the perſons they concern, it being evident, that ſome men though ill in themſelves yet have been the Authors of Uſeful Inventions, of which Truth, Inſtances might be given near at hand, in regard his Imperial Majeſty had many notable Inventions in his Archieves, which owed their Originals to bad men, yea, ſome of them accuſed of the ſame miſcarriages as F.</hi> Wenceſlaus, <hi>and ſince it is true, that ſome good things are done by ſome bad men; it being no leſs true, that all men are Sinners, muſt we therefore reject all their laudable Inventions and all the good Works they do. A notable Example whereof</hi> (proceeded he) <hi>lyes as yet freſh before your Majeſty,</hi> Joſeph Burrhi <hi>was accuſed of Hereſy, and being taken at</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna, <hi>was ſent to</hi> Rome, <hi>but after Pennance, he was pardoned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcore of his knowledge, rather than of his perſon, and the</hi> Germans <hi>his Accuſers were by this means deceived; of which I my ſelf</hi> (ſays he) <hi>at that time being</hi> Burrhus <hi>his Commiſſary at</hi> Vienna, <hi>did forewarn them, but in vain. Your Majeſty</hi> (ſaid he farther) <hi>is a perſon, with whom God ſeems to deal after a peculiar manner, having wonderfully delivered you from many imminent dangers, and now in theſe neceſſitous and indigent times, cruel Warrs being alſo in proſpect, your Hereditary Countries being alſo exhauſted, the Divine Bounty ſeems to offer you a</hi> mean <hi>and way how you may moſt pitty and ſpare your Subjects: It is the Devils Policy to caſt ſuſpition upon all extraordinary Aſſiſtances, that ſo he may make them uſeleſs; but</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is as great a Sin not to accept of things when offered, as to abuſe them when they are accepted. As for my ſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have no great reaſon to be a Friend to Chymiſtry, having ſuffered ſo much leſs by it, as your Imperial Majeſty well knows, neither did I ever find any Truth in the Art, ſave only in this Pouder of F.</hi> Wenceſlaus, <hi>and the tranſmutation made thereby. But as in referrence to that Tryal, he dared pawn his Credit it would ſucceed; and if his Majeſty would not believe his word, yet he might depute ſome perſons to ſee a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:45810:13"/>
               <hi>made; for his part, he thought he was bound in Conſcience to diſcover the whole buſineſs to his Majeſty, referring it wholy to him, whether he would graciouſly accept the Propoſal and protect the perſon that made it, or elſe diſcard them both; ſtill hoping nevertheleſs, that his Majeſty would not take his good Intention in ill part, nor exclude him from his Favour; wiſhing for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That he would cauſe one Trial to be made under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of ſome perſons; unprejudiced, that ſo his Impertal Majeſty might be ſatisfied, at leaſt in this one thing, that he had not made the Propoſition to him without ſufficient reaſon:</hi> Thus he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Harangue. The Emperor, as he is gratious to all Suitors, ſo he gave favourable attention to the Counts diſcourſe, and commended him for it; <q>Only <hi>(ſaies he</hi> to the Count) Alchymy is a ſubtil Impoſture, and though you your ſelf may mean honeſtly, yet perhaps you alſo may be deceived thereby, otherwiſe I do not <hi>(adds he)</hi> at all deſpiſe the wonderful Works of God, but do highly value them, and accept of his Gift with all hearty thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and I do well know how long my Father took very great pains in that Art; and how highly he prized that little which was ſhewed him by the Baron <hi>Chaos,</hi> and rewarded him for it; beſides, I know full well how to make a diſtinction between the Art, and the life of its Profeſſors.</q> Only leaſt he ſhould expoſe himſelf, and ſhew himſelf too eaſy, he gave the Count order to make another Tryal, and to procure the Preſence of other skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſons both of the Clergy and Laity: That ſo he might make him a more exact Relation of the Matter with all the Circumſtan e, and receive further order of his Majeſty concerning it.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Paar</hi> being return'd home from his Audience: The very ſame day he ſent to Father <hi>Spies</hi> and Dr. <hi>Becher</hi> to invite them to Dine with him the next day, adding theſe Words in his Meſſage, <hi>That he had a Buſineſs to communicate</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45810:14"/>
               <hi>to them from the Emperour.</hi> The next day, they all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly met. F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> being preſent, where after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Count <hi>Paar</hi> made known his Commiſſion, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cauſed an ounce of <hi>Schlachenwald</hi> Tin, and a new Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to be bought, which Materials being prepared and tried, and for fear of Inchantment, <hi>ex abundanti canteſa:</hi> ſprinkled with Holy water: The Trial began and was finiſhed within a quarter of an hour, one part Tinged, ten Thouſand parts into Gold, which was ſo graduated by the Tincture, that it was almoſt Friable, and was ſtriated and diſtinguiſhed with red Veines interſperſed, of which, as likewiſe of the Tin before it was tinged, both the Count <hi>de Paar,</hi> and alſo Father <hi>Spies,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Becher,</hi> each of them took a little piece for a perpetual Memorial of the thing. The reſt was ſealed up with their three Seals, and the ſame quantity of the Powder as this Projection was made with was encloſed with it, and the thing was by all three ſuſcribed to.</p>
            <p>The next day, Count <hi>Paar</hi> went to his Imperial Majeſty, and delivered it to him, making alſo a full Relation of all the particular Circumſtances in the Trial.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Emperour enjoyned him to treat Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> kindly, and to aſſure him of his Favour, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adviſing him to refrain his ill and ſcandalous life, and to ſatisfy the Clergy, that he would reaſſume the Monaſtical Habit, and for the reſt he would take Care; and till he had enquired further into the the thing, he would for his Security ſend him into ſome private place</p>
            <p>The Count returned home very joyful with this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and the very ſame Evening he cauſed F. <hi>VVence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus</hi> to be re-veſted with his Monks Habit by two Engliſh Fathers of the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Order, Father <hi>Dun<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll</hi> and Father <hi>Vostaller:</hi> A Letter was alſo writ to his Abbot at <hi>Bruna,</hi> informing him, that he might ſet his mind at reſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, becauſe he had laid aſide his Monks habit, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45810:14"/>
cloathed himſelf with other Apparel, for no other Reaſon, but becauſe he would free himſelf from the hardſhip of a Priſon, and make a Journey to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to diſcover a great Secret, which he had, to his Imperial Majeſty, which being now done, he had again reſumed his Monks habit.</p>
            <p>All this was done to perſwade him, that they meant him nothing but good, to make him call again for all the Tincture from his Comrade, and to keep him from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing any longer with thoſe which before were his moſt intimate Aquaintance, as counting himſelf ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt all Violence, by the Emperors Protection, and his Monks Habit: So that Count <hi>Paar</hi> was as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, and he, on the other ſide, as his adopted Son. Theſe two new Friends, undertook a Voyage toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to a Country-houſe of the Count's (adjoyning to a certain Lake) which he had in <hi>Hungary,</hi> diſtant about a dayes Journey from <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being come thither, the very ſame night they two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone in a Chamber, The Count pluck'd out a Decree of the Emperor's (as he pretended) which was ſealed up, adding theſe words, <hi>My Son, Into what Gulf of Miſery art thou cast? Here I have a Command in writing from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to demand the Tincture of Thee, and if thou refuſeſt to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, then to my great Grief, I muſt execute upon Thee the Sentence contained in this ſealed Decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fryer <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> deſired to read the Decree; but, the Count replyed, <hi>If it be opened, it muſt be immediately execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted!</hi> and, withal plucking a Piſtol out of his Pocket, he directed it to his Breaſt, Sighing, and breaking forth in theſe Words, <hi>Into what miſerys are we both Caſt! Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding if thou wilt harken to my Counſel, (from whence thou maiſt gather my Love and Fatherly Care, and free both of us from this great Misfortune, and make our Condition very happy) I will give it to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:45810:15"/>
Nothing was more grateful to Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> than to hear this Condition, and having given him his hand that he would follow it:</p>
            <p>The Count began thus, <hi>'Tis certain</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>That you and I do both ſtand in need of the Emperours Protection, and 'tis as certain, That we ſhall be forc'd to deliver the Tincture to him. My Advice then is, (which I refer to you for your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and conſent.) I will pretend, that being injoyn'd to make a ſtricter Examination of this Tinging Powder, that I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it all, in order to its multiplication, to try whether it might be augmented for the greater Benefit and Advantage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. However, we may both be ſheltred under the Continuance of the Emperors Protection, and yet we may keep the Tincture; And after the time deſigned for its augmentation is elapſed, we will eaſily deviſe ſome colorable Excuſe, to evade it; as, That the Glaſs was broken, or ſome Error committed in the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, the Truth is,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>The Emperours Court is not worthy ſo great a Treaſure; it will be Proſtituted there and made common. But to ingage they ſelf to me in a greater degree of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Thou muſt not refuſe to give me half the Tincture, and we will take a mutual Oath to be faithful one to the other, as long as we live, and for what now hath paſſed between us, it ſhall be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in perpetual oblivion. The Emperor ſhall never know any thing of it, neither ſhall he ever have any of the Tincture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> was fain to make an Agreement on thoſe Terms which vvere dravvn up in writing, ſubſcribed with both their hands, and confirmed by their mutual Oaths; and ſo the Tincture vvas divided betvvixt them. The Count made a Tryal by himſelf alone the next day, vvith ſome of his proportion thereof, to try vvhether he had not been deceived therein: but he found it Right and good.</p>
            <p>Having ſtaid a vvhile at this Country Houſe, he vvas about to return to <hi>Vienna;</hi> but he vvas taken ſo grievouſly ſick of a fit of the Gout, that out of the intollerable Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvhich he felt, he drank ſome <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> vvhich
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45810:15"/>
               <hi>Burrhy</hi> had given him heretofore; but vvith this Caution, That it vvas not yet perfect. Having taſted a fevv drops thereof, he preſently felt a moſt grievous and vehement pain in his Joynts, ſo that he could hardly perform his Journey vvith Fr. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> to <hi>Vienna.</hi> But the firſt night after his coming, he vvas ſo afflicted vvith heat, that all his Entralls ſeemed to be on a Flame; as he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf. The Day follovving his Phyſician, the Son of Dr. <hi>Sorbat,</hi> vvhoſe Name vvas <hi>Kreiſſet,</hi> vvho vvas alſo Phyſician to the Emperors Army vvas ſent for, vvho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his preſent Condition, applyed the propereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies he could, which availed him nothing, but bad Symptoms did ſo grow upon him, that the third day his Caſe was judged deſperate.</p>
            <p>The Count himſelf alſo being ſenſible of his Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, cauſed his Brother the Maſter of the Poſt-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Emperor, Count <hi>Peter de Paar,</hi> his only heir, (for the ſick Brother was a Batchelour) to be ſent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout night: to whom he ſpoke in theſe Words;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was foretold to me heretofore in</hi> Italy, <hi>That I ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Tincture, and, That ſoon after I ſhould dye! The firſt part of the Prophecy is fulfilled, and the latter is near at hand to be accompliſhed; I know, That you have beſtowed as much time and Expence in this Art as my ſelf; I have nothing more valuable to leave you, and which, nothing can be more acceptable to you, than a Notable Portion of Tincture, which I have ſealed up in this Desk, and ſhall entruſt it in the hand of my Confeſſor, who upon my deceaſe, ſhall deliver it to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which words, he delivered the Desk to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, who was preſent and heard him ſpeak them. Count <hi>Peter</hi> not imagining his Brother was ſo near his End, took his leave of him for that Night, and rode home, becauſe it was very late. And his Brother ſoon after departing this Life, his Confeſſor alſo took Coach, and went home to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> not far diſtant from the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45810:16"/>
Emperial Poſt Office at <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Death of the Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Count being ſignified to his Brother, by his Footmen who had accompanied the Confeſſor home.</p>
            <p>The Count immediately roſe out of his Bed, being but newly entred thereinto, and clothing himſelf, gallopped at two of the clock in the morning, to the Monaſtery of the Franciſcans, and, after he had knock'd fiercely at the Gate for admittance, the drowſy Porter aroſe and let him in; the Count deſired to be admitted to the Speech of the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of his newly deceaſed Brother, but it was reply'd, It was an unſeaſonable time for ſuch a Viſit, in regard the old man was weak, and weary, and being newly returned home, was laid down to reſt. The Count was not ſatisfi'd with this Anſwer, but was very earneſt with the Porter to accompany him and ſome of his Attendants to the old Fathers Cell: he making Excuſes, the Count ruſhed in preſently himſelf, and awak'd him, demanding the Desk which his Brother had depoſited in his hands, as now right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully belonging unto him.</p>
            <p>The Father was much ſurprized at his fuddain irruption and demand: which he did the more ſuſpect, becauſe it was made at ſuch an unſeaſonable time of the night: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he deſir'd the Count to hold himſelf contented till the Morning, and then he ſhould have the Desk delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him without fail, only he deſired to deliver it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father Guardian, and that he would then give him his acquittance for the Recept thereof. The Count, not content with this Anſwer, by the help of his Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and Servants, endeavored to get it from him by force:</p>
            <p>Whereupon a Tumult aroſe; The Watch was ſent for, the Monks were alſo gathered together, and a Spaniſh Bp. of the ſame Order, the Confeſſor of the Empreſs <hi>Margaret,</hi> then lodging in the Monaſtery, was alſo rouſed out of his ſleep, who hearing ſuch a tumultuous Noiſe in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, a priviledged place, was ſo much concernd thereat,

that he enquired into the occaſion, whilſt the Count was yet preſent, and underſtanding that it aroſe upon the ſcore of a ſealed Desk: he demanded it of the Father who had it in keeping: which having received from him, the next morning he carried it with him to the Emperor, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained grievouſly againſt the Count, as being the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that nights Uproar: In the mean time, as ſoon as it was day, the noiſe hereof was ſpread all over the City: and among the reſt it reached the Ears of F. <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> who preſently haſtned to Court, and by means of the Empreſs's Confeſſor obtaining Audience, he related to the Emperor the whole Story how the Count had uſed him in <hi>Hungary,</hi> how he had extorted from him half the Tincture, how he was neceſſitated, by a forced Agreement, not to diſcover any thing hereof whilſt he was living, but was now free from the Obligation of his Oath by the Counts Death, that he was very glad that the Tincture was at length come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the right Owner his Imperial Majeſty, for whom he had long before deſigned it; he did therefore now implore nothing more of his Imperial Majeſty, but that he would afford him his Protection, againſt the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Count <hi>Peter Paar,</hi> his Poſtmaſter, and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>The Emperor perceiving the wonderful <hi>Series</hi> of this Affair, preſently entertained F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> at his Court, and committed him to the Care and Inſpection of Count <hi>Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> the Imperial Governor of <hi>Hatſchirr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, the Poſt-maſter above-mentioned dyed alſo. F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> being thus received into the Emperours Protection, had his Lodgings aſſigned him by the Imperial Bowling-Green, where he made ſome Tryals before the Emperour and Count <hi>Auſtin</hi> of <hi>Wallestein</hi> his Guardian, and in the Pallace of the <hi>Johannites</hi> in the <hi>Carinthian-</hi>ſtreet, he made one of 15 Marks, as they ſay, out of which Tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations the Count <hi>Walleſtein</hi> made him a Gold Chain, to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45810:17"/>
keep in perpetual Memory of the thing. Moreover he did depoſite ſome of his Tincture in the Court, for augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, as farr as I can judge, by the Proceſs dlivered to me, he had a great deſire to get the Mercury of Silver, how far he proceeded in it, I do not certainly know, but ſome affirm, that he made ſome progreſs therein.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he both deſired to be acquainted with ſome noted Chymiſts and eminent Artiſts, and ſeveral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſters and Sophiſters intruded themſelves into his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ſo that from thence reſulted very frequent jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketings, drinkings and merry meetings, and many fooliſh trifling Proceſſes wrought by him; from whence F. <hi>Wence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaus</hi> learned rather ſeveral cunning and ſubtil Impoſtures, than any real augmentation of his Pouder: But the noiſe &amp; multitude of ſo many Importunate Viſitants, being cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſom at Court, where F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> had his Diet, under the ſevere inſpection of Count <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> he thereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that he had occaſion to make ſome ſorts of <hi>Aqua Forts</hi> and other <hi>Menstruums,</hi> which would be dangerous to the whole Court, and cauſe ſuch noyſom Fumes and odious Smells, that they could not ſafely be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in that place; therefore a Laboratory was built for him, in the <hi>Carinthian</hi> Fort, where the Emperors chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer did dwell, his name was <hi>Fiſcher,</hi> a great lover of Alchymy, and who ſhewed himſelf very officious to him, aſſiſting him to build ſtrange and moſt nonſenſical Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which can ever be ſeen; and beſides being not a little pleaſed with his good fortune of the neighbourhood and acquaintance of the Owner of ſo rich a Tincture; but this intimacy laſted not long, as the event ſoon made appear: for when F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> had ſcarcely well fixed his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſetled his things in order, the Engineer was forced to leave the ſplendid dwelling there aſſigned him by the Emperour, and to go to <hi>Javarin</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to dwell there, his Wife alſo, as ſome give out, being vitiated into the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45810:17"/>
bargain; F. <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> alſo fell very ſick, and he that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him in his Chamber dyed ſuddenly, not without ſome ſuſpicion of Poyſon, and he himſelf alſo lay without any hopes of recovery, in this caſe <hi>J. A. C. P. C. L. de S.</hi> who before had bought ſome of the Tincture of him, and had paid him for it a thouſand Ducats, deſigning to take this opportunity of his illneſs, and deceaſe ſo apparent, and ſo to get and enjoy his Tincture without money, ſent to him one <hi>Biliot,</hi> a French Phyſician, to ſteal from him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of a Viſit, both the ſaid thouſand Ducats, and the reſt of the Tincture: Fortune did favour him as to the firſt part of his Deſign, but in the latter ſhe did fail and diſſappoint him, for F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> had hid his Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture more carefully than his thouſand Ducats: at laſt, the Sick man, contrary to all mens exſpectation began to Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and F. <hi>Francis</hi> who was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to obtain a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for him, to abſolve him from his Vow, having obtained the ſame returned home; whereupon preſently F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> laying aſide his Monks Habit, took a Wife and was married publickly to one named <hi>Angerlee,</hi> who had miniſtred to him in his ſickneſs, and had otherwiſe been very aſſiſtant to him when he wanted her; ſhe was a very ſubtil and crafty woman, yet accounted at <hi>Vienna</hi> but little better than a common Harlot, and ſhe was the worſe thought on, becauſe her Siſter had been naught with <hi>B. D. L.</hi> and by his advice and aſſiſtance had cauſed her Husband to be made away, for which Fact, he the ſaid <hi>B. D. L.</hi> was Sentenced to Death: but, though afterwards pardoned by the Emperour, yet was deprived of all his Dignities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded of his Nobility, and caſt into perpetual Priſon in the Citadel of <hi>Gratz,</hi> where he dyed Miſerably; and his Whore, F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi>'s Wives Siſter, was the ſame day to be Beheaded in open Court, before the Judgement Hall, the Scaffold and all the reſt being already prepared, but by the interceſſion of the Wife of <hi>Caſtell Rodrigo,</hi> the Spaniſh
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45810:18"/>
Embaſſador ſhe was ſet free, yet afterward, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her leud life, and diſhoneſt Practiſes, ſhe was kil'd with a Piſtol-ſhot.</p>
            <p>Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> being linked by Marriage into ſuch a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, did then fancy for a time, That all the Elements did conſpire together to make him happy: for why? he was viſited by Perſons of the higheſt Rank, and withal was mightily reſpected by the moſt eminent Ladies, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes and Princeſſes: As for me, as Spectator of this Scene, I conſidered him in this Fools Paradiſe: Whilſt it put me in mind of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> who, in his Book of the <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Sciences,</hi> under the Title of Alchymy, ſayes, <hi>That if ever he ſhould be Maſter of the Tincture, he would ſpend it all in nothing but in VVhoring; for women being naturally covetous, he could thereby eaſily make them to proſtitute themſelves, and to yield unto his Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſeems that not only F. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> was ſo mighty a Proficient and ſo ſtout a Souldier in the School of VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS, That he was brought very low by the French Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but alſo that his Wife <hi>Angerlee</hi> dyed of it. After whoſe deceaſe Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> exceeded all Bounds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Modeſty, and dayly let looſe the Reins to all ſinful and voluptuous exceſſes: for from that time he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Tincture, he ſpent in two or three years time more than Ten Myriads of Crowns, in all manner of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury: and he foreſaw well enough, that it could not laſt and ſubſiſt long at that rate: for the Tincture would not maintain him. And to turn it into Gold, or ſell it for a ſmall price would turn to no Account, as he had alwaies hoped it would by Augmentation, and thereby to gain an inexhauſtible Treaſure.</p>
            <p>But on the one hand, his Want and Neceſſity was ſuch, and on the other hand, the Solicitings of thoſe who would buy of his Powder, were ſo importunate that he could not reſiſt ſo great Temptations: And therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45810:18"/>
between both, he reſolved upon a diſhoneſt Shift, which was to ſell for great Rates, <hi>Poudred Cinnabar, red Lead, and the Caput Mortuum of Aqua fortis boyled,</hi> and ſuch other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in ſtead of the true Pouder, mixing alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome few Filings of Copper, that Fooliſh ignorant People might miſtake the ſame for a Gold-making Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: to ſome he ſold it without any ſuch Cozening Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as Coppar: And if they were not able to tinge with it, he would lay the Blame on their Impatience and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs in making the Projection. To others, he paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome of his Counterfeit Tincture for a great ſumm of Money, which he pretended, he had a preſent uſe for: but he was loath to ſpend his Tincture in projecting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hoped to augment it with a Thouſand-fold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: And that they might ſee the Tincture was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine and true, he took ſome of it and wrapt it up in a little Wax, with which he mingled a little of his right Tincture, which he called his <hi>Crocus,</hi> or Pouder of Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſo tinged therewith.</p>
            <p>By this means he got very many 1000's of Crowns, and over and above he got P. C. de L. and C. L. to be his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Partners in theſe Myſteries. But the Impudent ſort, among which A. C. P. and his Coſen C. B. are to be reckoned, he gave them whole Ingots which he had caſt, conſiſting of equal parts of Gold and Silver; then filing ſome of them, and diſſolving it into common <hi>Aqua forts,</hi> which he brought with him, he affirmed that now his Tincture was exalted into a Menſtruum, which would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently change Silver into Gold: and that as ſoon as ever the price or value which was to be paid for its purchaſe ſhould be put thereto, it would be converted into Gold:</p>
            <p>It hath been alſo further related to me, That he grew to that Degree of Impudence, as to tinge ſome ſort of Coins after this manner into Gold, before the Empreſs Dowager and the Emperour himſelf. Yea, this fellow was ſo arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45810:19"/>
as to cauſe his own Effigies to be drawn on ſome of thoſe falſe Coins which he did attempt deceitfully to put off.</p>
            <p>Yet this matter could not be kept ſo ſecret, but the more prudent began to ſmell the Cheat, and to mutter ſomething about it; which was very ill taken in the Emperours Court. For he was in ſuch Credit there, that it was not ſafe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach him, as being received into the Emperors Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both againſt the Clergy and the Secular Power, and even againſt the skilful in the ſame Art. For great men are loth to acknowledge their Error; but think themſelves, tho under a Miſtake, to be as infallible as the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who were not much concern'd in the Matter, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it ſo to paſs, as taking little Notice of it; but ſome true Philoſophers were very much aggriev'd, That ſo in famous an Impoſtor, after ſo many Vows and Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by him to the contrary, and after ſuch evident Proofs of his former debauch'd Life, after ſo many villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crimes committed, and his baſe Proſtitution openly of ſo noble an Art of Chymiſtry, ſhould yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ranted it up and down in his Coach in Maſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, before the Emperours Court, be maintain'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by him. But others, who had been cozened by him of great Summs of Money, even to many thouſand Ducats, with his adulterate Tincture, could not ſo reſt ſatisfied, but brought in their Action againſt him at common Law: where, after ſome time and much Expence, they obtained Judgment againſt him, but it never was put in Execution, though all other means were try'd.</p>
            <p>Now the Emperour, unleſs he would have left his Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> to the Juriſdiction and power of his Judges, and Rigor of the Law, muſt needs interpoſe: for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made againſt him for his inſolent and abuſive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes were ſo many, and the Fame of them was ſpread ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45810:19"/>
far abroad in the world, That his Imp<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ial Majeſty thought it more convenient to have the Noiſe of it altogether ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, The Emperour paid all his Debts, and that he might prevent his farther opportunity of Coſenage, he got from him the reſt of his Tincture, and then advanc'd him to the moſt Ancient Order of Barrony in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the Title of <hi>Baron Seyler</hi> of <hi>Seylerburgh,</hi> and afterwards made him Hereditary Maſter of the Mint of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> and having thus preferred him, he ſent him away from his Court to <hi>Prague,</hi> where he now lives very gallantly; and hath made Fryer <hi>Francis</hi> the Steward of his Houſe: hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married a Second Wiſe, called <hi>VValdes Kircheriana,</hi> a handſome woman, and of a Noble Family.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, a Rumor was ſpread all over <hi>Germany, That the Devil had carried him away Soul and Body.</hi> Which Report, though it might have ſome good grounds, yet, for this time it was not true: but he hath very great reaſon to-fear that it may prove true, at laſt, if he doth not amend his Life: and the Event thereof we muſt expect.</p>
            <p>I have deſcribed the <hi>Series</hi> of this Story both to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Truth, and alſo to ſatisfy ſo many Curious, who have deſpicable thoughts of Chymiſtry. If I have miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in any Paſſage, Fr. <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> is yet alive, and I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire him to amend and rectify my miſtakes, and to vindicate himſelf, by giving the World a more exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof, that he may no longer lye under any unjuſt Reflection.</p>
            <p>For a Concluſion, I heartily wiſh, That if God ſhould bleſs any lover of this noble Art, with ſome ſuch like Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he would uſe it better than <hi>VVenceſlaus</hi> hath done: for the Glory of God, the Benefit and advantage of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and the furtherance of his own everlaſting Salvation.</p>
