            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE OF GOVERNMENT With relation to MILITIA'S.</head>
            <p>THERE is not perhaps in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs any thing ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable as the Indignity and Cruelty with which the far greater part of Mankind ſuffer themſelves to be uſed under pretence of Government. For ſome Men falſly perſwading themſelves that bad Governments are advantageous to them, as moſt conducing to gratify their Ambition, Avarice and Luxury, ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61706:3"/>
with the utmoſt art and violence to procure their Eſtabliſhment: and by ſuch Men almoſt the whole World has been trampled under foot, and ſubjected to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, for want of underſtanding by what means and methods they were enſlaved. For tho Mankind take great care and pains to inſtruct themſelves in other Arts and Sciences, yet very few apply themſelves to conſider the nature of Government, an Enquiry ſo uſeful and neceſſary both to Magiſtrate and People. Nay, in moſt Countries the Arts of State being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directed either to enſlave the People, or to keep them under ſlavery; it is become almoſt every where a Crime to reaſon about Matters of Government. But if Men would beſtow a ſmall part of the Time and Application which they throw away upon curious but uſeleſs Studies, or endleſs Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in peruſing thoſe excellent Rules and Examples of Government which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have left us, they would ſoon be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to diſcover all ſuch Abuſes and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as tend to the Ruin of Publick Societies. 'Tis therefore very ſtrange that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61706:3"/>
they ſhould think Study and Knowledg ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in every thing they go about, except in the nobleſt and moſt uſeful of all Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, The Art of Government.</p>
            <p>Now if any Man in compaſſion to the Miſeries of a People ſhould endeavour to diſabuſe them in any thing relating to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he will certainly incur the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and perhaps be purſued by the Rage of thoſe, who think they find their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the oppreſſion of the World; but will hardly ſucceed in his Endeavours to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Multitude. For the generality of all Ranks of Men are cheated by Words and Names; and provided the antient Terms and outward Forms of any Government be retained, let the nature of it be never ſo much altered, they continue to dream that they ſhall ſtill enjoy their former Liberty, and are not to be awakned till it prove too late. Of this there are many remarkable Examples in Hiſtory; but that particular Inſtance which I have choſen to inſiſt on, as moſt ſutable to my purpoſe, is, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Government which happened in moſt Countries of Europe about the year
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61706:4"/>
1500. And 'tis worth obſervation, that tho this Change was fatal to their Liberty, yet it was not introduced by the Contrivance of ill-deſigning Men; nor were the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Conſequences perceived, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by a few wiſe Men, who, if they ſaw it, wanted Power to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Two hundred years being already paſſed ſince this Alteration began, Europe has felt the Effects of it by ſad Experience; and the true Cauſes of the Change are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more viſible.</p>
            <p>To lay open this matter in its full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, it will be neceſſary to look farther back, and examin the Original and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of thoſe Governments that were eſtabliſhed in Europe about the year 400, and continued till this Alteration.</p>
            <p>When the Goths, Vandals, and other warlike Nations, had at different Times, and under different Leaders, overrun the Weſtern Parts of the Roman Empire, they introduced the following Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into all the Nations they ſubdued. The General of the Army became King of the Conquered Country; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61706:4"/>
being abſolute, he divided the Lands amongst the great Officers of his Army, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards called Barons; who again parcelled out their ſeveral Territories in ſmaller Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the inferiour Souldiers that had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them in the Wars, and who then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their Vaſſals, enjoying thoſe Lands for Military Service. The King reſerved to himſelf ſome Demeaſnes for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Court and Attendance. When this was done, there was no longer any Standing Army kept on foot, but every man went to live upon his own Lands; and when the Defence of the Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired an Army, the King ſummoned the Barons to his Standard, who came attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Vaſſals. Thus were the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Europe compoſed for about eleven hundred years; and this Conſtitution of Government put the Sword into the hands of the Subject, becauſe the Vaſſals depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more immediately on the Barons than on the King, which effectually ſecured the freedom of thoſe Governments. For the Barons could not make uſe of their Power to deſtroy thoſe limited Monarchies, without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61706:5"/>
deſtroying their own Grandeur; nor could the King invade their Privileges, having no other Forces than the Vaſſals of his own Demeaſnes to rely upon for his ſupport in ſuch an Attempt.</p>
            <p>I lay no great ſtreſs on any other Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of thoſe Monarchies; nor do I think any ſo eſſential to the Liberties of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as that which placed the Sword in the hands of the Subject. And ſince in our time moſt Princes of Europe are in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sword, by Standing Mercenary Forces kept up in time of Peace, abſolutely depending upon them, I ſay that all ſuch Governments are changed from Monarchies to Tyrannies. Nor can the Power of granting or refuſing Money, tho veſted in the Subject, be a ſufficient ſecurity for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, where a Standing Mercenary Army is kept up in time of Peace: For he that is arm'd, is always Maſter of the Purſe of him that is unarm'd. And not only that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is tyrannical, which is tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally exerciſed; but all Governments are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, which have not in their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a ſufficient Security againſt the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power of the Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61706:5"/>
I do not deny that theſe limited Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies during the greatneſs of the Barons, had ſome Defects: I know few Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments free from them. But after all, there was a Balance that kept thoſe Governments ſteady, and an effectual Proviſion againſt the Encroachments of the Crown. I do leſs pretend that the preſent Governments can be reſtored to the Conſtitution before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The following Diſcourſe will ſhow the impoſſibility of it. My deſign in the firſt place is, to explain the Nature of the paſt and preſent Governments of Europe, and to diſabuſe thoſe who think them the ſame, becauſe they are called by the ſame Names; and who ignorantly clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as would preſerve that Liberty which is yet left.</p>
            <p>In order to this, and for a further and clearer Illuſtration of the Matter, I ſhall deduce from their Original, the Cauſes, Occaſions, and the Complication of thoſe many unforeſeen Accidents; which falling out much about the ſame time, produced ſo great a Change. And it will at firſt ſight ſeem very ſtrange, when I ſhall name the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61706:6"/>
Reſtoration of Learning, the Invention of Printing, of the Needle and of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the chief of them; things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo excellent, and which, the laſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, might have proved of infinite Advantage to the World, if their remote Influence upon Government had been obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſutable Remedies. Such odd Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and of ſuch a different Nature, accompany extraordinary Inventions of any kind.</p>
            <p>Conſtantinople being taken by Mahomet the Second, in the Year 1453, many Learned Greeks fled over into Italy; where the favourable reception they found from the Popes, Princes, and Republicks of that Country, ſoon introduced amongst the better ſort of Men, the ſtudy of the Greek Tongue, and of the Antient Authors in that Language. About the ſame time likewiſe ſome Learned Men began to reſtore the Purity of the Latin Tongue. But that which moſt contributed to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of all kind of Learning, and eſpecially the ſtudy of the Antients, was the Art of Printing; which was brought
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61706:6"/>
to a great degree of Perfection a few Years after. By this means their Books became common, and their Arts generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and admired. But as Mankind from a natural propenſion to Pleaſure, is always ready to chuſe out of every thing what may moſt gratify that vicious Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; ſo the Arts which the Italians firſt applied themſelves to improve, were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally thoſe that had been ſubſervient to the Luxury of the Antients in the moſt corrupt Ages, of which they had many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents ſtill remaining. Italy was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently filled with Architects, Painters and Sculptors; and a prodigious Expence was made in Buildings, Pictures and Statues. Thus the Italians began to come off from their frugal and military way of living, and addicted themſelves to the purſuit of refined and expenſive Pleaſures, as much as the Wars of thoſe Times would permit. This Infection ſpread it ſelf by degrees into the Neighbouring Nations. But theſe things alone had not been ſufficient to work ſo great a Change in Government, if a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Invention, brought into common
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61706:7"/>
uſe about that time, had not produced more new and extraordinary Effects than any had ever done before; which probably may have many Conſequences yet unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, and a farther Influence upon the Manners of Men, as long as the World laſts: I mean, the Invention of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, by the help of which Navigation was greatly improved; a Paſſage opened by Sea to the Eaſt-Indies, and a new World diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. By this means the Luxury of Aſia and America was added to that of the Antients; and all Ages, and all Countries concurred to ſink Europe into an Abyſs of Pleaſures; which were rendred the more expenſive by a perpetual Change of the Faſhions in Clothes, Equipage and Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Houſes.</p>
            <p>Theſe things brought a total Alteration in the way of living, upon which all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment depends. 'Tis true, Knowledg being mightily increaſed, and a great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſuy and Nicety in every thing introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Men imagined themſelves to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all Points, by changing from their frugal and military way of living, which I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61706:7"/>
muſt confeſs had ſome mixture of Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ignorance in it, tho not inſeparable from it. But at the ſame time they did not conſider the unſpeakable Evils that are altogether inſeparable from an expenſive way of living.</p>
            <p>To touch upon all theſe, tho ſlightly, would carry me too far from my Subject: I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to apply what has been ſaid, to the immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The far greater ſhare of all thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences fell upon the Barons; for they were the Perſons moſt able to make them, and their Dignity ſeemed to challenge whatever might diſtinguiſh them from other Men. This plunged them on a ſudden into ſo great Debts, that if they did not ſell, or otherwiſe alienate their Lands, they found themſelves at leaſt obliged to turn the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Service their Vaſſals owed them, into Money; partly by way of Rent, and partly by way of Leaſe, or Fine, for paiment of their Creditors. And by this means the Vaſſal having his Lands no longer at ſo eaſy a Rate as before, could no more be obliged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61706:8"/>
to Military Service, and ſo became a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thus the Armies, which in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding times had been always compoſed of ſuch Men as theſe, ceaſed of courſe, and the Sword fell out of the hands of the Barons. But there being always a neceſſity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the Defence of every Country, Princes were afterwards allowed to raiſe Armies of Volunteers and Mercenaries. And great Sums were given by Diets and Parliaments for their Maintenance, to be levied upon the People grown rich by Trade, and diſpirited for want of Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Exerciſe. Such Forces were at firſt only raiſed for preſent Exigencies, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued no longer on foot than the Occaſions laſted. But Princes ſoon found Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make them perpetual, the chief of which was the gariſoning Frontier Towns and Fortreſſes; the Methods of War being altered to the tedious and chargeable way of Sieges, principally by the Invention of Gunpowder. The Officers and Souldiers of theſe Mercenary Armies depending for their Subſistence and Preferment, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the Prince, as the former
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61706:8"/>
Militia's did upon the Barons, the Power of the Sword was transferred from the Subject to the King, and War grew a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Trade to live by. Nay, many of the Barons themſelves being reduced to Poverty by their expenſive way of living, took Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in thoſe Mercenary Troops; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill continued Hereditary Members of Diets, and other Aſſemblies of State, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the loſs of their Vaſſals, whom they formerly repreſented, they were now the readieſt of all others to load the People with heavy Taxes, which were employed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Prince's Military Power, by Guards, Armies, and Citadels, beyond Bounds or Remedy.</p>
            <p>Some Princes with much impatience preſſed on to Arbitrary Power before things were ripe, as the Kings of France and Charles Duke of Burgundy. Philip de Commines ſays of the latter, <q>That hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a Truce with the King of France he called an Aſſembly of the Eſtates of his Country, and remonſtrated to them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice he had ſuſtained by not having Standing Troops as that King had; that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61706:9"/>
if five hundred Men had been in gariſon upon their Frontier, the King of France would never have undertaken that War; and having repreſented the Miſchiefs that were ready to fall upon them for want of ſuch a Force, he earneſtly preſſed them to grant ſuch a Sum as would maintain eight hundred Lances. At length they gave him a hundred and twenty thouſand Crowns more than his ordinary Revenue, (from which Tax Burgundy was exempted) But his Subjects were for many reaſons under great Apprehenſions of falling into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to which they ſaw the Kingdom of France already reduced by means of ſuch Troops. And truly their Apprehenſions were not ill-grounded; for when he had got together five or ſix hundred Men at Arms, he preſently had a mind to more, and with them diſturbed the peace of all his Neighbours: He augmented the tax from one hundred and twenty to five hundred thouſand Crowns, and increaſed the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe Men at Arms, by whom his Subjects were greatly oppreſt.</q> Francis de Beaucaire Biſhop of Metz in his Hiſtory of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61706:9"/>
France ſpeaking of the ſame Affair, ſays, <q>That the foreſaid States could not be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to maintain Mercenary Forces, being ſenſible of the Difficulties into which the Commonalty of France had brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the like Conceſſion; that Princes might increaſe their Forces at pleaſure, and ſometimes (even when they had obtained Money) pay them ill, to the vexation and deſtruction of the poor People; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that Kings and Princes not contented with their antient Patrimony, were always ready under this pretext to break in upon the Properties of all Men, and to raiſe what Money they pleaſed. That neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they gave him a hundred and twenty thouſand Crowns yearly, which he ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to five hundred thouſand: But that Burgundy (which was the antient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of that Family) retained its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Liberty, and could by no means be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay any part of this new Tax.</q> 'Tis true, Philip de Commines ſubjoins to the forecited paſſage, that be believes ſtanding Forces may be well employed under a wiſe King or Prince; but that if he be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61706:10"/>
not ſo, or leaves his Children young, the uſe that he or their Governours make of them, is not always profitable either for the King or his Subjects. If this Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be his own, and not rather an Inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion added by the Preſident of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris, who publiſhed, and, as the foreſaid Francis de Beaucaire ſays he was credibly informed, corrupted his Memoirs; yet Experience ſhews him to be miſtaken: For the Example of his Maſter Lewis the 11th, whom upon many occaſions he calls a Wiſe Prince, and thoſe of moſt Princes under whom ſtanding Forces were firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, demonſtrates, that they are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous under a wiſe Prince than any other: And Reaſon tells us, that if they are the only proper Inſtruments to introduce Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, as ſhall be made plain, a cunning and able Prince, who by the World is called a Wiſe one, is more capable of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to that end than a weak Prince, or Governors during a Minority; and that a wiſe Prince having once procured them to be eſtabliſhed, they will maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under any.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61706:10"/>
I am not ignorant that before this Change, Subſidies were often given by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, States and Parliaments, and ſome raiſed by the Edicts of Princes for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Wars; but theſe were ſmall, and no way ſufficient to ſubſist ſuch nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Armies as thoſe of the Barons Militia. There were likewiſe Mercenary Troops ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times entertained by Princes who aimed at Arbitrary Power, and by ſome Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in time of War for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but theſe were only Strangers, or in very ſmall numbers, and held no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thoſe vaſt Armies of Mercenaries which this change has fix'd upon Europe to her affliction and ruin.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid hitherto has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with regard to one or other, and often to moſt Countries in Europe. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows will have a more particular regard to Britain; where, tho the Power of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons be ceaſed, yet no mercenary Troops are yet eſtabliſhed. The Reaſon of which is, that England had before this great Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion loſt all her Conqueſts in France, the Town of Calais only excepted; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61706:11"/>
was taken by the French, before the Change was thorowly made. So that the Kings of England had no Pretence to keep up Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forces, either to defend Conqueſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or to gariſon a Frontier towards France, ſince the Sea was now become the only Frontier between thoſe two Countries.</p>
            <p>Neither could the Frontier towards Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land afford any colour to thoſe Princes for raiſing ſuch Forces, ſince the Kings of Scotland had none; and that Scotland was not able to give Money for the ſubſisting any conſiderable number. 'Tis true, the Example of France, with which Country Scotland had conſtant correſpondence, and ſome French Counſellors about Mary of Guiſe, Queen Dowager and Regent of Scotland, induced her to propoſe a Tax for the ſubſiſting of Mercenary Soldiers to be employed for the defence of the Frontier of Scotland; and to eaſe, as was pretended, the Barons of that trouble. But in that honourable and wiſe Remonſtrance, which was made by 300 of the leſſer Barons (as much diſſatisfied with the Lords, who by their ſilence betrayed the publick Liberty,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61706:11"/>
as with the Regent her ſelf) ſhe was told; That their Forefathers had defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Fortunes againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, when that Nation was much more powerful than they were at that time, and had made frequent incurſions into their Country: That they themſelves had not ſo far degenerated from their Anceſtors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, when occaſion requir'd, to hazard their Lives and Fortunes in the Service of their Country: That as to the hiring of Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Soldiers, it was a thing of great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to put the Liberty of Scotland into the hands of Men, who are of no Fortunes, nor have any hopes but in the publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; who for Money would attempt any thing; whoſe exceſſive Avarice opportunity would inflame to a deſire of all manner of Innovations, and whoſe Faith would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Wheel of Fortune. That tho theſe Men ſhould be more mindful of the Duty they owe to their Country, than of their own particular Intereſt, was it to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that Mercenaries would ſight more bravely for the defence of other Mens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, than the Poſſeſſors would do for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61706:12"/>
themſelves or their own; or that a little Money ſhould excite their ignoble Minds to a higher pitch of Honour than that with which the Barons are inſpired, when they fight for the preſervation of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Wives and Children, Religion and Liberty: That moſt Men did ſuſpect and apprehend, that this new way of making War, might be not only uſeleſs, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Nation; ſince the Engliſh, if they ſhould imitate the Example, might, without any great trouble to their People, raiſe far greater Sums for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Mercenary Soldiers, than Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land could; and by this means not only ſpoil and lay open the Frontier, but pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the Bowels of the Kingdom: And that it was in the Militia of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons their Anceſtors had plac'd their chief Truſt, for the defence of themſelves againſt a greater Power.</p>
            <p>By theſe powerful Reaſons being made ſenſible of her Error, the Queen deſiſted from her Demands. Her Daughter Queen Mary, who, as the great Hiſtorian ſays, look'd upon the moderate Government of a limited
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61706:12"/>
Kingdom, to be diſgraceful to Monarchs, and upon the ſlavery of the People, as the freedom of Kings, reſolved to have Guards about her Perſon; but could not fall upon a way to compaſs them: for ſhe could find no Pretext, unleſs it were the empty ſhow of Magnificence which belongs to a Court, and the Example of Foreign Princes; for the former Kings had always truſted themſelves to the Faith of the Barons. At length upon a falſe and ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, of an Intention in a certain Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſeize her Perſon, ſhe aſſumed them; but they were ſoon aboliſhed. Nor had her Son King James any other Guards whilſt he was King of Scotland only, than forty Gentlemen: And that King declares in the Act of Parliament, by which they are eſtabliſhed, that he will not burden his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by any Tax or Impoſition for their Maintenance.</p>
            <p>Henry the Seventh, King of England, ſeems to have perceived ſooner, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood better the Alteration before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, than any Prince of his time, and obtained ſeveral Laws to favour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61706:13"/>
it. But his Succeſſors were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improper to ſecond him: For Henry the Eighth was an unthinking Prince. The Reigns of Edward the Sixth, and Queen Mary, were ſhort; and Queen Elizabeth loved her People too well to attempt it. King James, who ſucceeded her, was a ſtranger in England, and of no Intereſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. King Charles I. did indeed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make himſelf Abſolute, tho ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prepoſterouſly; for he attempted to ſeize the Purſe, before he was Maſter of the Sword. But very wiſe Men have been of Opinion, that if he had been poſſeſſed of as numerous Guards as thoſe which were afterwards raiſed, and conſtantly kept up by King Charles the Second, he might eaſily have ſucceeded in his Enterprize. For we ſee that in thoſe Struggles which the Country Party had with King Charles the Second, and in thoſe Endeavours they uſed to bring about that Revolution which was afterwards compaſſed by a Foreign Power; the chief and inſuperable Difficulty they met with, was from thoſe Guards. And tho King James the Second had provoked
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61706:13"/>
theſe Nations to the laſt degree, and made his own Game as hard as poſſible, not only by invading our Civil Liberties, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by endeavouring to change the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Religion for another which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abhorred, whereby he loſt their Affections, and even thoſe of a great part of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Yet notwithſtanding all this miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, Britain ſtood in need of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force to ſave it; and how dangerous a Remedy that is, the Hiſtories of all Ages can witneſs. 'Tis true, this Circumſtance was favourable, that a Prince who had married the next Heir to theſe Kingdoms, was at the Head of our Deliverance: yet did it engage us in a long and expenſive War. And now that we are much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, and England by means of her former Riches and preſent Poverty, fallen into all the Corruptions which thoſe great Enemies of Vertue, Want, and Exceſs of Riches can produce; that there are ſuch numbers of Mercenary Forces on foot at home and abroad; that the greateſt part of the Officers have no other way to ſubſist; that they are commanded by a wiſe and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61706:14"/>
active King, who has at his Diſpoſal the formidable Land and Sea Forces of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation, the great Rival of our Trade: A King, who by Blood, Relation, other particular Ties, and common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, has the Houſe of Auſtria, moſt of the Princes of Germany, and Potentates of the North, for his Friends and Allies; who can, whatever Intereſt he join with, do what he thinks fit in Europe: I ſay, if a Mercenary Standing Army be kept up, (the firſt of that kind, except thoſe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſarper Cromwel, and the late King James, that Britain has ſeen for thirteen hundred Years) I deſire to know where the Security of the Britiſh Liberties lies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the good Will and Pleaſure of the King: I deſire to know, what real Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be had againſt Standing Armies of Mercenaries, backed by the Corruption of both Nations, the Tendency of the way of Living, the Genius of the Age, and the Example of the World.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown the difference between the paſt and preſent Government of Britain,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61706:14"/>
how precarious our Liberties are, and how from having the beſt ſecurity for them we are in hazard of having none at all; 'tis to be hoped that thoſe who are for a Standing Army, and loſing no occaſion of advancing and extending the Prerogative, from a miſtaken Opinion that they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the antient Government of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will ſee what ſort of Patriots they are.</p>
            <p>But we are told, that only Standing Mercenary Forces can defend Britain from the perpetual Standing Armies of France. However frivolous this Aſſertion be, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no good Argument can be brought to ſupport it, either from Reaſon or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as ſhall be proved hereafter; yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it to be good, what Security can the Nations have, that theſe Standing Forces ſhall not at ſome time or other be made uſe of to ſuppreſs the Liberties of the People, tho not in this King's time, to whom we owe their Preſervation? For I hope there is no Man ſo weak to think, that keeping up the Army for a year, or for any longer time than the Parliaments of both Nations
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61706:15"/>
ſhall have engaged the publick Faith to make good all Deficiencies of Funds granted for their Maintenance, is not the keeping them up for ever. 'Tis a pitiful ſhift in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers for a Standing Army, to ſay, We are not for a Standing Army; We are only for an Army from year to year, or till the Militia be made uſeful. For Britain cannot be in any hazard from France; at leaſt till that Kingdom, ſo much exhauſted by War and Perſecution, ſhall have a breathing ſpace to recover. Before that time our Militias will be in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and in the mean time the Fleet. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, no Prince ever ſurrendred ſo great Countries and ſo many ſtrong Places, I ſhall not ſay, in order to make a new War; but as theſe Men will have it, to continue the ſame. The French King is old and diſeaſed, and was never willing to hazard much by any bold Attempt. If he, or the Dauphin, upon his Deceaſe, may be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any farther Deſign, it muſt be upon the Spaniſh Monarchy, in caſe of the death of that King. And if it be objected, that we ſhall ſtand in need of an Army, in ſuch
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61706:15"/>
a Conjuncture; I anſwer, that our Part in that, or in any other foreign War, will be beſt managed by Sea, as ſhall be ſhown here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſee if Mercenary Armies be not exactly calculated to enſlave a Nation. Which I think may be eaſily proved, if we conſider that ſuch Troops are generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Men who make a Trade of War; and having little or no Patrimony, or ſpent what they once had, enter into that Employment in hopes of its Continuance du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Life, not at all thinking how to make themſelves capable of any other. By which means heavy and perpetual Taxes muſt be entail'd for ever upon the People for their Subſiſtence; and ſince all their Relations ſtand engaged to ſupport their Intereſt, let all Men judg, if this will not prove a very united and formidable Party in a Nation.</p>
            <p>But the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers muſt pardon me if I tell them, that no well-conſtituted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ever ſuffered any ſuch Men in it, whoſe Intereſt leads them to imbroil the State in War, and are a uſeleſs and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Burden in time of Peace. Venice
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61706:16"/>
or Holland are neither of them examples to prove the contrary; for had not their ſituation been different from that of other Countries, their Liberty had not continued to this time. And they ſuffer no Forces to remain within thoſe inacceſſible places, which are the chief ſeats of their power. Carthage, that had not thoſe advantages of ſituation, and yet uſed Mercenary Forces, was brought to the brink of ruin by them in a time of Peace; beaten in three Wars, and at laſt ſubdued by the Romans. If ever any Government ſtood in need of ſuch a ſort of Men, 'twas that of antient Rome, becauſe they were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in perpetual War. The Argument can never be ſo ſtrong in any other Caſe. But the Romans well knowing ſuch Men and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be incompatible, and yet being under a neceſſity of having Armies conſtantly on foot, made frequent Changes of the Men that ſerved in them; who, when they had been ſome time in the Army, were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to return to their Poſſeſſions, Trades, or other Emploiments. And to ſhow how true a Judgment that wiſe State made of this Matter, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61706:16"/>
thoſe who ſubverted that Government; the greateſt that ever was amongst Men, found themſelves obliged to continue the ſame Souldiers always in conſtant Pay and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>If during the late War we had followed ſo wiſe a courſe as that of Rome, there had been thrice as many trained Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as at preſent there are; no difficulties about Recruits, nor debates about keeping up Armies in time of Peace, becauſe ſome Men reſolve to live by Arms in time of Peace, whether it be for the good of the Nations or not. And ſince ſuch was the practice of Rome, I hope no man will have the confidence to ſay, that this method was not as effectual for War as any other. If it be objected, that Rome had perpetual Wars, and therefore that might be a good practice among them, which would not be ſo with us; I confeſs I cannot ſee the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; for if Rome had perpetual Wars, the Romans ought ſtill to have continued the ſame men in their Armies, that they might, according to the Notion of theſe men, render their Troops more uſeful.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61706:17"/>
And if we did change our men during a War, we ſhould have more men that would underſtand ſomething of it. If any man ſay, not ſo much as if they continued in the Army: I anſwer, that many of thoſe who continue in the Army, are afterwards ſwept away by the War, and live not to be of uſe in time of Peace; that thoſe who eſcape the War, being fewer than in the other caſe, are ſoon conſumed: and that Mercenary Standing Forces in time of Peace, if not employed to do miſchief, ſoon become like thoſe of Holland in 72, fit only to loſe forty ſtrong places in forty days.</p>
            <p>There is another thing which I would not mention if it were not abſolutely neceſſary to my preſent purpoſe; and that is, the uſual Manners of thoſe who are engaged in Mercenary Armies. I ſpeak now of Officers in other Parts of Europe, and not of thoſe in our Armies, allowing them to be the beſt; and if they will have it ſo, quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all others. I will not apply to them any part of what I ſhall ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt. They themſelves beſt know
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61706:17"/>
how far any thing of that Nature may be applicable to them. I ſay then, moſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Europe having put themſelves upon the foot of keeping up Forces, rather nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than well entertain'd, can give but ſmall Allowance to Officers, and that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is for the moſt part very ill paid, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render them the more neceſſitous and depending; and yet they permit them to live in all that extravagancy which mutual example and emulation prompts them to. By which means the Officers become inſenſibly engaged in numberleſs Frauds, Oppreſſions and Cruelties, the Colonels againſt the Captains, and the Captains againſt the inferiour Souldiers; and all of them againſt all perſons with whom they have any kind of buſineſs. So that there is hardly any ſort of Men who are leſs Men of Honour than the Officers of Mercenary Forces: and indeed Honour has now no other ſignification amongſt them than Courage. Beſides, moſt Men that enter into thoſe Armies, whether Officers or Souldiers, as if they were obliged to ſhow themſelves new Creatures, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61706:18"/>
regenerate, if before they were modeſt or ſober, immediately turn themſelves to all manner of Debauchery and Wickedneſs, committing all kind of Injuſtice and Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt poor and defenceleſs People. Now tho the natural Temper of our Men be more juſt and honeſt than that of the French, or of any other People, yet may it not be feared, that ſuch bad Manners may prove contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? And if ſuch Manners do not fit Men to enſlave a Nation, Devils only muſt do it. On the other hand, if it ſhould happen that the Officers of Standing Armies in Britain ſhould live with greater Regularity and Modeſty than was ever yet ſeen in that ſort of Men, it might very probably fall out, that being quarter'd in all Parts of the Country, ſome of them might be returned Members of Parliament for divers of the Electing Boroughs; and of what Conſequence that would be, I leave all Men to judg. So that whatever be the Conduct of a Mercenary Army, we can never be ſecure as long as any ſuch Force is kept up in Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61706:18"/>
But the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers for a Standing Army will ſay; Will you turn ſo many Gentlemen to ſtarve, who have faithfully ſerv'd the Government? This Queſtion I allow to be founded upon ſome reaſon. For it ought to be acknowledg'd in juſtice to our Souldiery, that on all occaſions, and in all actions, both Officers and Souldiers have done their part; and therefore I think it may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that all Officers and Souldiers of above forty years, in conſideration of their unfitneſs to apply themſelves at that age to any other Employment, ſhould be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the bounty of both Parliaments.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I do not ſee by what Rules of good Policy any Mercenary Forces have been connived at either in Scotland, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or Ireland. Sure, 'tis allowing the diſpenſing Power in the moſt eſſential Point of the Conſtitution of Government in theſe Nations.</p>
            <p>Scotland and England are Nations that were formerly very jealous of Liberty; of which there are many remarkable Inſtances in the Hiſtories of theſe Countries. And we may hope that the late Revolution having given
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61706:19"/>
ſuch a blow to Arbitary power in theſe Kingdoms, they will be very careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Rights and Privileges. And ſure it is not very ſutable to theſe, that any Standing Forces be kept up in Britain: or that there ſhould be any Scots, Engliſh, or Iriſh Regiments maintained in Ireland, or any where abroad; or Regiments of any Nation at the charge of England. I ſhall not ſay how readily the Regiments that were in the ſervice of Holland, came over againſt the Duke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth: He was a Rebel, and did not ſucceed. But we all know with what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition the Iriſh Mercenary Forces were brought into Britain to oppoſe his preſent Majeſty in that glorious Enterprize for our Deliverance.</p>
            <p>The Subjects formerly had a real Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for their Liberty, by having the Sword in their own hands. That Security, which is the greateſt of all others, is loſt; and not only ſo, but the Sword is put into the hand of the King by his Power over the Militia. All this is not enough; but we muſt have in both Kingdoms Standing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61706:19"/>
Armies of Mercenaries, who for the moſt part have no other way to ſubſiſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are capable to execute any Commands: And yet every Man muſt think his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſafe as ever, under pain of being thought diſaffected to the Monarchy. But ſure it muſt not be the antient limited and legal Monarchies of Scotland and England, that theſe Gentlemen mean. It muſt be a French Faſhion of Monarchy, where the King has power to do what he pleaſes, and the People no ſecurity for any thing they poſſeſs. We have quitted our antient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and put the Militia into the power of the King. The only remaining Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we have is, That no Standing Armies were ever yet allowed in time of Peace, the Parliament of England having ſo often and ſo expreſly declared them to be contrary to Law: and that of Scotland having not only declar'd them to be a Grievance, but made the keeping them up an Article in the Forfeiture of the late King James. If a Standing Army be allow'd, What Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will there be between the Government we ſhall then live under, and any kind of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61706:20"/>
Government under a good Prince? Of which there have been ſome in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick Tyrannies. If theſe be limited and not abſolute Monarchies, then, as there are Conditions, ſo there ought to be Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on both ſides. The Barons never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that their Militia's ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly on foot, and together in Bodies in times of Peace. 'Tis evident that would have ſubverted the Conſtitution, and made every one of them a petty Tyrant. And 'tis as evident, that Standing Forces are the fitteſt Inſtruments to make a Tyrant. Whoever is for making the King's Power too great or too little, is an Enemy to the Monarchy. But to give him Standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, puts his Power beyond controul, and conſequently makes him abſolute. If the People had any other real Security for their Liberty than that there be no Standing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in time of Peace, there might be ſome colour to demand them. But if that only remaining Security be taken away from the People, we have deſtroyed theſe Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61706:20"/>
'Tis pretended, we are in hazard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaded by a powerful Enemy; ſhall we therefore deſtory our Government? What is it then that we would defend? It is our Perſons, by the ruin of our Government? In what then ſhall we be gainers? In ſaving our Lives by the loſs of our Liberties? If our Pleaſures and Luxury make us live like Brutes, it ſeems we muſt not pretend to reaſon any better than they. I would fain know, if there be any other way of making a Prince Abſolute, than by allowing him a Standing Army: if by it all Princes have not been made Abſolute; if without it, any. Whether our Enemies ſhall conquer us is uncertain; but whether Standing Armies will enſlave us, neither Reaſon nor Experience will ſuffer us to doubt. 'Tis therefore evident, that no pretence of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from abroad, can be an Argument to keep up Standing Armies, or any Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Forces.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider whether we may not be able to defend our ſelves by well-regulated Militia's againſt any Foreign Force, tho never ſo formidable: that theſe Nations
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61706:21"/>
may be free from the fears of Invaſion from abroad, as well as from the danger of Slavery at home.</p>
            <p>After the Barons had loſt the Military Service of their Vaſſals, Militia's of ſome kind or other were eſtabliſhed in moſt parts of Europe. But the Prince having eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where the power of naming and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Officers of theſe Militia's, they could be no Balance in Government as the former were. And he that will conſider what has been ſaid in this Diſcourſe, will eaſily perceive that the eſſential Quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſuch a Militia, as might fully anſwer the Ends of the former, muſt be, that the Officers ſhould be named and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, as well as they and the Souldiers paid, by the People that ſet them out. So that if Princes look upon the preſent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia's as not capable of defending a Nation againſt Foreign Armies; the People have little reaſon to entruſt them with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Liberties.</p>
            <p>And tho upon the diſſolution of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Militia under the Barons, which made theſe Nations ſo Great and Glorious, by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61706:21"/>
ſetting up Militia's generally through Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, the Sword came not into the hands of the Commons; which was the only thing could have continued the former Balance of Government, but was every-where put into the hands of the King: Nevertheleſs ambitious Princes, who aimed at Abſolute Power, thinking they could never uſe it effectually to that end, unleſs it were wielded by Mercenaries, and Men that had no other Intereſt in the Commonwealth than their Pay, have ſtill endeavoured by all means to diſcredit Militia's, and render them bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom to the People, by never ſuffering them to be upon any right, or ſo much as tolerable Foot, and all to perſwade the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Standing Forces. And indeed they have ſucceeded too well in this Deſign: For the greateſt part of the World has been fool'd into an opinion, That a Militia can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made ſerviceable. I ſhall not ſay 'twas only Militia's could conquer the World; and that Princes to have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded fully in the Deſign before-mentioned, muſt have deſtroyed all the Hiſtory and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Antient Governments, where the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61706:22"/>
Accounts of ſo many excellent Models of Militia are yet extant. I know the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and Ignorance of the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Art of War, as it was prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Antients; tho what remains of that Knowledg in their Writings be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give a mean Opinion of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Diſcipline. For this reaſon I ſhall examine, by what has paſſed of late Years in theſe Nations, whether Experience have convinced us, that Officers bred in Foreign Wars, be ſo far preferable to others who have been under no other Diſcipline than that of an ordinary and ill-regulated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia; and if the Commonalty of both Kingdoms, at their firſt entrance upon Service, be not as capable of a reſolute Military Action, as any Standing Forces. This doubt will be fully reſolved, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Actions of the Marqueſs of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſe, which may be compared, all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered, with thoſe of Ceſar, as well for the Military Skill, as the bad ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of them; tho the Marqueſs had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerved abroad, nor ſeen any Action, before the ſix Victories, which, with Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61706:22"/>
much inferior to thoſe of his Enemies, he obtained in one Year; and the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of them were chiefly gained by the aſſistance of the Tenants and Vaſſals of the Family of Gordon. The Battel of Naſeby will be a farther illuſtration of this matter, which is generally thought to have been the deciding Action of the late Civil War. The Number of Forces was equal on both ſides; nor was there any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the Ground, or extraordinary Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that happened during the Fight, which could be of conſiderable Importance to either. In the Army of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nine only of the Officers had ſerved abroad, and moſt of the Souldiers were Prentices drawn out of London but two months before. In the King's Army there were above a thouſand Officers that had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Foreign parts: Yet was that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my routed and broken by thoſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſed Prentices; who were obſerved to be obedient to Command, and brave in Fight; not only in that Action, but on all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons during that active Campagn. The People of theſe Nations are not a daſtardly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61706:23"/>
Crew, like thoſe born in Miſery under Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Slavery, who muſt have time to rub off that Fear, Cowardice and Stupidity which they bring from home. And tho Officers ſeem to ſtand in more need of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience than private Souldiers; yet in that Battel it was ſeen, that the Sobriety and Principle of the Officers on the one ſide, prevailed over the Experience of thoſe on the other.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known that divers Regiments of our Army lately in Flanders have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been once in Action, and not one half of them above thrice, nor any of them five times during the whole War. O, but they have been under Diſcipline, and accuſtomed to obey! And ſo may men in Militia's. We have had to do with an Enemy, who, tho abounding in numbers of excellent Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, yet durſt never fight us without a viſible Advantage. Is that Enemy like to invade us, when he muſt be unavoidably neceſſitated to put all to hazard in ten days, or ſtarve?</p>
            <p>A good Militia is of ſuch Importance to a Nation, that it is the chief part of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61706:23"/>
Conſtitution of any free Government. For tho as to other things, the Conſtitution be never ſo ſlight, a good Militia will always preſerve the publick Liberty. But in the beſt Conſtitution that ever was, as to all other parts of Government; if the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia be not upon a right foot, the Liberty of that people muſt periſh. The Militia of Antient Rome, the beſt that ever was in any Government, made her Miſtreſs of the World: But Standing Armies inſlaved that great. People, and their excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia and Freedom periſhed together. The Lacedemonians continued 800 Years free, and in great Honour, becauſe they had a good Militia. The Swiſſes at this day are the freeſt, happieſt, and the People of all Europe who can beſt defend themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have the beſt Militia.</p>
            <p>I have ſhown that Liberty in the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Governments of Europe, ſubſiſted ſo long as the Militia of the Barons was on foot: And that on the decay of their Militia, (which tho it was none of the beſt, ſo was it none of the worſt) Standing Forces and Tyranny have been every-where introduc'd,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61706:24"/>
unleſs in Britain and Ireland; which by reaſon of their ſituation, having the Sea for Frontier, and a powerful Fleet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, could afford no pretence for ſuch Forces. And tho any Militia, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſlightly conſtituted, be ſufficient for that reaſon to defend us; yet all Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Conſtitution of Militia's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further Securities for the Liberty of the People, I think we ought to endeavour the amendment of them, and till that can take place, to make the preſent Militia's uſeful in the former and ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>That the whole free People of any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be exerciſed to Arms, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Example of our Anceſtors, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Acts of Parliament made in both Kingdoms to that purpoſe, and that of the wiſeſt Governments among the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; but the advantage of chuſing out of great numbers, ſeems clearly to demonſtrate. For in Countries where Husbandry, Trade, Manufactures, and other mechanical Arts are carried on, even in time of War; the Impediments of men are ſo many and ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61706:24"/>
various, that unleſs the whole People be exerciſed, no conſider able numbers of men can be drawn out, without diſturbing thoſe Employments, which are the Vitals of the Political Body. Beſides, that upon great Defeats, and under extream Calamities, from which no Government was ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, every Nation ſtands in need of all the People, as the Antients ſometimes did of their Slaves. And I cannot ſee, why Arms ſhould be denied to any man who is not a Slave, ſince they are the only true Badges of Liberty; and ought never, but in times of utmoſt Neceſſity, to be put into the hands of Mercenaries or Slaves: neither can I underſtand, why any man that has Arms, ſhould not be taught the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>By the Conſtitution of the preſent Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in both Nations, there is but a ſmall number of the men able to bear Arms ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed; and Men of Quality and Eſtate, are allowed to ſend any wretohed Servant in their place: ſo that they themſelves are become mean, by being diſuſed to handle Arms; and will not learn the uſe of them,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61706:25"/>
becauſe they are aſhamed of their Ignorance: by which means the Militia's being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only of Servants, theſe Nations ſeem altogether unfit to defend themſelves, and Standing Forces to be neceſſary. Now can it be ſuppoſed that a few Servants will fight for the defence of their Maſters Eſtates, if their Maſters only look on? Or that ſome inconſiderable Freeholders, as for the moſt part thoſe who command the Militia are, ſhould, at the head of thoſe Servants, expoſe their Lives for men of more plentiful Eſtates, without being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisted by them? No Bodies of Military Men can be of any force or value, unleſs many Perſons of Quality or Education be among them; and ſuch men ſhould bluſh to think of excuſing themſelves from ſerving their Country, at leaſt for ſome Years, in a military Capacity, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that every Roman was obliged to ſpend fifteen Years of his Life in their Armies. Is it not a ſhame that any man who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes an Eſtate, and is at the ſame time healthful and young, ſhould not fit himſelf by all means for the defence of that, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61706:25"/>
his Country, rather than to pay Taxes to maintain a Mercenary, who tho he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him during a War, will be ſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and enſlave him in time of Peace. Men muſt not think that any Country can be in a conſtant poſture of Defence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome trouble and charge; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis better to undergo this, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Liberty with Honour, than to be ſubjected to heavy Taxes, and yet have it inſolently raviſhed from us, to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Oppreſſion, and the laſting Miſery of our Poſterity. But it will be ſaid, Where are the men to be found who ſhall exerciſe all this People in ſo many ſeveral places at once? for the Nobility and Gentry know nothing of the matter; and to hire ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souldiers of Fortune, as they call them, will be chargeable, and may be dangerous, theſe men being all Mercenaries, and always the ſame men, in the ſame Truſts: Beſides that the employing ſuch men would not be ſutable to the Deſign, of breeding the Men of Quality and Eſtate to command, as well as the others to obey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61706:26"/>
To obviate theſe Difficulties; and becauſe the want of a good Model of Militia, and a right Method for training people in time of Peace, ſo as they need not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any War, tho never ſo ſudden, is at this day the bane of the Liberty of Europe, I ſhall propoſe one, accommodated to the invincible Difficulty of bringing Men of Quality and Eſtate, or men of any Rank, who have paſſed the time of Youth, to the uſe of Arms; and new, becauſe tho we have many excellent Models of Militia, delivered to us by antient Authors, with reſpect to the uſe of them in time of War, yet they give us but little information concerning the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods by which they trained their whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for War in time of Peace; ſo that if the Model which I ſhall propoſe, have not the Authority of the Antients to recommend it, yet perhaps by a ſevere Diſcipline, and a right method of diſpoſing the minds of men, as well as forming their bodies, for military and vertuous Actions, it may have ſome reſemblance of their excellent Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61706:26"/>
What I would offer is, that four Camps be formed, one in Scotland, and three in England; into which all the young men of the reſpective Countries ſhould enter, on the firſt day of the two and twentieth Year of their Age; and remain there the ſpace of two Years, if they be of Fortunes ſufficient to maintain themſelves; but if they are not, then to remain a Year only, at the Expence of the Publick. In this Camp they ſhould be taught the uſe of all ſorts of Arms, with the neceſſary Evolutions; as alſo Wreſtling, Leaping, Swimming, and the like Exerciſes. He whoſe condition would permit him to buy and maintain a Horſe, ſhould be obliged ſo to do, and be taught to vault, to ride, and to manage his own Horſe. This Camp ſhould ſeldom remain above eight days in one place, but remove from Heath to Heath; not only upon the account of cleanlineſs and health, but to teach the Youth to fortify a Camp, to march, and to accuſtom them (reſpect being always had to thoſe of a weak Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution) to carry as much in their march as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61706:27"/>
ever any Roman Souldier did; that is to ſay, Their Tents, Proviſion, Arms, Armour, their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils, and the Palizadoes of their Camp. They ſhould be taught to Forage, and be obliged to uſe the Countrymen with all juſtice in their Bargains, for that and all other things they ſtand in need of from them. The Food of every man within the Camp ſhould be the ſame; for Bread they ſhould have only Wheat, which they are to be obliged to grind with Hand-mills; they ſhould have ſome Salt, and a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beeves allowed them at certain times of the Year. Their Drink ſhould be Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſometimes tempered with a proportion of Brandy, and at other times with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Their Clothes ſhould be plain, coarſe, and of a faſhion ſitted in every thing for the Fatigue of a Camp. For all theſe things thoſe who could, ſhould pay; and thoſe who could not, ſhould be defray'd by the Publick, as has been ſaid. The Camp ſhould be ſometimes divided into two parts, which ſhould remove from each other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles, and ſhould break up again at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61706:27"/>
the ſame time, in order to meet upon ſome mountainous, mariſhy, woody, or in a word, croſs ground; that not only their diligence, patience, and ſuffering in marches, but their skill in ſeizing of Grounds, poſting bodies of Horſe and Foot, and advancing towards each other; their chuſing a Camp, and drawing out of it in order to a Battel, might be ſeen, as well as what Orders of Battel they would form upon the variety of different Grounds. The Perſons of Quality or Eſtate ſhould likewiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in Fortification, Gunnery, and all things belonging to the Duty of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier: And Forts ſhould be ſometimes built by the whole Camp, where all the Arts of attacking and defending Places ſhould be practiſed. The Youth having been taught to read at Schools, ſhould be obliged to read at ſpare hours ſome excellent Hiſtories, but chiefly thoſe in which Military Actions are beſt deſcribed; with the Books that have been beſt written concerning the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Art. Speeches exhorting to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and vertuous Actions, ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61706:28"/>
compoſed, and pronounced publickly by ſuch of the Youth as were, by Education and natural Talents, qualified for it. There being none but Military Men allowed within the Camp, and no Churchmen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that number, ſuch of the Youth as may be fit to exhort the reſt to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Moral Duties, chiefly to Humility, Modeſty, Charity, and the pardoning of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Injuries, ſhould be choſen to do it every Sunday, and the reſt of that day ſpent in reading Books, and in converſation direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſame end. And all this under ſo ſevere and rigorous Orders, attended with ſo exact an execution by Reward and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that no Officer within the Camp ſhould have the power of pardoning the one, or withholding the other. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhould be all honorary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſute the Nature of the different good Qualities and Degrees in which any of the Youth had ſhown, either his Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Obedience, Patience in ſuffering, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Diligence, Addreſs, Invention, Judgment, Temper or Valour. The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61706:28"/>
ſhould be much more rigorous than thoſe inflicted for the ſame Crimes by the Law of the Land. And there ſhould be Puniſhments for ſome things, not liable to any by the common Law, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt and inſolent Words or Actions, Gaming, and the like. No Woman ſhould be ſuffered to come within the Camp, and the Crimes of abuſing their own Bodies any manner of way, puniſhed with death. All theſe things to be judged by their own Councils of War; and thoſe Councils to have for rule, certain Articles drawn up and approved by the reſpective Parliaments. The Officers and Maſters, for inſtructing and teaching the Youth, in all the exerciſes above-mentioned, ſhould upon the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of ſuch a Camp, be the moſt expert men in thoſe Diſciplines; and brought by incouragements from all places of Europe; due care being taken that they ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the youth with foreign Manners. But afterwards they ought to conſiſt of ſuch Men of quality or fortune as ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for that end, out of thoſe who had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61706:29"/>
formerly paſt two years in the Camp, and ſince that time had improved themſelves in the Wars; who upon their return ſhould be obliged to ſerve two years in that Station. As for the numbers of thoſe Officers, or Maſters; their ſeveral duties; that of the Camp-Maſter-General, and of the Commiſſaries; the times and manner of Exerciſe, with divers other particulars of leſs conſideration, and yet neceſſary to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, in order to put ſuch a deſign in execution, for brevity's ſake I omit them, as eaſy to be reſolved. But certainly it were no hard matter, for men that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through ſuch a Diſcipline as that of the Camp I have deſcribed, to retain it after they ſhould return to their ſeveral homes; if the people of every Town and Village, together with thoſe of the adjacent Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were obliged to meet 50 times in the Year, on ſuch days as ſhould be found moſt convenient; and exerciſe four hours every time: for all men being inſtructed in what they are to do; and the men of quality and eſtate moſt knowing, and expert of all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61706:29"/>
others, the Exerciſe might be performed in great perfection. There might alſo be year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Summer time, a Camp of ſome thouſands of the neareſt Neighbours brought and kept together for a week to do thoſe Exerciſes, which cannot be performed in any other place: every Man of a certain Eſtate being obliged to keep a Horſe fit for the War. By this means it would be eaſy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion, tho never ſo ſmall (as for example, the keeping of the Peace, and putting the Laws in execution where force is neceſſary) or never ſo great and ſudden (as upon account of Invaſions and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies) to bring together ſuch numbers of Officers and Souldiers as the exigence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, according to the practice of antient Rome; which in this particular might be imitated by us without difficulty: And if ſuch a Method were once eſtabliſhed, there would be no neceſſity of keeping up a Militia form'd into Regiments of Foot and Horſe in time of Peace. Now if this Militia ſhould ſtand in need of any farther improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (becauſe no Militia's ſeem compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61706:30"/>
to thoſe exerciſed in actual War; as that of the Barons by their conſtant Feuds; and that of Rome, and ſome other anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Commonwealths, by their perpetual Wars) a certain ſmall number of Forces might be employed in any foreign Country where there ſhould be action; a fourth part of which might be changed every year; that all thoſe who had in this manner acquired experience, might be diſperſed among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Regiments of any Army, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of theſe Countries ſhould at any time call for; which would ſerve to confirm and give aſſurance to the reſt. Such a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia would be of no great expence to theſe Nations; for the mean clothing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for thoſe who could not maintain themſelves, being given only for one year, would amount to little; and no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence would be needful, except for their Arms, a ſmall train of Artillery for each Camp, and what is to be given for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the firſt Officers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:61706:30"/>
A Militia upon ſuch a foot, would have none of the infinite and inſuperable Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties there are, to bring a few Men who live at a great diſtance from one another, frequently together to exerciſe; at which conſequently they muſt be from home every time ſeveral days: of finding ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Maſters, as are neceſſary to train ſo many thouſands of People ignorant of all exerciſe, in ſo many different places, and for the moſt part at the ſame time: It would have none of thoſe innumerable Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and unneceſſary Expences, with which a Militia formed into Regiments of Foot and Horſe in time of Peace is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In ſuch a Camp the youth would not only be taught the exerciſe of a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket with a few Evolutions, which is all that men in ordinary Militia's pretend to, and is the leaſt part of the duty of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; but beſides a great many Exerciſes to ſtrengthen and diſpoſe the Body for fight, they would learn to fence, to ride, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage a Horſe for the War; to forage and live in a Camp; to fortify, attack, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61706:31"/>
any place; and what is no leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to undergo the greateſt Toils, and to give obedience to the ſevereſt Orders. Such a Militia by ſending beyond Seas certain Proportions of it, and relieving them from time to time, would enable us to aſſiſt our Allies more powerfully than by Standing Armies we could ever do. Such a Camp would take away the great difficulty of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of all Conditions, who have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the time of their youth, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the uſe and exerciſe of Arms; and beginning with them early, when like wax they may be moulded into any ſhape, would diſpoſe them to place their greateſt Honour in the performance of thoſe Exerciſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with the Fires of Military Glory, to which that Age is ſo enclined; which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion being made upon their youth, would laſt as long as life. Such a Camp would be as great a School of Vertue as of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcipline: In which the Youth would learn to ſtand in need of few things; to be content with that ſmall allowance which nature requires; to ſuffer, as well as to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61706:31"/>
act; to be modeſt, as well as brave; to be as much aſhamed of doing any thing inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or injurious, as of turning their back upon an Enemy; they would learn to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Injuries done to themſelves, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with joy the occaſions of dying to revenge thoſe done to their Country: And Vertue imbib'd in younger years would caſt a Flavour to the utmoſt periods of life. In a word they would learn greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than the Military Art, and more neceſſary too, if any thing can be more neceſſary than the defence of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Such a Militia might not only defend a People living in an Iſland, but even ſuch as are placed in the midſt of the moſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nations of the World.</p>
            <p>Now till ſuch a Militia may be brought to ſome perfection, our preſent Militia is not only ſufficient to defend us; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Circumſtances of the French Affairs, eſpecially with relation to Spain, Britain cannot juſtly apprehend an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if the Fleet of England, to which Scotland furniſh'd during the late War
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61706:32"/>
ſeven or eight thouſand Seamen, were in ſuch order as it ought to be. And it can never be the Intereſt of theſe Nations to take any other ſhare in preſerving the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Europe, than what may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by our Fleet. By which means our Money will be ſpent amongst our ſelves, our Trade preſerved to ſupport the Charge of the Navy; our Enemies totally driven out of the Sea, and great numbers of their Forces diverted from oppoſing the Armies of our Allies abroad, to the defence of their own Coaſts.</p>
            <p>If this Method had been taken in the late War, I preſume it would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not only more advantagious to us, but alſo more ſerviceable to our Allies than that which was followed. And 'tis in vain to ſay, that at this rate we ſhall have no Allies at all: For the weaker Party on the Continent muſt be contented to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Aſſistance in the manner we think fit to give it, or inevitably periſh. But if we ſend any Forces beyond the Seas to join thoſe of our Allies, they ought to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61706:32"/>
be part of our Militia, as has been ſaid, and not Standing Forces; otherwiſe, at the end of every War, the preſent ſtruggle will recur, and at one time or other theſe Nations will be betrayed, and a Standing Army eſtabliſhed: So that nothing can ſave us from following the Fate of all the other Kingdoms in Europe, but putting our Truſt altogether in our Fleet and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia's, and having no other Forces than theſe. The Sea is the only Empire which can naturally belong to us. Conqueſt is not our Intereſt, much leſs to conſume our People and Treaſure in conquering for others.</p>
            <p>To conclude; If we ſeriouſly conſider the happy Condition of theſe Nations, who have lived ſo long under the Bleſſings of Liberty, we cannot but be affected with the moſt tender Compaſſion to think that the Scots, who have for ſo many Ages, with ſuch Reſolution, defended their Liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Picts, Britans, Romans, Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Danes, Iriſh, Normans, and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61706:33"/>
as well as againſt the Violence and Tyranny of ſo many of their own Princes: That the Engliſh, who whatever Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their Country has been ſubject to, have ſtill maintained their Rights and Liberties againſt all Attempts; who poſſeſs a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, every where cultivated and improved by the Induſtry of rich Husbandmen; her Rivers and Harbours filled with Ships; her Cities, Towns, and Villages, enrich'd with Manufactures; where Men of vaſt Eſtates live in ſecure poſſeſſion of them; and whoſe Merchants live in as great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor as the Nobility of other Nations: that Scotland which has a Gentry born to excel in Arts and Arms: that England which has a Commonalty, not only ſurpaſſing all thoſe of that degree which the World can now boaſt of, but alſo thoſe of all former Ages, in Courage, Honeſty, good Senſe, Induſtry, and Generoſity of Temper; in whoſe very Looks there are ſuch viſible Marks of a free and liberal Education; which Advantages cannot be imputed to the Climate, or to any other Cauſe, but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61706:33"/>
the Freedom of the Government under which they live: I ſay, it cannot but make the Hearts of all honeſt Men bleed to think, that in their Days the Felicity and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch Countries muſt come to a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, if the Parliaments do not prevent it, and his Majeſty be not prevailed upon to lay aſide the Thoughts of Mercenary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which if once eſtabliſhed, will ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably produce thoſe fatal Conſequences that have always attended ſuch Forces in the other Kingdoms of Europe; Violation of Property, Decay of Trade, Oppreſſion of the Country by heavy Taxes and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the utmoſt Miſery and Slavery of the poorer ſort, the Ruin of the Nobility by their Expences in Court and Army, Deceit and Treachery in all Ranks of Men, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Want and Neceſſity. Then ſhall we ſee the Gentry of Scotland, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant through want of Education, and cowardly by being oppreſſed; then ſhall we ſee the once happy Commonalty of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land become baſe and abject, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expoſed to the brutal Inſolence of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61706:34"/>
the Souldiers; the Women debauch'd by their Luſt; ugly and naſty through Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and the want of things neceſſary to preſerve their natural Beauty. Then ſhall we ſee that great City, the Pride and Glory, not only of our Iſland, but of the World, ſubjected to the exceſſive Impoſitions Paris now lies under, and reduced to a Pedling Trade, ſerving only to foment the Luxury of a Court. Then will Britain know what Obligations ſhe has to thoſe who are for Mercenary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
