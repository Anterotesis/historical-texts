            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Yea, and to them it may ſeem ſo too; but I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
the myſtery of this <hi>Vindication-Book,</hi> if I miſtake not the

                  <note place="margin">Fol. 59.</note> Some <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>poſitions</hi> of <hi>Separation,</hi> which
if fomented, as the <hi>Author</hi> inſinuates, may in time ſubvert the
other <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as indeed they may, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inconſiſtent, and of a better and more ſpirituall nature;
and I am of his opinion, for I would have all of a <hi>colour</hi> and
<hi>conſtitution, All light,</hi> or <hi>all darkneſſe;</hi> and beleeve it, your
<hi>principles</hi> of a purer way, will not long incorporate with any
other; the <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Dagon</hi> will not ſtand together, and the
way to overthrow the inventions of men, is by taking in ſome
<hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> into <hi>traditions;</hi> what hath made the
<hi>Popiſh Hierarchy</hi> go down? Not its own <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Will-worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny:</hi> But when there were ſome
takings in of <hi>Reformation-principles,</hi> as when they would go
from <hi>Popery</hi> to <hi>Prelacy, Popery</hi> fell much in the <hi>power</hi> of it;
and ſo when from <hi>Prelacy</hi> they went off to <hi>Presbytery, Prelacy</hi>
fell, and ſo on: If you make any remove from the common
<hi>principles</hi> of this <hi>Presbytery,</hi> into any of the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>parts</hi> of
the <hi>Separation,</hi> your <hi>Presbytery</hi> will down too, becauſe it takes

            <sp>
               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>But if theſe be then the common Principles of this
<hi>Presbyteriall</hi> way, as he would have it to communicate in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
thus mixedly, and to ſuſpect no <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> in any
<hi>ſpiritual Communion</hi> from perſons ſo communicating, though
of never ſo <hi>unreformed a life,</hi> excepting onely ſome <hi>pretended
formall flaſhy apparences</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> put on and off
by the <hi>Communicants,</hi> as occaſion ſerves; I ſhall have I think

                  <hi>But the grounds are yet further laid down in the Book,
that</hi> unmixt Communions, <hi>and</hi> ſuspending from the Sacrament,
are grounds of Schiſm; <hi>and that the</hi> teaching <hi>of</hi> theſe formerly,

and preached againſt.</p>

               <p>I perceive then in a word, That the main thing the
<hi>Vindication-Book</hi> drives at, is, to place <hi>Presbytery</hi> upon ſuch a
<hi>mixed uniformity</hi> in the partaking of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> that there
ſhould be no <hi>act</hi> of <hi>ſuspenſion</hi> or <hi>ſeparation</hi> practiſed in their
<hi>Church,</hi> leſt the <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>ſeparation</hi> get in; and they that
make conſcience to ſeparate or ſuſpend in ſome particulars, it
implies, they may go on to a further <hi>ſeparation,</hi> till upon more
degrees of <hi>purity</hi> in <hi>communicating,</hi> they go off from all kinde
of <hi>mixt communicatings,</hi> in the <hi>conſtituting,</hi> as well <hi>Churches,</hi>
as <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Administrations,</hi> and ſo at length become,
either Congregationall, or of the other way.</p>
               <p>But many of us took ſuch of the Presbyteriall way, as writ
and taught, for a pure <hi>Reformation</hi> in partaking of <hi>Ordinances,</hi>
for the better, according to their <hi>light:</hi> And it ſeems they are
but novices, as we may gather from the <hi>Vindication-Book,</hi> and
are ignorant of his <hi>Presbyteriall ſecret,</hi> or <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>uniformity,</hi>
and <hi>unmixt communicating,</hi> according to the <hi>grounds</hi> there.</p>
               <p>Well, I am yet of the purer ſide, I like not this <hi>myſtery,</hi> if
the way to keep out Schiſm be of ſuch a kinde, as draws with
it an <hi>unavoidable neceſſity</hi> of partaking with all <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>ſinners,</hi>
except onely for ſome preſent <hi>affected paſſions of Faith</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
and a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all <hi>ſorts</hi> of that kinde, except by
<hi>excommunication,</hi> where in ſome places whole <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and
almoſt in all <hi>Pariſhes</hi> many muſt ſtand, either <hi>excommunicated</hi>
by the <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Reformed,</hi> which is <hi>impoſſible,</hi>

For that Controverſie betwixt the Brethren,<note place="margin">Fol. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> which is,
Whether <hi>Judas</hi> received or not? I know there are divers
Leaves of Paper writ upon it in the <hi>Vindication,</hi> and many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men are quoted, and Scriptures brought in on both ſides,
and harmoniouſly compared; but ſince the Lord left it ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable,
as ſome imagine, we muſt not do in ſuch doubtfull
ſayings, as thoſe Diſciples did, who becauſe Chriſt ſaid of <hi>John,
If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> and <hi>it was
reported amongst the Diſciples, that that Diſciple ſhould not die,
though Christ ſaid not he ſhould not die:</hi> but onely, <hi>what if I will
that he tarry.</hi> So if the Lord hath not clearly ſaid, that <hi>Judas</hi>
was there, why goeth it ſo amongſt the Diſciples, as if he
were there without all contradiction? but if he were, and
Chriſt gave it to <hi>Judas,</hi> as for my part, I make it not any ſuch
ground, though he and all others do, becauſe it will not be
clear then, that he gave it to <hi>Judas</hi> as a wicked man, or a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
Diſciple; for I know Chriſt adminiſtred then as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Diſpenſer</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>chief Paſtour,</hi> and in his
Body unglorified, whereby he kept cloſe to the analogy of

               <p>If the Sacrament be onely a ſealing or confirming Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of true Grace, when and where it is already begun,
then it were altogether impertinent, and ineffectuall unto ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

thoſe.</p>

                  <head>Inference.</head>
                  <p>Whence we may infer, That the <hi>Sacrament</hi> being a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
Ordinance,</hi> may be given to all unregenerate perſons, in
or out of the Church; for if it be a <hi>converting Ordinance,</hi> the
conſequence lies clear; that no ſinners, of any ſort, kinde, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
condition, in or out of the Church, ought to be denied it;
nay, to have it adminiſtred, as well without the <hi>Word,</hi> as with
it, it being of equal power with the <hi>Word</hi> for <hi>converting,</hi> as
the <hi>Vindication</hi> ſaith; and that who holds otherwiſe, are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
And though there be a diſtinction premiſed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
to the <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>formall profeſſion,</hi> and a <hi>converting</hi> to a
<hi>ſpiritual ſincere Faith in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yet this diſtinction
makes not any thing againſt the Sacrament, to be given before
the Word, even for converſion to the firſt Faith, or faith from
Paganiſm; which neither <hi>Scriptures,</hi> nor <hi>practiſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or
any <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>his,</hi> from <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> and ſo down
through any age, to our own, that ever I could read on,
practiſed: and yet the principles laid down in <hi>Fol.</hi> 38. will
infer ſuch a conſequence, naturally and truly; for the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ſaith in <hi>Fol.</hi> 38. That the <hi>Word, and all Ordinances, are alike
for converſion;</hi> and if ſo, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> may be uſed as well
to convert from <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and adminiſtred ſingly by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as the <hi>Word</hi> by it ſelf may be taught.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Vindication</hi> ſaith, That it is doubleſſe to be
given to all, for elſe it had been an impertinent and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
thing to adminiſter to cloſe <hi>Hypocrites</hi> that are <hi>carnall
Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence we may infer; That, becauſe the Counſels of the
Lord in all his Adminiſtrations, do not clearly appear, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113259:11"/>
through the <hi>Vindictions</hi> own ſuppoſitions and premiſes;
therefore he concludes fully, That it were <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,</hi>
when as there appears no ſuch end at all in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of it, but rather two other ends.</p>
                  <p>One, which himſelf layes down, as occaſional or evidential,
<hi>for the damnation, and hardning ſome;</hi> though I ſcarce allow him
that, that Ordinances of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> are properly active
to condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The other, which he never thinks on in his Book, is this,
That God having left no infallible rule for diſcerning, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it yet by a pure Goſpel rule, which if wicked men will
come up to, they hazard greater condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Further we may infer, That things may be called <hi>impertinent</hi>
and <hi>ineffectual,</hi> which are inſtituted of the Lord, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the Lords inſtitution appear not to us; and that we may
put our own ſuppoſitions and ends upon any adminiſtration
in the Word, when his ends are not clear to us; nay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
againſt any other end then that of our own conjecture,
or ſuppoſed probable reaſon; which I am confident is too too
groſſe to be in the learned <hi>Author Intentionally,</hi> though not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially</hi>
in his <hi>Vindication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ends which I clearly gather from the Analogy of
things in Gods diſpenſation, are theſe; Why the Sacrament,
though according to the inſtitution delivered to Hypocrites,
yet is no converting Ordinance?</p>
                  <p>God having left no infallible <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>diſcerning</hi> his, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Rule for outward evidences,</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> muſt either be
adminiſtred to all, walking according to the <hi>Rule of outward
evidences,</hi> or to none; and according to that Rule, Hypocrites
may come in, and do; yet that is no ſin to the <hi>Administrator</hi>
nor <hi>Communicants,</hi> ſo long as Adminiſtrations be ordered
according to that <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Gods End</hi> of his revealed Will
ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The work of ſifting, and reaping, of dividing
betwixt the Trees and the Wheat, the Sheep and the Goats, is
the work of the great day of the Son of man; and therefore,
though Ordinances be adminiſtred here to Hypocrites, yet at
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113259:12"/>
the time of the finall diſcerning the communicating of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
ſhall be viſited in judgement, and greater condemnation
upon them. So as there is no need of framing it into any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a converting Ordinance, leſt otherwiſe it prove im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
or ineffectual; for if the cloſe Hypocrites be finally
impenitent ones, God reckons for a greater ſin; if not, yet it
is no more impertinent then the Word is to all the children of
God, who yet never partake truly of it, till converted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the diſtinction of his into the firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Paganiſm to Faith; and ſecondly, from a formall
Faith to a true ſincere Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, which is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Stone in his building, is a diſtinction and certain degrees,
which we have not in any ſuch notion in the Word; nor if it
were, doth it appear that the Scriptures place adminiſtration
upon the bottom of any ſuch diſtinction, though he doth it?
But ſuppoſe I grant it, yet a <hi>formal profeſſion</hi> then, as he contends
for, and many other, was not <hi>ſuch</hi> as is now, ſince <hi>Kingdoms</hi>
were <hi>Christianized;</hi> but a profeſſion then, was according to
the <hi>Rule of evidence,</hi> till the contrary appeared, as in all the
firſt gathered Churches, as in <hi>Simon Magus, Ananias, &amp;c.</hi>
And formal profeſſion then, was as much as a kinde of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
profeſſion now; for then it was perſecution to take up an
Ordinance or name of Chriſt, and now it is faction on the
Law of the Land, as well as the Law of the God, to profeſſe
Chriſt; neither were the whole Counſels of the Spirit of
Chriſt brought forth then to make up the rule of evidences, as
afterwards; but they were brought forth by degrees, till the
whole Scriptures of the New Teſtament were finiſhed. And
we are now to take the whole Counſels of God concerning
Adminiſtrations, as laid down in the whole New Teſtament,
and not by parcels, though ſo much as they did profeſſe in the
firſt time of gathering, were rule enough then, to them, when
no more was revealed, yet not to us now, who have a full
Goſpel for our learning: And this miſtake or want of juſt
conſideration of times, and Scriptures, is the ground of all
the miſtakes.</p>

an inſtrument of converſion.</p>

               <p>5. Converſion is a turning of the whole man unto love,

and what engine more powerful for the forecited reſpects or

               <p>6. Experience in every Chriſtians conſcience, whoſe prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

                  <p>We may infer, upon the firſt, that there are ſoul-melting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
in a ſoul unconverted, or unmelted; and that there
are <hi>ſoul-changing</hi> meditations in a ſoul unchanged, which the
Scriptures never ſpeak on; ſuch <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>converſion</hi> are no
ways in the Word that we read on, but hidden paths for the
ſpirit, of mans deviſing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that becauſe <hi>afflictions</hi> are, therefore <hi>Sacraments</hi>
are: that is, becauſe one thing is, therefore another thing is:
This is but the <hi>Old Argument.</hi> But God may ſanctifie any thing
at his own pleaſure, to make way for <hi>Converſion,</hi> and yet that
no inſtituted Ordinance for converſion neither: Becauſe ſome
have been converted when afflicted, when ſick, when poor;
therefore will you firſt go afflict them, and make them ſick,
and poor, taking all they have from them, that you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them, and ſo make them ſtanding Ordinances?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Is</hi> a rule of contraries <hi>a rule in the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>or in</hi>
Logick? <hi>But it is ſaid,</hi> Worthy receiving is an inſtrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<hi>that is,</hi> Converſion is an means of converſion: <hi>who can
receive worthily, till in Chriſt, till</hi> converted?</p>
                  <p>4. But <hi>all the ends of it are ſpiritual, and how is it poſſible but
then it ſhould convert?</hi> This <hi>How is it poſſible?</hi> is like that of
<hi>Why ſhould it not?</hi> both of one ſtrength to prove it; for
though the ends be never ſo ſpiritual, yet if there be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for any ſuch <hi>inſtitution</hi> as <hi>converſion,</hi> all the reaſons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
or ſtrange conſequences, as all ſuch are, cannot <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
an <hi>Ordinance;</hi> none but God and Chriſt; and therefore
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Arguments built upon ſuch forreign and external
(though rational) conſequences, are not immediate nor intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal
enough to warrant any thing of their will-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>5. But <hi>it is a powerful engine:</hi> Yea, but onely for what it is
<hi>inſtituted</hi> and <hi>ordained;</hi> nor is it leſſe excellent, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
not, becauſe every thing is <hi>beautiful</hi> in its <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>place,</hi>
and <hi>law</hi> of <hi>creation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. But <hi>the experiences of Chriſtians witneſſe, who had never

                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>ſome had not been converted, if debarred from it.</hi> This is

                  <head>Inference.</head>
                  <p>Whence we may infer, That the <hi>Vindication,</hi> though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
in the <hi>general</hi> or <hi>face</hi> of it, to be for <hi>Presbytery,</hi> yet it is
very clear, that, in aſperſing the Government of all thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Kingdoms</hi> where the <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of it hath been,
it ſecretly <hi>wounds</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of it, in the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>world;</hi>
and though it pull not down the <hi>Government</hi> quite, yet it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the <hi>Poſts,</hi> or <hi>Judgements of men,</hi> on which it ſtands. I
name not here the other <hi>Texts</hi> that the <hi>Vindication</hi> hath pull'd
out of the building of the <hi>Presbyterial Government;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> fol. 3, &amp;c.</note> for the
taking out the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are like the pulling out the <hi>nalls</hi> and
<hi>pins</hi> from the <hi>houſe,</hi> and a looſning of the <hi>frame.</hi> This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
becauſe the <hi>Vindication</hi> profeſſes ſo for that Government;
though I ſuppoſe many <hi>ſuch friends,</hi> in time, might do as much
harm, if not more, then thoſe of the <hi>Separation,</hi> whom he
calls their <hi>enemies.</hi> Surely, I do believe, <hi>France, Germany,
Scotland</hi> had rather ſuch <hi>Books</hi> were not writ in their behalf,
that opens the evil, corruption, and grievances of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſo much.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall argue further: What need ſuch comparing of
the mixt <hi>Congregations</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> ours and theirs?
Surely they are all <hi>corrupt</hi> enough, and mixt enough; and a
<hi>Law</hi> for all ſorts of <hi>ſinners</hi> to <hi>communicate,</hi> as the <hi>Vindication</hi>
would have, would not much more <hi>reform,</hi> becauſe it would
then be a kinde of <hi>Church-priviledge</hi> to be a <hi>ſinner,</hi> or a <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
perſon;</hi> and to be ſomething <hi>notoriouſly wicked,</hi> would
be a way of <hi>enrighting</hi> them to <hi>Church-Ordinances,</hi> according to
the Principles of <hi>Vindication,</hi> however ſome fair <hi>pretences</hi> and
<hi>Colours</hi> are laid on, that we ſhould believe the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But what of all this? I believe there is another reaſon why
the Government hath brought forth no more <hi>power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
upon the <hi>Kindoms</hi> then the <hi>Vindication</hi> obſerves; becauſe
neither the <hi>Pariſhes</hi> are conſtituted, nor yet the Government,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113259:18"/>
according to <hi>Goſpel-order:</hi> yet I honour them as Believers, and
Brethren in the Lord, according to their light.</p>
                  <p>Yet I obſerve another <hi>ſecret,</hi> why the <hi>preaching of the Word</hi>
thrives better, and reforms more then the <hi>Government</hi> in theſe
Kingdoms, becauſe that <hi>the Preaching of the Word</hi> is an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
of the Lord; and when preached or held forth to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
ſcandalous, and notorious ſinners, is but according to
its right order of Inſtitution ſo preached; the <hi>end</hi> of the Lord
is but fully and clearly ſerved, becauſe the <hi>Word,</hi> in the <hi>miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of it, is appointed for a <hi>converting Ordinance;</hi> but the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> being not inſtituted as a <hi>converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi>
primarily, but for a <hi>people</hi> already <hi>converted</hi> and
brought in, it cannot be accompanied with ſuch <hi>power from
heaven,</hi> becauſe it is not managed according to <hi>pure Goſpel-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
nor upon a <hi>people</hi> rightly prepared and fitted: ſo as the
fault is not, becauſe there is a <hi>Government,</hi> as the <hi>Vindication</hi>
obſerves; but, not the <hi>pure Government,</hi> nor the <hi>Government</hi>
rightly placed.</p>
                  <p>And for his Charge againſt the <hi>purer Congregations,</hi> as I
know not any <hi>ſuch doings</hi> amongſt them; ſo I will make no
<hi>Apologie</hi> for them, becauſe that would bring them within the
compaſſe of ſomething like a crime; and I know nothing but
well by them.</p>

            <head>AN
Experimental-Argument
FOR PURE
Churches and Ordinances.</head>
            <p>THere is a ſpritual <hi>Antipathy</hi> betwixt <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature,
Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> luſting againſt the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> againſt the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> and the more <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> or more
<hi>carnal,</hi> the more theſe two contrary <hi>Natures</hi> work, and the
more powerfully againſt each other, as in <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and the leſſe or more they can bear with
each other: As for example: While <hi>Judas</hi> carnal nature or
diſpoſition, uninflamed by <hi>Satan,</hi> boyled and heightned not
into any ſuch <hi>groſſe act</hi> as <hi>ſelling</hi> and <hi>betraying</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the
<hi>diſciples</hi> bore with him more, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as he was
man, and in a ſtate of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> could more endure him, then
upon the breaking out of his <hi>ſin:</hi> and ſo in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in
<hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> whom the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> could
no longer ſuffer, not by way of <hi>diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>inflicting Cenſure,</hi>
but by way of a ſpiritual <hi>contrarineſſe</hi> to ſuch groſſe <hi>hypocriſie</hi>
and ſin diſcovered: And ſo the experiences of all that are of a
<hi>pure Goſpel-temper,</hi> will witneſſe to this very Age, in <hi>acts</hi> of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<hi>fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>Community,</hi> in all <hi>acts of Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is founded not onely <hi>ſpiritual antipathies</hi> and <hi>ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,</hi>
but in <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>civil; natural things</hi> of a <hi>contrary
nature</hi> bearing one another no leſſe; and <hi>things</hi> of a <hi>civil</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet <hi>contrary,</hi> doing the like.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſe <hi>ſeparations</hi> meerly <hi>natural,</hi> and <hi>ſenſitive,</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional:</hi>
Hence ariſes a <hi>particular Schiſm</hi> and <hi>ſeparation</hi> in all
the things of the world, and a ſecret <hi>gathering</hi> and <hi>contracting</hi>
of things from the <hi>contrary</hi> into the <hi>ſame</hi> kinde: the common
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113259:23"/>
               <hi>purity</hi> being loſt,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> as the Apoſtle implies, by which <hi>Nature</hi> did
at firſt more <hi>univerſally</hi> agree, as if one <hi>common ſpirit</hi> had been
in it. And thus it was in the Churches of God at firſt, when
<hi>three, four,</hi> or <hi>five thouſand</hi> did agree in one way of <hi>ſpiritual
fellowſhip, Doctrine, breaking of bread,</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi> but we
ſee there is not now ſuch <hi>pourings out of ſpirit</hi> upon <hi>multitudes</hi>
and <hi>Nations,</hi> that a <hi>National-Church</hi> ſhould be together in ſuch
a <hi>unity of ſpirit.</hi> And under the <hi>Law</hi> there was even a weaker
example in the people of the <hi>jews,</hi> being taken out from the
people of the world, and naturally hating all that were
<hi>common</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And before the <hi>Law,</hi>
the <hi>people of God</hi> did gather into <hi>Families</hi> and <hi>particular ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. And thoſe <hi>Families,</hi> the children of
the <hi>Bond-woman</hi> and of the <hi>free,</hi> never <hi>bearing</hi> but <hi>perſecuting</hi>
each other. So as all of <hi>pure ſpiritual conſtitution,</hi> cannot
but experimentally finde a <hi>ſpiritual nature</hi> in themſelves, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them into a more glorious fellowſhip then that of the
world.</p>

               <p>If then there be two contrary natures of <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fleſh;</hi>
if theſe cannot, nor never could, in <hi>experience</hi> of all <hi>Ages,</hi> and
according to the <hi>truth</hi> in <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>example</hi> of all there,
bear each other into the ſame <hi>ſpiritual ſociety</hi> or <hi>fellowſhip;</hi> if

            <head type="sub">Argument from the Power of Spiritual
Ordinances and Diſpenſations.</head>
            <p>THe Goſpel-Ordinances brought into the World a <hi>power,</hi>
and ſpiritual <hi>Law</hi> in them, though in degrees and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and ſeveral givings out, as in <hi>Johns</hi> time, and his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
in <hi>Chriſts</hi> own time, and his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirits</hi>
time; and according to theſe times of <hi>manifestation,</hi> believers
were wrought upon: in <hi>Johns</hi> time they came out to the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
of Water;</hi> in <hi>Chriſts</hi> and his Diſciples, to the preaching
of the Word; in the <hi>Spirits</hi> time, to the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
to a more <hi>mighty</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> working; and all theſe <hi>times</hi> of
<hi>Gospel-manifeſtation,</hi> had a prevailing <hi>loſſe,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> upon the
<hi>believers</hi> of theſe ſeveral times, in drawing them out from the
<hi>world</hi> in part, though weakly: <hi>in Johns time,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Then
come out unto him all Judea;</hi> yet though they were Baptiſed of
him, they gathered not off into ſuch particular ſocieties, as
after, <hi>The Kingdom of God then was but at hand in Chriſts time,</hi>
though his <hi>preaching</hi> was <hi>powerful,</hi> yet he let out the <hi>glory</hi> of
his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but ſometimes with the <hi>Word,</hi> reſerving his more
<hi>glorious manifestations</hi> for other <hi>times;</hi> and even here, though
<hi>Christs preaching</hi> gathered in his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> into
ſome particular, and neerer way to himſelf, yet not many
more; nay, he rather left many, partly in that <hi>mixed condition</hi>
of <hi>ſociety</hi> he found them; and ſo the <hi>Diſciples Commiſſion</hi>
which was given, was to <hi>preach</hi> but little yet of <hi>Church</hi>-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
but by way of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as in <hi>Matth. 16. and 18. The
Kingdom of God was but yet at hand, not come:</hi> In the <hi>Spirits
time,</hi> then the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> was come, and then a <hi>mighty
operation</hi> and <hi>meaſure</hi> of the Spirit was powred out, and then
the <hi>believers</hi> through the powerful working, were brought
more off from the <hi>World,</hi> and began to gather in <hi>cloſer</hi> to
<hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>one another.</hi> And now all power was given to
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was not before his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and now he ſets
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113259:24"/>
up a <hi>Kingdom;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> 
               <hi>All power is given into my hands;</hi> and now the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> begins to be ſet up in the hearts and practice of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 8, 11.</note>
and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>mold</hi> and <hi>caſt</hi> the <hi>believers</hi> into <hi>Brother hoods</hi>
and <hi>ſocieties,</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and now the
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual policy</hi> are given out for ordering this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
And we ſee how the <hi>people of God</hi> in <hi>Rome, Corinth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,
Galatia,</hi> drew off from the world, in the things of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>We ſee then how the <hi>Word</hi> did begin to work <hi>Believers</hi> into a
<hi>fellowſhip</hi> from the <hi>world;</hi> and the more the <hi>ſpirit</hi> was given, the
more and more off from the world, in all theſe ſeveral times:
And it is a rational truth, and a clear concluſion, even to meer
reaſon, that the more <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> is in any, the more
neer and cloſe they will gather up to <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>walkings</hi> with
God; and the more <hi>Chriſtward</hi> any one is, the more <hi>off</hi> ſtill
from the <hi>multitude</hi> of the <hi>world:</hi> And thus the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in which the <hi>Spirit</hi> breathes ſo powerfully,
work men off from the <hi>mixed world,</hi> into <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with the
<hi>Lord,</hi> and that <hi>ſpiritual fellowſhip</hi> makes them rejoyce more in
one another, then in any other that are more carnal: The
more men <hi>live</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the more they <hi>die</hi> to the <hi>world,</hi> and
are formed into the fellowſhip of his death and Reſurrection.</p>

               <p>If then the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi>
had ever a power, in ſome <hi>degree,</hi> of prevailing upon the <hi>ſouls</hi>
of <hi>Believers,</hi> according to the manifeſtation of the Spirit:

the more they muſt come off from the <hi>world:</hi>
               </p>
