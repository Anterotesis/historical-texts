         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An <hi>Introduction</hi> to the <hi>Arguments,</hi> ſhewing the cauſe of their writing.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Earing many corrupt doctrines delivered in <hi>Wool-Church</hi> by a ſtranger, where I am a Pariſhioner, the knowledge of the truth moved mee to write theſe eight Arguments, below ſpecified, thereby to vindicate Gods great Bounty and free Grace ſet forth to man-kinde by the Sacrament of the Bodie and Blood of our Lord, as well as by the Word preached. His Text was theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. affirming, that the Apoſtle here by the name <hi>man,</hi> ſpake only of a ſpirituall man; and that the Scriptures do in no place call a naturall man by the name of a man, alledging <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. to prove it, with divers other Scriptures: and affirmed, that naturall men, all of them always, are denominated by the name of beaſts, as <hi>Serpents,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 23.</note>
               <hi>Vipers, Wolves, Dogs, Swine,</hi> beaſts after the manner of men, &amp;c. Now to deliver this without the due diſtinction the Scriptures make, is very falſe, and contrary to our Lords own doctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Except a man be born again,</hi> &amp;c. meaning by the name <hi>man,</hi> a naturall man: as alſo the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. Now ſee his doctrine as ſtrange to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the Preacher was to mee; for it is beyond exception, that as our Lord, ſo his ſervant means by the name <hi>man,</hi> naturall men. And as the miſunderſtanding of the Scripture is the ground of all errour and ſchiſme; ſo from theſe premiſſes he drew this ſtrange concluſion, that one in nature, and unregenerated, ought not to be admitted to the Supper of the Lord: and becauſe hee had no plain Scripture that forbids a naturall man, which hath received the faith, to believe and to be baptized, therefore he falſly affirmed, that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. forbad the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> to come to his baptiſme; and ſo argued from the leſſer to the greater, that if Baptiſme which is the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, ought to be denyed to impenitent men, much more the Sacrament, which is the greater, ought to be denyed naturall men; and this hee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113149:4"/>
ſham'd not to affirm, although there be not one word in the Text of <hi>Johns</hi> denying the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and ſo went on to ſhew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſons why naturall men ought not to be admitted to the Lords Table: Firſt, ſaith hee, becauſe a naturall man cannot diſcern what the Sacrament ſhewes forth: Secondly, becauſe all naturall men are Serpents, Vipers, Dogs, Swine, cruell and ſavage beaſts, to whom the holy and precious things of the Sacrament ought not to be given; for naturall men, ſaith he, are no more capable of them, then the beaſts that periſh: Thirdly, becauſe all naturall men are forbidden to come, as Chriſt in another caſe ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23, 24. <hi>If thou bringeſt thy gift to the Altar, and remembreſt thy brother hath ought againſt thee; go firſt and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come,</hi> &amp;c. in which Reaſon this yong Miniſter did not remember that our Lord here ſpeaks of a brother, not naming him a naturall unregenerated man, neither is it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only of the Sacrament, for there we come rather to receive then give: Fourthly, becauſe, ſaith he, every naturall man that comes to the Sacrament, is that man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11, 12, 13. that had not on the wedding garment, who therefore ſpeechleſſe was caſt into utter darkneſſe; which if this be ſo, then all the unregenerate elect in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, are in that caſe and condition, ſo that none of them by his reaſoning ſhall be converted (if they receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but condemned, which is blaſphemy to affirme, and all that have heretofore received it, before regeneration, ſhall periſh: Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe whoſoever giveth the Sacrament to a wicked naturall man, doth therein caſt the childrens bread to Dogs: Sixtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sacrament was ordained only to confirme Grace, and not at all for the begetting of grace: as bread is not given to beget, but to ſuſtain a man: Seventhly, hee that comes to the Lords Table, being unregenerate, is that fathers ſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 30. ſaying <hi>Go,</hi> and <hi>went not.</hi> His Uſes following, did aggravate his Doctrine and Reaſons, as it follows: alſo he did affirm, that the damned ſhall cry out of hell, to ſuch Miniſters as have delivered the Sacrament to ſuch naturall men here in their life-time, and ſhall ſay, Thou gaveſt me my damnation in giving me the Sacrament; for I was blind and ſaw it not, dead and diſcern'd it not, and therefore wo be to you that have given mee my eternall confuſion and deſtruction, with many more of theſe and the like ſtrange and fond expreſſions of his own viſion, invented by his own brain, contrary to Gods truth; hee concluding theſe vanities with ſuch a ſeeming confidence as no man could contradict or gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113149:4"/>
but aſſured himſelf, that every one that heard him, were ſatisfied with the cleere truth of this dark light, urging it on the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again and again with theſe or the like words.</p>
            <p>Now I hope there is none but who are fully ſatisfied, whoſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for miſtakings, where no leſſe then an engagement to mee which underſtood their falſeneſſe, to make theſe oppoſing <hi>Grounds,</hi> preſently turning them into eight <hi>Arguments;</hi> proving thereby, that the Sacrament of the body and blood of our Lord, ought not to be denyed to any that receive the common faith and outward Baptiſme, except in the caſe of excommunication, and in that reſpect the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as well as the carnall may be excluded:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> He that preacheth that the Sacrament of the Lords Table, doth not as well teach to the begetting of grace as the confirming of grace, hee is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the nature of the Sacrament, and of the Word of God; but ſo it was preached at <hi>Woolchurch</hi> on the <hi>29<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>June, 1645.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If by the preaching the Word, Chriſt crucified, be the means to beget grace, then the viſible manifeſtation to the eye (as well as to the eare) of the ſignes if his death, are the means of begetting of grace alſo; But by the preaching of the Word to the eare, Chriſt crucified, is manifeſted or ſet forth for the begetting of grace, <hi>Gal. 3. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 23, 24.</hi> Therefore the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manifeſtation of the ſignes of Chriſts death are for the bagetting of grace alſo, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 26.

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> If Gods Word ſay, <hi>So often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, yee do ſhew the Lords death till he come,</hi> then the Sacrament doth teach grace to be received by Chriſt, as well as confirm the grace already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but the Apoſtle ſo ſaith, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 26.</hi> therefore hee that teacheth otherwiſe is ignorant of the Scripture, and of the nature of the Sacrament, as alſo it is proved, <hi>Luke 22. 19, 20.

               <p>In my affirming that the bread and wine, the ſignes of the Lords Body and Blood, do teach grace where it is not, as well as confirme grace where it is; I do not therein deny that <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> but I affirm that the ſame Word is alſo taught and preached by the Sacrament. For the Text hee alledgeth, doth not ſay as he affirmeth, that it is the office of the Word alone, but theſe are the Apoſtles words; ſo then <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Now we muſt obſerve, that the term <hi>faith</hi> hath divers acceptations in the Scriptures; and for the clearing this point, I will obſerve but two diſtinctions: Firſt, as it is referred to God the Creator; and ſecondly, as it hath reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour; and in both theſe reſpects the heart is as truly taught by the eye, by ſeeing Gods works, as by the ear through hearing Gods Word. The firſt diſtinction is fully proved by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. 20. becauſe that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them, (that is, to mankinde) for God ſaith, Hee hath ſhewed it unto them, for the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world, are cleerly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and Godhead; ſo that they are without excuſe: And that holy man <hi>Job,</hi> of whom God himſelf teſtifies, that hee was his ſervant, he was wel acquainted with this truth: <hi>Job</hi> 12. 7, 8. <hi>But ask now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the beaſts, and they ſhall teach thee, and the fowles of the aire, and</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:113149:6"/>
                  <hi>they ſhall tell thee; or ſpeak unto the earth, and it ſhall teach thee, and the fiſhes of the Sea ſhall declare unto thee:</hi> And again, two Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> give in evidence to this truth at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. <hi>Nevertheleſſe, he</hi> (that is, God) <hi>left not himſelf without witneſſe in that hee did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſſe;</hi> and again, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2. 4. <hi>Or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance and long-ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance,</hi> (that is) to return to God? And for the further proof of this, the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is very ample and large, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night ſheweth,</hi> that is, declareth, or preacheth knowledge, there is no ſpeech nor language where their voyce is not heard. And ſecondly, that faith in Jeſus Chriſt is taught viſibly by the eye, as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly by the eare, the Scriptures do as clearly and plainly declare al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for thus did all the ſhadowes under the Law viſibly and openly teach and preach Chriſt as the Sacraments under the Goſpel; and this was the only objection of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ever ſince King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixth his time, that none but God could put or impoſe upon his Church teaching ſignes or ceremonies, and ſuch teaching ſignes, Sacraments or ſhadows was circumciſion, the Paſchall Lamb, and all other ceremonies before Chriſt; And ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>Meats and drinks, Holy dayes and new Moons, or Sabbath dayes were a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt;</hi> ſo alſo the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the gifts and ſacrifices, and the Prieſthood under the Law, ſerve unto the example and ſhadow of heavenly things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. And as Jeſus Chriſt was thus viſibly taught by the eye to the heart under the Law, ſo he is more clearly taught, preached and ſet forth by the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, now under the Goſpell, which do as viſibly manifeſt him as the Word doth audibly, and as the Rainbow in the clouds when it appeareth to the eye, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly teach the heart Gods perpetuall faithfulneſſe in his promiſe, ſo the viſible ſignes of Chriſts Body and Blood in the Sacrament, and are a lively ample viſible Sermon to us of Chriſts death and paſſion, his giving himſelf for mans ſalvation, and do teach and inſtruct us to grace and mercy by Jeſus Chriſt, as truly as the Word preached; ſo that now it is cleer by what hath been proved, that if the viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teach the ſame truth in their meaſure that the audible creatures do, then ſo doth alſo the bread and wine ſet apart to be received, that Chriſts death may be commemorated, and they therein declare and

               <p>This mans anſwer to this Scripture, is like the anſwer that an <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> made me not long ago, to another Scripture I alledged againſt his blaſphemous poſition of <hi>Arrianiſme,</hi> he maintaining that Chriſt was a meere man, and that to affirm a Trinity in Unity of the Godhead, was nonſenſe and ridiculous, and contrary to reaſon, nature, learning and Scripture: Will you be judged by Scripture? ſaid I, yes ſaid he: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I demanded what he thought of 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There are three that beare record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> here ſaid I the Scripture affirms the Trinity in Unity. Oh, Sir, ſaid he, the Text it not truly tranſlated, for the word in the originall is, <hi>they do agree in one:</hi> I pray, ſaid I, what other acceptation hath the word, or how can you expreſſe it otherwiſe from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; it is, ſaid he, as truly to be tranſlated, <hi>they are one,</hi> as <hi>they agree in one:</hi> then ſaid I, your own mouth is witneſſe, for by your own words you have confirmed the Text; ſo I ſay to this Linguiſt, that in the Margin, <hi>ſhew yee,</hi> &amp;c. is the ſame in the Text, <hi>yee do ſhew,</hi> &amp;c.

Chapter, in theſe words, <hi>And ſupper being ended,</hi> which words briefly contain all the particulars that the other three Evangeliſts at large ſet forth, which is, that at the Supper of the Paſſeover, our Lord inſtituted the Sacrament, the Supper of his Paſſion; yea, both of them before Supper was ended; and therefore it is ſaid in the 4. <hi>verſ. hee riſeth from ſupper,</hi> that is, our Lord, and none elſe, <hi>and he laid aſide his garment and took a towell,</hi> &amp;c. and with <hi>water waſhed his Diſciples feet,</hi> amongſt whom he waſht <hi>Judas</hi> with the reſt, therefore hee ſaid, verſ. 10. <hi>yee are clean, but not all,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>for he knew who ſhould betray him,</hi> and therefore he ſaid, <hi>yee are not all clean;</hi> ſo after he had waſhed their feet, ſaith the Text, and taken his gorments which hee had put off, when hee did riſe from them, and was ſet down again, that is with the twelve that had not riſen from the table, but ſate ſtill all the while he waſhed them, and after he was ſate down again, he exhorted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113149:9"/>
them to humility and brotherly love; and that they ſhould do one to another as hee had done to them; and that his example ſhould be their pattern, ſaying, <hi>If yee know theſe things, happy are yee if you do them, I ſpeak not to you all, I know whom I have choſen;</hi> and then tels them of a Propheſie in the 41. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that one that did eate bread with him, <hi>ſhould lift up his heel againſt him,</hi> that is, <hi>betray him.</hi> And the Apoſtles hearing it was one of them, (here is <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt them ſtill) <hi>Peter</hi> beckned to <hi>John,</hi> to ask the Lord who, or which of them it ſhould be, <hi>Jeſus anſwered,</hi> verſ. 26. <hi>he it is, to whom I ſhall give a ſop</hi> or <hi>a morſel,</hi> as it is in the margin, <hi>and he gave it to</hi> Judas Iſcariot, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Simon, <hi>and after the ſop Satan entred into him.</hi> Now that wee may ſee the true nature and conſequence of theſe premiſſes, and the conſent of <hi>John</hi> with the reſt of the Evangeliſts, wee muſt remember, that <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> all of them teſtifie, that before the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Judas</hi> went to the chief Prieſts, and communed with them how he might betray the Lord into their hands, and agreed with them for thirty pieces of ſilver; ſo that <hi>Judas</hi> from that time ſought his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, ſaith <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 26. 16. and how he might conveniently do it, ſaith <hi>Marke,</hi> chap. 14. 11. and he promiſed, ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 22. 6. to betray him cunningly and without tumult, in the peoples ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; therefore ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> chap. 13. 2. ſupper being ended, the Devill now put into the heart of <hi>Judas</hi> to perform and make good his wicked bargain for his lamentable &amp; curſed wages, but as yet it was a little too ſoon for the opportunity; and therefore our Lord riſes from them, but there's no mention of their riſing, and he waſhes them all, yet <hi>Judas</hi> is ſtill unclean, though waſhed: and our Lord ſits downe with them again, and now the time, the conveniency, voyd of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, it being night, and opportunity and all agree, and being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſpirit, our Lord reveals the treaſon to the twelve, and upon their deſire to know which of them it ſhould be, hee declares it by giving him a <hi>ſop</hi> or a <hi>morſell,</hi> for the fragments were not as yet taken away; and ſo ſoon as <hi>Judas</hi> had received it, the Devill then moves him to finiſh the treaſon, ſo long before purpoſed and agitated, and then quickly proceeds to execution.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger in this <hi>Replication,</hi> becauſe I know many, of whom I dare not but judge well of, that are of opinion, that <hi>Judas</hi> was not with the twelve at the inſtitution of the Supper of the Lord, and yet they all acknowledge, that hee ate the Paſſeover with them, which makes mee the more wonder at their exception, becauſe the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113149:9"/>
Paſſeover ſhadowed out the ſame body and blood that the bread and wine doth ſhew forth, as in my Reply to his ſeventh <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ſhall be more cleerely manifeſted; ſo then notwithſtanding all you have ſaid in your ſeeming Anſwer, the Argument ſtands in force againſt you in all its parts, that whoſoever affirmeth that they that give the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to wicked unregenerate men, caſts holy things to Dogs, and pearles before Swine, doth in ſo ſaying, either willingly or ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or both, teſtifie that Chriſts practice in the caſe of <hi>Judas,</hi> was againſt his commandment in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 5. which is blaſphemy ſo to affirm, for our Lord did give the bread and cup to <hi>Judas</hi> amongſt the reſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more then probable; and in ſo doing, hee did not caſt holy things to Dogs, nor pearles before Swine. Now it is very true, the ignorant and ſcandalous are not fit to receive, yet there is no rule from God or man that forbids them, but the authority given to the Church to excommunicate them; yet however, they ought daily to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and admoniſhed to repentance and faith.</p>

               <p>To the firſt part of the Anſwer, I reply that I had thought he had ſo well known the Scriptures, that when a man had ſpoke Scripture, it had been as good a proof as to have quoted the Text; and becauſe the want of quoting the Text is the cauſe, ſay you, the Argument is not proved, therefore reade and examine the Scriptures, and then tell mee if it be not proved: <hi>Simon Magus alſo believed, and was baptized,</hi> Acts 8. 13. who continned with <hi>Philip</hi> in the communion of all common ordinances; as the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, wondering to behold the miracles and ſignes which

were done, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. whoſe impenitent naturall eſtate the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth declare notwithſtanding, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. And ſo it was with <hi>Demas,</hi> Col. 4. 14. and <hi>Philemon</hi> verſ. 24. which Text ſhews his like fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with Gods people in the common ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, notwithſtanding in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews his carnality and wickedneſſe: and alſo S. <hi>John</hi> unmasks a great man, in high place in the Church, <hi>Diotrephes</hi> by name, 3 <hi>John</hi> verſ. 9. and as he loved, ſo hee had preeminence, who was ſo wicked, that hee would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Apoſtles of Chriſt, nor the brethren, and hindered and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad them that would, and excommunicated them through malice; here's a falſe Chriſtian in great place and authority in the Church, even a carnall naturall man, and a prater againſt the Saints, the beſt of Gods people, and yet for all this, not denyed to partake at the Lords Table; for hee was the man that denyed others, in ſuch a caſe and condition were the falſe Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. falſe Prophets, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. falſe Teachers, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. and falſe brethren, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. and the Apoſtles, the Prophets, the Teachers, the Brethren, although falſe, yet all in common communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the Word, Sacraments and Prayer, &amp;c. So that now you ſee the firſt part of the Argument proved, which you would not ſee before. To the ſecond part of his Anſwer I reply, and as it conſiſteth of two parts, ſo the Gentleman is miſtaken in both. And firſt for the name <hi>man,</hi> he ſaith that in the Scriptures, it is only to be underſtood of a ſpirituall man, which to affirm, is fond and ridiculous, as before in the <hi>Introduction</hi> I have ſhewed, and now more largely ſhall be cleered, as <hi>Job</hi> 14. 1. <hi>A man that is born of a woman is of few dayes, and full of trouble,</hi> where <hi>Job</hi> means by the name <hi>man,</hi> every naturall man, as hee is born into the world: and ſo ſaith <hi>Eliphas</hi> the <hi>Temanite, Job</hi> 15. 14. <hi>What is man that he ſhould be clean, and he that is born of a woman, that he ſhould be righteous?</hi> And again, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Man is born to trouble,</hi> or <hi>labour, as the ſparks fly upwards;</hi> as alſo <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>God hath made man upright, but hee</hi> (that is man) <hi>hath found many inventions,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe and many other Scriptures make it cleer, that naturall men, as they are born of their mothers into the world, are called men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ground and foundation of his doctrine is falſe, as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is falſe: And ſo likewiſe I ſhall prove in the ſecond place, that ſuch a generall or unregenerate believing man, may diſcern ordinary bread and wine that is ordained to feed and ſuſtain our natures, from the Sacrament of bread and wine that are ſignes of Chriſts body and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113149:10"/>
blood the only ſpirituall food of our ſoules, and ſo communicate of them alſo in this different reſpect whereunto they are appointed; and to this doctrine the Apoſtle points in theſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>What have yee not houſes to eat and drink in?</hi> that is, for your ordinary food, for you ſhame the Church of God, to come to the Table of the Lord to eat to gluttony, and to drink to drunkenneſſe, <hi>What ſhall I ſay to you?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>for this I muſt reprove yee: for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Lord in the ſame night he was betrayed, inſtituted the Sacrament of bread and wine,</hi> the bread to ſignifie his body, the wine his blood, which body was broken, and blood ſhed, <hi>for you,</hi> that is, for mans ſalvation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 22, 24, 25. And our communicating in theſe, ſhewes forth the Lords death, and keeps it continually in our remembrance; and therefore the bread and wine ought to be ſo known, as to diſcern thereby the body of the Lord, to do it in remembrance of Chriſt, and thereby to ſhew forth his death, and whoſoever doth not ſo communicate, is condemned in his own conſcience; for every man, naturall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, are capable of this knowledge, of this diſcerning; and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and diſtinction, (the Lords Table differing from ordinary food,) may all naturall believing men receive it, even the elect before rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as others, having been baptized. And thus to know and diſtinguiſh, is to diſcern the Lords body in one ſenſe, as to eat Chriſts fleſh, and drink his blood by juſtifying faith is in a more excellent and ſpirituall ſenſe; ſo that by this diſtinction, his anſwer is manifeſted to be no anſwer, and my Argument not at all diſabled, for this ſenſe is not ſtrained, but true and proper.</p>

               <p>Firſt, for your exception againſt the terme <hi>carnall Chriſtian,</hi> I wonder you ſhould be ſo ignorant of the Scripture, and yet take upon you to be a Teacher, for to be <hi>carnall,</hi> is to be in the fleſh; and doth not the Apoſtle in one word reſolve the queſtion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>But as hee that was born after the fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit; even ſo is it now,</hi> that is, in the Apoſtles time, and ever ſince alſo, as in all the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>Are ye not carnall,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle? and alſo amongſt us at this time, for one ſpirituall Chriſtian, there is ninety nine carnall, and in the fleſh; and for you to expound <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. to be a carnall <hi>Jew</hi> under the Law, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. to be a ſpirituall <hi>Jew</hi> under the Goſpel, you have thereby written a monument of your ignorance; for look back to the 14, 15, 26. and 27. verſes, and they will ſhew you the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but thoſe truths are beyond your capacity.

Wherefore I adviſe you hereafter, to conſider what you ſhould ſay before you ſpeak, and let your tongue be in your heart, and not your heart in your tongue; for, <hi>a Scribe inſtructed unto the Kingdome of God, is like a good houſholder, that bringeth forth of his treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things new and old:</hi> And the Meſſengers of the Lord, the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſpeak not their own mindes, but <hi>the minde of God, and of Chriſt,</hi> as they have received it from above, who are, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>like good workmen, and need not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth;</hi> for as the Sacraments, if they be not received for the better, but for the worſe, through our own wickedneſs and diſobedience, will aggravate and increaſe our judgement and condemnation, ſo of the like nature is the Word alſo, which is the chiefeſt means to beget or attain to grace; the Word preached it ſelf, through the diſobedience of ſuch as heare it, proves the ſavour of death, as it is the ſavour of life to them that believe and obey it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>

               <p>For, although there be no rule in Scripture, that gives any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Miniſter order to reſtrain any from the Lords Table that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and are baptized, except the authority given to the Church in caſe of excommunication, as at firſt is ſignified; yet the Scriptures do plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully teſtifie, that faithfull Minſters ought to watch over the flock of Chriſt, to teach, inſtruct and admoniſh the people, to learn, know and underſtand the meaning of all Gods ordinances, and inſtructed in our own eſtates and conditions, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt exhorted the <hi>Pariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Mat. 3. 7. and that except we be betterred by them, that which is ordained for our eternall life, will be found to be to our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

And therefore as every naturall man renders their ſalvation, ſo they are to examine themſelves, and prepare their hearts by repentance, ſo to come to the Sacrament, as to finde Jeſus Chriſt to become their ſpirituall life, as he is life and food both, to ſuch as are regenerated; ſo that all and every mans coming to Gods Ordinances may be endeavoured to be for the better, and not for the worſe: and alſo Miniſters ought to have compaſſionate affections towards the people, even as a Nurſe towards the Babe on her breaſt, and as a tender mother towards the childe of her womb, and in all their wayes ſeek them, and not theirs, ſo that all bitterneſſe and pride be avoided, and that the Congregation may ſee, that they ſincerely ſeek the ſalvation of the people; and alſo the people muſt know, that holy and faithfull teachers ought to be had in double honour, both by countenance and maintenance, that the glory of God, and mans ſalvation be promoted; and thus and ſo admoniſheth he that is the Lords and thine in him.</p>
