            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Iewell hath come in the hands of many, who being strangers, not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Canaan,</hi> from which it came, haue out of wrong conception iudged it to bee adulterine.

            <p>Of old, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> were placed by God in that <hi>Pectorall</hi> of the high Priest, called by the Iewes, <hi>Hosen,</hi> by the Greekes

            <p>
               <hi>Iosephus</hi> records, that these stones by<note place="margin">Ioseph.

               <hi>Republick,</hi> seemes to haue followed him. The report that <hi>Suidas</hi> brings from an vncertaine Author, is as vncertaine as the Author, that if battell was imminent, the stones turned red; if death was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, they turned black; if no change of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state was to ensue, then the stones chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not their colour at all. One thing is sure, God by them gaue answere to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that sought him, as may bee cleared by many places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But of this booke wee may boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that it is indeed a heauenly <hi>Oracle,</hi> foretelling in types, the truth of things, as they were to fall out to the worlds end: at the first it sheweth a white colour, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:9469:4"/>
comfortable grace by the Gospell now, and immortall glory hereafter. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent it turneth to a red colour, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing bloudy persecutions which Saints must suffer, before they enioy the Crown. Then againe it appeareth with a blacke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to declare that blackenesse of wrath temporall and eternall, which abideth the enemies of the Church.</p>
            <p>In some parts it looketh darke, in others, cleare like the Christall, yet through all, more or lesse transparent, and therewith variable with sundry sheddes, among which most apparant are three seuerall rankes of <hi>Seuens,</hi> stretching themselues in most comely order through this Iewell, and wherein the Lord hath secretly inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed treasures of manifold wisedome. In the <hi>Seales</hi> vnsealed, secrets are disclosed: In the Trumpets, battels are denounced: In the <hi>Uials,</hi> plagues are powred out. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in these three is not one, yet by a comely proportion and correspondence, doe they answere one to another.</p>
            <p>Many haue handled this Iewell, not to
<pb facs="tcp:9469:4"/>
finde it by their labour, (that were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) but to finde themselues by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew of it. For that cause among others, I haue also looked vpon it, truely for none other end, but that I might learne from it; and now what I haue seene, I shew, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my selfe to the Church, for whose profit I haue taken these paines. If the light of the booke hereby be any way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, and comfort arise to the good Christian, the praise is the Lords, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God thankes is due to your Lordship; for by your louing counsell &amp; care, I haue beene relieued of many intricate matters of Law, and found the greater leysure and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty both, to attend my studies. Thus hath your Lordship beene a <hi>Mecaenas</hi> to me indeed. Good men oftentimes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to expresse great affections by small meanes, and so now it fareth with me; yet I trust your Lordship will esteeme of mee, not as I am, but as I desire to be on your behalfe.</p>
            <p>But it is no reason I should requite deeds with words. I know, your Lordship doth
<pb facs="tcp:9469:5"/>
neyther like them, nor need them. Where Vertue giueth out her beames, euen her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are forced to acknowledge her glory: yet thus much out of duty must I speake, that by many <hi>Coards</hi> of loue hath your God bound you to be thankefull to him. Vertue is weake without some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity, neither can that felicity bee found on earth, that communicates not with some crosse. Some are raised to wealth, but the lesse regarded by reason of their base Linage: Some, Noble by parentage, but depressed with pouerty: many beautified both with Nobility and riches, who want the delight of children; others haue the comfort of children, but with the turning of a few yeares, they turne crosses vnto them; there is no estate so prosperous, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which there is not iust cause of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: Thus runneth the common cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of worldly courses here on earth.</p>
            <p>But will your Lordship turne your eyes a little from others, and looke to your selfe; you shall see what cause your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath aboue others to say with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:9469:5"/>
               <hi>Many wayes hath the Lord beene beneficiall to his Seruant,</hi> beeing for Linage descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a wise, and worthy Father, of an Honourable Family, famous among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of that most flourishing <hi>Trybe of Hammilton;</hi> Honourable also for the places of honour which you possesse, but much more for the vertue whereby you haue worthily deserued them; for it is a greater thing to deserue Honour, then to haue it, but where by Vertue it is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by Wisedome encreased, and by good Gouernement reteined, (all which are eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in your Lordship:) What can be more? Your children (thankes be to God) no cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but comforts, like <hi>branches of the Oliue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 127. 3.</note> promised to such as feare God, they stretch out themselues from the sides of your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, and without disparagement, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the mighty Cedars of the Land.</p>
            <p>For your selfe I haue nothing to say, but that which I know, no man can gaine-say: If quickenesse of ingine, vigour of ready witte, wisedome in words, discretion in deedes, secrecie in thoughts beseeming a

               <hi>Secretary,</hi> fidelity in seruice of your <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne;</hi> surety in friendship, modesty in all your behauiour: If education of your children in true Religion: If good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the obseruance of God his publike worship euery Sabboth: If indefatigable paines in your Calling, for the good of the publique State, wherein nothing can bee seene all the dayes of the weeke, but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenati labores mutandi semper grauioribus;</hi> so that iustly it may bee admired how in so weake a body, such restlesse labor of mind may be sustained. If all these (I say) may commend any man, then hath your Lordshippe witnesses enow to speake for you, and needes not the testimony of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Loe now, what a heape of good things hath the Lord multiplied vpon you! what remaines, but that you consider with <hi>Dauid, What shall I render to the Lord for</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 116. 12.</note> 
               <hi>all his benefites towards mee?</hi> Hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe will giue you the answere; <hi>My well-doing extends not to the Lord, but</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Great cause had <hi>Dauid</hi> to loue <hi>Ionathan,</hi> hee could not get himselfe to requite his kindnesse, but hee enquired if any man were left of the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> that hee might shew him mercy for <hi>Ionathans</hi> sake:<note place="margin">2.

            <p>My Lord; our <hi>Ionathan</hi> is the Lord <hi>Iesus:</hi> wee haue not himselfe, but for his sake wee are bound to shew mercy to his <hi>Mephibosheths;</hi> these are the Leuites, the Widdow, the Fatherlesse, the Poore, the Stranger, and the Oppressed. Let not the Leuite want the comfort of the Law in his righteous cause: Look with a tender eye to the vpright action of weake and impotent men; God is a righteous Iudge to all men, but he hath taken these aboue others, vnder his singular protection.

honour and happinesse also to be a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of them. So shall your Lordship pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per still, and God shall stablish bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings vpon you, and your posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I will pray to God for it, and so rest.</p>

               <hi>remember that I told you of them.</hi> And this fruite of confirmation, wee haue especially by bookes Propheticall.</p>

            <p>And this is to be noted, that where other books<note place="margin">And it serues especially to confirme vs in the faith.</note> of holy Scripture are written to instruct vs in the faith, and to teach vs, what wee must doe, if wee would be saued; this booke is written, not so much to instruct vs in the faith (though in part it doe that also) as to confirme vs in it, that for no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent persecution following it, for no fraudulent he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie by deceit impugning it, for no externall change befalling the Church, for no prosperous preuailing of the enemies thereof (as for a time will appeare to the world) we should forsake that

               <note place="margin">Reu. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>tryall of them that dwell vpon the earth.</hi> And in this Prophecie are distinctly fore-told by the Lord, that his Saints and seruants in all ages might be confirmed against them, when they should see them come to passe, knowing that they fall not out by accident, nor by the will or power of man, but according to the determinate counsell of God, who hath also letten his Church see before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand a comfortable out-gate, and end of them all.</p>
            <p>And as both for the Matter, and Authour, this<note place="margin">The time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this book was written, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vs.</note> booke should bee welcome to vs, so the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the time doth greatly commend it.

It is the last Loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token of our Lord, and louing Husband, after which he will write no more vnto vs, but will come himselfe: he hath sent it to vs with the Disciple, whom he loued best, and who was the last, and longest liuer of all the Disciples.</p>
            <p>Kinde children remember best the words<note place="margin">The last words of our Lord, should be best remembred.</note> spoken by their fathers on their death-bed: and if it were possible that after death, they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any information from them, O, in what estimation would they haue it!

In the entry of this<note place="margin">God will haue this book read, and reuealed, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</note> booke (as I said) a blessing is pronounced vpon them, that reade, or heare the words of this prophecie, and in the end of it, a speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is giuen to S. <hi>Iohn, Seale not the words of the</hi>

This is sufficient to stop the mouthes of all them, who vnder whatsoeuer pretence giue out, that this booke should not be meddled with at all. What else is this, but to close that, which Christ hath opened, to conceale that which God hath reuealed, and in a word to seale vp the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, which the Lord expresly hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to be sealed?</p>

He protests in like maner, that he hath fully satisfied himselfe, whereof the lesse hope remaines that he shall satisfie others. One thing I must say, by his leaue, it seemes strange hee hath not beene afraid to inuert the order, not of chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters onely, but verses also: hee hath iumbled them one through another in most confused maner, and beaten them, as we say, into an <hi>Hotch-Potch:</hi> But God is the God of order, and not of confusion.</p>

for many other his learned workes, and specially for his great paines taken vpon this book, out of rare learning, and singular Ingene, which are not commonly found in men of great ranke. <hi>Cotterius</hi> giues him great praise, but takes it backe againe too suddenly to himselfe: Hee compares the <hi>Reuelation</hi> to a golden Mine. <hi>Naiperus aurifo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinam inuenit, Vignerus ostendit, Ego vero aurum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de erui: Naiper</hi> found it, <hi>Vigner</hi> hath shewed it, but I (saith he) haue digged, and wrought the gold out of it.

The Epistle containes first, an Inscription, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Narration, thirdly, a Conclusion. The Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is, first, of particular Churches, secondly, of all Churches; and that first, by a generall Type of all the three periods in the fourth chapter, next, by an opened booke, the dignity whereof is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the fifth chapter. The euents foreshewed by the opening of the booke, are of three rankes, the first declared in the seuen Seales; the second euents, partly greater, partly smaller, are declared in the seuen Trumpets; and the third euents are in the seuen Vials.

Beside the Inscription and conclusion, the body of the booke consists for the most part (saith hee) of a propheticall Narration, and it is two-fold: First, of things which then were: Next, of things to be done thereafter. And this Prophecie of things to be done, hath first a generall Introduction, in

the fourth and fifth chapters, then a speciall Storie in the rest. In the Seales, are types of the first sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes wherewith God shall plague the world for reiecting the Gospell; the sixe Trumpets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce second sorrowes, and the seuenth affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth seuen Vials of the last wrath, for full and finall destruction of the enemies.</p>

The large, or extended Reuelation, containes a cleere Exposition of all things; this continues from the fourth chapter, to the ninth verse of the nineteenth, and it is diuided into ten Classes.

                  <hi>Ioannes Auentrotus,</hi> a Gentleman, as it seemes<note place="margin">37 Printed yeere 1615.</note> of good credit, hath some discourses vpon this Prophecie, by way of an Epistle sent to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and presented, as he writes, by the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and graciously receiued of the King: hee seemes to restraine it somewhat strictly to the <hi>Belgic</hi> Battell, the blame whereof hee casts on the Pope, not sparing to affirme, that these wars shall hasten the end of Antichrist his grandeur. Hee witnesseth of himselfe, that hee liued a long time in the <hi>Canarie</hi> Iles, plunged in the puddle of Papistry: at length by reading the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and conferring it with holy Scripture, he found a direct discordance of the one from the other, and thereupon resolued to transport his house into the Low Countries. By the way hee
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9469:21"/>
visited the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> where he spared not to communicate his minde to the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and <hi>Andreas de Prada,</hi> the Kings Secretarie, not onely concerning matters pertaining to State, but Religion also; these concerning Religion, the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> willed him to communicate by himselfe to the King: the King for that cause ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Andreas de Prada</hi> to conferre with him for his better information. As the Authour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, this Secretaric was a man who feared God, loued truth, and was not far from the knowledge thereof. In the conference hee was twice moued to confesse, By your Arguments, saith he, it is not impossible but that the Pope must be Antichrist; yet did he counsell him rather to write his minde in his owne Countrey, then there: whereupon the Authour went forward in his iourney, and hauing accomplished it, he writes from <hi>England,</hi> in the yeere 1610. <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. another pithic Epistle against the Kingdome of Antichrist, which as he saith, the fore-said Secretary, according to his promise, presented to the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> In it he boldly affirmes, <hi>Romanam Religionem falsam esso doctrinam, Papam Antichristum, &amp; Bellum Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum regni Antichristi sinem suturum esse.</hi> In this last point onely, as I said, he seemeth too strictly to restraine this Prophecie. I haue written this at the greater length, that we may remember, how in all parts, of all sorts of persons, God hath his owne; yea, euen there where <hi>Satan hath his</hi>

                  <p>This will be manifest, if we compare the end<note place="margin">The time of the first Seale continues to the worlds end.</note> of this Prophecie with the beginning thereof.

And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie hath before it a conuenient vision of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, from the ninth verse of the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the end; and then after the preparatorie Vision, followes the prophecie it selfe, contained in the second and third chapters.

The other is a prophecie of the victorie, glory, and eternall felicity of the Church Triumphant, in the one and twentieth, and beginning of the two and twentieth chapters. In this, all the Interpreters agree, and make no question; except that some will haue the fourth and fifth chapters to containe Visions of Prediction, as well as the rest, which (as we haue said) cannot be; for, the opening of the Seales, out of which comes the discouery of things to come, beginneth at the sixt chapter.</p>
               <p>Now to take vp rightly the Method of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy<note place="margin">The Visions of Prediction are three, the state of the Church being foretold three times.</note> of the estate of the Church Militant, let vs keepe in minde that ground laid by S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Primasius,</hi> that it is, <hi>Prophetia saepius repetita,</hi> not one continuall Prophecie, but a Prophecie repeated; and that, not doubled onely, as was the dreame of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to shew the certainety of the<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note> Vision, but tripled; all the three Visions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the estate of the Church in a different

it, but that they are commanded to stay till the seruants of God be gathered, and sealed, as was answered to the cry of Saints in the fifth Seale. This is the onely difficulty in the method of this first Prophecie, the like whereof occurres not in any of the rest; yet, let that be pondered without preiudice, which I haue said, and the matter shall be plaine. Needfull was it, that the Seale, shewing out the cry of slaine Martyrs, and the answer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, should be explayned, by a more full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their felicity in heauen: and that the Tragicall end of the wicked in the sixt Seale, should haue set against it the Triumphant estate of the godly in heauen; all which, at length, is done, in the seuenth chapter, and therefore I count it a pendicle of the sixt.

                  <p>Where we are to obserue another thing, which<note place="margin">In the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets God comes not out in hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but warnes his Church of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming against her.</note> hath in this point miscarried many learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters.

It is true, the Lord after this commeth out in open battell against his enemies, but not here in this place.</p>
                  <p>Marke it yet ouer againe (for these grounds,<note place="margin">How the Tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Trumpets and Vials differ this manner of way. In the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Satan by his Instruments, commeth out in arrayed battell against the Church: Lest they should annoy her by suddaine inuasion, or secret<note place="margin">In the one, wicked men fight against the Church, in the other, God fights against the wicked:</note> ambushment, the <hi>Lord Iesus, Captaine</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, warnes them by sound of Trumpet, of the enemy approaching; hee tels what troupes they are, what stratagems they vse, what armour they

fight with, that his Saints may be armed to resist them. In the Vials againe, the Lord commeth forth in araied battell against the enemies of his Church, rendring plagues proportionall to these sins, by which they impugned and corrupted true doctrine. This not being considered, hath moued many iudicious men to thinke, that for time and matter, the Trumpets and Vials are both one, but in truth they are not.</p>
                  <p>For cleering this matter once for all, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,<note place="margin">And renders to them iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to their sinnes.</note> how in the most obscure Prophecies of this Booke, the Lord hath secretly laid downe a key, which if men can finde, they shall bee the more able by it to open the Prophecie. Reade the fifth and sixt verses of the sixteenth chapter, <hi>Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reu. 16. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>thou art iust, because thou hast iudged these things, for they shed the bloud of the Saints and Prophets, and therefore hast thou giuen them bloud to drinke.</hi> In the Trumpets, the wicked giue battell to the Lord; In the Vials, the Lord iudges, and repaies them with plagues proportionall, and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to their sinnes. It shall bee made plaine to him that reades without preiudice; compare eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trumpet with the correspondent Viall, and yee shall see, in the one, men impugning the Truth of God, and in the other, God plaguing them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondently. In the Trumpets, Antichrist riseth<note place="margin">This will bee made plaine by comparing euery Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet with the correspondent Viall.</note> by degrees, till he come to his height; in the Vials, God casts him downe by degrees. To leaue the rest, and compare but one: In the fifth Trumpet, Antichrist following his fore-runners, commeth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9469:33"/>
forth like a fallen Starre, openeth the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pit, and bringeth out a smoake which darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth both the Sunne, and the Aire; that is, both the light of the Gospell, and glory of the Church: for which, the righteous Iudge, in the fifth Viall, powreth out wrath on the Kingdome of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and darkneth his Throne; the like throughout all, the attentiue Reader may obserue, comparing euery Trumpet with the correspondent Viall. Thus in the Trumpets and Vials, haue we seuerall Prophecies of seuerall times, and matters, yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a relation the one to the other; the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the enemy against the Church being pointed out in the Trumpets, their punishments proportionall comming from God, expounded in the Vials.

not the truth of this place. I maruell what should haue moued <hi>Cotterius,</hi> a iudicious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writer; to follow them; This Heauen (saith hee) is, <hi>Ecclesia in qua Deus habitat,</hi> the Church wherein God dwels, and the Voice which spake vnto S. <hi>Iohn, Verbum est quo vocamur in Ecclesiam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> It is the Word, by which wee are called to the Church. All by purpose, for was S. <hi>Iohn</hi> now in <hi>Pathmos</hi> to bee called to the communion of the Church. But leauing this, when wee shall come (if the Lord please) to such places of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, where the Heauen is a type of the Church Militant, or Triumphant, we shall shew the reason thereof.</p>
                  <p>But here, that we may vnderstand with sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Heauen three waies taken in holy Scripture.</note> let vs consider how Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes, as hee saw: He saw not this Vision in the Earth, nor in the Aire, but in the heauen was it represented to him. It is true, most part of things prophesied here, were to be performed on the earth, but they are fore-shewed in the heauens, to tell vs, that the earth, and all things which fall out therein, are ruled by the Decree of Heauen. To make this yet more cleere, let vs be remembred that in holy Scripture, Heauen is sundry waies taken; First,<note place="margin">1 For the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.</note> for the Church Triumphant, their place, and their persons are both exprest by the name of Heauen; as, when it is said the two Witnesses were<note place="margin">Reu. 11.</note> taken vp into heauen. Next, for the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,<note place="margin">2 For the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</note> in the Gospell, &amp; in this Reuelation, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Heauen: But in this, and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9469:42"/>
of this Prophecie, Heauen is taken for that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall<note place="margin">3 For the Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatiue.</note> representation of heauen made to him in this Prophecie. For it is to bee noted, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as a necessary rule, that in these Visions S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes of things according as hee saw them represented in types (as we haue spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) yet so, that euery type hath a truth corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to it, and it requires great discretion to accommodate euery Type to the owne truth.</p>
                  <p>Which is not done by them, who in this place<note place="margin">S. <hi>Iohn</hi> learned not these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries in the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, nor from it, but for it.</note> expound heauen to be the Church Militant: for S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saw not, nor learned not these Mysteries in the Church, nor yet from the Church, hee saw them represented to him in heauen, to be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Church. In a word, he got it indeed for the Church Militant, but not from it. Neither is there any more reason to say that heauen here is the Church Militant, then to say that these things which S. <hi>Paul</hi> saw, when hee was rauished to the third heauen, hee saw them in the Church: for at<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 2, 4.</note> this time also, was S. <hi>Iohn</hi> rauished and transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Alway we learne here, that wee can haue no<note place="margin">The Lord who taught him to know them, must also teach vs, or else wee cannot learne them.</note> knowledge of heauenly things, vnlesse the Lord open the doore, and discouer them vnto vs. The Iewes euery Saturday, read in their Synagogues a part of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets; these point with the finger vnto Christ, but they cannot see<note place="margin">2.

                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:9469:42"/>
through which hee saw these Visions, to open a doore to vs also, by which we may haue entrance to vnderstand them, for the glory of his name, and comfort of his Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the first Voice which I heard, &amp;c.</hi>] Vpon<note place="margin">Of the voice which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> heard.</note> this place <hi>Victorinus</hi> obserues, that it was one Spirit which spake in the Prophets of old, and in the Apostles now. <hi>Cotterius,</hi> in the first Vision (saith hee) <hi>Iohn</hi> heard a Voice speaking onely, but here, a Voice speaking with S. <hi>Iohn, quo non obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè innuitur verbi (quod personam suam habet) &amp; nostri communio;</hi> whereby the communion of the Word with vs is not obscurely declared.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:9469:43"/>
beginning of this Verse, desirous to see more, and now the Lord offers not onely new sight to his eye, but new information to his care: Wee neuer turne our hearts truely to the Lord, but hee is readie to meete vs; All his children finde this in experience. Certainely, if wee would be more<note place="margin">If we wait on God, hee shall reueale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto vs.</note> homely with our God, we should soone finde him more familiar with vs. But alas, our sinne is, we wait not vpon him, and intertaine not a spirituall fellowship with him. How shall wee see, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the light? And how shall we bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with that grace which ouerflowes in him, so long as we are carelesse, and negligent to come to him?

                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:9469:43"/>The lesson here arising is, that the Voice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by<note place="margin">The voice of God is loud, &amp; liuely.</note> God speakes to his owne, is loud, liuely and powerfull, to waken them out of the dead sleepe of their sinne.

                  <p>O how miserable are they, to whom this Voice sounds and they heare it not, and the Trumpet of the liuely Word wakneth them not! For if they continue in this estate, and their sleepe bee vnto death, what remaines, but a fearefull Trumpet of doome, which whether they will or not, they shall be forced to heare, denouncing to them the iudgement of endlesse condemnation.

In a word, his body being relinquished for a time, and left senselesse, the Visions are presented to his spirit, it being vnable at one time, both to animate the earthly and inferiour body, and to conceaue heauenly and superiour mysteries reuealed vnto it. This hee meanes when he saith, <hi>I was in the Spirit;</hi> not that the soule as yet was dissolued from the body, but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9469:47"/>
because, in respect of operation, it did not animate the body after the wonted manner.</p>

At his brightnesse Angels couer their faces; they are holy by creation, redeemed ones are holy by communication, other things are also holy by separation, as was Ierusalems Temple of old, and now are the elements in both the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments holy; but none, neither Angel, man, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other creature, holy like the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The next thing they ascribe vnto him, is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie,<note place="margin">2 Omnipotency consisting in these two: 1. That he can do what hewil. 2.

The first of these renders instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Atheists; the other for Papists.

                  <p>The other renders instruction for Papists; they<note place="margin">Papists abuse the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of God, in making it militant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his truth.</note> vrge Gods omnipotencie, to prooue their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and fond transubstantiation, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for in this they make his power to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, and to reuerse his owne Word, &amp; the plaine Articles of our faith.

Christ, <hi>that wine</hi> is the blood of Christ.

                  </p>
                  <p>Their Harps note two things; first, the great<note place="margin">Their harpes doe note two things.</note> ioy they haue in praysing GOD. There is no ioy on earth comparable to that, vvhich is found<note place="margin">1 The great ioy they haue in praysing God.</note> in the praysing of GOD, and praying vnto him. When our Sauiour prayed, then was his countenance changed: when <hi>Dauid</hi> played vpon<note place="margin">Mat. 17.</note> the Harpe, the euill spirit that troubled <hi>Saul,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>This was the happinesse of the Primitiue<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> Church, the <hi>multitude of beleeuers was of one heart,</hi> but shortly after were they diuided, by an vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie<note place="margin">1.

The

euill is more then we can mend, at least, let vs<note place="margin">Sinne of this age, that the bond of loue is broken by them, who prosesse one faith.</note> mourne for it, and pray, <hi>Thy will, O Lord, be done in earth, as it is in heauen:</hi> And let euery man take heed vnto himselfe; hee is a sacrilegious renter of the Church, who breakes the bond of loue with his brother, in whom hee sees no rupture of the vnity of faith.</p>
                  <p>But for our further instruction, let vs know, that<note place="margin">The right Harpe of a Christian is his Heart.</note> the Harpe of a Christian, wherewith he praises God, is his Heart; the strings of the Harpe are the affections of the Heart, which must be well tuned and prepared, before they can make any melodie to the Lord; <hi>My heart is prepared, and I will sing,</hi>

                     </gap>, a prayer for auerting of euill; the second is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a prayer whereby we giue thanks to God.</p>
                  <p>All these foure sorts are vsed by Saints militant:<note place="margin">Of these foure two only are ascribed to Saints trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> two of them onely are ascribed to Saints trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, namely, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, thanksgiuing, and supplication, for the good which they want. Where if it be asked, What good want they who<note place="margin">Saints trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant want two things for which they pray.</note> are in heauen, for which they haue need to pray? The answer is, They want a two-fold good, which God hath promised, and they long to enioy. First, they want their bodies, without which the soules<note place="margin">1 They want their bodyes.</note> in heauen cannot haue full ioy; for by their first creation they were ioyned together, as insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companions not to be diuided, if they had not fallen in the transgression; therefore it is, that the one cannot be fully contented, wanting the other, for which to fulfill their ioy, they pray for restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bodies. Secondly, they want their<note place="margin">2 They want their brethren</note> brethren, the remanent me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Christ his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9469:90"/>
body, requisite necessarily to their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for <hi>God hath so prouided, that they vvithout vs</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>should not be perfected. Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> haue<note place="margin">Without these they cannot be perfected.</note> great ioy in heauen, but not full ioy, because they will not be perfected without their brethren. That therefore the mystical body of Christ may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and so their ioy fulfilled, they pray for Christ his second comming, which cannot be, till the last and youngest of the sonnes of God be borne, and brought to the fellowship of Iesus Christ. And this is made cleare heereafter, when the soules vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar are brought in crying, <hi>How long, O</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reue. 6.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">They cannot pray for our particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, how long, &amp;c!</hi> For this is the voice of them who want something they would faine haue, and yet are sure to enioy it. Thus we see then, that the prayers of Saints triumphant are generall, they pray for their bodies and brethren; but to gather of this that they know our necessitios<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tentations, farre lesse our secret desires, is but a doting dreame: and if we shall a little insist in this same metaplior of Odour, or Incense, it shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their error more clearely.<note place="margin">This same place by three arguments improues prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Saints.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, Incense offred to God, might not be made, but in such a manner and with such ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients as God himselfe commanded; teaching vs,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.</note> that prayer vnto God should be made, not as we<note place="margin">1 Incense might be made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way then God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: so pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp;c.</note> fansie to our selues, but as hee hath commaunded vs. Now, if wee shall looke to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, it directs vs to pray vnto God, and to none other; there is the voice of God the Father, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of thy trouble, I will deliuer thee, and thou</hi>

                     <hi>shalt glorifie me.</hi> There againe is the instruction of God the Sonne, <hi>When yee pray, pray in this manner,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 6. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Our Father which art in heauen;</hi> and there is the direction of God the holy Ghost; hee teacheth vs in our prayer to cry <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> No word heere<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> of any prayer to <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> or <hi>Esay,</hi> to Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim, or Seraphim, to Angels, or Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Incense might not be burnt but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">2 Incense might not be burnt but vpon the golden Altar: so prayer may not be offred to God in the name of any but Iesus.</note> the golden Altar onely, whereof there was but one, figuring the Lord Iesus; teaching vs that our prayers may not be offered to God in the name of any other, but Iesus Christ onely; <hi>For there is not any other name vnder Heauen, by which wee may be saued;</hi> and, <hi>In him onely is the Father well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 17. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was not lawfull for any man to make<note place="margin">3 Incense made for the Lord, might not be applyed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but to the Lord. So prayer, &amp;c.</note> an odour for his owne pleasure, or priuate vse, of those gummes whereof the Lord commanded his Incense to be made, and that vnder a most strait penaltie; for so stands the Law, <hi>Yee shall not make vnto you any composition like to this Perfume, it shall be holy for the Lord: whosoeuer shall make like vnto</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 30. 37, 38</note> 
                     <hi>that, to smell thereof, euen hee shall be cut off from his people.</hi> And this doth plainely teach vs, that no creature should smell the sauour of our Prayer: it is the Incense holy to the Lord, and appertaines to our God onely.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see, how Papists when they seeke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocinie<note place="margin">What patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Papists find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> for their errors from holy Scripture, doe it with no better successe, then <hi>Ioab</hi> did, when hee
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:9469:91"/>
made his refuge to the hornes of the Altar; hee fled vnto it, to seeke the safety of his life; but hee was pulled from it, and executed to the death: so they, when they bring in Scripture to defend their errors, doe in effect bring it, to destory them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
                  <p>But to leaue them: let vs consider for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,<note place="margin">Why prayer is compared to perfume.</note> how our prayer is compared to a perfume. All the spices of Myrrhe, Cynamon, and what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is most excellent on earth, cannot make such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume; from heauen it commeth, and vnto heauen it returneth. O what a great mercy is this! wee are not yet able to ascend our selues, and yet haue we this liberty and priuiledge, as to send our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors in our name before vs, which are so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the diuine Maiestie, that hee accounts of them, as of sweet odour and perfume sent vp vnto him. Let vs marke this: for many times the weake<note place="margin">Comfort for a Christian whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he faints in prayer.</note> Christian faints, and becomes remisse in prayer, because he disesteemes of his own prayer. This is a policie and tentation of the old Serpent, to make thee neglect that which hee knowes to be most hurtfull to himselfe, most helpfull to thee, &amp; most acceptable to thy God; but doe it not: <hi>Noli vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendere</hi>

a larger explication of the fifth and sixth Seale, as (God willing) we shall heare: so then the first Prophecie is absolued in six Seales, whereof the last concludes with the Day of Iudgement; for the seuenth Seale hath in her bosome the seuen Trumpets, which make vp the second Prophecie of this Booke, beginning at the eighth Chapter;<note place="margin">The second fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eighth to the twelfth.</note> for till then, the seuenth Seale is not opened, and continuing to the end of the eleuenth, there it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth with the Day of Iudgement.

                  <p>This first Prophecie, as I said, is generall, for<note place="margin">The first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stication of the estate of things to the worlds end: Whereof the summe is, Christ will go by his Gospell thorow the world, till hee ouercome.</note> it containes a generall Prognostication, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to vs a view of the estate of things, as they will be to the worlds end: whereof the summe is, Christ shall go thorow the world vpon the Ministerie of his Word, preaching the Gospell where, and when it best pleaseth him. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied in the first Seale, like a crowned King, and Conquerour, hee hath gone out long agoe vpon his White Horse, and so shall hee continue till hee ouercome.

The other reason is more pungent, for it is said here plainly, that at the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sunne and Moone, at the departure<note place="margin">2 Apostasie could not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify great men, as here them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues being authors and actors of it.</note> of heauen, &amp; falling of starres, Kings, Great men, and Captaines were terribly afraid, and therefore cannot it be vnderstood of Apostasie, and defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof they themselues were both authors and actors. Was it the obscuring of the light of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:9469:135"/>
the Gospel, that made them to cry out, <hi>Rocks and Mountaines, fall vpon vs and couer vs?</hi> It can stand with no sense: for so farre were they from all feare for that matter, that by the contrary they reioyced in it, and did what they could to extinguish the Gospel, and erect heresies, to force Preachers and Professors vnto defection: and in so doing, they thought they did good seruice vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Others againe take it for a denuntiation of some<note place="margin">Neither is this sixt seale to be vnderstood of a temporall iudgement.</note> externall and temporall iudgement, such as vvas executed on Persecutors, and specially vpon <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian.</hi> It is true, that in the holy Scripture many of the phrases vsed here, are vsed also to expresse fearefull temporall iudgements, threatned against particular states, and persons of wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Looke the denuntiation of iudgement against Babel and Egypt; to expresse the horror of their<note place="margin">Esay 13. 10.</note> plagues, mention is made of the darkning of the<note place="margin">Ezech. 32. 7.</note> Sunne, and Moone, &amp;c.

And euen they vvho vvill haue it one continued Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, the later Chapter beeing alway posterior in time to the matter of the Chapter preceding, as they thinke, are forced to interrupt that course, and change their mind, when they come to the twelfth Chapter, for there they are drawne backe<note place="margin">Arguments prouing that it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the Day of Iudgement.</note> again, to the first beginning of the daies of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But to returne, this sixt seale concludes this first generall Prophecie, with a Propheticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of the Day of Iudgement, and so wee<note place="margin">1 The seuenth seale for etels nothing as the rest doc, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces seuen trumpets to foretell.</note> expound it, for these reasons, besides others, which we haue shewed before. First, the seuenth seale hath no proper prediction of it owne, as the preceding sixe haue, but containes in the bosome thereof se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Trumpets, proclaiming for matter a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, different from the former.<note place="margin">2 The sixt seale brings an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall change of al creatures.</note>
                  </p>

Thirdly, all the persons of the wicked are<note place="margin">3 All the wicked vniuersally are iudged in it.</note> here vniuersally iudged without exception; no Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, nor Egyptians, nor Israelites onely, but all the wicked, <hi>Euery free man, euery bond man.</hi>

                     <hi>great Day of the Lords wrath.</hi> And lastly, the like prediction made by our Sauiour, serues for a cleer Commentary, to lead vs to expound this of the day of Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>For after our Lord hath foretold of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,<note place="margin">5 Collation of this place with the words of our Sauiour, proues that it is so.</note> apostasies, heresies, &amp; of false Christs, which were to come, he subioynes, <hi>And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after the tribulation of those daies, shall the Sun be darkned, and the Moone shall not giue her light: and the starres shall fall from heauen, and the powers of</hi>

                     <hi>heauen shall be shaken.</hi> Now that these speeches are<note place="margin">Luke 21. 25.</note> not to be taken allegorically, but properly, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning<note place="margin">Marke 13. 24.</note> a prediction of that fearefull concussion of this Vniuerse, which shall be made in that great Day of the Lord, is most euident by that which followes; <hi>Then shal appeare the signe of the Sonne of</hi>

For there we heard all manner of reprobate men sorrowfully lamenting and crying, that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines might couer them. Here we are all told,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:9469:143"/>
that the godly shall not be inuolued with them in their desperate estate, the Lord by his owne Seale separates them from the wicked, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewes that happy estate wherein they shall liue for euer, and euer.</p>
                  <p>The Chapter hath two parts: the first enlarges<note place="margin">Two parts of this chapter.</note> that which hath beene briefly set downe in the fift and sixt Seale; for in the fift Seale, Saints cry for a<note place="margin">1 In the first is declared, how the last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till Saints be sealed:</note> dissolution of the world, and for finall iudgement, to auenge their bloud on them who dwell on earth: there they are desired to rest, vntill their fellow-seruants were fulfilled. In the sixt Seale, that dissolution of the world, and iudgement on the wicked, craued by Saints, and promised by the Lord, is represented to S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> Both these, in the first part of this seuenth Chapter are more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded. For first, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> sees foure Angels standing at the foure corners of the earth, ready to ouerturne the world, and to fold it vp like an old Vesture, as was figured in the sixt Seale: and this we haue, ver. 1. Next, these Angels are inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and forbidden to destroy the world, vntill the seruants of God be first sealed, and secured, as was promised in the fift Seale: and this we haue,<note place="margin">2 In the second, the happy condition of Saints is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the miserable condition of the wicked, in the sixt Seale.</note> ver. 2. 3. together with the number of them that are sealed, till we come to the thirteenth verse. From that to the end, is described the happie condition of Saints, set downe in plaine termes, and directly opposite to that wofull condition of Reprobates, mentioned in the sixt Seale: so this, from ver. 15. to the end, makes vp the second
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:9469:144"/>
part of this Chapter: The first part letting vs see, how the world is conserued, till Saints be fulfilled and sealed: the other part shewing vs their ioyfull and happy estate.</p>
                  <p>Wherein it is very comfortable to obserue the<note place="margin">A short oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition marked of these two, for the greater comfort of Saints.</note> opposition which is made betweene the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate of the wicked, in the end of the sixt chapter, and happy estate of Saints, in the end of this seuenth: They had shed the bloud of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, and therefore the <hi>Moone</hi> with a bloudie face lookes vpon them, and all creatures concurre to bee auenged of them. Heere the Saints come safe through all these tribulations, and make their Robes white in the bloud of the Lambe: There the Sunne waxed black, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his light from the wicked; heere Saints haue no need of the light of the Sunne, for the Lamb gouernes them, ver. 16. 17. And <hi>the glory of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reu. 21. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Lamb is their light.</hi> Againe, there the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked flie from the presence of God, and may not abide it; but here Saints are in the presence of the Throne of God, ver. 15. There the wicked cry, that Mountaines might hide them from him that sits on the Throne: but here, hee that <hi>sitteth on the Throne,</hi> dwelleth among his Saints, and they serue him for euer, ver. 15.</p>
                  <p>These things thus compared together, may let<note place="margin">This euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewes the seuenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bee a pendicle of the sixt.</note> the iudicious Reader see, how this Chapter is a proper pendicle of the sixt, explaining at length some things shortly, and obscurely set downe in the former. So that in these two Chapters we haue
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:9469:144"/>
the first Prophecie of this Booke, which I call generall, absolued; and in the beginning of the eighth Chapter, we are to looke for a second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, which continues to the twelfth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I saw foure Angels.</hi>] This Verse, as I haue<note place="margin">What the foure Angels at the foure corners of the earth doe sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.</note> said, lets vs see, how the Angels standing at the foure corners of the earth, are ready to ouerturne the world, and to fold it vp like an old <hi>Vesture,</hi> if the Lord did not stay them. That they are said to be foure, is a certaine number for an vncertaine, yet imports it that they are sufficient; for one, at euery corner of a sheet, or vesture, as the Psalmist<note place="margin">Psal. 102. 26.</note> termeth this Vniuerse, are able enough to fold it vp.</p>
                  <p>What these Angels are, whether good or euill,<note place="margin">God doth his worke, both by good and euill Angels.</note> is disputed among the Diuines, but without a cause: for sometime by good Angels the Lord punisheth euill men, as was done to the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Sodomites</hi> and <hi>Assyrians:</hi> sometime by euill Angels hee exerciseth good men: so S. <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted with an Angell of Satan; for maruellous is the Lord in working with his Saints: Satan in his fighting against them, fights for them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies himselfe into them.</p>
                  <p>But that these are good Angels, appeares by<note place="margin">But that these are good Angels, may appeare out of the Text.</note> the speech which Christ vseth vnto them, ver. 2. <hi>Hurt not the earth, till wee haue sealed the seruants of our God in their fore-head:</hi> hee speakes to Angels, hee speakes of Saints redeemed, and inuolueth them both in the fellowship of one God with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Beside this, the execution of that last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:9469:145"/>
is commonly ascribed to the holy Angels; <hi>The Lord shall descend from heauen with a showt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Thess. 4. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>and with the Voice of the Arch-Angell, and with the Trumpet of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>When the Sonne of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 25. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>man shall come in his glory, the holy Angels shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so come with him, then shall the sheepe bee separated from the Goates.</hi> That this shall be done by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, is euident in the Parable of the Haruest; <hi>The</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Math. 13. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>Haruest is the end of the world, the Reapers are the Angels.</hi> And to this same purpose Angels here are brought in, as executors of the last Iudgement, to ouer-turne the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Holding the foure windes of the earth.</hi>] I leaue<note place="margin">This verse is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically.</note> here those allegoricall interpretations, whereby this is expounded to be the restraint of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which is the breathing of the holy Spirit for the saluation of the Elect. This agrees to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of faith, but comes not in pertinently here; for these spirituall plagues are seuerally and distinctly fore-told by themselues in the second Prophecy beginning at the eighth chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this first generall Prophecie denounceth plagues corporall, or externall, sword, famine, pestilence, beasts, whereby the Lord punishes the contempt of his Gospell, Preached to the world by him who rideth vpon the White Horse.</p>
                  <p>We still keep our former ground, that by the<note place="margin">The restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the winde, is a type of the dissolution of the world.</note> holding of the winds, that they blow not, a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the world, and destruction of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therein is here declared: for if we shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the foure Elements among themselues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:9469:145"/>
at all we can want none of them, yet the most necessarie, at least, which wee may want shortest space, is the Aire, for it is by respiration that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing liueth, which is endued with sense: take breath away from man, and beast, they perish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent; and such as haue the vegetatiue life, as<note place="margin">No liuing thing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, without motion of the Aire.</note> trees, or plants, without motion of the Aire, they wither and decay: yea, without it, the fire burneth not, the Sea moues not, but putrifies and stinkes, and the creatures which are therein die. So much worth to man and the creature, is this one, among the smallest of Gods benefites, euen the benefite of the Aire; which <hi>Pisida</hi> properly called a gift, that could not be gotten for siluer: But man, not considering what he hath, cannot bee thankefull. Alway, this with-holding of the winds, that they blow not, which the Angels are ready to doe, if they were not stayed by a superiour power, imports (as we haue said) the destruction of the world, and all creatures therein contained, which shall stand no longer, then the Saints of God be once accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
