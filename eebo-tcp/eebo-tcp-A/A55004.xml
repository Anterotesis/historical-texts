            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THat Kindneſs that hath been always between us, makes me thus bold with you, as to requeſt your Vote for a Worthy Gentleman, Mr.—, who ſtands to be Burgeſs here. I had ſo great a confidence of your Kindneſs to me, that I did almoſt aſſure him of your Vote; and I am confident if you knew the Gentleman as well as I do, I ſhould not need to have ask'd this Favour. But if you pleaſe to engage for him upon my Credit, you will not, I believe, repent your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking: for he is a <hi>moderate man,</hi> and of <hi>ſound Principles in Religion, according to the Pureſt Reform'd way, a ſtout Oppoſer of the Court, and a good Country-man,</hi> and one that will ſtand up for the <hi>Intereſt of the People and the Good of the Country;</hi> and ſuch men will make us happy: and ſuch I hope you will always ſtand for. Our Election is next <hi>Thurſday<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <salute>My Old Friend!</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Received yours, and have conſidered of your Motion for my Vote. I confeſs I have one to give, and am reſolv'd to beſtow it on an honeſt Gentleman, if I can. Your Friend may be ſo, for any thing I know; but the <hi>Character</hi> you give of him in your Letter is not ſo <hi>taking</hi> with me, as peradventure you think it is, as to fetch me ten Miles to Vote for him. You tell me he is a <hi>Moderate</hi> man: what you mean by that piece of your Character I do not know; whether you mean it as to the King, or the eſtabliſht Government in Church, it matters not; he cannot be a fit man for this Election, when the moſt zealous men for King and Church are the fitteſt now to ſecure us from thoſe <hi>Plots</hi> that are on all ſides againſt <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and to defend us from a <hi>Commonwealth-Government</hi> in the State, and <hi>Presbytery</hi> or worſe in the Church; both which are ſo plainly drove at and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: and I fear your <hi>Moderate</hi> men will rather pull down, than keep up and preſerve the preſent Eſtabliſhments amongſt us. I my ſelf have felt and ſeen too much miſchief by a Change in Government, ever to give my Aid and Aſſiſtance a Second time to its <hi>Alteration</hi> or <hi>Downfal.</hi> I formerly have been inclin'd to believe <hi>Moderation</hi> would be the beſt way to preſerve the Government in Church and State, and beget the King and Church many Friends, and confirm and ſecure them for ever. But ſad experience hath found the contrary; and nothing hath ruin'd All, and made the Enemies of our Government ſo <hi>high,</hi> ſo <hi>ſawcy</hi> and <hi>inſolent,</hi> as <hi>Lenity.</hi> Had they bin kept at firſt to their Duty and Allegiance, and felt the Effects of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, they would not have grown to ſuch a <hi>Formidable Height of Preſumption</hi> as now they are, and been ſo ungovernable.</p>
               <p>As for your Burgeſſes Principles in Religion, which you warrant are ſo ſound, they do not appear ſo to me. I have ſome reaſon to ſuſpect them, you word them ſo <hi>cunningly,</hi> in an unuſual Phraſe, <hi>According to the pureſt Reformed way.</hi> He may be what he pleaſe, even an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> or a <hi>Quaker,</hi> for any thing I ſee in that Character. <hi>Purity of Reformation</hi> is the language of them all, and <hi>each Faction</hi> pretends to be the <hi>pureſt;</hi> and where to rank him, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>And for his Principles in Politicks, I have too much ground to queſtion them too, from what you ſay of him, That he is <hi>a ſtout Oppoſer of the Court;</hi> the King, I doubt, you mean, if not Monarchy. And in that you tell me he is <hi>a good Countryman,</hi> I muſt for ever be jealous of him, and of that ſort of men, and believe for two Reaſons them to be Men of Dangerous and Miſchievous Principles, to both Church and State. I conſeſs I have formerly lookt upon them as their Title beſpoke them, as a very Loyal true-hearted ſort of Gentlemen, that rather meant a great deal of good, than hurt to Church and State; and deſigned to carry it <hi>even</hi> betwixt Court and Country, and not to <hi>deſtroy the Prerogative,</hi> and to <hi>graſp at all Power,</hi> nor to <hi>Incloſe Soveraignty in the Commons Houſe,</hi> and <hi>make the King himſelf a Duke of</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, <hi>and his Antient Court and Counſel inſignificant Cyphers.</hi> But as things have been lately managed by that ſort of Men you call <hi>Country-men,</hi> I muſt except againſt them,</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the worſt Principled Men in the whole Nation, are the Men that uſurp the Title of <hi>Countrymen,</hi> and have it beſtowed upon them; and the Beſt and moſt Faithful Subjects His Majeſty hath, and thoſe that have approved themſelves always ſo, are the perſons that onely are blackned with that diſgraceful Name of <hi>Courtiers,</hi> which makes me think there is a <hi>Snake in the Graſs;</hi> ſo that I have no reaſon to think ſo <hi>well</hi> of your <hi>Countryman,</hi> nor ſo <hi>ill</hi> of the <hi>Courtiers</hi> as you and others do, and would have me. I am inclined to believe there were ſome <hi>Covetous and Ambitious men</hi> at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> in and about Sixty, that ſought their own Intereſt more than the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97290:2"/>
King's and Countrey's, and caſt off the beſt Subjects His Majeſty had, becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſht; and brought into Place and Power his worſt Enemies, to the manifeſt diſcouragement of Loyalty and good Principles. And this unequal diſtribution of Preferments and Places, did no doubt exaſperate the Kings ſuffering Friends. But now, by the <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> and <hi>Fanatick cunning,</hi> thoſe <hi>private piques</hi> are improved to an <hi>univerſal implacability</hi> againſt the <hi>Court,</hi> and all that belong to it; and as they have ordered the buſineſs, every perſon about the King and Court, except their own Party, muſt be the object of the peoples Fear and Malice: and though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt the Court was firſt the ſuffering <hi>Cavaleers</hi> onely, and not the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Dad's</hi> were then uppermoſt, and rul'd the roaſt; yet ſince of late years Counſels have gone ſomewhat againſt them, now 'tis their complaint chiefly: for this muſt be obſerved, that when the <hi>Godly Party</hi> are not uppermoſt, <hi>things cannot go well;</hi> and they muſt cry out of <hi>Ill Management,</hi> and <hi>bad Miniſters of State,</hi> and <hi>evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi> and Addreſs for their Removal, that ſo there may be room for themſelves: for certain it is, there is no ſuch grievance under any Government, as for them to be under; <hi>Dominion</hi> being <hi>Founded in Grace,</hi> they have a palpable wrong done them, if they be not at the Stern; and thoſe Miniſters of State that ſhall dare but adviſe the contrary, ſhall be <hi>Enemies to God and Religion,</hi> and diſaffected to the <hi>Countries Intereſt;</hi> and if poſſible, be made a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to Popular Rage and Fury: ſo that I find the <hi>worſt Principled Men,</hi> are the <hi>beſt Countrymen,</hi> in the peoples eſteem; and thoſe in the Houſe of Commons that fly moſt briskly in the face of the King and his Friends, and do moſt confront the Court and Biſhops, are the peoples Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. And ſince I have ſeen, and ſufficiently prov'd, what kinde of men the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Court generally are, in the laſt <hi>Country-mans Parliament,</hi> and what they all along aim'd at; I deſire to be excus'd from being concern'd in my Vote for a <hi>Country-man</hi> any more.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe alſo the Notion is founded upon this moſt Seditious and Peſtilent Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, <hi>That neither the King nor Court are friends to the Country.</hi> For if that be not neceſſarily ſuppos'd in the Diſtinction of <hi>Country-man</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Court,</hi> how could a mans bare Attendance on the King, and being his Servant, make him liable immediately to the Peoples Wrath and Cenſure, if he did not receive his Malignity to the Country from Him who gave him his Preferment and Place? For certainly, if a man muſt be forthwith accounted an Enemy to the Country (as we ſee he is) for no other reaſon, but becauſe he is a Courtier, and neer to the King; He then that is the greateſt Courtier, and made him ſo, muſt be ſuppoſed to be their <hi>Greateſt Foe;</hi> and no queſtion but 'tis the King they mean, if they durſt but ſpeak out; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how could it come to paſs, (as we ſee now it doth) that all that are about the King, and thoſe eſpecially that he <hi>loves beſt,</hi> be they never ſo Honeſt and Faithful, or Wiſe or Juſt, muſt forthwith be counted Dangerous and Miſchievous men to the people, and all Arts muſt be uſed to <hi>Remove</hi> or <hi>Ruine</hi> them; when perhaps juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Advancement to their Princes Favour, they ſtood fair enough in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eſteem; and they then <hi>Commenced Villains,</hi> when they were preferr'd. And I pray tell me how could this happen, if the people did not believe the <hi>King</hi> to be the Countreys <hi>Greateſt Foe,</hi> and the main <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> of their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Freedom.</hi> And for this conſideration it is, that I ſhall forbear to anſwer your deſires, as to your hopeful Burgeſs. I could wiſh you and others would be wiſe in time, and take heed of being drawn into Rebellion and Miſchief before you are aware. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we live under is <hi>Eaſie</hi> and <hi>Gentle;</hi> and none that I know of have any juſt cauſe to complain of it, or to deſire or endeavour a change in it. I profeſs I do not ſee what reaſon there is, for thoſe common and ſtale Clamours of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Court;</hi> if any thing <hi>looſes,</hi> and hath done for the laſt Age, 'tis the <hi>Prerogative;</hi> nay, it hath ſcarce enough left to ſecure it ſelf from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn. I cannot obſerve the leaſt deſign in the King, or any about him, to <hi>deprive</hi> the people of any of their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> but rather the contrary, to <hi>enlarge</hi> them, and to make them more and greater; witneſs that unparallel'd and moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97290:3"/>
Gracious Condeſcention of his the laſt Seſſion, about <hi>Securing our Religion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty after his Death, if the next King ſhould prove a Papiſt;</hi> which had it been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, we and our Poſterity might have been happy; but it did not ſeem <hi>good</hi> or <hi>Thanks-worthy</hi> to your <hi>good Countrymen.</hi>—</p>
               <p>And why, after this, and a many more <hi>Generous</hi> and <hi>Noble Acts,</hi> His Majeſty ſhould be repreſented amiſs to His People, as one that meant them no good, and yet prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them ſo much, is ſtrange; and why the whole Kingdom ſhould ſo obſtinately chooſe thoſe Countrymen the <hi>ſecond time,</hi> that were ſo backward to do them good, <hi>To ſecure Religion, and Try the Lords,</hi> I cannot ſee. Therefore (my Friend) give me leave to be plain with you in this caſe, that I have ſeen ſo much miſchief already, and fear ſhall ſee more and more, from that ſort of men you would have my Vote for, and call <hi>Countrymen,</hi> that I would as ſoon beſtow it upon the Five Members of the Long Parliament, if they were alive, as on theſe, and ſhould look for as much good from them as theſe. And I hope the Name of <hi>Countryman,</hi> as it ſtands oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Court,</hi> will be in a little time as odious to Wiſe, Loyal, and Good Men, as ever theirs was.</p>
               <p>And ſo you know my mind as to your Burgeſs, but this ſhall not keep me from doing the utmoſt Service I can for you in any other matter, and from being ſtill</p>
