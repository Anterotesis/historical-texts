            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>NO true Philoſopher will deny this: The <hi>Platoniſts</hi> place not the ſoul in the body, but the body in the ſoul: And the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> themſelves do with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſe, That the ſoul doth execute ſome <hi>action</hi> without the <hi>body:</hi> Nay, it ſeems very abſurd, to ſhut up
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115013:15"/>
ſo noble an Eſſence, in ſo narrow and ſtrait a Priſon; Neither were there wanting ſome <hi>Divines</hi> who attributed acerta in <hi>ubiquity</hi> to the ſoul; affirming it to be there where it worketh: for what can be deviſed more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, than to conclude that moſt noble <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as bounded and comprehended in this ſo exceeding ſmall a priſon. The common dictate of <hi>Reaſon</hi> proveth, That the thing <hi>comprehended,</hi> ſo far forth as it is comprehended, is more baſe and ignoble, than the thing <hi>comprehending:</hi> And it is manifeſt to him, who conſidereth the nature of things, That the thing comprehending, ſo far forth as it comprehendeth, is more excellent in operation and power than the thing comprehended. That the <hi>Imagination</hi> worketh without it, and beyond its own body, I take it to be manifeſt, and if any man doubt of it, he will be convinced by experience: for it worketh in the <hi>Embrio:</hi> Neither can <hi>faſcinations</hi> be otherwiſe performed. But is not the Imagination the hand of the ſoul, by which it worketh without the help of the body? and yet theſe operations conduce not to our purpoſe: Therefore we muſt ſhew more clearly what we mean by this <hi>Concluſion.</hi> We do then under it and by it, mean nothing elſe but that the <hi>ſoul</hi> muſt neceſſarily be, whereſoever the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> is found; for the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> is the bond by which the <hi>ſoul</hi> is tyed to the <hi>body:</hi> or rather it is the undivided companion of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> brought by the <hi>ſoul</hi> from heaven, by which the <hi>ſoul</hi> joyned it ſelf with the <hi>body;</hi> by means and mediation whereof, it gives the form of the <hi>body;</hi> and if by the frown of the <hi>deſtinies</hi> it be forſaken by the <hi>particular ſoul,</hi> it returns to its common country: but is never extended further than the <hi>ſoul</hi> it ſelf, without which the <hi>ſpirit</hi> cannot ſubſiſt: Then, if a mans body work ſomething without it ſelf, ſurely it worketh as informed by the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and ſhall it not then work <hi>vitally,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vital actions; But how I pray you ſhall it produce them? without doubt in and by the vertue and power of the <hi>form,</hi> that is, the <hi>ſoul.</hi> But (except I be deceived) there can nothing work by the power of another, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115013:16"/>
not be partaker of it: Therefore the <hi>active beams</hi> that produce ſuch <hi>effects</hi> without the <hi>body,</hi> muſt needs be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> by which they work. And I think no man can be ſo ſenſleſſe to deny <hi>actions extrinſecal,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, to Man, the moſt noble compound, and grant them to Plants and Stones: but that operations depend on forms, it alwayes ſeemed true to the moſt Learned. The ſeed doth (as ſome would have it) beget the <hi>Embrio</hi> in the mother; which it could not do, were it not upholden and furniſhed with the preſence of the fathers ſoul. But I hear ſome whiſper, that this opinion can be no way conſonant to truth: becauſe that then, if the father ſhould dye aſſoon as he hath begotten the child, his ſoul being free from the bonds of the body, goes to its appointed place, And how then can it work in the <hi>Embrio?</hi> But to him that conſidereth the matter well, this will appear of no great difficulty; whether we ſay, That the <hi>ſoul</hi> is not utterly and abſolutely free as long as any <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> remaineth any where ſafe and untoucht; for it there ſticks and abides as long, and until its ſubject be quite turned into an other thing; but becauſe it wants <hi>organs</hi> (as in an <hi>appoplexy)</hi> it cannot perform any ſencelike <hi>actions;</hi> Or whether we will ſay rather, The <hi>ſoul</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily preſent at theſe operations, by a certain preſence; and yet not hindered, but that in another place it may perform other works: for ſeeing that the ſoul doth by wonderful and ſtrange means, produce many things in the body, and is after divers manners in divers places, Why ſhall it not, when it is free from the body, do the ſame things, or the like, ſo it wants not its <hi>Inſtruments of its proper natural heat,</hi> which only is fit to produce ſuch an effect? But of what hath been ſaid the cauſe is plain, why about the Graves of them that <hi>die a violent death</hi> there are apparitions ſeen: for the <hi>vital heat and natural moiſture</hi> being not quite diſſolved, the <hi>ſoul</hi> ſticks, and gives ſometimes in theſe <hi>exhallations, impregnated with the ſpirit, the ſhape and form of a man:</hi> And the ſame may be the reaſon, why ſometimes in <hi>Church-yards</hi> ſuch things
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115013:16"/>
appear: and from the ſame head it is, that the ſlain Corps bleedeth at the preſence or touch of the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer: for, the <hi>ſoul</hi> being yet preſent, doth by the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence, work ſuch things. But for the better confirmation of this Concluſion, there is enough ſaid in this place, others from theſe grounds, will invent and finde out things which will be far more ſublime and high.</p>

For, if the <hi>ſoul</hi> be without the <hi>body,</hi> it can and ſhall without doubt work there: for, the <hi>ſoul</hi> in its <hi>eſſence</hi> includes <hi>Act,</hi> being (as one ſaith, and very well) an <hi>Eſſentiall Act proceeding temporally:</hi> It works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to the <hi>Organs</hi> informed, or, according to the manner of information, ſeeing it communicates a <hi>form</hi> to the <hi>ſubject;</hi> for, peradventure it were more agreeable to ſimple and pure truth, to call the <hi>ſoul,</hi> not the <hi>form,</hi> but rather, <hi>the giver of the form:</hi> yet, ſo giving <hi>forms,</hi> that both in their <hi>beings and operations</hi> they ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, and whatſoever is, is diſpenſed and given by it. <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to have placed in men a <hi>three-fold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct form,</hi> yet depending on the common ſoul. It is true, that to theſe Inferiour <hi>forms,</hi> the name of <hi>form</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given; but how truly and properly, let them look to it, that accuſtomed to ſpeculations, have learned to ſeparate <hi>Vitall Actions</hi> from the <hi>ſoul,</hi> which proceed onely from it. But we, omitting all theſe difficulties,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115013:17"/>
will be content to uſe the common means, which will alſo peradventure ſerve our turns.</p>
               <p>Some men will ſay, If the <hi>ſoul</hi> be and work without the <hi>body,</hi> or beſides it, by informing the <hi>naturall heat</hi> that proceedeth without it, and is inherent in his beams, they muſt needs be men, conſiſting of a <hi>ſoul</hi> and of a <hi>body.</hi> When I firſt began this Work, I had thought to have paſſed over ſuch Objections as ridiculous; but this being one, that may ſeem of ſome moment to them that are leſſe perſpicacious, I am content to anſwer; And <hi>firſt</hi> I ſay, it is as abſurd, for ought I ſaid, to call the <hi>beams, men,</hi> as it is to call the <hi>feet</hi> and <hi>hands, men. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Every bare information doth not make man, for it is required, that a <hi>reaſonable ſoul do inform an organical body;</hi> and thus; by means of the <hi>form,</hi> be made fit for <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical operations;</hi> but, if the <hi>ſoul inform</hi> any Compound onely <hi>vegetably,</hi> or ſome inferior way unknown to us, it cannot be forthwith called, a Man: for, the <hi>ſoul informs</hi> according to the <hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>matter,</hi> ſay the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> or more clearly, it informs according to the Portion of the <hi>vitall ſpirit</hi> that is preſent: for, every proportion of this, is not fit for every operation. Hence it appears, that though the <hi>ſoul</hi> do for ſometime inform a <hi>Corps</hi> with a certain <hi>form:</hi> for, we ſee in dead <hi>Carcaſes,</hi> the <hi>vegetative faculty</hi> doth for a time exerciſe its power, which cannot be done without the ſoul, yet it cannot be called, a Man; for, being deprived of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> it falls from that dignity; But it is moſt certain, that the <hi>ſoul</hi> being there preſent, onely according to the <hi>vegetable power,</hi> may work elſewhere: for, when it was tyed to the <hi>body,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the wayes of <hi>vitality,</hi> it did form many other operations; why then when it is altogether free from thoſe bonds, or elſe tyed with them, it ſhould not work things proper to it ſelf, there can no reaſon be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; nor can any man in judgment underſtand. It may then, according to the will of God, either injoy pleaſure, or ſuffer pain, although it be tyed to the <hi>dead Corps</hi> in that manner, ſeeing that in the <hi>vegetative faculty</hi> it ſhall

               <p>THE firſt part of this <hi>Concluſion</hi> will eaſily be evicted; for, there is no man that can deny it that conſidereth the <hi>operations</hi> of naturall things, and the hinderances of thoſe <hi>operations:</hi> For, what reaſon is there, why things more hard and ſolid, than the nature of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, work not ſo freely; is it not becauſe the <hi>Pores</hi> of the body being ſhut, the <hi>Corporal beams</hi> cannot finde a due <hi>egreſſe?</hi> Now, unleſſe they were <hi>Corporal,</hi> no <hi>affection</hi> that is <hi>meerly corporal</hi> could hinder them, and nothing but the change of the <hi>forms,</hi> could deſtroy the <hi>faculties</hi> of things: But when we ſee that the <hi>form</hi> remains, the <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> are hindered, we wonder then if we be forced to conſider and reſolve of ſuch beams. Moreover, unleſſe thoſe <hi>Active beams</hi> were <hi>corporal,</hi> their <hi>operation</hi> would proceed to any diſtance, and not be hindered by <hi>bodies.</hi> If you ſay, it is but an <hi>Accident</hi> by which things work at diſtance; yet an <hi>Accident</hi> muſt needs be in a <hi>ſubject,</hi> and muſt needs work by the <hi>virtue</hi> of that <hi>ſubject</hi> in which it is; for, I take it to be certain, that no <hi>Accident,</hi> barely conſidered in it ſelf, can have any Activity: Therefore, except ſuch beams be granted, nothing can work at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by any means; Therefore, theſe <hi>Accidents</hi> are diſplayed in <hi>Corporal beams,</hi> poſſeſſing all the manners of the body, whence they proceed, yet I would not have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115013:18"/>
you take me for a maintainer of <hi>Accidents,</hi> who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hitherto ſee any thing in nature but ſubſtance, unleſſe any man could make the poſitions and manner of things ſomething reall diſtinct from the bodies: but here I ſpeak out of ſuppoſition, granting peradventure what ſome man might ask at my hands.</p>
               <p>Beſides what hath been ſaid for our <hi>beams,</hi> you may add, that adventitious heat doth promote the operations of things; but how could it do this, but by ſtirring up more plentifull <hi>beams</hi> to bring them out? We ſee how <hi>Amber,</hi> being made hot with rubbing, drawes the <hi>Chaff</hi> to it more ſtronglier; and many other will not work unleſſe they be hot; by which making them hot, the <hi>Corporal beams</hi> are more plentifully drawn out, and ſo work more powerfully. Moreover, cloſeneſſe would not long keep the <hi>natural power</hi> of things unhurt, but that it hinders the diſſipations and ſpending of the <hi>beams:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, unleſſe <hi>beams</hi> were <hi>Corporal things,</hi> they would pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate though the moſt <hi>compact bodies,</hi> the contrary whereof, experience bears witneſſe unto: though it be true, that ſome <hi>Compound bodies</hi> ſend out <hi>beams</hi> ſo thin and ſubtill, that they can pierce the <hi>pores of all bodies;</hi> as doth appear in the <hi>Loadstone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, wherefore did Nature ordain <hi>Pores in bodies,</hi> but that they may be doors, by which theſe <hi>beams</hi> might paſs in and out: again, the <hi>ſences</hi> would never perceive <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things,</hi> but that there proceedeth <hi>beams</hi> from the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> affecting the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> as appears in <hi>ſmelling; for odour periſheth with age,</hi> and yet for no other cauſe, then that the <hi>beams</hi> periſh which bring the odour to our <hi>noſtrils;</hi> ſo from all <hi>bodies</hi> there goes ſubtill thin <hi>beams,</hi> bringing with them the ſhapes of things, which is poſſible to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to <hi>the eyes</hi> in a dark place, by mean of a <hi>tranſlucide convex—glaſſe:</hi> but unleſſe theſe <hi>beams</hi> were <hi>Corporal,</hi> let any man tell me, how they could affect <hi>the ſenſes:</hi> rather I have often wondred, how being mingled with ſo great confuſion, in paſſing through the glaſſe, they can ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explicate themſelves. But let us come to another
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115013:18"/>
ſtronger argument, and more agreeing to our purpoſes, to prove what we principally intend; And namely, that ſuch <hi>beams</hi> do in a continuall motion, go out of the <hi>bodies</hi> of <hi>wights,</hi> which we ſhall eaſily do, if we <hi>firſt,</hi> conſider the <hi>common natures</hi> of all <hi>wights:</hi> for, every <hi>wight,</hi> that it may live any ſpace, muſt neceſſarily be nouriſhed with food, neither can it live without it, becauſe of the continuall going out of the <hi>beams;</hi> the <hi>body</hi> from its <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition,</hi> can endure no more <hi>vacuity and empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> than <hi>nature</hi> hath appointed for ſuch a <hi>body:</hi> That which in food is dry, doth reſtore and refreſh the <hi>ſolid parts;</hi> and that which is moiſt, the <hi>humors:</hi> And why this? but, becauſe every day, nay, every moment, the <hi>beams,</hi> and thoſe moſt plenteouſly, do go out from <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and thoſe <hi>corporal;</hi> yea, and from every part of the <hi>body;</hi> for, were not this ſo, living <hi>wights</hi> would grow to monſtrous and enormous greatneſſe. And this is the reaſon, why <hi>wights</hi> fall to deſtruction, and are not ſo long-lived as <hi>Stones;</hi> nay, not as ſome of the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact ſort of <hi>Trees;</hi> for, the <hi>vitall ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>natural heat</hi> being in <hi>wights</hi> freer, and more at liberty, work more powerfully, and produce more plenteous <hi>exhalations;</hi> whence it comes to paſſe, that they are propagated to the greateſt diſtances, the <hi>ſoul</hi> all the while knitting them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, leſt they ſhould be altogether diſſipated: for, they could not elſe hold the <hi>ſpecifical virtue</hi> of the <hi>body;</hi> neither could they work, except the <hi>ſoul</hi> informed them; for, that hath in it the <hi>natural heat,</hi> as we ſhall ſhew in the Chapter following, which produceth a ſufficient diſpoſition to receive information from the <hi>ſouls,</hi> as we ſaid in the Chapter fore-going. But, that thoſe <hi>beams</hi> are of parts, is clearer than the Sun at noon day; for, that which proceedeth from diverſe and <hi>heterogeneous</hi> parts, conveying alſo with it ſelf, ſomething from all, even the ſmalleſt parts, cannot chooſe but be of diverſe parts: for, from the <hi>bones, fleſh, nerves,</hi> there do flow continually certain <hi>particles,</hi> of which thoſe <hi>beams</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: theſe carry with them the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>body;</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115013:19"/>
according to that <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> taken from the <hi>body,</hi> work more powerfully than the <hi>body</hi> it ſelf: Hereupon a wiſe man will take ſpecial heed of living and converſing with ſick people, the rather if he feel himſelf diſpoſed to ſuch a <hi>diſeaſe;</hi> for, a <hi>body</hi> ſo diſpoſed, doth more greedily draw to it ſelf thoſe <hi>beams,</hi> and is ſooner changed: <hi>And note,</hi> that <hi>bodies</hi> in whom there is a likeneſſe of nature and complexion do ſooner <hi>ſympathize</hi> with one another; as brothers, ſiſters, and do ſooner take <hi>infectious diſeaſes</hi> one of another; becauſe of the <hi>radical likeneſſe,</hi> the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>beams</hi> are more drawn, and the <hi>body</hi> more ſpeedily changed. Another neceſſary <hi>caution</hi> doth by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion come into my minde, That great care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to avoid theſe places where the <hi>excrements of diſeaſed perſons</hi> are laid: both for the reaſons aforeſaid, and for a more proper and particular cauſe, it ſhall be expreſt in what followeth.</p>

               <p>EVery compound conſiſting of <hi>matter and form,</hi> hath its own proper <hi>natural heat,</hi> which is derived and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, not from the <hi>Elements,</hi> but from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and particularly from the <hi>Sun</hi> the heat of <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſeeing that by the departure of it, all things grow ſad and torpid, and by the return of it are cheared and refreſhed; for, it is the <hi>fountain and original</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> making all things fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by its heat, multiplying and preſerving them in their own being. Whence it followes, that nothing can exiſt without ſome manner of <hi>heat,</hi> it being the bond whereby the <hi>form is tyed to the matter,</hi> and which, lying hid in them in <hi>a viſcous Mercury,</hi> a moiſture brought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115013:19"/>
with it from <hi>Heaven,</hi> giveth increaſe of <hi>ſeed to every body.</hi> It is alſo the inſtrument which the <hi>form</hi> uſeth to produce <hi>actions:</hi> and it is the immediate cauſe of the aforeſaid <hi>beams,</hi> which <hi>beams</hi> it never forſaketh, but accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them in their journey. Bleſſed, and thrice bleſſed is he, which can <hi>Multiply</hi> it in a fit <hi>ſubject,</hi> under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Heaven.</hi> This ſaid <hi>heat,</hi> if it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the <hi>body</hi> tends to deſtruction, the <hi>beams</hi> being fewer and weaker: Furthermore, though the <hi>form</hi> be not <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>matter,</hi> but by a certain mean of this heat, which is ſo required as proper to all things, yet it varieth in every <hi>ſpirit</hi> of things, yet it hath in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>spirit</hi> ſome latitude; ſo that you ſhall finde in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,</hi> that which is altogether the ſame; becauſe the heat ſometimes is more, and ſometimes leſſe, which may be the cauſe of variety of operations, not onely in theſe of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but even in the ſame <hi>individual:</hi> it is after changed, till at laſt by corruption, it end in that which is altogether another latitude; for, the <hi>matter</hi> is not tenacious enough, nor holds the heat faſt enough, but lets it (being <hi>volatile)</hi> wander abroad, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>impreſſions of Heaven,</hi> applyeth it ſelf va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to the <hi>matter;</hi> whence depends the whole <hi>oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> and every change in <hi>ſublunary things.</hi> But it's now time to retire our ſelves, and deſcend to the <hi>body of man,</hi> the proper <hi>ſubject</hi> of this work. And <hi>firſt,</hi> it ſhall not be amiſſe to explicate our ſelves, what we mean by the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit</hi> in this <hi>Concluſion;</hi> whether after the manner of other <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> that which the <hi>Schools</hi> call by this name; or, ſome other thing of far another nature: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although we think that <hi>received opinion</hi> of the <hi>spirits animall, vitall,</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> (as they call them) not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conſonant to truth, yet being beſides our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we mean not to meddle with it here; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of other manner of <hi>spirits.</hi> But what new <hi>spirit</hi> is this brought in into <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or, by what Authority came it in? Truly, I am ſo <hi>ſupercilious</hi> as to affirm this done by my Authority: Let it not be brought in at all;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115013:20"/>
I onely require, that I may be ſpared the uſe of that name, to expreſſe the <hi>natural heat and radicall moiſture</hi> both together; and the reaſon is, becauſe they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually ſeparated: And to call them <hi>ſpirits,</hi> becauſe of all <hi>Corporall things,</hi> they come neareſt to the nature of <hi>ſpirits,</hi> both in their originall and power. It is called <hi>vitall,</hi> becauſe by mediation of it, <hi>life</hi> flowes, and is propagated into the <hi>body;</hi> and therefore, whereſoever you finde in this Treatiſe the name of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> underſtand it as is ſaid. Now then, that this <hi>ſpirit</hi> flouriſheth in the foreſaid <hi>beams,</hi> I think it appeareth from hence; This <hi>ſpirit</hi> alſo floweth from the <hi>body,</hi> and this no wiſe man will deny; for, if it flow not from the <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> would laſt for ever: Conſequently, the things that can moſt fix theſe <hi>ſpirits,</hi> have great power to prolong the life of man: for, it is <hi>volatile,</hi> and every moment ſome portion of it goeth out with the parts of the <hi>body,</hi> reſolved into <hi>beams:</hi> for why it ſhould leave the <hi>beams</hi> going out, and inſinuate it ſelf into <hi>bodies</hi> indiſpoſed, there can be no reaſon given, nay, it ſeems utterly impoſſible; and that the <hi>beams</hi> have a diſpoſition to hold it: for, with them it goeth out in the <hi>plague,</hi> becauſe the <hi>beams</hi> (as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) retain the diſpoſition of the <hi>body</hi> from whence they go: yea, if the <hi>ſpirit</hi> were not there, the <hi>beams</hi> could not do as they do, nor work in the power of the <hi>ſoul;</hi> for, of it this <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the <hi>Inſtrument.</hi> Either therefore the <hi>bodies</hi> of men ſhall work at no diſtance at all; or, if at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whatſoever, this <hi>ſpirit</hi> muſt needs reach, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to it: and by virtue of a more <hi>potent ſoul,</hi> in the very beginning and principall of life, the <hi>body</hi> of man (as of all other <hi>wights)</hi> is ordinated to <hi>natural actions,</hi> as other <hi>natural bodies</hi> are, by the <hi>ſeminary vertues,</hi> which are in their <hi>forms;</hi> nay, more powerfull than theſe are, this <hi>ſpirit</hi> that accompanieth the <hi>beams,</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their <hi>Actions,</hi> which are far propagated; and when they grow faint, they are ſupplied by and from the <hi>bodies.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The Proof and Explanation of it, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THat the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>bodies of Wights,</hi> retain ſome portion of the <hi>vitall spirit,</hi> it appears; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lurked long in the <hi>body,</hi> they <hi>imbibe the ſpirit,</hi> and joyn it to themſelves, intercepting the <hi>beams</hi> iſſuing from the nobleſt parts of the <hi>body:</hi> yea, having at the leaſt ſome <hi>digeſtion,</hi> they are made like the <hi>bodies</hi> in which they were concocted; and therefore do more greedily attract the <hi>beams</hi> with the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and the <hi>ſpirits</hi> do much more willingly inſinuate themſelves into them, than into any other <hi>body,</hi> not partaker of the ſame; or a greater digeſtion and likeneſſe. It is likewiſe evinced by common experience; for, doth not the too much flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any <hi>excrement,</hi> produce grievous <hi>ſymptoms,</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the end death; and that not ſo much by cutting off the nouriſhment, as by exhauſting the <hi>ſpirits:</hi> or elſe in the Dropſy, how could the over-much flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the water out of the wound, cauſe death, but that the water being impregnant with theſe <hi>ſpirits,</hi> carries more of them out with it, than the <hi>body</hi> can bear in ſo ſhort a time? So, in all inward <hi>Abſceſſes,</hi> when great ſtore of <hi>purulent matter</hi> hath filled the <hi>hollow</hi> of the <hi>breaſt,</hi> if by the negligence or ignorance of the <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> it be too much and ſuddenly emptied, it is for the ſame reaſon, followed with death or dangerous weakneſſe: for, the <hi>body,</hi> unleſſe it be every-where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion requiſite, ſtored with theſe <hi>ſpirits,</hi> cannot long ſubſiſt. This <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as long as the <hi>body</hi> continues in its due <hi>Symetrie,</hi> is nouriſhed from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> by the mediation of the <hi>Air,</hi> and by the <hi>vital spirit</hi> of the Aliment. All things therefore that proceed from the <hi>bodies</hi> of man or beaſt, after what manner ſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115013:21"/>
                  <hi>naturally,</hi> or by the force of <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> are impregnated with the ſame <hi>vital spirit the body hath:</hi> and therefore becauſe they are liker the <hi>bodies</hi> whence they came, than thoſe things that never were in the <hi>body,</hi> they quickly imprint the <hi>qualities</hi> drawn from the <hi>bodies,</hi> upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other like <hi>body,</hi> which ought to occaſion great care, that <hi>excrement matter,</hi> corruption, nor any of thoſe things that come from <hi>infected perſons</hi> be left unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; for, great miſchief may come by them, either by <hi>Nature,</hi> or by <hi>Art,</hi> if peradventure they come into the hands of ſome skilfull, but ill-diſpoſed men. But if the burning of <hi>Dead Carcaſes,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> be not permitted, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ought to take care, that they be ſoon, and very deep buried, and that in moiſt places, if it may be, and far remote from the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Beaſts: for, from ſhallow ſuperficiall Gravels, there ariſe unſpeakable miſchiefs; And I think this is one of the greateſt <hi>natural</hi> cauſes, why the Plague doth ſo furiouſly rage in diverſe places: for, I am afraid, that they to whom the charge of burying is committed, are ſtill too negligent and careleſſe. I would here take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to commend, and that upon good grounds, the <hi>funeral fires</hi> of the <hi>Ancients;</hi> But another cuſtome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now prevailed, I am ſure my words will not alter it. It is known that <hi>Witches</hi> cannot hurt, without the <hi>parts of dead bodies,</hi> and the <hi>Excrements</hi> of him that they deſire to miſchieve; as therefore <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ought to have a care of <hi>burials,</hi> ſo every man, if he have <hi>Enemies,</hi> ought to have a care of his <hi>Excrements.</hi> But now let us return to the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> which affirmed, <hi>That theſe Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do alſo live,</hi> which though at firſt do ſeem a little hard, yet indeed to him that will conſider it, it is ſo far from being either hard or unreaſonable, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould be otherwayes; nay, what if I ſhould ſay, the <hi>hair</hi> and <hi>nails</hi> do <hi>live a certain life,</hi> propagated from the <hi>ſoul.</hi> It may be thou wilt ſay, For they are as certain <hi>parts of the body,</hi> they live with the ſame <hi>ſoul</hi> they did before, thou wouldſt think that more ſtrange; and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115013:21"/>
yet thou canſt not give a reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt think ſo: Well, this only I will ſay of <hi>Excrements,</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they live with the ſame life that <hi>wights</hi> do after a manner, certainly they would want the <hi>vital spirit,</hi> of which we ſpake before, and which we have above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and will not all this clearly demonſtrate, that they have and do plentifully injoy it? Moreover, who can deny that the <hi>nails</hi> and <hi>hairs</hi> have <hi>life,</hi> that have obſerved in them an <hi>augmentative</hi> or aſſimulative faculty? at leaſt who can deny it ſo long as they remain faſtened to the <hi>body,</hi> though they want <hi>ſence,</hi> as the <hi>bones</hi> and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of the <hi>Organical body</hi> do? Now, if they <hi>live</hi> when they remain joyned to the <hi>body,</hi> theſe ſhall likewayes <hi>live</hi> when they are ſeparated from the <hi>body,</hi> as long as they are <hi>nails</hi> and <hi>hairs,</hi> having ſtill the ſame <hi>form</hi> as they had before: Witneſſe the <hi>Accidents</hi> or the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial moods,</hi> which abiding ſtill the ſame, depend of the ſame fountains from whence they flowed: but no man can deny, that the very <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>figure,</hi> or <hi>mood</hi> flowed from the <hi>ſoul,</hi> draweth thence its life, which is propagated by the preſence of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> by the mediation of the <hi>vital spirit.</hi> In concluſion, a man may thus argue for any <hi>Excrement:</hi> All <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> by means of ſome manner of <hi>Digeſtion,</hi> have changed the <hi>form</hi> they had before that <hi>Digeſtion,</hi> and put on another, as may be known by their <hi>operations</hi> and <hi>faculties,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together changed. As for example; The <hi>Excrements</hi> of a Dog healeth the diſeaſes of the <hi>Pallet and Throat,</hi> which <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>bones</hi> howſoever prepared, could not do, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they had been ſtinking and corrupt; and this <hi>form</hi> by which they work ſuch things, they got from the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the Dog; and therefore being introduced and brought in by it, it depends wholly of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and conſequently cannot want <hi>vitality,</hi> which <hi>vitality</hi> or <hi>livelineſſe</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and unperceivable to them which know not the centers of things, which it ſhall better become a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to ſearch after, than ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported with a deſire of contradiction.</p>

               <p>IF we confirm and demonſtrate this <hi>Concluſion,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the buſineſſe is done: for, this being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed here, is laid a firm foundation of this <hi>Act,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the precepts thereof may be built: yet, if what we have ſaid already, abide unſhaken, the future diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will not be great: But firſt, it would be known, what <hi>concatenation</hi> we do here intend, when we affirm a <hi>concatenation of ſpirits or beams between the body and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements thereof;</hi> we underſtand thereby, a perpetual flux of <hi>beams,</hi> proceeding after a peculiar manner from the <hi>body,</hi> and terminated as in a <hi>body,</hi> after a ſort in kinne, and like unto it; as alſo reciprocally flowing from the <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi> That there is ſuch reciprocall <hi>emanations,</hi> is eaſily ſhewed: for, if you once grant the <hi>flux of beams,</hi> and <hi>Impregnation of the Excrements</hi> by the <hi>vital ſpirits,</hi> it will neceſſarily follow, that both the <hi>beams of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and the <hi>body,</hi> as not differing in nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are ſo terminated one upon another by the aforeſaid means, rather than by any other: yea, if the <hi>form</hi> both of the <hi>body</hi> and of the <hi>Excrements</hi> do depend in the ſame <hi>ſoul,</hi> it will be amiſſe to call them <hi>Excrements,</hi> untill they have utterly loſt their <hi>form</hi> they got in the <hi>body;</hi> rather a part of the <hi>body,</hi> or ſomething ſubordinate to the <hi>body,</hi> and therefore the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> being affected in the <hi>Excrements,</hi> is alſo affected in the <hi>body,</hi> which cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a <hi>concatenation:</hi> But this generall rule is to be obſerved, namely, <hi>That the Excrements of any parts, are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly</hi>

                  <hi>allyed and tyed to the Part whoſe Excrements they were;</hi> and that the <hi>beams</hi> that interchangeably flow from theſe, do by a peculiar love, imbrace theſe that flow from the part whoſe <hi>Excrement</hi> it is, <hi>&amp; vice verſa;</hi> for, out of that part it hath drawn more plenteous <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and therefore hath greater affinity with it; which may be perceived by manifold experiences: for, if you put any uſcerating thing into the <hi>Excrements,</hi> the <hi>Pudding</hi> will be affected with great grief and pain: For example, Put <hi>Peaſe</hi> in a firing-Pan, till they be very hot, and put them into <hi>hot odure,</hi> and how many <hi>Peaſe,</hi> ſo many Puſtules will be on the fundament. So the <hi>Aculeus Pastenacae Marinae,</hi> ſtuck in the place where one hath lately Piſt, reſtrains it, till you have pull'd it out again. You will finde more Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this kinde in the proceſſe of this Work. It is not therefore to be doubted, but that the <hi>Excrements</hi> are by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal beams concatenated with the bodies,</hi> eſpecially with thoſe parts out of which they laſt proceeded; Thence ariſe ſeverall conſiderations, whereof we will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice hereafter; onely take notice of this, That upon this <hi>concatenation,</hi> depends all <hi>Magnetical Phyſick,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mark it well, that if any thing in the practice ſhall ſeem obſcure, that thou mayſt addreſſe thy ſelf to this place, and better conſider that which is already ſaid: It is added in the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that the furtheſt diſtance doth not break this <hi>concatenation,</hi> which is ſo true, that the <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> extends it ſelf ſo largely, that it is ſcarcely contained in place: for, the <hi>concatenation</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the <hi>ſoul,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>extended</hi> according to the <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>ſoul;</hi> beſides, the other reaſon (which we infinuated above) of this extention where we ſaid, there do moſt plentifull <hi>ſpirits</hi> flow from <hi>wights,</hi> by reaſon of the great plenty of <hi>vitall ſpirits,</hi> which appear to the <hi>ſences,</hi> in that they need ſo great ſtore of Aliment, to the end that what was ſpent in propagating <hi>beams,</hi> might by the conduct of the <hi>diſpenſing ſpirit,</hi> be renewed in the <hi>body</hi> the fountain of them: There is therefore no ſmall ſtore of thoſe <hi>beams,</hi> becauſe being thin, ſubtil, and eaſily
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115013:23"/>
diſſipated, they need continual food for the reparation of them; They extend themſelves likewiſe very far, and work diverſly (we not knowing of it:) and as diverſly are we affected in the hurting of them, when we are fully ignorant of the <hi>cauſes</hi> of our <hi>diſeaſes:</hi> And therefore in all <hi>ſickneſſes</hi> the ſaid <hi>ſpirit</hi> is to be rectified, comforted and multiplied; and ſo may all <hi>diſeaſes</hi> be eaſily cured; which we propound eſpecially, for <hi>Phiſicians</hi> to note and conſider. Now there is no man will deny but that which we have ſaid of the Excrements, doth alſo agree to the <hi>parts ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>body,</hi> as alſo to the <hi>blood;</hi> for, there is the ſame reaſon in all: in <hi>blood</hi> it appeareth moſt evident, becauſe in Holy Writ it is called the <hi>ſeat of the ſoul</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> as having greateſt ſtore of vital ſpirits, and hurting more eaſily, by the too much flux of it. Amongſt all thoſe things confirm this concatenation, that moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Sympathetical Oyntment</hi> commonly called, the <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-ſalve,</hi> and our <hi>Sympathetical Water,</hi> do by manifeſt experience clearly prove it, in deſpite of the vain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperous noiſe that ſome ignorant Divines make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, proclaiming it <hi>diabolical</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious;</hi> whom many others, and eſpecially the learned <hi>Helmont</hi> hath put to everlaſting ſilence. Nor did the wrangling <hi>Libavius</hi> (though he proudly railed after his manner) write better againſt this, than he did of and for the <hi>Philoſophers Stone,</hi> how ignorantly and audaciouſly he carried himſelf in both, to the infinite prejudice of the Hermetical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, is known too well to them that have learned the true knowledge of things from the things themſelves: but of this enough. Of the parts of the body ſeparated from it, he that doubteth may find in the ſame <hi>Helmount,</hi> a ſtrange ſtory: I will give you his own words. <q>A certain man of <hi>Bruxels</hi> being at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> did in a fray loſe his Noſe; he went to <hi>Tagliacorzo</hi> a Chirurgeon, living there, to conſult how he might have a new <hi>Noſe;</hi> and fearing the cutting of his own <hi>Arm,</hi> hired a Porter, that for a great ſum of money, was content to let him have a <hi>Noſe</hi> cut out of his <hi>Arm</hi> (as the manner is:) he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115013:23"/>
did ſo, and the Cure well performed, the man of <hi>Bruxels</hi> returned home into his own Country: But about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen moneths after his return home, he felt his Noſe ſuddenly grow cold, and within a few dayes after it rotted and fell quite off: And where many wondred of this ſtrange change, he inquired into the cauſe, and it was found, that juſt at the ſame inſtant when the Noſe grew cold, the Porter at <hi>Bolonia</hi> died: And (ſaith <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount)</hi> there are many yet living in <hi>Bruxels</hi> that can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the truth thereof: Thus far he.</q> The like I have heard from a Doctor of Phiſick, a friend of mine, who did ſwear deeply, that himſelf was an eye-witneſſe of it. Is not all our Doctrine here confirmed clearer than the light? Was not the <hi>inſcitious noſe,</hi> as animated at the firſt, ſo ſtill informed with the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the <hi>Porter?</hi> neither had it any from the man, whoſe Noſe now it was made, but only <hi>nouriſhment,</hi> the power of the <hi>aſſimulation,</hi> which it hath from its proper <hi>form,</hi> it took it not from him, but from the <hi>Porter,</hi> of whom it was yet truly a part; and who dying, the Noſe became a dead Noſe, and did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly tend to corruption: But who doth not here ſee moſt openly and evidently a <hi>concatenation?</hi> otherwiſe, how could the <hi>Noſe</hi> of one that was at <hi>Bolonia, enform</hi> the <hi>Noſe</hi> of one that was at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> but by means of a concatenation? Our aſſertion therefore is confirmed by true and undoubted experience; from whence, as from a plenteous ſpring, divers fair rivelets do flow. Hence aroſe that glorious <hi>Miracle of Nature,</hi> whereby a man may at diſtance, and in an inſtant open his mind to his friend, though they be ten thouſand miles aſunder, by means of a <hi>little blood, fleſh, and ſpirit,</hi> a ſecret not to be revealed to the unworthy multitude.

and better: for what can hinder <hi>action</hi> but undue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximation, which impediment we here ſtudy to avoid, ſeeking the vital ſpirit in its nakedneſſe that it may be the ſooner affected, by a due and convenient <hi>application,</hi> and may be the more ſpeedily freed from things hurtful and extraneous, and ſo quickly change and rectifie the <hi>body</hi> ſlipt into a diſtemper: for, if where it is moſt naked, it being there free from <hi>extraneous</hi> things, becauſe it is not ſo fettered and cloyed with evils, then certainly there (if one know the right <hi>ſubject,</hi> and uſe the <hi>right Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi> it may be made to free the <hi>body</hi> ſooner from <hi>diſeaſes:</hi> for being fortified in one place, it will ſtraight-wayes be fortified throughout: for, as a diſeaſe is never truly, but when the whole ſpirit is infected with a ſickly diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for till that time it is but, as ſome ſpeak, <hi>in fieri;</hi> which <hi>dispoſition</hi> at the beginning <hi>affected</hi> but one part, and that <hi>affected</hi> not hindered, corrupted the whole; ſo muſt we alſo <hi>philoſophize</hi> concerning the recovery of health; but there are two things here requiſit: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That thou ceaſe not the application, until the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> be fully cured: for, if thou leave off before that time, the part that is yet infected, will (if the <hi>infection</hi> be ſtrong) again corrupt and <hi>infect</hi> the part, thou hadſt made whole, and ſo leave thee to begin the ſame labour again. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That one part anſwer another; for he that will happily <hi>cure diſeaſes,</hi> muſt begin at the <hi>root,</hi> and if the <hi>root</hi> of the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> be in the <hi>head,</hi> then cure the <hi>vital spirit</hi> proper to the <hi>head:</hi> if in the <hi>ſtomack,</hi> to the <hi>ſtomack;</hi> for though the vital ſpirits conſidered in themſelves, have no <hi>hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genical parts,</hi> but be every where, and wholly as the light like it ſelf; yet as it is in the body, by certain <hi>adjuncts</hi> very conſiderable; And therefore the <hi>beams</hi> proceeding from the head, do in that diſpoſition contain the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as the <hi>head</hi> doth; as from the things already ſaid may eaſily be gathered: The naked ſpirit thereof affected with the diſpoſitions of the head (if the root of the diſeaſe be in the head) is to be taken, and remedies applied to that, before we proceed to other things. It will not be a miſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115013:26"/>
to confirm the truth of this <hi>Concluſion</hi> by experience; There's no man doubts, but that in the blood the ſpirit is moſt naked; for, if it were more naked, than for fear of death, if it could, it would fly and get it gon to its own country: Therefore Phiſicians know that the naked <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in the <hi>blood</hi> is ſooner infected with poiſon, than the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of any other part; for, <hi>venom</hi> being put into a <hi>vein,</hi> doth ſooner diſſolve and looſe the whole <hi>form of the body,</hi> than twice ſo much taken in meat or drink inwardly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be taken faſting, or without any other <hi>vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum;</hi> which confirmeth the truth of our Concluſion.

being far from the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Excrements,</hi> there is no need the Spirit ſhould drown it ſelf ſo far and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: Moreover, the <hi>beams</hi> coming from <hi>excrements, blood without the veins,</hi> and <hi>parts ſeparated</hi> ſtick about the ſurface and outſide, and are not allured and drawn inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; becauſe that is tending to deſtruction, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> retires it ſelf, and makes ſome ſtay in the ſuperfices, where alſo the <hi>beams</hi> joyn themſelves to their fellow<hi>-beams,</hi> and there reſt, untill at laſt the excrements, blood and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated parts becoming clean another thing, are apt either to receive theſe beams, and the ſpirit that accompanieth them, or to return them when they have received them. Again, the ſpirits are more naked in theſe, eſpecially in the blood, becauſe that when it was in the body, it had the ſpirits more naked, and ſcarce tyed to the body, as appears evidently in blood. But ſome may ask how this reaſon agrees to parts cut off, for what priviledge have they above parts of the ſame kind? I anſwer, It is to be conſidered, That now the door is open, by which a more free egreſſe is granted to the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> which now having broken the fetters, begin to wander abroad more at liberty. Again, ſome will object, That if this were true, then by applying things to a wound, we might cure internal diſeaſes. To ſatisfie this objection, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things; and <hi>firſt,</hi> That in every wound there is not only <hi>ſolutio continui,</hi> but alſo the part wounded, there is in a part <hi>exotick</hi> and a ſtrange <hi>quality</hi> introduced, by means whereof the <hi>vital spirit</hi> is hurt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe things that are applied to the wound, have no power to change the <hi>vital spirit,</hi> labouring of another evil diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, the <hi>Phiſician's</hi> expectation is ſatisfied, if one thing do but perform <hi>operation;</hi> and therefore they are content with the <hi>cure</hi> of the wound. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If a thing good for another <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> whereof peradventure the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> is ſick, ſhould be applied to the <hi>wound,</hi> it perhaps will hurt this more, than it would help that: Now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon perſwades, we ſhould <hi>firſt</hi> ſuccour that which moſt urgeth. From theſe things the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Objection</hi> is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115013:27"/>
manifeſt; for the <hi>ſpirit</hi> then labouring of a double <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Art</hi> commandeth to cure that which moſt urgeth; therefore we principally attend the <hi>wound,</hi> leſt <hi>ſyderation</hi> ſhould follow, or ſomething elſe bringing aſſured de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; And for the ſame reaſon we apply not to it things good for the other diſeaſe; yet this I will here adde, That it is manifeſt by experience, that many men by <hi>wounds</hi> have been freed from many other diſeaſes, and ſo, that they never relapſed into them afterwards; namely when the <hi>part affected</hi> being wounded, the things proper to the diſeaſe could alſo perform the <hi>cure</hi> of the <hi>wound:</hi> as if the <hi>head</hi> labouring of a <hi>cronical diſeaſe,</hi> ſhould be wounded, and the wound could be cured with <hi>Betony</hi> and <hi>Sage,</hi> there is no doubt but the <hi>ſpirit</hi> being naked, and now being refreſhed and cheriſhed with theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, would perfectly heal both the <hi>head,</hi> and the whole body. Here alſo is this to be noted, That they who dig the body with <hi>Cauteries,</hi> and keep the wounds open a long time for the <hi>purulent matter</hi> to run, are ill adviſed, they do not apply to the wound remedies proper for that diſeaſe, for which they made the <hi>Iſſue;</hi> for this being done, the <hi>Patients</hi> would in ſhort time feel very great eaſe, if that wound were made upon the part principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; eſpecially if all the other things were accordingly done <hi>diaſtatically,</hi> and the matter alſo that iſſueth out, uſed as Art commandeth. By theſe means it is certain, and found by experience, that the <hi>Gout</hi> in the <hi>hands, feet,</hi> and other parts, may moſt happily and eaſily be cured. But returning again to the <hi>excrements, blood,</hi> and ſeparated parts, we ſay, That this <hi>Art</hi> uſeth thoſe rather and with better ſucceſſe than the whole body that is hurt: becauſe the <hi>vital spirit</hi> being free and naked, eaſily receiveth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, eſpecially from things agreeing with it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Inventers</hi> of this <hi>Art,</hi> mingle ſuch things (though taken from other bodies) with the <hi>Medicines,</hi> as in the common <hi>Weapon-ſalve</hi> it is to be ſeen, where they mingle with the Oyntment, the <hi>fleſh, blood</hi> and <hi>fat</hi> of <hi>men</hi> for no other cauſe; that being endued with theſe <hi>Medicaments</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:115013:28"/>
and <hi>qualities</hi> of Medicaments, they might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily help the <hi>heart, spirits;</hi> for, by their likeneſſe, they do the more eaſily draw the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and being drawn, do the more eaſily change them, according to the qualities acquired; but it is not alwayes neceſſary, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines be mingled with thoſe things that are taken from the <hi>body;</hi> for, we ſee, that the <hi>ſympathetical water</hi> alone, and ſimple without any mixture, will cure all wounds by means of the <hi>blood</hi> of the wound: but eſpeciall care muſt be taken, that you make choiſe of thoſe things that do cure, not by <hi>qualities,</hi> but by their <hi>whole ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as they uſe to ſpeak, that is, by their <hi>ſignatures</hi> from Heaven; or elſe ordained to ſuch affections by the <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reaſon</hi> of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> otherwayes they may eaſily miſſe the mark: for, the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> diſpenſed from <hi>Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it paſſeth the like <hi>ſpirits,</hi> doth much advance the effects; nay, without this thou wilt ſcarce do any good, as by daily <hi>experience</hi> we may ſee made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>

               <p>IN as much as the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> being fortified, can by its own power free the <hi>body</hi> from hurtfull <hi>humors;</hi> It may be doubted, whether in <hi>Cures</hi> done by this <hi>Art, Purgation</hi> be to be promiſed: And true it is indeed, that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> can by its power, expell hurtfull things out of the <hi>body:</hi> But, if any would <hi>quickly, ſafely and pleaſantly cure diſeaſes</hi> by this <hi>Art,</hi> it is fit to begin with <hi>Purgation;</hi> for ſo, the oppreſſed <hi>ſpirit</hi> is relieved, and is made fitter, being helpt by our <hi>Medicine</hi> to do the other things, and when it is free, it is more eaſily changed and reduced to its former eſtate: for, there are ſome of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> before they give a <hi>Doſe</hi> of a great <hi>Elixer, firſt</hi> think fit, (that the <hi>Cure</hi> may be more eaſily wrought) to free the <hi>Body</hi> by <hi>Purgation.</hi> How much rather then in this <hi>Art</hi> now, whether it is beſt to do it, may be doubted. And <hi>firſt,</hi> it is to be conſidered, That there be very few <hi>ſimples, violently purging,</hi> that do not hurt the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> by their great <hi>proportion</hi> of <hi>venenoſity. Secondly,</hi> there is not yet any <hi>Medicine</hi> purging <hi>Magnetically</hi> found out, (except ſome certain <hi>ointments</hi> commonly known) which utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wants all <hi>venemous qualities.</hi> And therefore, I would have them quite forborn, becauſe they may be the cauſe of more miſchief, than if they were given inwardly: But <hi>Magnets</hi> and <hi>Oyls</hi> may be commodiouſly uſed, if the diſeaſe be in the <hi>Stomach, Inteſtines,</hi> or <hi>Meſaricks:</hi> I will give this example of one that doth gently looſe the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; In other Writers thou mayeſt finde more, or mayeſt make them according to thine own intention.

There are many things ſpoken of an Hearb in the Weſt parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> called by the Natives, <hi>Mackanbuy;</hi> which if any carry about him, it purgeth without griping; but that it doth not this by corroborating the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> it appears: for, if one carry it about him too long, it brings a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>flux.</hi> Some aſcribe the like vertue to <hi>Tobacco,</hi> tyed to the Flank; So the milky juice of <hi>Tithimal,</hi> mixt with ſalt, and put it into the new <hi>Excrements of the belly,</hi> doth violently looſen, but not without pain; yet theſe things muſt be warily uſed; neither is it ſafe to apply any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that purgeth violently to the <hi>vital ſpirit</hi> nakedly, either by <hi>excrement, blood,</hi> or any other <hi>means;</hi> we will therefore preſcribe ſome things to be taken inwardly, which are benigne, and agreeable to <hi>Nature,</hi> and which thou mayeſt uſe, untill by experience there be more healthſome Purges found out, examined according to the Precepts of this <hi>Art:</hi> And the firſt ſhall be the <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical.

This doth likewayes cure <hi>continual burning feavers,</hi> if it be given the firſt or ſecond day, while the Patient is yet ſtrong: Thou mayſt if thou wilt afterwards, give ſome <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> eſpecially of thoſe who procure ſweat, not by <hi>prolatation,</hi> but <hi>confortation,</hi> and the aboveſaid prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Antimony.</hi>

               <p>Out of what hath been ſaid, thou mayſt learn to make <hi>Panchimagogon,</hi> if thou know how to vary the <hi>Doſe</hi> of the Ingredients, according to the variety of humors, thou mayſt likewayes uſe the extract of black <hi>Hellebor,</hi> made by white Wine, to all <hi>melancholy diſeaſes</hi> with good ſucceſſe, eſpecially in the ſuppreſſing <hi>menſtruous,</hi> and all diſeaſes ariſing from thence; but thou mayſt adde to theſe, <hi>Reſina Scamonii,</hi> ſo ſhalt thou beſt haſten the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and take away the nauceouſneſſe which often proceeds from the operation of <hi>Hellebor,</hi> that which is by <hi>Rulandus</hi> called, <hi>The golden ſpirit of Life,</hi> is good for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes, it is made with ſtrong <hi>S.

               <p>I have moreover often uſed <hi>Cariocoſtinum</hi> prepared chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically very happily, which do you conſider of, for I have ſaid enough at this time. For <hi>vomitings</hi> I do uſe them alſo, but common ones, as thou mayeſt, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity forceth thee; yet I prefer before all others, that truly ſo called <hi>Aqua benedicta Ruland,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in his <hi>Chymia practica,</hi> and is made of <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Vitrio lana,</hi> and twice or thrice ſo much <hi>ſalt niter</hi> into a <hi>Corpus metallorum,</hi> which being exquiſitely ſweetned, is given by infuſion in unc. i. or more of white Wine as the diſeaſe requireth, The <hi>Vomitorium Conradi</hi> of <hi>Crollius</hi> is not to be deſpiſed.

no place to any medicine. Likewiſe the extract of white Helebor, given in a convenient doſe, cureth all pains in the <hi>head,</hi> ariſing from the <hi>ſtomach</hi> or lower parts. Thy ſelf mayeſt finde out more, theſe are enough for us that are in haſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BEfore we go any further, ſomething muſt be ſaid of <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> and whether it be here to be admitted or no; and if ſo, then when and in what caſes it may be uſed; And firſt it is generally to be known, That every Medicine that may be uſed in other <hi>Phyſick,</hi> may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo uſed here. Briefly then let us enquire into <hi>Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> in general, and <hi>firſt</hi> to them that contemplate the depth of Nature, and behold the uncueſt frequent cauſes of things, it may ſeem ſtrange how ſo many lettings of blood came into uſe amongſt <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> eſpecially if the opinion of them be true, both in <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>experience:</hi> for, if blood corrupted ceaſeth to be <hi>blood</hi> and degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into <hi>unnatural humours,</hi> which are to be purged, not by <hi>letting blood,</hi> but by ſweat and purgation, as the matter requireth. Or will they ſay, They do it to looſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; ſurely it is ſcarce agreeable to reaſon, That blood ſhould be the cauſe of a <hi>feaveriſh</hi> or <hi>praeternatural heat;</hi> unleſſe peradventure the <hi>ſpirits</hi> that have their ſeat in the blood, be ſtirred up by <hi>fermentation,</hi> which is ſeldome done, nor laſteth it, except <hi>choler</hi> be joyned therewith; which being purged away, the motion and heat are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently quieted and allayed: or may be cauſed ſometimes when too much blood grieveth the body, and begetteth <hi>feavers.</hi> But to that perhaps they will anſwer, That ſuch are not to be cured but by <hi>Phlebotomie;</hi> becauſe a <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian muſt follow Nature,</hi> and never ſtray from her Laws: but <hi>Nature</hi> hath ſhewed another, and moſt natural way, that doth not trouble the body like Phlebotomie, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115013:33"/>
that is <hi>nouriſhment;</hi> for while the body is nouriſhed, the blood is conſumed, if it be not repaired by <hi>aliment;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take away <hi>aliment</hi> for the time, and <hi>nature</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the blood without troubling the humours or the body; and therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſcribes to ſuch, a ſlender dyet. But if thou ſayeſt the body cannot now be nouriſhed, becauſe of the malignant humours that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the blood, thou ſayeſt nothing; for, why doeſt thou not throw them out by <hi>purgation?</hi> Thou wilt peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay, there is no <hi>concoction;</hi> yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> purgeth the turgid and ſwelling humours in <hi>feavers,</hi> which if I affirm with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> there can be no <hi>feavers</hi> at all without the fermentation of humours, which is as it were the <hi>ſoul</hi> of <hi>concoction,</hi> do not I ſpeak reaſon? for, what elſe but <hi>fermentation</hi> could brook ſuch a heat, and ſtir ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the body? <hi>Choler,</hi> if it be a humour, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow hot, but either by external heat, or <hi>fermentation:</hi> They prattle that ſpeak, that <hi>putrifaction</hi> can ſtir up heat; who ever heard ſuch trifles from ſo great men, let them tell me how <hi>putrifaction,</hi> which is a certain corruption, can cauſe heat, and let them tell me if this effect agree to all <hi>putrifaction:</hi> They dare not ſay ſo, for ſome would convince them; for it agreeth only with moiſt things, whom they putrifie, and, yet not by reaſon of <hi>putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> neither is it the <hi>adequat cauſe;</hi> for <hi>fermentation</hi> cauſeth heat: for, look how much it putrifieth, ſo much heat decreaſeth, as it is plainly ſeen in all moiſt things putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; and the reaſon is, becauſe, look how much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prevaileth, ſo much fermentation evaniſheth.</p>
               <p>But let us hear theſe mens diſtinctions of putrifaction; It is, ſay they, the corruption of the proper and naturall heat in every moiſt thing, by a ſtrange heat, by the <hi>Ancients</hi> or according to <hi>Galen,</hi> it is a change of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the body, putrifying to corruption by externall heat: The <hi>firſt</hi> ſuppoſeth that the proper heat of a thing can be diſſipated, by an external heat: but firſt let them tell me how heat, as heat, can work upon heat, if it do firſt diſſipate natural heat, before it conſume <hi>radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:115013:34"/>
for the property of heat is not to work upon heat, but upon moiſture: it drieth up; drying hinders <hi>putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi> Again, if it firſt work upon that which is moiſt, proportionably with the moiſture, it conſumeth the heat; therefore there is ſo much heat left, as the moiſture left requireth: Therefore it ſeems that external heat is not the cauſe of <hi>putrifaction.</hi> Look upon other things that putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, Doth not heat by drying hinder <hi>putrifaction?</hi> Doth not external cold ſometimes advance it? But ſurely it ought to cauſe it, if it conſiſt in the corruption of heat, and that in moiſture; for, what can deſtroy <hi>heat</hi> in a moiſt body, where there is nothing left but moiſture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept cold? Moreover, it ſeems, That <hi>putrifaction,</hi> if it cannot proceed from the <hi>corruption</hi> of proper heat: for, if this were ſo, then the more the proper heat ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the more putrifaction would prevail, and then be perfected, when the heat were driven quite away: But who ſeeth not the contrary, that putrifaction ceaſeth when heat is clean gone; do not thoſe things that have the beſt portion of this heat, laſt longeſt without putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? But that we may come to that heat that takes its original from <hi>putrifaction</hi> (as theſe men would have it) of which is all the controverſie, let any may tell me, how external heat can ſtir up a greater and more intenſe heat? How do dunghils putrify (I ſpeak after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) in the winter time, and have more heat than either the proper heat declining, or the Ambient can ſtir up; nay, they putrifie ſooner in the winter, than in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, if they be laid in great heaps. Whence is that great inflamation in feavers, not from the internal heat, ſayes <hi>Galen,</hi> but from a ſtrange adventitious heat? But whence it cometh, or what brings the heat into the putrid matter, neither he, nor any man elſe knoweth, or can tell: but from the definition it is clear, That putrifaction cannot be the cauſe of heat, becauſe it deſtroyeth heat, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced from an external heat; that which is putrid, is only the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the heat, not the cauſe: which heat is only poſſeſſed according to the intention and remiſſion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115013:34"/>
of the Introducer: neither laſteth it longer than the cauſe is preſent; and how theſe things can agree, let them look. As to <hi>Galen's definition,</hi> I wonder why he ſo unadviſedly and ridiculouſly, made the body putrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be the ſubject of putrifaction; whether in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of all putrifactions, is there a putrifying body ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily prae-required; and therefore that which is once ſound, is for ever free from putrifaction: but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall heat is by him called, the cauſe of putrifaction; and therefore it ſhall be the cauſe of heat in that which putrifieth; but putrification it ſelf cannot be called, the cauſe of heat; yet I would fain have ſome of them tell me, how moiſt things can putrifie without <hi>fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> going before? and where ſhall the putrifaction of humors at length ſtay it ſelf but in corruption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is truly putrified, is not the ſame which it was before putrifaction be finiſhed, but is changed into another thing of inferiour order; becauſe of the heat that is gone: Choler putrified, is not now Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but another thing colder than it; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cauſe a <hi>Tertian feaver,</hi> which dependeth of Choler, as appears by the <hi>excrements:</hi> Beſides, <hi>putrifaction</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with ſtinking: (by ſtink I do not underſtand that Odour which is unpleaſant to us, but that which agrees not with things in their proper ſtate) but who ever ſaw ſtinking <hi>choler</hi> voided in feavers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were mixt with ſome things that did truly putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; whereas the Excrements of the belly, though they had an odious ſmell before, yet being putrified, they have a moſt pleaſant odour, as experience ſheweth. Therefore the putrifaction of humors is not the cauſe of Feavers, but Fermentation: which being the height of concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth alwayes (other things requiſite being preſent) unite to purgation in ſummer. I would ask thoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious Maſters one thing, What concoction they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in a putrid humor? can Nature bring back a thing from corruption? can it ever be in a better ſtate than now it is if it be putrified? It is Nature's duty to perfect
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115013:35"/>
the work begun: unleſſe her Intention be led aſide, or be hindered. The truth is, thoſe men are too ſubtill to ſee the ſimplicity of Nature; but, how if all the ſtrife be onely about the name? how if <hi>fermentation</hi> be by them called <hi>putrifaction?</hi> I will not ſtand upon this, ſo be they confeſs that <hi>concoction</hi> in <hi>feavers</hi> needs not to be expected; and that by a timely <hi>purgation</hi> they provide for the life of the Patient; which is often loſt by needleſſe letting blood.</p>
               <p>But of Feavers we ſhall ſpeak more in our <hi>Practice;</hi> now therefore let us return to <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> from which we degreſſed, Againſt which ſome do further urge, that conſidering the whole latitude of <hi>Nature,</hi> they finde no <hi>medicine</hi> that draws blood: But if Blood-letting had been neceſſary, <hi>provident Nature</hi> would have provided ſome <hi>medicine</hi> to that purpoſe, who rather labours to keep that <hi>Cataract of life</hi> within the body; Moreover they ask, how any dare be ſo bold as to draw blood from a <hi>Cacochymick</hi> body, ſeeing themſelves (and that truly) ſay, that blood is the bridle of the humors. They will ſay, that <hi>Nature</hi> being disburdened, will the readier ariſe up againſt the humors: but fooliſhly; for, if one ſhould take away a Souldiers weapons, and then bid him ſet upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, promiſing himſelf by this means the victory, would you not think him mad? How much leſſe is he who robbing <hi>Nature</hi> of her Arms, bids her make head againſt the Enemy; yea, but many have mended by letting blood; I deny it not, but neither was then blood-letting the cauſe of the recovery: but <hi>natural heat, or the vital heat</hi> ſtirred up by motion, ſet upon, and conquer'd the diſeaſes; which heat by another <hi>motion,</hi> had been better ſtirred up, eſpecially by Purgation at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whileſt there was ſtrength; by which means there is not onely endured a motion exciting the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the cauſe of the diſeaſe being partly taken away, the Patient is much relieved. Thus you ſee the boldneſſe and madneſſe of them that are ſo forward upon every occaſion, time and age, to let them blood; whereupon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115013:35"/>
how many dangers follow, I appeal to experience. This is the true cauſe why Feavers are ſo ſeldome cured. I would ſuch Phyſicians would one day repent, and take Nature for their guide.</p>
               <p>But is <hi>Phlebotomie</hi> wholly to be condemned? Is it in ſome caſes lawfull for a <hi>Phyſician</hi> that followes <hi>Nature,</hi> ſeeing that ſhe in ſome caſes, as by <hi>bleeding</hi> at the Noſe, avoiding evil blood that is troubleſome. So it is at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and upon ſome occaſion needfull: but theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions muſt be obſerved, which are by experience fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that it be never done but in a <hi>ſanguine body,</hi> not too much filled with preter-naturall humors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it be done whileſt the <hi>ſtrength</hi> is conſtant; under which conditions are comprehended the <hi>age, ſex,</hi> and <hi>times</hi> of the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> and of the <hi>year,</hi> which when they weaken, forbid it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> is never to be done ſucceſſively <hi>(viz.)</hi> two dayes together; let <hi>Avicen</hi> ſay what he will: for, a double commotion is too great, and doth too violently, eſpecially in <hi>feavers,</hi> trouble <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In particular Irruptions, either in their making, or already made you may do it more freely.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If <hi>diverſion</hi> of the diſeaſe require it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If <hi>Feavers,</hi> when <hi>Nature</hi> ſhewes the way by blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the Noſe, or other paſſages: Provided, that ſhe do not evacuate enough of her own accord.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If the <hi>natural flux</hi> of women be ſtopped, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, untill <hi>nature</hi> can by fit medicines, be brought to her wonted courſe, for the avoiding of <hi>diſeaſes:</hi> but there muſt be great care taken to open the <hi>paſſages;</hi> for, <hi>nature</hi> knowes how better to govern her ſelf than we do. And in theſe caſes, and with theſe conditions, it is permitted: But except in a Caſe where a particular Irruption ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, as ſometimes in a <hi>Pluriſie,</hi> and in a <hi>Squinancy,</hi> I would alwayes prefer Faſting before <hi>Phlebotomie:</hi> yet before this if the <hi>Indication</hi> command, I would free the body from the humors: for ſo <hi>Nature</hi> would <hi>naturally</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:115013:36"/>
be eaſed, I would have the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> the <hi>miniſters of Nature,</hi> to follow <hi>Nature</hi> every-where, plain and ſimple, and leave their ſtrife and contentions; What have we, (that ſhould follow ſimple Nature) to do with Sects? that one ſhould ſwear himſelf a ſlave to <hi>Galen,</hi> another to <hi>Avicen,</hi> another to <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> theſe were great men, but when theſe gave themſelves to contentious diſputes to defend their own opinions, they much erred many times from the truth.

The Doſe is from gr. iiij. to ſcr. Sſ. The ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be given of the <hi>natural white Balſome of Peru:</hi> of which <hi>Monardus</hi> hath diſcourſed at large, whom thou mayeſt ſafely follow. The not vulgar preparation of <hi>Coral</hi> and <hi>Pearls,</hi> we will give hereafter; for the preſent take ſome Compounds, and the firſt ſhall be a <hi>Diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> called commonly by the Inventers name, <hi>Gaſcones powder;</hi> which ſecret he ſold to the <hi>Biſhop of Worceſter</hi> for 300 lib. I give it thee freely: Take the <hi>black toes</hi> of <hi>Sea-Crabbs</hi> boyled, beat them to powder, which muſt be done, <hi>Venus</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Luna,</hi> being in <hi>Cancer:</hi> of this powder take, for example, unc. j. <hi>Mageſtery of Coral and Pearls</hi> a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a unc. ij. of the true <hi>Bezoar,</hi> unc. j. make rolls of the <hi>gelly of Viper skins,</hi> or, if thou wilt, of the fleſh of the whole <hi>Viper,</hi> which is good; and being dryed, let them be made up again, and dryed with the ſame gelly, and the oftner they be repeated, the better it will be. The uſe of it is, to beat it into powder, and give of it from ſcrup. j. to ſ. ij. in almoſt any <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> repeating it often againſt <hi>poyſon.</hi> But if thou hadſt learned to <hi>calcine</hi> the <hi>Crabbs claws, Corral, Pearl</hi> and <hi>Beozar,</hi> with the fire of <hi>Nature,</hi> it would be an admirable <hi>Alexiterion</hi> indeed, and more precious than all Gold preparations.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Compound ſhall be our moſt precious <hi>Diarhodon:</hi> Take of <hi>pale Roſe-leaves</hi> as much as thou wilt, bruiſe them well in a Morter till they be an <hi>Maſſe;</hi> to every ounce whereof put of the extract of <hi>Cinamon,</hi> made with <hi>Roſe-water,</hi> of the Extract of <hi>Cloves</hi> and <hi>Mace,</hi> made by the ſame <hi>Waters</hi> a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a unc. 1. of the extract of <hi>Musk</hi> and <hi>Amber</hi> made together, ſee that the <hi>Amber</hi> be three times as much as the <hi>Musk</hi> ſcrup. ij. this extract is made by means of a very ſtrong <hi>spirit of Wine,</hi> drawn off in a gentle bath to the conſiſtance of the oyl of <hi>Salt;</hi> of <hi>Corral</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>a ſcrup. iiij. <hi>Aquae magnanimitatis</hi> drach.

                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> hath a great <hi>Confortative,</hi> good againſt moſt <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> it is found deſcribed by <hi>Crollius,</hi> with a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>virtue</hi> of it. The preparation of Queen <hi>Elizabeths rectified Amber</hi> is this: Take the beſt <hi>Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeſe</hi> drach. viij. choſen <hi>Musk</hi> that is not ſophiſticated, drach. j. of white <hi>Sugar</hi> drach. S S. pulverize them according to Art, imbibe them with the <hi>burning ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Roſes,</hi> and beat them well together till they be brought into a reaſonable ſoft paſte, put them into a veſſell well ſhut, ſet to digeſt in the Sun till it be dry, then imbibe it as before, and again dry it; the oftner this <hi>proceſſe</hi> be repeated, the better and ſtronger will the Medicine be: The Doſe is the quantity of a great Peaſe, in diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Satyrion impregnate</hi> with its own ſalt.

The <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Soot</hi> is of great force, as no man will deny that hath once uſed it prepared: The manner of working it is extant in <hi>Hartman,</hi> where he ſpeaks of <hi>Confortatives</hi> in his <hi>Chymica practica,</hi> about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Though the power of theſe things be not ſo great, as that they deſerve the title of an <hi>univerſall medicine,</hi> yet experience ſhewes, that the powerof them is great, and that they are alwayes uſed with good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>But we, that we may inrich this <hi>new Art,</hi> with the addition of an invaluable treaſure, will teach the true calcination or diſſolution of Herbs, Stones, Minerals,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115013:38"/>
and Mettals; whereby every thing may, according to his <hi>nature,</hi> become an <hi>univerſal medicine,</hi> and being <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted,</hi> work according to his <hi>ſubject;</hi> ſo that no man ſhall deny them equal to the true <hi>Aurum potabile;</hi> which, as ſhall appear, ſprung from the ſaid root. Here the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt know, our words are not to be interpreted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes than out of the book of genuine <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and we are not of the number of common men, how great ſoever, nor like <hi>Quercetan,</hi> though otherwiſe a great Scholer, who, ſpeaking of <hi>Therica</hi> in <hi>Pharmacopaea dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica reſtituta,</hi> calleth the <hi>ſpirit of Wine</hi> the <hi>fire of Nature;</hi> and the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>ſalt</hi> and <hi>ſulphur of Nature;</hi> as if <hi>Nature</hi> did uſe the <hi>ſpirit of Wine</hi> to the generation of all things, &amp; play the <hi>Chymick</hi> in the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>earth.</hi> I do not deny but the whole <hi>earth,</hi> and principally the <hi>ſalt</hi> is the receiver of the <hi>ſulphur</hi> and <hi>mercury</hi> of Nature, yet hath it no more than is ſufficient for it ſelf, and as ſoon as it hath it, immediately giveth it to others: We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the <hi>ſalt</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>wine,</hi> or any other ſalts or ſpirits whatſoever vulgarly known; it is far another matter, which the blind, who are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by multitude of operations, cannot ſee: but how the <hi>Calcination</hi> worketh miracles, harken, I will tell thee; When I laboured about the <hi>calcination of Corrals</hi> in naked fire, in a ſtrong one, continuing four dayes and nights, I could by no means get it to be red, I gave it to the <hi>Glaſs-makers</hi> to keep it ſome dayes in their fire, but when I had tried that four dayes more, I found it only a little <hi>yellowiſh</hi> on the outſide, having in taſte a little ſaltiſh ſweetneſſe; while I was troubled at this, comes to me a moſt learned and noble Gentleman: when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him of my Corral, he told me that in eight hours ſpace he had calcined Corral into a rediſh colour, with putting the ſpirit of Wine to it, it yeelded a <hi>yellow tincture;</hi> whereas mine would yeeld no tincture at all: which when I heard, I told him the ſecret was better than <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> as being ſo quickly diſpatched; whereas the other required ſo long time: from thence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115013:38"/>
forwards we gave our ſelves to <hi>natural Calcination,</hi> trying the ſeveral <hi>families</hi> of things, and learned to <hi>multiply</hi> the fire by <hi>Art;</hi> whereas before we had only known (and that not long) the calcination of <hi>natural Gold:</hi> ſo by trying all things, <hi>experience</hi> taught us one thing after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: therefore work wonders if you know Nature, I mean naked, as I have often to my great content ſeen her; yet I dare not be ſo Irreligious towards her, as to expoſe her to the view of the ignorant and unworthy, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence never to be expiated: but to the <hi>Judicious</hi> and lovers of Truth I will ſhew a <hi>ſpectacle,</hi> that ſhall not like <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> change Men into <hi>Harts,</hi> but into <hi>Angels.</hi> Two things I muſt only ſuppoſe as fore-known, namely the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> fire of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>water</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> which yet to the punctual followers of <hi>Nature,</hi> will ſhew themſelves out of the context. Then to underſtand the <hi>natural abreviated Calcination,</hi> two things, or inſtruments, are neceſſary for thee, if thou wilt gain time; the firſt is a great pair of <hi>bellows:</hi> if thou knoweſt the <hi>fire,</hi> thou canſt not (except thou be very dull) be ignorant of the <hi>bellows,</hi> by which thou mayeſt extreamly increaſe the <hi>fire:</hi> The ſecond is a Collateral veſſel made of the <hi>Oſbeſtos:</hi> if you know not this, you may in many things work without it: but in the <hi>ſecond preparation</hi> of <hi>ſalts</hi> of <hi>Herbs,</hi> by which the <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of them appears in a glaſſe, thou canſt not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; as alſo in the whole preparation of Plants, and in the <hi>calcination</hi> of Gold thou muſt uſe it, if ever thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee a good end. Now we come to the practice, beginning with <hi>Plants;</hi> and becauſe they are <hi>all</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after one manner, we will be content with one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Thus thou ſhalt then make a truly noble <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortative of Roſes:</hi> Take <hi>Roſes</hi> gathered in their bloſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming time, bruiſed, or not bruiſed, it makes no matter; put them into a <hi>Collateral veſſel</hi> that is <hi>hermetically</hi> ſhut with a knot, firſt have them three moneths in a digeſting fire, with <hi>bellows</hi> thou mayeſt ſhorten the time, but take heed that thou ſpoil not the callitore veſſel with too much fire; after the third moneth bury it in the belly of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115013:39"/>
a great Horſe for ſix moneths ſpace; afterwards put it again into the fire till the groſſe and impure be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the pure; then haſt thou a royal Cordial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whoſe vertue yet thou mayeſt, if thou pleaſeſt, thus augment: Take a great quantity of Roſes <hi>dry</hi> at our <hi>fire,</hi> at length increaſe the <hi>fire</hi> with thy bellows, until they be burned to moſt white aſhes; then with ſimple <hi>water</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the <hi>ſalt,</hi> vapour the water away, and put the <hi>ſalt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Collitore veſſel,</hi> whoſe mouth muſt be well ſtopped with a knot, there let it be three moneths; then, as thou didſt the Roſes themſelves, bury it in a dunghill for ſix moneths; then take it out, put it again in the <hi>fire,</hi> till the <hi>ſpecies</hi> begin to appear in the glaſſe, then take it from the fire, and mix a ſufficient quantity of this with the true <hi>cliſmes</hi> of Roſes, ſo ſhalt thou have a more mighty Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial than before, exceeding good in all hot diſeaſes and reſtoring the radical moiſture. And by this means thou mayeſt make the true <hi>Cliſſus</hi> of all <hi>Herbs,</hi> according to the true doctrine of the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus:</hi> each ſhall work according to the intention of the <hi>Herb,</hi> from whence it is taken: though the vertue be from the <hi>fire of Nature,</hi> and freedom from their <hi>foeces,</hi> wonderfully mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and inabled: nor are they clenſed from their <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal impurity</hi> by any water, but by fire. But come we now to <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>middle-minerals,</hi> and becauſe they are all done after one manner, let us take Coral for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>Take therefore as much <hi>Coral</hi> as thou pleaſeſt, ſprinkle it upon a <hi>calcinatory veſſel,</hi> to the thickneſſe of a ſtraw; put it to <hi>our fire,</hi> ſtir it up with thy <hi>bellows</hi> as thou canſt, and ſo multiply the <hi>fire</hi> till thou ſee the colour changed: but ſee the <hi>ſurface</hi> equal, the <hi>Calcination</hi> will be ſoon done, that thou wilt wonder, and therefore I would adviſe thee to do it three or four times, untill it let go its <hi>tincture</hi> into the <hi>Wine,</hi> which when it hath given, if it can give no more, repeat the <hi>Calcination</hi> before, and with a <hi>new spirit</hi> draw out the <hi>tincture,</hi> or with the ſame, till it be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>red,</hi> then mix all the <hi>ſpirit of Wine</hi> wherewith thou
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115013:39"/>
haſt drawn out the <hi>tincture</hi> together, and draw it off to the conſiſtance of <hi>Oyl.</hi> So muſt thou draw the tincture of all <hi>Stones, middle-Minerals</hi> and <hi>Salts,</hi> infinititly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſtrength; ſo that <hi>Pearls</hi> thus calcined, will truly cure <hi>Hecticks.</hi> Now let us proceed to <hi>Mettals,</hi> and for an example let us propound, with envie that much talk't of it, <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and to them that do underſtand, clearly, though briefly: Put your <hi>foliated Gold</hi> into the <hi>calatory veſſel,</hi> the mouth well ſhut with our knot, put it to the <hi>fire</hi> till it be calcined into aſhes, and then ſublimed into whiteneſſe, leaving the black <hi>terra damnata</hi> in the bottom; then let that which is ſublimed be with the ſame degree of fire united to the <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> that it may be revived by it, that ſo they may be all brought into an <hi>Unguent,</hi> which is called the Oyl of Gold: the Doſe is gr. ij. or iij. Out of this Oyl or <hi>Mercury of Gold,</hi> thou mayeſt extract a high <hi>redneſs</hi> by the <hi>ſpirit of Wine,</hi> which contains the perfect cure of all <hi>diſeaſes curable:</hi> the true <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> if thou attempt by any other means, thou wilt never bring thy purpoſe to paſſe; and when thou ſhalt ſee by this means, that thou canſt make any other <hi>mettal potable,</hi> thou wilt laugh at the vain devices of others, and confeſſe that I have told the truth: I have ſpoken (I aſſure thee) more plainly than ever any man did, and if thou underſtand not what hath been ſaid, thou art utterly ignorant of Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtudy her better: and if thy intent be pure, to ſee in theſe things the wonderful, ſtrange, and praiſe-worthy works of thy Creator, God bleſſe and proſper thee: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I beſeech Him keep thee far from the underſtanding of my words. Concerning <hi>Laudanum</hi> there is no great need to ſay any thing; many forms of it are every where extant: in <hi>Hartman</hi> there is an expreſſe deſcription of <hi>Laudanum opiate.</hi> A learned Phyſician can vary the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of things according to his own intent, and the nature of the <hi>diſeaſe:</hi> ſo all things be <hi>magnetically</hi> done: But he that knows how to <hi>calcine</hi> the things to be calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>fire of nature,</hi> may doubtleſs do ſtrange things.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115013:40"/>
Wherefore haſting to other things, we leave this to the judgment of the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> meaning one day to ſpeak more hereof, if God ſhall ſo pleaſe.</p>

Theſe that help by any <hi>known quality,</hi> are not ſo much worth as to be taken into this <hi>Art;</hi> for the <hi>matter</hi> of our <hi>medicine,</hi> unleſſe it be when they have a <hi>ſagacity</hi> (mark well what I ſaid, for theſe things ought to be precious to thee) for then if any <hi>external quality</hi> hurt the <hi>body</hi> or the <hi>ſpirit</hi> moſt violently, thou muſt uſe theſe <hi>ſagacious</hi> plants, endued with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>quality</hi> which have more <hi>spirit.</hi>

which have ſome property contrary to them, ſo the <hi>Salix</hi> or <hi>Willow</hi> is ſigned to a <hi>dry bectick:</hi> for it hath the power to grow apace, and though torn or cut from the <hi>Trunk,</hi> if it be but pricked into the <hi>Earth</hi> it dieth not, but growes preſently into a Tree, and getteth roots of its own.

                  <hi>Note</hi> alſo, That not alwayes the ſame veſſels are to be uſed, but ſometimes <hi>glaſſes,</hi> ſometimes ſome things taken from <hi>living creatures;</hi> as for example: If thou wouldeſt <hi>digeſt ones excrement</hi> to ſtay a <hi>flux,</hi> an <hi>earthen veſſel:</hi> if thou wouldeſt ſtay <hi>vomiting,</hi> the <hi>ſtomach</hi> of a <hi>Swine</hi> is the beſt; and ſo of the reſt: but when thou intendeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation in all putrifactions, to this purpoſe glaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels are beſt; though I would uſe an egg in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as in <hi>digeſting blood</hi> by it ſelf, or mixed with <hi>ſweat, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you ſeek the time of <hi>application</hi> generally, take it thus; All <hi>application</hi> of theſe remedies, be it <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation,</hi> or ſimple application of things convenient, ought to be done, the Moon being in a <hi>ſign</hi> conveniently <hi>fortunate,</hi> if it may be in the <hi>tenth houſe,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> of the Plant of the <hi>medicine</hi> exalted above the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>diſeaſe:</hi> But of theſe we will give precepts in every like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſie. And this by the way; Though all things do not agree exactly, yet do not thou forſake or procraſtinate
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115013:42"/>
the cure, fit thoſe things that thou canſt fit, as if when the reſt agreed, thou wouldeſt begin a-new; for, if there be a due <hi>application</hi> of things, although the <hi>ſtars</hi> do not ſo exactly accord, the cure may be prolonged, but the effect will not be altogether fruſtrate, if thou learn well to obſerve the times to come; this thou ſhalt do, if the time be obſerved in the progreſſe of the cure: then do as it were ſet upon the Diſeaſe a-freſh, applying new Inſtruments of health; A thing well to be <hi>noted;</hi> for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is the wiſedome of a Phyſician moſt required.</p>

               <p>THere are many means whereby this <hi>Art</hi> applyeth <hi>medicines</hi> to the <hi>vital ſpirits:</hi> but for <hi>methods</hi> ſake we will contract them into two in generall: the <hi>one</hi> we will call <hi>transplantation;</hi> the other naked <hi>application. Tranſplantation is, when by means of a Magnetick, we put the Diſeaſe into a plant, or another living creature, the Patient being fully and wholly cured;</hi> for, when the <hi>Plant,</hi> or the <hi>Wight</hi> hath drawn to its ſelf the ill <hi>complexion</hi> (troubling the <hi>vital spirit)</hi> the <hi>spirit</hi> is thereby freed, and made able and fit to exerciſe its due function; but the <hi>Wight</hi> into which the Diſeaſe is <hi>transplanted,</hi> languiſheth, and at length (unleſſe it be cured) dieth. Yet this caution is to be obſerved, that we ſtrive not in vain to <hi>tranſplant</hi> the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> into another <hi>Wight,</hi> which hath too ſtrong a <hi>ſpirit;</hi> for, the <hi>vital ſpirits,</hi> being ſometime very ſtrong, reſiſt vehemently, and then all this <hi>preparation</hi> availeth nothing. But into <hi>plants</hi> never ſtrive for to <hi>tranſplant</hi> the Diſeaſe, unleſſe it be in ſome <hi>property,</hi> contrary to the Diſeaſe, eſpecially take heed leſt it have a <hi>quality</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of man, or leſt by its too much <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> after it hath attracted the Diſeaſe and evill <hi>quality,</hi> and as it were <hi>digeſted</hi> it, it attract more than it ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115013:42"/>
do; for, by <hi>tranſplantation,</hi> not onely the <hi>evill,</hi> but the <hi>good</hi> is ſometimes attracted and communicated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Hence it is, that they which <hi>tranſplant hair</hi> into a <hi>Willow,</hi> to make it grow, and leave it there longer than they ſhould do, do make the head <hi>weak,</hi> and the <hi>ſight dim;</hi> for, the <hi>willow</hi> draweth the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the head too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently: from hence it comes, that by <hi>tranſplantation,</hi> a man may get himſelf the ſtrength of a <hi>Horſe</hi> or a <hi>Bull,</hi> if it be rightly done. This <hi>tranſplantation</hi> is <hi>twofold (viz.) immediate</hi> and <hi>mediate; Immediate</hi> is, that which is done to any living Creatures by <hi>mummiall</hi> things; for, ſo the thing, whereunto it is applyed, appropriates unto it ſelf, and draws to its own nature, the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evill</hi> quality of the <hi>Mummey;</hi> and either frees the <hi>ſpirit</hi> from ſuch a <hi>quality,</hi> if it be <hi>evill;</hi> or appropriates to its ſelf the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> if it be hurt by no ill <hi>quality,</hi> and <hi>fortifies</hi> it ſelf by this <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> by means whereof, it can bring in the <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> into the thing, whereunto it is applyed, and that things, by means of theſe <hi>qualities,</hi> unites the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> unto it, and by <hi>that,</hi> and in the virtue of it can work many things. And leſt thou be deceived by the word we call <hi>Mummey,</hi> It ſignifieth thoſe things or parts of Wights which exhibit the <hi>ſpirit</hi> nakedly, as thou mayſt learn out of the Firſt Chapter. <hi>Mediate tranſplantation,</hi> is that which is done by mediate means; as if any <hi>quality</hi> being <hi>tranſplanted</hi> into an <hi>Herb,</hi> will be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the <hi>Animal</hi> to whom it is given, and by this means wonders may be done; take thou heed thou do not evill here. <hi>Note,</hi> that <hi>due putrifaction</hi> doth excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepare the aforeſaid <hi>Mummy,</hi> that any <hi>quality</hi> may be introduced into an <hi>Animal;</hi> but it is found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>blood</hi> doth beſt admit of ſuch <hi>putrifaction.</hi> Now, let us come to the other <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> which we called <hi>Application,</hi> which we muſt know is nothing elſe, <hi>than the application of thoſe things to the Mummy, which can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther correct the evill quality, or can draw the vitall ſpirit out of it;</hi> by which laſt means alſo, <hi>mediate application</hi> is done, as in ſome <hi>Amatories</hi> it is very manifeſt. In this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115013:43"/>
                  <hi>application,</hi> theſe things are further to be noted, <hi>firſt,</hi> That nothing endued with any <hi>venemous quality,</hi> be applyed to the <hi>Mummy,</hi> being hurt by that means, for it eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicates his hurt to the whole. But if you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the former Doctrine, concerning <hi>ſignatures,</hi> thou ſhalt not eaſily erre from the mark. <hi>Moreover,</hi> take heed that by <hi>evill diet</hi> in the time of <hi>application</hi> thou overthrow not the whole buſineſſe, which is alſo religiouſly to be obſerved in <hi>tranſplantation.</hi> And of theſe things here is enough ſaid at this time.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of</hi> tranſplantation, <hi>and the diverſe manners by which it is done.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the former Chapter, we have ſaid what we meant by <hi>tranſplantation;</hi> now it followes, how many wayes it may be done. There be Six manner of <hi>tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, viz. Inſemination, Implantation, Impoſition, Irrora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ineſcation,</hi> and <hi>Appromination.</hi> We will ſpeak in order of them all. <hi>Inſemination is, when a Magnet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with Mummey is mingled with fat earth, wherein the ſeed of herbs agreeing with that diſeaſe, are ſown;</hi> for, the <hi>earth</hi> being ſifted, and mixed with <hi>Mummey,</hi> is put into an <hi>earthen pot,</hi> and the <hi>ſeeds</hi> are ſown therein, and watered with the waſhing of the <hi>diſeaſed member,</hi> or of the whole body, if it be affected, ſo in time, all the Diſeaſes, are tranſplanted into thoſe <hi>ſeeds proper</hi> to the Diſeaſe: if the time require it, they are watered every day with the waſhings of the part, as is aforeſaid: This done, expect till the herbs begin to ſprout, and when it is time, tranſplant them into the like earth, and ſo thou ſhalt ſee, that as the <hi>Herbs</hi> increaſe the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> will wear away, and at length be cured. There be, that when the <hi>Herbs</hi> be ripe, pull them up, and dry them in the <hi>ſmoak,</hi> or throws them into a <hi>running water,</hi> or uſe them ſome other way, as beſt agreeing with experience. And
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115013:43"/>
if the <hi>Mummey</hi> wherewith the <hi>Magnet</hi> is impregnate, be not diſeaſed, then the <hi>Plant</hi> will be impregnate with the <hi>vital spirit</hi> of him whoſe <hi>Mummey</hi> it was; wherewith thou mayeſt do ſtrange things. So then, underſtand well what I have ſaid: But chuſe you <hi>Herbs</hi> fit for the purpoſe, and be not deceived, <hi>for every thing is not good for every thing:</hi> but they diſpenſe their <hi>spirits</hi> every thing according to its proper gifts; for otherwayes worketh the <hi>ſpirit</hi> joyned to <hi>Vervine,</hi> and otherwayes to <hi>Carduus</hi> or <hi>Angelica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Implantation</hi> is almoſt done as <hi>Inſemination</hi> is, but here the herbs are to be taken with their <hi>roots</hi> alone, and implanted in the like earth, as is ſaid; ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and ſo ordered and watered; nay, in this caſe it is beſt, if the <hi>herbs</hi> have no other <hi>water</hi> at all; for ſo they will be as it were conſtrained to receive and appropriate the <hi>Mummey</hi> with the greater violence, which is alſo good in <hi>ſemination,</hi> except the too much tenderneſſe, and looſe ſoftneſſe of the <hi>ſeed</hi> command the contrary, which here you need not fear; but in all things take experience to thy help. <hi>One</hi> thing is to be <hi>noted</hi> in them both, that if the <hi>Plant</hi> die, having attracted ſome ill quality before the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> be fully cured, then another of the ſame kind muſt be <hi>implanted</hi> in the ſame, or rather the like <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Impoſition</hi> muſt be thus done; Take the <hi>Mummey</hi> of the diſeaſed <hi>members,</hi> or the Excrements, or both, (take as many as thou canſt get) put them into a <hi>Tree</hi> or an <hi>Herb,</hi> between the <hi>bark</hi> and the <hi>wood;</hi> or elſe put them into a <hi>hole,</hi> ſtop it with a <hi>pin</hi> made of the ſame <hi>wood,</hi> and put upon it <hi>clammy earth:</hi> if thou put the <hi>Mummey,</hi> or the <hi>Excrements,</hi> between the <hi>bark</hi> and the <hi>wood,</hi> cover the <hi>Wound</hi> with the <hi>bark</hi> again, and with Earth, as they do in <hi>Inoculation,</hi> and leave the <hi>Mummey</hi> there, and if thou work well, thou wilt quickly ſee the effect. Yet thou muſt know, that ſome <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cured by <hi>Inſemination,</hi> and ſome by <hi>Impoſition;</hi> namely, the <hi>fixed</hi> by this, and the <hi>volatile</hi> by that: but
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115013:44"/>
if I might perſwade thee, thou ſhouldeſt in every <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> do all things; for, <hi>Nature</hi> is not burdened with theſe, and conſider what ſhall be ſaid in the practice: for there we are reſolved to ſet down nothing, but what we have proved. Moreover, ſome there are, that to very good purpoſe have uſed <hi>Impoſition.</hi> There is to be <hi>noted,</hi> that where thou deſireſt a <hi>lasting effect,</hi> you uſe <hi>long-lived Trees;</hi> and where a ſpeedy effect, them that grow apace. Remember the Caution given in the laſt Chapter, <hi>As ſoon as thou haſt thy will, take out all that thou didſt put in,</hi> leſt too much attraction of the ſpirit, do hurt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Irroration</hi> muſt be done, that by it, tranſplantation might be perfected. Thou ſhalt water convenient herbs, or a Tree (and that every day till the Diſeaſe be cured) <hi>with Urine, Sweat, Dung,</hi> or the <hi>waſhings</hi> of the <hi>members,</hi> or of the whole body (as the Diſeaſe requireth) either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, or all mixed together: though no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but the mixture is better: But this way I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe as one help to the other, than alone: howſoever thou do, yet this alwayes obſerve, That as ſoon as Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roration is done, thou cover all the Irrorated <hi>Earth</hi> with new <hi>Earth,</hi> leſt the <hi>Air</hi> diſſipate the <hi>mummiall virtue</hi> in the things, before the Plants can draw it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Ineſcation</hi> is, when the <hi>Mummie</hi> is given to a <hi>Wight</hi> for food; for, then the <hi>vitall heat</hi> of the <hi>Wight</hi> unites the <hi>Mummie</hi> to its ſelf: And the onely <hi>quality</hi> by which the <hi>spirit</hi> was diſeaſed, and ſo reſtores to health the <hi>body</hi> whence the <hi>Mummie</hi> was taken; the <hi>vitall spirit</hi> of the Patient being by this means cleanſed by the operation of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the beaſt: but this eſpecially is here to be <hi>noted,</hi> that as ſoon as the beaſt is fully and wholly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> it be then killed, leſt it do again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to hurt that body from whence the <hi>Mummie</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; afterwards if the body be not throughly cured, when that beaſt is infected and killed; give another beaſt a portion of the like <hi>Mummie,</hi> and reiterate the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration untill the Patient be whole, and in this caſe, blood
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115013:44"/>
rightly <hi>putrified,</hi> or to ſpeak more truly, <hi>fermented,</hi> is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be uſed; and yet there is no doubt, but the ſame cures may be done with the <hi>Mummie</hi> extracted by the <hi>Magnet.</hi> There are likewayes ſome, that with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe do give the <hi>blood</hi> yet <hi>warm</hi> from the <hi>vein,</hi> to a <hi>Dog</hi> or a <hi>Swine,</hi> which though peradventure they be not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Diſeaſe, (for the ſpirit is here too faſt fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered) yet experience confirms, that it much furthers the Cure. By this operation <hi>natural Philters</hi> are done, though we finde by proof, that love may be procured by more applications: but although <hi>natural Philters</hi> may to good men work good effects; yet here I will ſay no more, becauſe of thoſe wicked men, that uſe to pervert the beſt things to the worſt uſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, By <hi>Approximation, Tranſplantation</hi> is done, if to the <hi>ſick body</hi> theſe things be applyed, which can attract the <hi>vital ſpirit,</hi> and the <hi>Active beams,</hi> and having attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, <hi>unite them to themſelves,</hi> and correct them: And this is done either by <hi>application of Plants,</hi> and their parts, or of beaſts: as if you would lay <hi>Cucumbers</hi> by an <hi>Infant</hi> that hath a <hi>feaver,</hi> when he is aſleep; the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers</hi> will wither, and the Child be cured. Some lay young <hi>whelps</hi> to the <hi>feet</hi> of young Children in their Cradles, and ſo are often recovered. After the ſame ſort <hi>Doves</hi> cloven in the midſt, and applyed hot to the <hi>ſoals</hi> of the <hi>feet,</hi> do by attraction, rectifie the praeternaturall heat, diffuſed through all the body, and remove all pains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the ſame manner applyed to the ſeveral parts: So the Arſe of a <hi>Hen</hi> plucked bare, and applyed to the biting of a <hi>viper,</hi> freeth the body from venome, and the Hen ſwells, and if not cured, dies ſooner than if ſhe had been ſtruck with the <hi>viper.</hi> All which things can be done by no other means, but by Magnetiſme.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we ſee that ſome Diſeaſes infect by <hi>Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximation:</hi> for, the <hi>ſpirit</hi> inſinuating it ſelf into the body, communicates an evill diſpoſition to his brother<hi>-ſpirits;</hi> and who ſees not, that <hi>Love</hi> alſo is begotten by <hi>Approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> eſpecially between them who by ſweat commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115013:45"/>
their ſpirits, and being in the ſame bed, by a long <hi>Circulation</hi> as it were of ſpirits, lead almoſt the ſame life: but that this doth not alwayes happen, is long of the reaſonable <hi>ſoul,</hi> which commands the <hi>affections,</hi> as ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them, yet doth not this overthrow the <hi>Art;</hi> for, <hi>Nature</hi> cannot force the <hi>Will,</hi> being moſt free.</p>
               <p>Now I fore-ſee an <hi>Objection</hi> of ſome moment: For, it will be ſaid, If <hi>diſeaſes</hi> may be thus cured by <hi>approxima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> how happeneth it, that he who gives the <hi>infection</hi> to another, is not cured himſelf? To which I anſwer; It is <hi>firſt</hi> to be conſidered what, and what manner of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi> thoſe be that be moſt communicated to men by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:</hi> Neither would I here ſay, that every Diſeaſe may by <hi>approximation</hi> be communicated unto every <hi>beaſt.</hi> I would but ſearch here, what Diſeaſe of themſelves, and by their own nature are fitteſt for it, and commonly ſo called. Such Diſeaſes are of three <hi>kindes:</hi> The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a <hi>ſupernatural heat</hi> not venemous, which when it can quickly and ſuddenly inſinuate it ſelf into bodies, in the leaſt ſpace of time, it alters the body, and gives it an evill <hi>complexion:</hi> (Theſe properties are here aſcribed to heat, in reſpect of the <hi>ſubject</hi> in which it lyes hid) but this carrying the heat of the <hi>vitall ſpirit,</hi> becauſe of the ſudden <hi>alteration,</hi> is not ſtrongly freed, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter. The ſecond <hi>kinde</hi> indeed conſiſts in <hi>preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat,</hi> but are ſuch as lye hid in ſubtill venemous breaths, and more vehemently infect, as we ſee in the <hi>Plague.</hi> The third <hi>kinde</hi> doth not conſiſt in a meer <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> nor in the meer <hi>fluctuating humors,</hi> nor lurketh in any <hi>particular part,</hi> but it changeth all the habit of the body, ſubverts all the <hi>operations,</hi> or at leaſt diſpoſeth them otherwayes than man's <hi>nature</hi> requireth: And this kind doth therefore <hi>infect,</hi> becauſe it ſends forth a <hi>habitous,</hi> or breathing altogether infected, and in no part ſound, which inſinuating themſelves into another body, do at length overthrow the temperature thereof: Of this ſort are the <hi>Leproſies,</hi> and the <hi>French Pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, having laid the <hi>grounds,</hi> I ſay, that in the <hi>two firſt</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:115013:45"/>
                  <hi>kindes,</hi> why the body, infecting another, is not thereby releaſed, is, becauſe the <hi>infection</hi> ſuddenly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, doth in an inſtant change the body receiving it, and then going immediatly through it, when it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected, it cannot correct another, it rather hurts it: And therefore we ſee, that when any are ſick of the <hi>Plague</hi> in one houſe, ſcarce one eſcapes; for, the diſeaſe is ſtrengthened, being <hi>circulated</hi> from one to another; whereby, if there be but one infected, there is more hope of his recovery; and therefore their care and cuſtome is to be commended, which do allot a ſeverall houſe, to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular perſon infected. <hi>Next,</hi> as I ſaid above, it is required, that aſſoon as the <hi>beaſt</hi> is infected wholly, it be killed; but who dares be ſo impious as to kill men being infected; then it is neceſſary, to put another beaſt in his place, and again, till the cure be perfected: But in <hi>feavers,</hi> where there is not ſo great violence, we have obſerved, that if one be infected by another, the <hi>Infector</hi> is often ſtraight freed; and ſo ſometimes it goes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively clear through houſes, till it come to the laſt, who either ſcapes not at all, or very hardly. This obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth exceedingly confirm this Doctrine; and this happens where the <hi>weak body</hi> falls ſick firſt: As to the <hi>third kinde,</hi> the reaſon why the body infecting, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cured; Beſides what hath been ſaid, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe <hi>confirmed diſeaſes,</hi> have ſo changed the whole <hi>habit</hi> of the <hi>body,</hi> that it is almoſt impoſſible to reſtore it, eſpecially, where the <hi>condition</hi> above required, is wanting: but in the beginning that ſome (though wickedly) have been cured from theſe diſeaſes, it is known by experience: for, he that hath <hi>tranſplanted</hi> them by lying with many <hi>Women,</hi> hath been cured, as I have heard it credibly reported, to have happened in the <hi>French Pox:</hi> but theſe are deteſtable things, and worthy of grievous puniſhment; yet they confirm our Doctrine. One thing I will adde more worthy of obſervation; If a weak body be infected, there is ſmall hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but if a ſtrong body be infected, becauſe there is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115013:46"/>
a greater power of rectifying, there is ſome hopes, and many times the body infecting is freed from the Diſeaſe.</p>

               <p>NOw come I to diſcover the <hi>high ſecrets</hi> of this <hi>Art</hi> (ſtudiouſly concealed by many) for the common good, whereto I have dedicated my ſelf and all my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I am not ignorant that there may be diverſe <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> all aiming at one work; the <hi>two chief</hi> that have come to my hand I will ſet down, adding a <hi>third</hi> moſt conſonant to reaſon, and a <hi>fourth</hi> formed out by my own <hi>experience.</hi> Uſe thou which thou wilt, for thou ſhalt have no ſcarcity. <hi>Aurelius</hi> out of ſome words of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> hath made him one not altogether contemptible; thus he proceeded: He took the <hi>dung</hi> of a ſound <hi>man,</hi> and let it be dryed in a ſhady place, for ſo it loſt the ſtink and the excrementitious moiſture; a portion of the ſpirit above-ſaid being left, which he by a word ſignificant, and apt enough, calleth <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which being dryed, he uſeth after the manner anon to be told. We neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow the <hi>preparation</hi> nor <hi>matter;</hi> becauſe experience ſhews, that a <hi>Magnet</hi> ſo prepared, will copiouſly attract the <hi>ſpirits;</hi> neither will we upon the tranſport of <hi>Envie,</hi> that incurable diſeaſe, deter any man from the practice of it, becauſe it is not of our invention, but proceed we to the <hi>ſecond.</hi> When about two years agoe, I, with my ever honoured Friend, being at his houſe, there grew ſome diſcourſe upon the <hi>Argument</hi> among us; my friend (as he was wont) ſpake many things very accutely, but covertly, of this <hi>Art,</hi> and amongſt the reſt, of this <hi>Magnet,</hi> which I knew before, but had never tryed it, ſaying, That it was of ſo vigorous <hi>attraction,</hi> that being applied to the <hi>region</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> it would ſo violently draw, that he could not ſuffer it long. But when I asked him the uſe of this Magnet, he ſuddenly held his peace, repenting he ſaid ſo much. How art thou ſo much beholden to me,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115013:47"/>
to impart that to thee, my friend would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to me, who, as thou ſeeſt, knew ſomething in this <hi>Art?</hi> But to the point. This Magnet is nothing elſe, but <hi>dryed mans fleſh,</hi> which is certain, hath a mighty attractive power; but it muſt be taken, if it be poſſible, from the body of a man that dies a <hi>violent death,</hi> and yet while it is warm: But if we were tyed to this <hi>Magnet,</hi> every man ſees how extreamly we ſhould ſuffer for the want of it: If we will therfore hearken to <hi>reaſon,</hi> I will before I come to my <hi>Magnet,</hi> conform both to <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> ſhew you a better Magnet, and not gotten with ſo much <hi>cruelty.</hi> Take therfore the <hi>blood of a ſound yong man,</hi> drawn in the <hi>spring</hi> (there are every where <hi>fools</hi> enow) as much as thou canſt get, it's no matter whether it be drawn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together or not, this <hi>blood</hi> ſuffered to congeal, pour off the <hi>water</hi> ſwimming aloft, and keep it while it is cold, dry it in the ſhade, and then moiſt<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But at length let us come to our <hi>Magnet,</hi> which doth as it were by epitome, comprehend all the body of man in it.</p>
               <p>Take therefore a great quantity of <hi>mans dung</hi> (but of a <hi>ſound man)</hi> mix it with <hi>Wine</hi> to the conſiſtance of a <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> add to it as much <hi>ſweat</hi> as thou canſt get, this may be with <hi>linnen Cloth</hi> taken from ſound bodies, put them all together, and in a clean place, in the ſhade, till they be dry; then add as much <hi>freſh blood</hi> to them, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them altogether, and ſo let them dry again; and if any water ſwim again on the top, decant it, but keep it in a veſſel very cloſe, and being dry imbibe it again with the <hi>decanted water,</hi> and dry it, and ſo till the <hi>maſſe</hi> hath drunk up all the <hi>water.</hi> This Magnet, thus prepared, keep in a veſſel very well ſhut; for ſo thou haſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Magnet, the <hi>compendium</hi> of all mans body, gotten without any horrour or cruelty, which we altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; yet he that will follow other mens devices, may let us proceed.</p>

               <p>IF thou haſt never ſo good a Magnet, and knoweſt not the uſe of it, thou beſtoweſt thy labour in vain. We ſhall therefore add the uſe of it, that nothing may be wanting in this <hi>Art;</hi> And about it, being moſt needful, and asking little labour, there needs but few words: yet <hi>one thing</hi> is to be <hi>noted</hi> in the way; namely, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the aforeſaid <hi>beams</hi> do alwayes <hi>flow</hi> from the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> yet there are ſome parts out of which they flow more <hi>copiouſly:</hi> in one word, they are the <hi>Emmunctories</hi> by which the body is as it were cleanſed, and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> doth accompany the ſuperfluities; becauſe theſe parts are more porous and ſpungie, it wandreth out more freely, finding a larger egreſſe.</p>
               <p>Now come we to the uſe of the <hi>Magnet:</hi> Apply the Magnet to the <hi>emmunctory</hi> of the <hi>part grieved,</hi> and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>patient</hi> to <hi>ſweat,</hi> which is beſt done by ſome <hi>Cordial Diaphoretick fitting the diſeaſe,</hi> leave there the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net until it be impregnate with the <hi>vital spirit,</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, and immediatly uſe it according to the precepts given in the Chapter of <hi>Transplantation:</hi> but take heed it be ſpeedily done, for fear the ſpirit be diſſipated by ſome external more powerful cauſe; for then <hi>Transplantation</hi> will be in vain attempted: if the patient be not cured at the firſt, do it again, and thou ſhalt ſee the deſired effect.</p>
               <p>And not only <hi>diſeaſes</hi> are cured this way, but ſtrange things, even all that are done by <hi>transplantation,</hi> are this way effected: although <hi>transplantation</hi> may be done by other means, as ſhall be ſhewed by and by. But if thou deſire by this means to <hi>transplant</hi> diſeaſes, read diligently the Chapter of <hi>Transplantation,</hi> and obſerve well the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> there given, leſt if things ſhall happen not to hit thy deſire, thy ignorance do return to the reproach of this Art.</p>

We have above in general bidden to beware of <hi>Excrements</hi> of the diſeaſed people. But here we will give a more particular advice, namely, That thou never eaſe thy ſelf where diſeaſed folks have; for much miſchief hath come of it: for, we have known ſome hurt by the ſmell; that doing their eaſement where one had done it that had a <hi>flux, themſelves</hi> got the <hi>flux</hi> without a procatar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick cauſe preceding. The reaſon of which ſo ſtrange a matter, is to be taken from that which hath been ſaid, and ſhall not be here repeated. Furthermore, take heed leſt at any time you do your <hi>eaſement</hi> upon <hi>herbs,</hi> that are either <hi>malignant, exulcerating,</hi> or <hi>violently purging;</hi> for hence many times when the cauſe is unknown, proceeds dangerous <hi>diſenteries,</hi> which, until thoſe <hi>herbs</hi> be quite

putrified, will not yeeld to any medicine. <hi>Finally,</hi> It is not ſafe to leave theſe <hi>Excrements</hi> in places where thine Enemies can come; for it is eaſie to know what violent pains are procured by a <hi>kindled coal</hi> with <hi>ſpirit of Wine</hi> or <hi>Aquavitae</hi> put into thoſe <hi>Excrements.</hi> I would have thee to perſwade thy ſelf, that if theſe things were ordinarily known, they be worſe and more dangerous matters, than theſe known to ſome others; therefore look wiſely to thy ſelf. But of theſe <hi>Excrements</hi> enough, ſo far as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this Art in the general: the particular wayes of working with them, we will deſcribe in our practice.</p>

It is not unknown, That almoſt all <hi>Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> floweth from the ſaid <hi>inſenſible transpiration</hi> and <hi>ſweat;</hi> for being <hi>impregnate</hi> with much <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it faſt, according to the <hi>dispoſition</hi> thereof, they work violently; therefore take heed we be not partakers of the <hi>ſweat,</hi> or <hi>exhalation</hi> of an unſound body: that we touch not the <hi>ſheets</hi> ſo impregnate, nor put on the <hi>ſhoes</hi> or <hi>ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,</hi> or <hi>gloves,</hi> or the like: but in a ſpecial manner, that we be no <hi>bedfellows</hi> with them.

               <p>OUt of almoſt all the <hi>Parts</hi> of the Body, do <hi>Hairs</hi> grow, and they are made not only of viſciditie of the <hi>Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>fourth concoction,</hi> growing in the <hi>pores</hi> which by addition of new <hi>matter,</hi> grow in length (as ſome do falſely imagine,) but they take alſo not the leaſt part of their <hi>matter</hi> from the reſolved <hi>parts</hi> of the body, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this <hi>Experiment:</hi> for, if by <hi>Diaſtatick</hi> Art thou wouldeſt increaſe <hi>hair,</hi> by means of a <hi>Willow tree</hi> (as ſhall be taught in the Practice) and if thou continue the medicine longer than it is fit, thou wilt aſſuredly bring a weakneſſe upon the <hi>part,</hi> which can be by no other means, but becauſe by the violence of the medicine, the <hi>parts</hi> being reſolved further than <hi>Nature</hi> doth ſuffer, are loſt. And for the confirmation of this Truth, <hi>hairs</hi> are ſeen to grow long after <hi>Death,</hi> whereas there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. So, as there can be no <hi>Excrements</hi> of the <hi>fourth concoction;</hi> and therefore, they muſt needs come from the <hi>body reſolved;</hi> which <hi>reſolution</hi> is added to the <hi>hairs</hi> by the <hi>vital ſpirit,</hi> which is ſtill there remaining: For, by any other means this addition cannot be: whence alſo our aſſertion of the remaining <hi>ſpirit</hi> is confirmed. Hence appears how great agreement <hi>hairs</hi> have with the body, and whereupon we uſe them as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in this <hi>Art.</hi> It is well known what ſtrange things the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Magi</hi> did by <hi>hairs;</hi> and why the like may not be done, I ſee no reaſon. It is alſo a thing well known by hear-ſay, how <hi>love</hi> hath been procured by means of <hi>hair</hi> burned in a <hi>Candle, Aſtrologically</hi> made; which though it be not (as no reaſon it ſhould) <hi>ordinarily known</hi> to the vulgar, yet to ſome it is: and though it be mingled with <hi>filthy ſuperſtitions,</hi> yet I, that am wont to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115013:52"/>
reduce all <hi>operatious</hi> to the <hi>poſſibility of nature,</hi> never thought them abſolutely and preciſely neceſſary to the producing of the effect. So likewayes we have known many diſeaſes, otherwayes incurable, cured by <hi>hatrs,</hi> eſpecially taken from the <hi>part affected,</hi> if being duely <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified</hi> and mixed with <hi>things ſigned,</hi> they be <hi>implanted</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>plants,</hi> as every man may prove according to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. So if <hi>hairs</hi> be taken from the <hi>four principal Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,</hi> no doubt, but well prepared, they will cure all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. I would counſell the Readers, that in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof, they do not ſo careleſly ſcatter their <hi>hairs</hi> up and down, which may be the cauſe of much miſchief; nor yet burn them, for (that) as-experience ſhowes, hinders the growth of them, but bury them in ſome wholeſome ground, adding unto them <hi>things</hi> to ſtrengthen the <hi>head,</hi> which will much conduce to your health.</p>

               <p>OMitting thoſe many Diſputes concerning <hi>Blood,</hi> which makes not to our purpoſe: as of the <hi>original organ, Circulation,</hi> and the like. So far forth as concerns our <hi>Art,</hi> I do briefly ſay, That <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſay, and teach us, that <hi>blood</hi> is the <hi>principal Chariot</hi> of the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> by placing the <hi>ſoul in the blood:</hi> but, if the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115013:53"/>
                  <hi>bond,</hi> by which the <hi>ſoul</hi> is tyed to the <hi>body,</hi> then where the <hi>ſpirit</hi> moſt reſideth, there ſhall the <hi>ſoul</hi> moſt powerfully work. The <hi>blood</hi> then, which ſo plentifully poſſeſſeth the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and communicates them to the <hi>body,</hi> is ſurely the fitteſt <hi>Inſtrument</hi> to cure Diſeaſes, and do all the other things which the <hi>Art</hi> requireth and promiſeth: for, here the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is free and not bound up, as elſewhere. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>blood,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is ſooneſt affected, becauſe there it is <hi>naked,</hi> as is aforeſaid. Yet we muſt not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly conclude, that it may be taken and uſed preſently, without any <hi>fermentation</hi> or <hi>putrifaction:</hi> for, they are both uſefull here, as in the Practice ſhall be ſhowen: onely take heed that thou <hi>corrupt</hi> not the <hi>blood</hi> with too much <hi>fermentation;</hi> for then the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is driven away ſo, that peradventure it will do nothing. But that thou mayeſt know the fit time of <hi>fermentation,</hi> I'le teach thee a ſecret; Let the <hi>blood</hi> with the moſt excellent parcell of the whole body, be joyned in a true proportion, by the beſt way poſſible, and put them into a <hi>natural veſſel,</hi> well ſhut up, and ſet under a hen to hatch, and in the product thou wilt finde a thing performing many miracles, <hi>coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated</hi> in the <hi>ſhape of a man:</hi> and the <hi>oyl</hi> or <hi>liquor</hi> ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about it, with the proper <hi>ſweat</hi> mixed, doth change <hi>mans mindes</hi> with the touch of it. Many things more may be done by <hi>blood,</hi> which are better concealed, than ſpoken: But if thou perfectly underſtand the things aforeſaid, and canſt diligently ſearch <hi>Nature,</hi> thou mayſt by thine own <hi>induſtry</hi> attain unto them. We will in the mean time give thee ſome cautions: After the <hi>blood</hi> is drawn, thou muſt take heed how thou uſeſt it; for thereby may be done both good and hurt. There be ſome that put the <hi>blood</hi> into the ground, which I counſell may be done in a clean place, mixed with wholeſome <hi>herbs;</hi> for if it ſhould be buried in a <hi>ſtinking</hi> or <hi>infected place,</hi> it might hurt the body whence it was taken: There are others that give it to <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>whelps</hi> to eat, which I like beſt of all: for, ſo it may happen to <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant</hi> the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> and ſo cure it wholly, or at leaſt help
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115013:54"/>
the Phyſician; but it would do a great deal better, if it were given the <hi>dog</hi> either <hi>warm,</hi> or <hi>putrified</hi> in a cloſe veſſell with a temperate heat. But here I cannot but tax the villany of ſome, who with an execrable bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, dare give the <hi>blood,</hi> yea Monthly Flours, for a <hi>Philter,</hi> not conſidering the miſchief iſſuing from thence: for <hi>blood,</hi> though never ſo pure, is an enemy to the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and before it will be digeſted, is corrupted and turned into matter, and what effect will it then work? Beſides, here lyes not the <hi>loving force</hi> which they ſeek; but there muſt be another manner of preparation, before thou come to that: for, it muſt be looſed before, that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> may work more freely and buſily to incline minds: becauſe of the <hi>will</hi> ruling, there is required a greater force, and the conſpiring of many cauſes: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the multitude knowes not, it can never attain the truth, but calumniates the certainty of theſe things, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them either <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>deviliſh.</hi> For although <hi>blood,</hi> of all things in the <hi>body,</hi> contain the looſeſt <hi>ſpirits,</hi> yet will it work more mightily, being digeſted, as the former Conſiderations, and Experience it ſelf teacheth: and therefore they are ſurely to be puniſhed, that work ſo infernally. But, I fore-ſee an <hi>Objection;</hi> for, if the power of <hi>love</hi> reſt in the <hi>blood,</hi> then how happens it that <hi>ravenous beaſts,</hi> that do ſo greedily drink <hi>blood,</hi> and ſo well digeſt it, are not to be brought to be in <hi>love</hi> with thoſe things that they eat, being the reaſon of the Individualls, and the <hi>ſpecies, &amp;c?</hi> I anſwer, firſt, In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular operations of the whole <hi>ſpecies</hi> to the <hi>individuum,</hi> or of one <hi>individuum</hi> to another, there is not the ſame reaſon. Secondly, That they eat unprepared <hi>blood,</hi> which is not ſo powerfull as to change <hi>nature:</hi> for, by it duely <hi>fermented,</hi> one <hi>individuum</hi> may be reconciled to another, though it be a <hi>Dog</hi> to a <hi>Hare.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> filled with the Commotion of an <hi>angry ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and retaining ſtill a portion of it, doth rather whet <hi>ravenous beaſts</hi> into rage, and make them ſeek the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others the like. And hence thou mayeſt learn,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115013:54"/>
that it is impoſſible by any means or preparations to cauſe <hi>Love,</hi> by <hi>blood</hi> violently ſhed; but it is more likely to cauſe hatred. Therefore the <hi>Ancients</hi> never drank the <hi>blood</hi> of one anothers <hi>fore-head vein,</hi> before perfect reconciliation. Before I go any further, I will adde one <hi>Parergon:</hi> The <hi>ſalt</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> if it be diſſolved in the <hi>menstruum</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> is the excellenteſt remedy of all others; and by this means the <hi>ſalts of Herbs,</hi> will ſhew the <hi>species</hi> of the <hi>herbs</hi> whence they are taken, in a <hi>glaſſe:</hi> So the <hi>ſalt of blood,</hi> will by the help of the Beaſts heat, ſhew the <hi>ſhape</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> in a glaſſe: And this I believe was <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his <hi>Homuncio:</hi> But of Medicines taken from <hi>blood,</hi> I will give examples in my Practice; therefore here this ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Matter,</hi> (which is nothing elſe but <hi>blood</hi> putrified without the <hi>veins,</hi> or Fleſh looſed with rottenneſſe) a man may philoſophize as of <hi>blood;</hi> if he ſpeak of it as a means to cure <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> ſaving that it hath loſt much of the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> which are in the <hi>ſound blood,</hi> by corruption: yet by means of it, <hi>ulcers</hi> and <hi>old ſores</hi> may be cured by the Sympathetick water, or ointment, whether they be inward or outward. There are that an oint the inſide of a <hi>Nut ſhell</hi> with the Balſom, then put the <hi>Pus</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> into it, and then hang it up in the dry Air, or <hi>Mundum Coelum,</hi> and by this Medicine cure all Ulcers. Yet this is to be noted, that <hi>Pus</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> may be two wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, according to which conſideration it is ſound in the body: for, it either ſimply ariſeth from <hi>blood,</hi> by means of <hi>putrifaction,</hi> corrupting without the <hi>veins;</hi> or, it ariſeth from ſome <hi>venemous quality</hi> in ſome <hi>foul diſeaſe,</hi> as in the <hi>French Pox;</hi> or, it is infected with ſome ſimple <hi>diſeaſed quality,</hi> as in <hi>Pthiſis.</hi> And from the touch of all theſe, experience ſhewes, that much harm may come. But if thou wilt, by thy <hi>ſympathetical</hi> either <hi>water</hi> or <hi>oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> cure any ſuch Ulcers, the <hi>extraneous qualities</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that there muſt be ſome <hi>Alexipharmaca,</hi> or <hi>ſpecifick</hi> to that <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> added: for, it is manifeſt, that the <hi>qualities</hi> muſt be taken away, before the Ulcers can be cured.</p>

Of thoſe things that are <hi>caſt up by vomit,</hi> it boots not to ſpeak much; for, we may think of them as of other <hi>Excrements,</hi> uſing alwayes the ſame Cautions: but, if the vomit be by <hi>Nature,</hi> not by <hi>Phyſick,</hi> it will be fitter for our purpoſe, as we may think of other things.
