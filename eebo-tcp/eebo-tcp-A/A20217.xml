         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing often requeſted (gentle Reader) and much importuned by ſundry, both learned and godly, to publiſh that doctrine of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> which diuers of them with liuely voyce heard publikely deliuered: I did at laſt, vpon my moſt mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yeeld vnto their reaſonable requeſt; I meane the reaſons of their requeſt. Indeed I doe ingeniouſly confeſſe, that I am the vnmeeteſt of many, which this age (God be thanked) doth afford, to deale in a matter of ſo great importance, or any wiſe to be imployed in ſo great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a ſeruice as this is. But if I doe induſtriouſly vſe my ſmall talent, and be found faithfull in a little; I hope it ſhall haue both chearefull and comfortable acceptation with the Church of God. For this I preſume will bee granted of all, that hee which hath but a little ſtrength, and yet putteth it forth to the vttermost to doe good withall, is more to be commended, then he which hath thriſe his ſtrength, and vſeth it not to the helpe and benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And true it is indeed, that ſundry worthy labours of diuers excellent men vpon the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> are already extant: ſo as he may ſeeme to powre water into the Sea, or goe about to mend the crowes eyes, that will attempt to adde any thing to that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready publiſhed. But know this (O Christian Reader) that the Lords garden is ſo large and plentifull of all moſt ſweete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant flowers, that where any one hath gathered a Noſegay most fragrant and delectable, another may come after, and gather ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to be contemned. For the wiſedome of God is ſuch an vndrainable fountaine and head-ſpring, that where one hath
<pb facs="tcp:18003:3"/>
drawne much before, another may come happely, and draw as much afterward: yea though thouſands doe ſucceede, yet can this fountaine neuer be drawne drie. Be it farre from me to arrogate any thing to my ſelfe, aboue others: for I am priuy inough to mine owne meanes, and do freely confeſſe, that in this worke, I haue receiued much light from others: and therefore do not as a iudge, giue ſentence vpon other mens workes: but as one that would furniſh the ſame feast, bring in my diſh among them. Or as one that in the ſame cauſe would come in as a third, or a fourth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to teſtifie and confirme the ſame thing. And verily through the gracious aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, my ſimple purpoſe and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor is to giue a lift to the vttermoſt of my power, to further that which is already happily begun, and to prouoke others of greater gifts, to come after with their great lights, and Lanternes in their hands, to diſcry and diſcouer whatſoeuer in this Propheſie is not yet fully ſeene into. I am not ignorant that ſome would not haue this booke medled withall, nor in any wiſe to be expounded among the common people, becauſe (ſay they) it is ſo darke and hard to vnderſtand. But let all ſuch leaue their owne opinions, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what the holy Ghoſt ſaith.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apo. 1.3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that heare the words of this Prophecy, &amp;c.</hi> What can be ſaid more? or more effectually to ſtirre vs vp to heare and reade, and with all gladneſſe to embrace this booke, then to tell vs, that in ſo doing we ſhall be bleſſed? For the thinges contained in this booke, be no trifles: they be not things onely for a ſhew to mooue wonderment, or to delight the curious minds of men: but ſuch as indeed do giue true bleſſedneſſe vnto all thoſe that are well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in them. What thing is greater, then to bee bleſſed for euermore? If we be not exceeding dull, yea, euen like ſtockes and ſtones, it must needs moue vs &amp; ſtir vs vp. For who will wittingly &amp; willingly looſe his own bleſſednes, or ſuffer it to be taken from him when as he may haue it? If any will obiect that a man may be bleſſed well inough without the knowledge of this booke, and that there bee bookes inough in the Scripture, to procure our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, without this: and that thouſands are now in heauen, which neuer knew what this booke meant: I anſwere, that all this doth
<pb facs="tcp:18003:3"/>
not take away the neceſſary vſe of this booke: for the holy Ghoſt doth pronounce a bleſſing vpon the heads of thoſe that reade and ſtudie this booke, not becauſe a man cannot be ſaued without it: but becauſe of the great comfort which it miniſtreth vnto vs of this age, and hath miniſtred vnto all the Churches ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times. For it is the Propheſie of this age, and the Propheſie of all the ages ſince Chriſt: wherein is fully ſhewed what ſhall be the eſtate and conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church in the ſeuerall ages thereof, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende of the worlde. For God according to his admirable wiſdome &amp; mercy, hath neuer from the beginning left his church without a Propheſie, for the great comfort thereof. For we know, that immediately after the fall of our first parents, God himſelfe, for the great comfort of his Church, did foretell and foreprophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie long before of that reſtauration which ſhould be made by the Meſſias his ſonne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen. 3. Gen. 15.</hi>
               </note> according as it came to paſſe in the fulneſſe of time. Afterward he did foretell his people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of their great ſeruitude, and intollerable bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and alſo of the ende and full determination thereof, after foure hundred and thirtie yeares. After all this he foretold by his ſeruants the Prophets of the captiuitie in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the full expiration thereof at the end and tearme of ſeuentie yeares.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier. 25.</hi>
               </note> And yet further for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation of his people,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan. 7. Ezech. 38.</hi>
               </note> he foretold by <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> of the great afflictions &amp; troubles which his Church ſhould endure by the perſecutions of the diuided Greeke Empire: (I meane <hi>Alexanders</hi> poſteritie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan. 8.</hi>
               </note> eſpecially the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Siria,</hi> which deſcended of <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi>

Loe then what care God hath had of his Church in all ages before the comming of his ſonne in the fleſh, ſo to foretell both of the affliction it ſelfe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the iust period and determination thereof. And ſhall we not thinke that God hath the like care now for his church which then he had: or hath he not as great and as prouident care for the good of his Church ſince the promiſed Meſſias was actually exhibited as before? Yes aſſuredly, and much more too: for if his care and
<pb facs="tcp:18003:4"/>
prouidence was ſo great for his Church being in her ward-ſhip and minoritie: then much more now being come to her ripeneſſe and full age: If when it was leſſe glorious, then much more now, being farre more glorious. Therefore now vnto vs he foretelleth by his ſeruant <hi>Iohn</hi> what ſhall be the eſtate of the Church vnto the end of the world: and therefore <hi>Bleſſed is hee that heareth and readeth this booke:</hi> ſith it foretelleth of the Churches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions in this age by the whoore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and of the full end and determination thereof. It ſheweth iuſtly and preciſely what the Church hath ſuffered ſince the Apoſtles times in ſeueral ages, and what it ſhall ſuffer: and alſo how all the enemies thereof ſhall ſhortly be troden vnder foote. What can be more ioyfull or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to all the people of God, then to know afore-hand that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall: <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall downe: Antichriſt the great perſecutor of the Church, ſhalbe vtterly confounded and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in this world; notwithſtanding all plottes and policies, crafts and deuiſes to the contrary; notwithſtanding all forces &amp; armies cunningly contriued and raiſed vp againſt the Church by Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prieſts, Ieſuites, Pope, Cardinall, and King of <hi>Spaine</hi>? For all theſe in this age do very buſily beſtirre them, and ranſacke all corners of their wits to repaire the ruines of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make vp the breaches which are made in the walles of <hi>Babylon</hi> their great citie. But alas all in vaine, for it ſhall fall: It ſhal fall: It ſhal fall as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the preſence of the Arke, do what they can, ſpight of their hearts, maugre their beards: it ſhall fall finally: it ſhall without all hope of recouery: for hath the Lord ſpoken it, and ſhall it not come to paſſe? or can any word of his euer fall to the ground? Sith therefore the Ieſuits and Secular Prieſts do ſo fiske about, and croake in euery corner, as greatly fearing the fall of their <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the drying vp of their <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it ſtandes vs all in hand to be as reſolute for Chriſt, as they are for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; and as ſtudious to vphold the kingdome of God, as they are to vphold the kingdome of the diuel. And for this purpoſe it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requiſite and neceſſary, that all the Lords people ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this booke, and armed againſt them with the things reueald in this Propheſie. For this booke is a moſt precious Iewell
<pb facs="tcp:18003:4"/>
which God hath beſtowed vpon his Church in this laſt age: and it is great pitie that all the ſeruants of God are not better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, eſpecially in theſe times, for now in this age is and ſhall be the very heate of the warre, and brunt of the battell betwixt Papiſts and Proteſtants; betwixt God and <hi>Belial;</hi> betwixt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt, and the armies of Antichriſt. Now this Propheſie laieth all open, and plainly telleth vs what ſhalbe the iſſue and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in the day of battaile: which ſide ſhall haue the victory, and which ſide ſhall goe downe. And therefore very needfull it is that it ſhould be expounded againe and againe, and all the Lords people made throughly aaquainted with it. For in this age wherein we liue, this Propheſie can neuer be inough opened and beaten vpon, that all good Proteſtants may bee armed with it againſt future times, euen as it were with an armour of proofe. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> plainly telleth the people of his time, euen the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that they ſhould be bleſſed by reading and ſtudying this booke, becauſe they ſhould thereby be both forewarned, and forearmed againſt many eminent troubles and future dangers. For ſaith he, <hi>The time is at hand:</hi> that is to ſay, ſome things were euen then to be fulfilled. For ſome matters foretold in this booke, did begin to be fulfilled, euen preſently after they were ſhewed vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> for the miſtery of iniquitie did euen then begin to worke. The Church in the Apoſtles time had her conflicts. The ten great perſecutions began euen then to be raiſed vp. Hereſies ſhortly after beganne to ſpring and ſprout. Afterward by degrees, the great Antichriſt did approach towards his curſed ſeate. And after all this, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> foretelleth how hee ſhould take poſſeſſion of his abhominable and moſt execrable ſeate and ſea of <hi>Rome:</hi> How he ſhould raigne and rule for a time as the Monarche of the world: How he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt the Church, and make warre againſt the Saintes: How he ſhould raigne but a ſhort time, and afterward come tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling downe, as faſt as euer he roſe vp, and decreaſe as faſt as euer he increaſed. Therefore <hi>Bleſſed is he</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn) that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently readeth and peruſeth this booke,</hi> that thereby hee may foreſee all theſe thinges, and bee armed againſt them. For as the Heathen man ſaith; <hi>Leuius laedit quicquid praeuideris antè,</hi> Foreſeeing daungers do leaſt hurt. Now to apply all this to our
<pb facs="tcp:18003:5"/>
times, I ſay they are twiſe happie that are ſtudious and painfull in ſearching out the true ſenſe and meaning of this Propheſie, that thereby they may be ſtrengthned againſt all the aſſaults of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts our profeſſed enemies, and the enemies of Gods Church, and ſtick faſt to the euerlaſting truth of God, knowing for a certaintie that theſe ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> ſhall not long preuaile. The date of their raigne is almoſt out, and the time draweth on apace, wherein both they and their king <hi>Abaddon</hi> ſhalbe laide in the duſt. But I will now proceed to a new reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc. 9 11.</hi>
               </note> to proue that this booke of the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ought not to be concealed: but openly preached and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the whole Church of God in this age. My reaſon is taken out of the <hi>22.</hi> chapter of this booke, ver. <hi>10.</hi> in theſe words. <hi>Seale not the words of the Propheſie of this booke, for the time is at hand.</hi> Here is a flat commandement from God, that this booke and the doctrine of it may not be ſealed vp; that is to ſay, kept cloſe from the knowledge of Gods people: but it muſt lie alwaies vnſealed, that all men may open it, read it, and ſee what is in it: for it is a borrowed ſpeech, taken from ſealing of Letters. For we all knowe, that when Letters are ſealed, none may open them, or reade them, but onely thoſe whom it doth concerne: but if they be of purpoſe left vnſealed, then any man may reade them without daunger: So the Lorde willeth and commaundeth, that this booke of the Reuelations ſhould of purpoſe be left vnſealed, that all the people of God might reade it, ſtudie it, and knowe it. If any man doubt whether the Metaphor of Sealing be thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſcripture, let him reade the places quoted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa. 29 11. Dan. 12.9. Apoc. 4.1. Apoc. 10.4.</hi>
               </note> and in all theſe places hee ſhall finde it taken in this ſenſe. Whereby it doth euidently appeare, that the minde and meaning of God is, that this booke ſhould be proclaimed and publiſhed in all the Churches. And vpon this grounde, I holde that euery Miniſter of the Gospell ſtandeth bounde as much as in him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to Preach the doctrine of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> to his particular charge and congregation: for euery Minister of the Gospell muſt ſhewe vnto his people all the counſell of God, and keepe backe nothing: as <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth that hee did, to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his conſcience. But the doctrine of the Reuelations is a part and parcell of the counſell and will of God: therefore it
<pb facs="tcp:18003:5"/>
muſt not be concealed or kept backe from the knowledge of the people of God. And in theſe dayes I thinke it not only meete and conuenient that it ſhould be ſo, but in truth abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>But now me thinketh I heare ſome man ſay: what? muſt this book of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> be preached &amp; made knowne to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? alas, what ſhould they do with it? It is not for them to meddle withall: It is not for their diet. I anſwere, and yet not I, but the holy Ghoſt: that this booke muſt be made knowne to all the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth it the Reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt which God gaue him to ſhew vnto all his ſeruants.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc. 1.1.</hi>
               </note> It is plaine therefore, that al the ſeruantes of God, both men and women, yong and old, rich and poore, muſt be made acquainted with this booke. Moreouer, <hi>Iohn</hi> is commaunded by the God of heauen, to ſet downe all the viſions which the Angell ſhewed him: and to write them all in a booke, and ſend them to the ſeuen Churches of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia: that is, to people of all ſortes, and conditions:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc. 1.11.</hi>
               </note> And therefore this booke doth not only concerne preachers, and deep diuines; but euen all the Lords people whatſoeuer: for it doth miniſter great comfort and strength of faith to all the people of God, that liue in this age. But here the Papists obiect that this booke is full of darkeneſſe and obſcuritie, and therefore not for the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to meddle withall: nay, (ſay they) there are as many miſteries, as words in it, and therefore what ſhould men trouble their heads about it. But no maruell though the Papists ſay ſo much, for it is the wound of their kingdom, and the battery of their <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> As for others, both learned and godly, which in this point are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the ſame mind, that they will not meddle with this booke of the Reuelations: I cannot but maruell at it. The modeſty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of ſome, very rare and reuerend men for learning, &amp; great variety of gifts (which notwithſtanding ſcotch much at this book) is greatly to be commended: But if I were worthy to giue them aduice, I would wiſh them, in this behalfe to change their minde, and to be of another reſolution: for I dare auouch it, that there is nothing in this Propheſie, which ſtudy and diligence, with prayer and humility, may not ouercome. True it is indeed, that the ſhell is thicke, and hard to breake: but being broken, the kernell is moſt
<pb facs="tcp:18003:6"/>
ſweet and pleaſant. If any be diſcouraged with the darkeneſſe &amp; obſcurity of it, let him hearken to theſe reaſons following. Firſt it is called a Reuelation, which is as much to ſay, as an vncouering of things which did lie hid: if it be an vncouering, and reuealing of things, then no doubt it may be knowne and ſeene into. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed thinges are for vs and our children.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut. 19.</hi>
               </note> If it be a Reuelation, how ſay ſome that it cannot be vnderſtood? For, it is contrary to the nature of a Reuelation, to be ſo darke that none can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. But ſhall we ſay that the holy Ghoſt which is the ſpirit of truth, hath giuen a wrong name vnto it? God forbid. For if it hide matters, or ſo ſet them forth that it cannot be vnderſtood, then it is not rightly called a Reuelation. If this booke be ſo myſticall that it cannot be vnderſtood: If the interpretation of it be vncertaine: If the common people cannot be taught to vnderſtand it: how then ſhould the holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth the words of this Propheſie?<note place="margin">

Then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that this booke may be vnderſtood, and no doubt is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of many: and might bee better vnderſtood of many moe, if they would bend their wittes and ſtudies vnto it. The holy Ghoſt as I ſaid before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc. 22.10.</hi>
               </note> willeth and commaundeth that the words of this Propheſie ſhould not be ſealed vp. Whereby it is euident, that he would haue them read and made knowne to all. Then I reaſon thus: That which is open and vnſealed, may be read and knowne: But this booke is open and vnſealed: Therefore it may be read and knowne. If men ſay the matters of this Propheſie are ſealed and hid, and God ſay they be vnſealed and open, whether ſhall we beleeue men or God? If any ſhall reply &amp; ſay, we feele &amp; finde by experience, that the words of this booke are hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: I anſwere, that the fault is in our ſelues, becauſe we are ſo negligent in the ſearch and ſtudy thereof. For if we did with that humilitie, and reuerend care that ought to be in vs, ſearch after the things reuealed in this booke, we ſhould finde that they be not ſealed vp, but lie open to bee read and knowne. True it is indeed, that if any man light vpon ſome peece, and take it by it ſelfe, he ſhall finde it very darke: But if he looke vpon the whole courſe of matters throughout the booke, and marke and obſerue diligently
<pb facs="tcp:18003:6"/>
how things be iterated, hee ſhall finde no ſuch darkneſſe as he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, for there is a notable coherence of matters, and courſe of times obſerued in this booke, euen from the first chapter vnto the laſt, as God willing ſhall more fully &amp; plainly appeare in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular opening and interpretation thereof. One great obiection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Propheſie is, that the Fathers confeſſe it is full of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and that they could not vnderſtand it. If they could not vnderſtand it ſay ſome, how, how ſhall we vnderſtand it? Is it not great arrogancy for vs to ſay wee vnderſtand it better then they did. I anſwer no. For a man of meane learning in compariſon, may now in theſe daies more eaſily vnderſtand &amp; expound this booke, then the learnedeſt Doctors and Fathers in auncient time. The reaſon is this, we liue in an age wherein the moſt of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in this booke are fulfilled. Now the fulfilling of a propheſie is the beſt expoſition of it. But as for the Fathers, they liued in a time wherein many of theſe things were not come to paſſe, nor ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and therfore more hard for them to interprete and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: for thoſe things in this Propheſie which are not yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are hardeſt for vs of this age to vnderſtand and reſolue of. But when a Propheſie is fulfilled, it is an eaſie matter to ſay this was the meaning of the Prophet. Some things in this booke were fulfilled before the daies of the Fathers, and ſome thinges in the daies wherein they liued: and both thoſe they did clearely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Some things were fulfilled after their daies, as the riſing and raigning of the great Antichriſt, which they did not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee into. Hereupon it commeth to paſſe, that many things which vnto them were very obſcure, are vnto vs moſt cleare &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: as being already fulfilled: inſomuch that all which are not wilfully blinded, may ſee and vnderſtand them, yea the moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. Be not therefore diſcouraged (gentle Reader) at the darkneſſe &amp; difficultie of this booke. Doe not preiudicially reſolue and ſet downe with thy ſelfe, that the naturall ſenſe of this booke cannot be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the true meaning found out, but that we muſt be faine when we haue done all that we can, to reſt in vncertaine coniectures, ſome following one ſenſe, and ſome an other, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth moſt like and probable. But no man can ſay confidently and preciſely this is the meaning of the holy Ghoſt. Oh be not of that minde good Chriſtian brother: for if we haue not an vndoubted
<pb facs="tcp:18003:7"/>
certainty for the ſenſe &amp; meaning of this Propheſie, we are neuer the nearer: and that is it which the Papiſts would driue vs vnto. But know for a certainty, that the naturall ſenſe of this booke, is to be found out, as well as of other bookes of the Scripture. And that we might not be left to our ſelues in the darke, and to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine coniectures, and doubtfull interpretations; Behold the mercifull goodneſſe of God to his Church, who himſelfe doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the darkeſt, and most miſticall things in this Propheſie, or at leaſt ſo many of them, and ſo far, as the reſt are thereby laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and made manifest. The Lord himſelfe expoundeth ſome things in the firſt Chapter, which giue cleare light to the firſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: The Angell expoundeth diuers other things. In the <hi>17.</hi> Chapter, which is the key of this propheſie, the Angel doth of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, open and interpret all the greateſt doubts of this booke: as who is the Whore of Babylon, who is the beaſt, what be his ſeuen heads, what be his <hi>10.</hi> hornes, what be the waters which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is, the Whore of Rome, ſitteth vpon. Moreouer, for the better vnderſtanding of this Propheſie, we muſt note, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the Prophets, vnto which there bee ſundry alluſions, and from the which ſundry things are drawne, do cleare diuers things in this Reuelation. The knowledge of antiquities, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth much aide to the vnderſtanding of this Propheſie. The knowledge of the hiſtories of the Church, and the particular ſtate thereof in diuers ages, bringeth great light. The obſeruation of the phraſes and maner of ſpeech, vſed by the old Prophets, doth helpe alſo not a little. The ſerious and deepe weighing of all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the text, &amp; conferring one thing with another the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents with the antecedents, &amp; the antecedents with the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, furthereth greatly for the bolting out of the true &amp; natural ſenſe. And furthermore, as the ſpirit of God is the author of this propheſie, ſo the ſame ſpirit is the beſt interpreter of it, &amp; doth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and reueale it to all ſuch, as vſing al other good meanes are earneſt and humble ſuters vnto God, for the illumination thereof: whereby they may vnderſtand both this, and all other the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his will: which the Apoſtle ſaith, God hath reuealed vnto vs by his ſpirit:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1. Cor. 2.</hi>
               </note> For the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deepe things of God. To all this may be added the knowledge of artes, tongues, and the learned writings, and interpretations of ſundry
<pb facs="tcp:18003:7"/>
excellent men, which all do bring great furtherance to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Propheſie. Sith then there be ſo many helpes for the opening and expounding of this Reuelation: why ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny be diſcouraged from the reading and ſtudy thereof? But if any man demaund a reaſon, why Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writeth this Reuelation in ſuch miſticall and allegoricall maner: I anſwere, that there may be diuers reaſons yeelded hereof. Firſt, that the world being blinded, might fulfill the things herein ſpecified. Secondly, becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> was to publiſh this Reuelation, in ſuch maner and forme as he had receiued it from Ieſus Chriſt, which was figuratiue and allegoricall. Thirdly, becauſe it was much more wiſedome, to foretel the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romaine Empire, which al that time bare the ſway, almoſt ouer all the world, vnder couert and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeeches, then in plaine tearmes, leaſt the Romaine Princes ſhould rage more againſt the Chriſtians, euen in that reſpect. The like alſo may be ſaid, for <hi>Daniels</hi> darke maner of deliuering his Propheſie. For if he had vttered thoſe things in plaine tearmes, which he ſpake darkely and allegorically, it might haue coſt him his life. For the heathen enemies would neuer haue endured to heare that all their Empires glory and renowne ſhould fall one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and one by another: and that the Iewes were the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy people whome God did defend, and to whome in the ende, God would not onely giue a quiet poſſeſſion of their owne land and kingdome: but alſo a kingdome euerlasting, &amp; that through their Meſſias and great deliuerer. But to grow to a concluſion (gentle Reader) thou ſhalt find in this poore trauell: Firſt, an expoſition of the firſt <hi>13.</hi> Chapters: after thou ſhalt find the next <hi>6.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, vnto the twentith, reduced all to one head, which is to proue the <hi>5.</hi> points propounded: and laſt of all the <hi>3.</hi> Chapters following briefely and plainely expounded. If any through lazineſſe will not, or through want of leiſure cannot read ouer this ſhort trauel: yet for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, let him read thoſe things only which are written vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>14.</hi> Chapter. And thus (Chriſtian Reader) hoping that thou wilt not neglect that which may be for thine owne good, I comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thee to God, &amp; to the word of his grace, which is able to build fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to giue thee an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</p>

the ſoundeſt Diuines, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt; <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diſciple, whom Ieſus loued, was the Authour and Inſtrument of penning this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie:<note place="margin">Apoc. 22. verſe 8.

Now we all know that the teſtimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> is of great weight, though hee be but a man: for hee is ſuch a man as is firmely to be beleeued in all that he ſpeaketh.

                  <hi>as it had bene of a trompet, ſaying, I am</hi> Alpha <hi>&amp;</hi> Omega, <hi>the firſt and the laſt, &amp; that which thou ſeeſt write in a booke, &amp; ſend it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churches.</hi> Here we ſee how <hi>Iohn</hi> is called &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed, by <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> that is Ieſus Chriſt, to write this doctrine of the Apocalyps. But may ſome man ſay, was not <hi>Iohn</hi> called before? was he not one of the Lambes 12. Apoſtles? had he not now many yeares executed the office of the Apoſtleſhip right faithfully? muſt hee now haue a new calling, &amp; a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond calling? what needs he being an Apoſtle, to be called &amp; authoriſed again? To this I anſwer, that this matter now in hand, was a new &amp; a ſpecial work, and therfore requires a new &amp; ſpecial calling. It is a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge reuelation, &amp; therfore requireth a new authoritie to meddle in it. For in this propheſie God dealeth with <hi>Iohn,</hi> as he did with the old prophets in like caſes. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wold foreſhew vnto any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he called them by glorious viſions, as we may read what a goodly viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> had:<note place="margin">Eſay 6.</note> what a viſion ful of glory <hi>Ezechiel</hi> had: &amp; what a viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> had,<note place="margin">Ezech. 1. Dan. 10.</note> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in maieſtie like vnto this which <hi>Iohn</hi> hath here. Thus then it is to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18003:10"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> now is as one of the old Prophets, to foreſhew things to come: therefore the Lord appeareth vnto him in viſion, and calleth him, and authoriſeth him therevnto, as he appeared vnto them &amp; called them. Let this then ſuffice for a reaſon of <hi>Iohns</hi> new calling to his new worke and office. And thus much tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the firſt circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the ſecond circumſtance, which is the time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> receiued this Propheſie, which is noted to be vpon a Lords day.<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.10.</note> It is the day which <hi>S.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> calleth the firſt day of the weeke: in which the Churches did meete for the holy exerciſes in religion: which is alſo euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaith they came together to breake bread. Now the obſeruation of a ſeuenth day is of diuine inſtitution,<note place="margin">Act. 20.7.</note> euen from the beginning. It is naturall, morall, and perpetuall: for God bleſſed the ſeuenth day, and ſanctified it. We are therfore to thinke, that although <hi>Iohn</hi> now in his exile was abſent in bodie from the church aſſemblies, yet he was preſent with them in ſpirit, commending them moſt earneſtly vnto God in his holy praiers, and meditations: and therefore it is ſaid, that hee was rauiſhed in the ſpirit vpon the Lords day. So we reade, that the like befell vnto <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 7.2. Ezec. 3.12.14.</note> when hee was priſoner in <hi>Babylon</hi>: the like alſo vnto <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who was taken by the ſpirit in the viſions of God, and carried to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>: The like to <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 10.10. 2. Cor. 12.2.</note> the like to <hi>Paul.</hi> But the ſpeciall reaſon of <hi>Iohns</hi> rauiſhment in the ſpirit at this time was, that thereby hee might be made more fit and capable to receiue and vnderſtand all thoſe great myſteries and heauenly viſions, which now ſhould be ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18003:10"/>
him. And withall, let vs obſerue, that all men are alwaies moſt capable of heauenly things, when they are moſt in the ſpirit: for God doth euermore moſt reueale himſelfe to ſuch as are moſt in praier, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and meditation; and to ſuch as make greateſt conſcience to ſpend his Sabaoths Chriſtianly, and religiouſly, according to his great commandement. And let vs alwaies be ſure of this, that the more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent &amp; zealous we are in religious duties, the more familiar acquaintance we ſhall finde with God, and he will at all times be the more open-hearted vnto vs, and will hide nothing from vs that may be for his glorie, and our good. For ſuch as are much in heauenly contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he doth recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not amongſt his ſeruants, but amongſt his deareſt friendes;<note place="margin">Iohn 15.15.</note> to whom he will make knowne all things that he hath heard of his Father. But now let vs proceed to the third circumſtance.</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance is the place where <hi>Iohn</hi> receiued this Propheſie, and that is ſet downe to be the Ile of <hi>Pathmos</hi>: which (as the Geographers write) is a litle deſart Iland lying in the Aegean ſea, wherein it is reported that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> about the yeare of our Lorde 96. and there receiued, and writ this booke of the Apocalyps: where note by the way, that there is no place ſo obſcure or vaſt, wherein a godly mind may not aſpire vp vnto heauen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a great largeſſe of ſupernaturall things: for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in priſon, <hi>Peter</hi> in a Tanners houſe, <hi>Paul</hi> in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſhippe receiued a ſuperabundant meaſure of grace, more to be eſteemed then all the golde of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18003:11"/>
                  <hi>India.</hi> Some write, that this Ile of <hi>Pathmos</hi> is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt the Ilands called <hi>Sporades,</hi> which lye ouer againſt <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Citie of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and was in the ſight both of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> ſo that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee as it were as middle ſeate or holy chaire, out of the which Chriſt preached by <hi>Iohn</hi> from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the whole world. And indeed the counſels of God are wonderful, and his goodneſſe vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which reuealeth ſo great myſteries to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as it were out of the Romiſh priſon, and Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall captiuitie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, <hi>Iohn</hi> declareth the cauſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the ſame Iland; for hee ſaith, he was there for the word of God,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.9.</note> and the teſtimonie of Ieſus Chriſt: that is, for the preaching and conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hiſtories doo report, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and by ſouldiers ledde to <hi>Rome,</hi> that hee might pleade his cauſe before the Emperour <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> who moſt ſauagely and cruelly condemned the innocent, and cauſed him to bee put into a caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of hotte boiling Oyle, out of the which when hee by miraculous prouidence eſcaped without harme, hee was carried and conueied into the Ile of <hi>Pathmos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But immediately after <hi>Iohns</hi> baniſhment, God met well inough with this perſecuting Emperour <hi>Domitian.</hi> For in the fifteenth yeare of his raigne hee was moſt cruelly and ſhamefully murthered by his owne ſeruants. And thus much for the third cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
               <p>Now it followeth to ſpeake of the fourth circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18003:11"/>
which is, the perſons to whom this propheſie is written,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.1.</note> and that is ſet downe in the firſt chapter and firſt verſe, to bee all the ſeruants of God. As many therefore as be the ſeruants of God, muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vnto this booke, heare it, reade it, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it: for to all ſuch it is dedicated by the holy Ghoſt, to all ſuch it belongeth, for all ſuch it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recorded.</p>
               <p>Some do falſely and fooliſhly imagine, that it was giuen onely to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that it might likewiſe bee giuen to ſome ſpeciall men, as to ſome great ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or deepe diuines, which could tell how to vſe it, and how to weld it. But wee ſee how groſſely they erre: for the holy Ghoſt ſaith, it belongeth to all the ſeruants of God. And moreouer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>1.11.</label> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and commaunded to write all the things which hee ſawe in ſundrie viſions in a booke together, and to ſend it to the ſeuen Churches which are in <hi>Aſia,</hi> becauſe the Lorde would haue it remaine in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect record vnto the vſe of the whole Church, both that the Church might haue the cuſtodie of this booke, and alſo that it might bee a faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto the ende of the world, that this booke was written and penned by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, of whoſe truth and ſinceritie the church had ſufficient experience.</p>
               <p>True it is indeede that there are but ſeuen chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches named, but vnder theſe ſeuen Churches all others are comprehended. It had bene an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite matter to recken vp all the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were then in the world, and to haue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18003:12"/>
opened their ſeuerall eſtates: therefore vnder theſe ſeuen Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and their particular and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall eſtates, the ſtate of the vniuerſall Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is laid open. I conclude therfore, that the whole doctrine of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Reuelation, appertaineth to the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt throughout all the world, and in all times and ages, ſince it was written and recorded. And that as all ſcripture is written for our inſtruction and comfort:<note place="margin">Rom 15.4. 2. Tim. 3.16.</note> and as all ſcripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by diuine inſpiration, is profitable to teach and conuince, &amp;c: ſo this booke of the Apocalyps is written for the ſpeciall comfort and inſtruction of the Church in theſe laſt daies. And ſo I do conclude this fourth point.</p>
               <p>The fift circumſtantiall point is, the end and vſe of this Propheſie, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>1.1.</label> which is to publiſh and blaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the things which muſt ſhortly come to paſſe, that is, all things propheſied in this booke, and to be fulfilled euen to the end of the world. And whereas he ſaith, that theſe things muſt come to paſſe, hee doth vs to vnderſtand how great the ſtableneſſe, and aſſuredneſſe of Gods determination is. For looke what things are foreappointed by Gods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate purpoſe, they are altogether vnchaungeable: for the Lord is God, and he is not chaunged. And he ſaith:<note place="margin">Mal. 3.6. Eſa. 46.10. Math. 24.35.</note> 
                  <hi>My determination ſhall ſtand, and all my will ſhall come to paſſe.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my word ſhall not paſſe.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt certaine, that euery particular thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this propheſie, ſhall bee fulfilled in Gods appointed time. For God hath diſcloſed theſe things to his ſonne Chriſt, not to the end he ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18003:12"/>
ſhut them vp againe in himſelfe, but that he ſhould ſhewe them forth to the godly, that the whole Church might fare the better by them. It doth then ſtand vs all vpon to enquire and ſearch into theſe things which muſt ſo ſhortly come to paſſe, that thereby wee may bee ſtrengthened and comforted againſt all future dangers. And Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Apoc. 22.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Beholde I come ſhortly. Bleſſed is hee that keepeth the words of the Propheſie of this booke.</hi> But how ſhall we keepe them except wee knowe them? and how ſhall wee know them except wee reade them, and ſtudie them? If therefore we meane to bee partakers of this bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wee muſt not onely eſteeme this booke to bee very profitable, but abſolutely neceſſarie for all the ſeruants of God to be exerciſed in. And if euer there were any time wherein it behoued to ſet forth, to vrge, and to beate in this doctrine to all the people of God, then is it chiefly neceſſarie to bee done in this our time. For this age of ours hath in the Popes kingdome, many ſharpe and quicke wits, which commend with maruellous praiſes both the Pope, and the Popiſh Church, and buzze into the eares of the common people, and vnlearned ſorte, many things cleane contrarie to the doctrine of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Ieſuites &amp; Prieſts are growne exceeding craftie and cunning. The Papiſts are rich, wealthy, and full of armour and munition. Poperie ſeemeth to make a head againe, and the Papiſts looke for a day. It ſtands vs then all vpon which loue Chriſt and his Goſpell, that wee ſhould be well appointed, and throughly armed againſt them. And for this purpoſe the Reuelation of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> is of great vſe &amp; neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:18003:13"/>As I ſaid before, ſo I ſay againe, that it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of our time, written to this ſpeciall ende, that by it wee might bee both fore-warned and fore-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. If wee doo conſider the whole matter of this booke, wee ſhall eaſily finde out the vſe and end of it. For the excellent matter of it doth argue the excellent ende and vſe of it.</p>
               <p>Now then, as concerning the generall matter of this booke, here are to bee founde very large and liuely deſcriptions of the moſt glorious perſon of Chriſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>1</label> and all his excellent offices, both of King,<note place="margin">Cap. 2. Cap. 3. Cap 7. Cap. 12. Cap. 7. Cap. 8.

Alſo of Gods mercifull prouidence for his Church, and moſt vigilant care ouer it in the middeſt of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.<note place="margin">Cap. 12. Cap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Cap. 9.</note> Here are ſet before our eyes very liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcriptions of the Churches deadly enemies; both of Sathan himſelfe, and his three great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Romaine Emperour, the Pope, and the Turke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 18. Cap 19. Cap. 14. Cap 20.</note>Here are ſet downe all their cruell perſecutions of the Church, and their vtter ouerthrowe in the ende. Here are deſcribed hell, death, the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the laſt iudgement. Here alſo the very kingdome of heauen is at large deſcribed, with all thoſe great rewards,<note place="margin">Cap. 21. Cap. 22.</note> infinite glory, and endleſſe felicitie, which remaine for all the faithfull worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that for as much as this Propheſie is of ſuch excellent contents, therefore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18003:13"/>
the vſe and neceſſitie of it muſt needes bee verie great. And for this cauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> is willed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>1.19.</label> to write the things which hee had ſeene, the things that were, and the things that ſhall come hereafter. By the things which he had ſeene, is meant that glorious viſion mentioned in the firſt Chapter, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>13, 14, 15, 16.</label> wherein Ieſus Chriſt did appeare vnto him in the middeſt of the ſeuen golden Candleſtickes, in moſt glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as is there deſcribed. And all this was in the Ile of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> where <hi>Iohn</hi> was firſt called, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to this worke, and therfore he is willed firſt of all, to record this viſion which hee had alreadie ſeene.</p>
               <p>By the things that are, hee meaneth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the ſeuen Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which were then the moſt flouriſhing Churches in the world, as they are deſcribed in the ſecond and third Chapters, and in them the eſtate of all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>By the things that ſhalbe, he meaneth all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of this booke, which were to bee fulfilled in their time, &amp; al thoſe ſtrange accidents, which ſhould come to paſſe in proceſſe of time, and the ſeuerall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church, euen vnto the end of the world. Thus we ſee how <hi>Iohn</hi> receiueth a preciſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from the ſonne of God, to write things paſt, preſent, &amp; to come, that they might ſtand in record vnto all poſterities, from generation to generation. Thus much touching the fift circumſtance, which is the ende and vſe of this booke.</p>
               <p>Now followeth to ſpeake of the laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18003:14"/>
point, which is the authoritie of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, which is ſtrongly confirmed from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, which is Ieſus Chriſt; and therefore it is called the Reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt, which God gaue vnto him. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>1.1.</label> And againe it is written: <hi>I Ieſus ſent mine Angell to teſtifie theſe things in the Churches.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>22 16.</label> Here wee ſee plainely, that Ieſus Chriſt the very ſonne of God, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> is the Author of this booke, for hee ſubſcribes his name vnto it, and ſets his hand and ſeale vnto it. Needes therefore muſt the authoritie of it bee very great, which commeth from ſo great a perſonage: for looke what dignitie and authoritie he is of, from whom the booke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, of the ſame dignitie &amp; authoritie is the booke it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>An other ſtrong argument to confirme the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of this booke, may be taken from the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Ieſus Chriſt in theſe words: <hi>I protest vnto euery man that heareth the words of the Propheſie of this booke,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>if any man ſhall adde vnto theſe things, God ſhall adde vnto him the plagues that are written in this booke. And if any ſhall diminish of the words of the booke of this Propheſie, God shall take away his part out of the booke of life.</hi> Here wee ſee how Ieſus Chriſt maketh the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of this booke equall to all other the Oracles of God, to the which it is not lawfull for any man to adde or detract vnder paine of condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much alſo for the authoritie of this booke, that S.<note place="margin">Cap. 1.1. Cap. 1.4. Cap. 1.9. Cap. 22.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> doth ſo often repeate, reiterate, and inculcate his owne name; I <hi>Iohn,</hi> I <hi>Iohn,</hi> I <hi>Iohn</hi>: I <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; I <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt; I <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine. Shewing by all theſe repetitions, how needfull a thing it was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18003:14"/>
that the faithfull ſhould bee throughly inſtructed who he was, euen one of the Lambes twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and therefore to be voide of all ſuſpition and doubt concerning the authoritie of this booke, and not once to imagine it to bee any inuention of man, or faigned deuice, ſith it was penned by ſo great an Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the authoritie of this Propheſie is confirmed by foure reaſons in the laſt chapter. The firſt is the affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Angell, who ſaith: <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Theſe words are faithfull &amp; true.</hi> The ſecond is the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the moſt high God himſelfe in theſe wordes: <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>The Lorde God of the holy Prophets ſent his Angell to ſhewe vnto his ſeruants the things which must ſhortly bee fulfilled.</hi> The third is the teſtimonie of Ieſus, who pronounceth them bleſſed which keepe the words of this Propheſie.

                  <hi>Bleſſed is hee that keepeth the words of his Propheſie.</hi> The fourth and laſt is the witneſſe of <hi>Iohn</hi> in theſe words: <hi>I am</hi> Iohn <hi>which heard and ſawe theſe things.</hi>

Surely wee muſt thinke there is ſome ſpeciall cauſe and reaſon of it. For the holy Ghoſt dooth not vſe to deale ſo much and ſo earneſtly in a matter, but vpon great cauſe. We may eaſily gather what the cauſe is. This booke painteth out the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the whole kingdome of the great Antichriſt, together with all Sathans cunning and ſleight therein, and for this cauſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath laboured eſpecially to weaken the credit and authoritie of this booke.

in olde time preuailed thus farre, that euen among ſome Churches of true Chriſtians, the authoritie and truth of it was doubted of. The holy Ghoſt did well foreſee this practiſe of Sathan, and therefore bringeth the moe reaſons for the confirmation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If the credit and authoritie of this booke ſhould neuer haue bene impugned, there needed not any ſuch ſpecial confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But now (God be thanked) there is no queſtion or controuerſie concerning the authoritie of this Propheſie. It is receiued as authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall by the common conſent of all the Churches. Almoſt all the auncient Fathers do acknowledge it to bee Canonicall. The new writers doo with one voice giue their conſent &amp; approbation vnto it. The Papiſts themſelues do acknowledge it to bee the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred &amp; vndoubted word of God, though of al ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they cannot endure it ſhould be medled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, becauſe it cutteth them ſo neare the bone. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, it may not be omitted, that God is called the Lord God of the holy Prophets, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>22. verse 6.</label> which proueth, that this Propheſie is of equall authoritie with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, which were of olde, in as much as the ſame God is the Author of it. And this booke is to be held in the ſame account with the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Prophets; for all things contained in it ſhall as certainly be fulfilled in their time, as theirs were. In <hi>Eſay,</hi> in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and in the reſt, we find many things, which the Lord ſhewed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before they came to paſſe. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo there be many things foreſhewed &amp; fore-propheſied in this booke, which in their time ſhalbe aſſuredly fulfilled. Nay, we ſee and know, that many things here fore-tolde,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18003:15"/>
are already fulfilled, &amp; ſome things are come to paſſe euen in theſe our daies. Hee that ſhall looke into the times that are paſt, ſince this Propheſie was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſhal finde that all things haue fallen out agreeable to the Propheſie of this booke. And ſurely if there were none other thing to perſwade vs touching the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie thereof, this might ſuffice, that euery thing hath fallen out iuſt and iumpe, as this Propheſie did foreſhewe. It is our great negligence, that we do not clearely ſee ſo much. And I do humbly entreate all the people of God to looke more diligently and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into it in all time to come. And thus much concerning the circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Now, as concerning the booke it ſelfe, it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly be deuided into three viſions, as it were into three generall parts. The firſt viſion is contained in the three firſt Chapters. The ſecond viſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the next eight Chapters following, from the 4. to the 12. Chapter. And the laſt viſion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in all the Chapters following, from the 12. to the ende.</p>
               <p>As concerning the firſt viſion, my purpoſe is not to ſtand much vpon it, becauſe it is plaine and eaſie to vnderſtand, and becauſe it containeth no Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of things to come, but onely openeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the Church at that time, &amp; alſo becauſe I haue alreadie touched the ſumme of it in handling the circumſtantiall points, I will therefore content my ſelfe with a very briefe opening and reſolution of it, beginning at the firſt Chapter.</p>

As Chriſt ſaith; <hi>the ſeuen ſtarres are the Angels</hi>; that is, the Miniſters of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen churches. Miniſters are compared to ſtarres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould ſhine as bright ſtarres in this darke world, both by life and doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is ſaid to hold them in his right hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he alwaies defendeth them againſt the malice &amp; fury of the world, which of all others is moſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly bent againſt them, and their fauorites. But let men take heed of ouer bold preſuming to pul the ſtarres out of Chriſts right hand, leaſt they ſmart for it. The world is very buſie this way, they thinke to wring them out of his hands; but alas poore ſoules they are not able, he holdeth them too faſt, who can pull them out of his right hand? If they continue bold and buſie this way, they may hap at laſt take a beare by the tooth, and peraduenture pull an olde houſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heads. An other reaſon why Chriſt is ſaid to holde the 7. ſtarres in his right hand is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he worketh by them, and their miniſtrie, as an Artificer with his toole in his right hande. The things which Chriſt hath done by theſe inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are glorious and admirable. For by the miniſtery of the Goſpell he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted many ſinners, &amp; ſaued many ſoules, then the which nothing can be more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18003:20"/>
honorable &amp; wonderfull: and therfore the word of God which is the Miniſters weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is compared to <hi>a ſharpe two edged ſword,</hi>

                     <hi>which came out of Chriſts mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now vnto all this may be added that Chriſt ſaith; <hi>he was dead, but now aliue,</hi> becauſe hee died, and roſe againe. And alſo that he ſaith; <hi>Hee had the keyes of hell and death</hi>: that is, authoritie and power ouer hell and damnation. For he hath abſolute power to open and ſhut, binde and looſe; and therefore it is written, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>3.7.</label> 
                     <hi>He hath the key of</hi> Dauid, <hi>which openeth, and no man ſhutteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> All this ſetteth forth the great power &amp; glory of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and all aimeth at this marke &amp; end, to commend vnto vs the authoritie of this booke, becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from a perſon of ſo great dignitie &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, it remaineth to ſhewe how <hi>Iohn</hi> was affected with this viſion, wherein Chriſt did ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly appeare vnto him: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>17</label> for he ſaith; <hi>When I ſawe him I fell at his feete as dead.</hi> Wherein hee ſheweth how greatly hee was amazed and daunted with the ſight of Chriſts moſt glorious perſonage. Hee was ſtriken with ſuch an aſtoniſhment &amp; feare, that there was almoſt no life, or ſpirit left in him, and all this was to humble him euen to the ground, in as much as by it, he findeth his owne weakeneſſe and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not capable of ſuch a ſight, ſo farre as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. It was no doubt profitable, or rather neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that this holy ſeruant of God, ſhould thus be humbled and made fit to receiue this reuelation with the greater reuerence from his great Lorde and maiſter. And alſo it maketh much for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, as appeareth, in that euery part of this viſion is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18003:20"/>
rehearſed in the Epiſtles to the Churches. But to conclude, <hi>Iohn</hi> being thus humbled and caſt downe in himſelfe, is comforted and raiſed vp by Chriſt, <hi>who laid his right hand vpon him, and willed him to feare nothing.</hi> For ſaith he: <hi>I am the firſt and the last,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>and am aliue, but I was dead, behold I am aliue for euermore.</hi> In which wordes hee dooth greatly cheare vp <hi>Iohns</hi> heart, and telleth him plainely, that this might and terrour of his perſon is bent onely againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enemies of his Church, nothing at all againſt the friends thereof: but contrariwiſe, that all this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and glorie, might and maieſtie, is wholy and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together for the good of his Church. Wherein wee may all clearely ſee and knowe to our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the ſame arme of God which caſteth down the wicked, raiſeth vp the godly: the ſame power wich woundeth them, healeth vs: the ſame hand which deſtroieth them, ſaueth vs: the ſame might and maieſtie wich hurteth them, helpeth vs. For whatſoeuer is in God, is wholly for his, and wholy againſt thoſe that are none of his.

               <p>The <hi>Exordium</hi> or entrance of euery Epiſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth two things; namely, the perſon to whom the Epiſtle is written, and the perſon from whom the Epiſtle is written.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is one &amp; the ſame in all theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles contained in theſe words: <hi>I know thy workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The narration containeth the matter of each E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth of commendations and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; of admonitions, reprehenſions, threats and promiſes.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of euery Epiſtle, is one and the ſame, in theſe words: <hi>Let him that hath an eare heare what the ſpirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning the perſon to whom theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are ſent, he is named in the beginning of euerie Epiſtle, <hi>To be the Angel of ſuch a Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this word Angel, he meaneth not the inuiſible ſpirits which we call the Angels of heauen; for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18003:21"/>
things attributed to theſe Angels, can in no wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the inuiſible ſpirits, as to be Angels of ſeueral churches: to be neither hotte nor cold, to leaue their firſt loue, to repent and amend, and ſundry ſuch like attributes throughout all theſe Epiſtles. But by the word Angell, he meaneth the Miniſter or Paſtor of euery church: which therefore is called an Angell, becauſe he is the Miniſter of God, as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth: As alſo becauſe euery faithfull Miniſter ought to be receiued and regarded as an Angell of God, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth of the Galathians, that <hi>they receiued him as an Angell of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.14.</note> 
                  <hi>yea as Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> And he giueth many admonitions in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to this effect: for hee would haue all faithfull and painfull Miniſters to be greatly reuerenced and had in double honour: to be acknowledged,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17. 1. Theſſ. 5.12. 1. Cor. 16.18. 1. Cor. 16.10. Phil. 2.29. Tit. 3 13.</note> &amp; had in ſingular loue for their workes ſake: to be cared for, to be made much of, and to want nothing. For indeed a good Miniſter is a Iewel of price. A good Miniſter is as a friend in court, which we ſay is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then penny in purſe. A good Miniſter is like a candle, which ſpendeth it ſelfe to giue light to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. A good Miniſter is like a cocke, which by the clapping of his wings awaketh himſelfe, and by his crowing awaketh others. For a good Miniſter by his priuate ſtudies, praiers, &amp; meditations, awaketh him ſelfe, and by his publike preaching awaketh others.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture affirmeth a good Miniſter to be the very glory of Chriſt. And againe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.23.</note> that a good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is a ſingular bleſſing of God. For the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith; <hi>I will take you one of a citie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and two of a tribe, and will bring you to Zion: and I will giue you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18003:22"/>
Paſtors according to my heart, which ſhall feede you with knowledge &amp; vnderſtanding.</hi> Now then, if a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter be ſo great a bleſſing of God, and ſo peareleſſe a pearle, how great is the ſinne of thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them, and treade their Miniſtrie vnder foote, as vile and nothing worth. Our Lord Ieſus ſaith of all ſuch:<note place="margin">Luk. 10.16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> Let thoſe ſcoffers and ſcorners therefore take heede how they deſpiſe Chriſt, for aſſuredly he wil not long put it vp at their hands.</p>
               <p>If any man demaund a reaſon why all theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are ſpecially ſent and directed to the Angels or Paſtors of the Churches, ſeeing <hi>Iohn</hi> before, chap. 1. verſe. 11. is commanded to write them to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> I anſwer, that he writing to the Paſtors, excludeth not the Churches, but in them, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, he writeth to the whole Churches, as it plainely appeareth in the concluſion of euery Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, when hee ſaith: <hi>Let him that hath an eare, heare what the ſpirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> Then that which is ſpoken to the Angell of the Church, is ſpoken to the Church. The reaſon why the ſpeech is ſpecially directed to the Paſtor of euery church, is, becauſe the good or bad eſtate of the church, for the moſt part, dependeth vpon the Miniſter. For commonly we ſee it commeth to paſſe; Such a Paſtor, ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Such a ſhepheard, ſuch ſheepe: Such a builder, ſuch building: Such a husbandman, ſuch husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.9.</note> And as the Prophet ſaith: <hi>Like Priest, like people.</hi> For we may obſerue in all theſe Epiſtles, that where the Miniſter is commended, the people are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and where the Miniſter is diſcommended, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18003:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people are diſcommended alſo. So that they ſtand and fall, ſinke and ſwim together.</p>
               <p>As concerning the perſon from whom theſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are ſent, it is Ieſus Chriſt, who is very gloriouſly deſcribed of his diuerſe qualities in the entrance of euery one of theſe Epiſtles. Firſt, in the Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it is ſaid: <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that holdeth the ſeuen ſtarres in his right hand, and which wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the middest of the ſeuen golden Candlestickes.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the Epiſtle to the church of <hi>Smyrna: Theſe things ſaith hee that is first and last; which was dead, &amp; is aliue.</hi> Thirdly, to the church of <hi>Pergamus: Thus ſaith he which hath the sharpe ſword with two edges.</hi> Fourthly, to <hi>Thyatira: Theſe things ſaith the ſonne of God, who hath eies like a flame of fire, and his feete like fine braſſe.</hi> Fiftly, to the church of <hi>Sardis: Theſe things ſaith he that hath the ſeuen ſpirits of God, and the ſeuen ſtarres.</hi> Sixtly, to the church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it is thus ſaid of Chriſt: <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that is holy and true, which hath the key of</hi> Dauid, <hi>which openeth, &amp; no man shutteth, &amp; shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and no man openeth.</hi> Laſtly, to <hi>Laodicea</hi> it is thus ſaid: <hi>Theſe things ſaith</hi> Amen, <hi>the faithfull and true witneſſe, the beginning of the creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then wee doo plainely ſee how gloriouſly Ieſus Chriſt is deſcribed of his ſeuerall properties in euerie one of theſe Epiſtles, and what honourable and magnificent titles are giuen vnto him: and all to this ende, to moue attention, and to worke in vs a reuerence of ſo great a perſonage, that wee might more ſeriouſly regarde, and deepely ponder the things which proceede from ſo great a maieſtie. For we ſee and know by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experience, that almoſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18003:23"/>
euery mans words are heeded and regarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion &amp; reuerence which is had of his perſon. Sith then that euery one of theſe Epiſtles is fronted with this great authoritie; <hi>Thus ſaith the ſonne of God: Thus ſaith Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus ſaith</hi> Alpha <hi>&amp;</hi> Omega; therefore wee ought to giue diligent heede to the things herein contained. So likewiſe we reade in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, that after the holy Ghoſt had very notably deſcribed the perſon of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.4.5.</note> and extolled him far aboue the Angels &amp; all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hee giueth the vſe of it in the beginning of the ſecond chapter,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> ſaying: <hi>Therfore we ought to giue more diligent heede to his doctrine.</hi> And thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Exordium</hi> or entrance of theſe ſeuen Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, touching the perſon to whom, and the perſon from whom theſe Epiſtles are ſent.</p>
               <p>Now it followeth to ſpeake a word or two of the generall propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contained in theſe words; <hi>I know thy workes.</hi> We read in all theſe Epiſtles, how the Son of God doth praiſe ſome of the churches, &amp; diſpraiſe others: commend ſome of the Paſtors, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend others. Now, hee that will praiſe or diſpraiſe, muſt ſpecially looke to this, that he be vpon a good ground: and therefore Ieſus Chriſt before he enters into any praiſing or diſpraiſing, commending or reprouing, doth firſt proteſt that hee knoweth their workes, &amp; is priuie to all their particular actions, yea, their very thoughts, and therefore cannot erre or be deceiued in his cenſures. True it is indeed, that men may erre in their opinions &amp; cenſures of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not mens harts, &amp; with what affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions things are carried. Men I ſay, may praiſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18003:23"/>
too much or too little. But Ieſus Chriſt whoſe eies are as a flame of fire, and which ſearcheth the raines, cannot faile one iot, nor erre a haire breadth, as we ſay, either in comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or diſcommending, and therefore he ſtoppeth their mouthes at the firſt daſh, ſo as they can haue nothing to reply, when he ſaith: <hi>I know thy works</hi>; I know wel inough what thou art, &amp; what thou haſt bin; I am not deceiued in thee; I know thy ſitting downe &amp; riſing vp, &amp; am accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to al thy waies; And this briefly of; propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>The narration (as is aforeſaid) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Epiſtles, conſiſting of praiſes &amp; diſpraiſes, admonitions, reprehenſions, threates, and promiſes.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, we find that ſome churches are wholy commended, others wholy diſcommended: others partly commended, partly diſcommended. As for example, the Paſtor &amp; people of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> are generally comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for all things, and diſcommended for nothing; there is no fault found with them; that is, no groſſe fault, as in others: for they were not without commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corruptions and infirmities. The Miniſter of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was a very rare &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man, although a poore man to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For Chriſt ſaith thus vnto him: <hi>I know thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: but thou art rich</hi>; that is, rich in grace,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2 9.</note> and the manifolde gifts of the ſpirit. Thou haſt done great ſeruice to the church. Thou haſt imploied thy gifts to the good of many. Thou takeſt great pains in thy miniſtrie, &amp; art greatly bleſſed in thy labors: for thou haſt an excellent flocke, a notable good people, and therefore I cannot but greatly commend both thee and them. The Miniſter of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was alſo a very worthy and notable man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:18003:24"/>For although his gifts were not ſo great as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet was he very painefull and faithfull in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.8.</note> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt a litle ſtrength, and haſt kept my word, and haſt not denied my name</hi>: that is, thou art very conſtant in the profeſſion and practiſe of Chriſtian religion. And therevpon Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to bleſſe his labours. For ſaith hee: <hi>I will make them of the ſinagogue of Sathan which call themſelues Iewes, and are not, but do lye: Beholde I ſay, I will make them that they ſhall come and worſhip before thy feete, and ſhall knowe that I haue loued thee.</hi> Here we do plainely ſee how Chriſt promiſeth to bleſſe this mans mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, for his painefulneſſe and diligence, although hee was not of the greateſt gifts. For men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt gifts are not alwaies moſt bleſſed in their labors. For God doth commonly worke the greateſt things by weake meanes, that all glory might redound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and no fleſh might boaſt in his ſight. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, if men of greateſt gifts ſhould alwaies bee moſt bleſſed in their labours, and winne moſt ſoules vnto God, then wee would be readie to aſcribe that to men, &amp; their gifts, which is proper vnto God, and ſo this praiſe and glorie ſhould be ſomewhat eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thus wee ſee what excellent men the Miniſters of <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> were, and what excellent people they had in their charges. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the Paſtor and the people of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> are diſcommended for all things, and commended for nothing. Indeede the Miniſter of <hi>Sardis</hi> had a great name for learning and other good gifts, but he was growne very idle &amp; negligent, &amp; did little good with his gifts.<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.1.</note> Of whom it is ſaid: <hi>Thou haſt a name
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18003:24"/>
that thou liuest, but thou art dead.</hi> That is, there was no ſpirit in him, no life of grace, his gifts waxed ruſtie for want of vſe: hee was fallen aſleepe: he was fallen away from the grace of God: hee was nothing the man which he had bene. Therefore hee is admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to awake and ſtrengthen the things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, which were readie to die.</p>
               <p>The Miniſter of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> &amp; the people alſo, were growne luke-warme, neither hot nor colde;<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.16.</note> they were become careleſſe and ſecure, not caring great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which end went forward in Gods matters, ſo they might enioy the preſent profits and pleaſures of this life.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Paſtors and people of <hi>Epheſus, Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> they are partly commended, and partly diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. Theſe three were reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good Miniſters, &amp; had many good parts in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and tooke paines in their charges, although there be ſome faults found with them. For the Miniſter of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> is commended for ſixe things; for labour, for patience, for zeale, for wiſedome, for ſinceritie, &amp; for courage: but diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for leauing his firſt loue;<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.5.</note> that is, for reuolting, or ſomewhat going back, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed, for cooling in the loue &amp; zeale of God. The Miniſter of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> &amp; people alſo, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended for their conſtant profeſſion of the truth in the middeſt of manifolde troubles, &amp; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heate of perſecution. For the rage of the enemies grew ſo fierce againſt the profeſſion and profeſſors of the Goſpell, that <hi>Antipas</hi> the Paſtor of <hi>Pergamus</hi> (as ſome ſuppoſe) was put to death. For Chriſt ſaith thus of this church:<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou dwelleſt where Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s throne

               <p>But yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this church is found fault withal for ſome few things, that is, two groſſe faults: the one for ſuffering the doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> to be broached there by the inſtruments of Sathan: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they maintained the doctrine of the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans.</hi> The doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> did vphold the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of eating things ſacrificed to Idols,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.14.</note> &amp; of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fornication: for he taught <hi>Balac</hi> the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> thus to put a ſtumbling blocke before the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitanes</hi> did vphold the common vſe of women, that is, that women might be made common. Theſe two moſt groſſe and abſurd doctrines, were ſuffred and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the church of <hi>Pergamus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 2.19.</note>As concerning the church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> they are greatly commended for the loue and ſeruice to the church, for their faith, patience, &amp; manifold workes, and eſpecially for their conſtant proceeding in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and godlineſſe, and that with increaſe. For of this church it is ſaid; <hi>I knowe thy loue, and ſeruice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy workes, and that they are moe at the laſt then at the firſt.</hi> But this church is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended for ſuffering the wicked woman <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> (that is, a falſe Propheteſſe, which was craftily crept into this church) to teach &amp; ſeduce the people of God in that congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, teaching the ſame falſe doctrine that <hi>Balaa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> did at <hi>Pergamus</hi>:<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. Verſe 20.</note> which was, that it was lawfull to commit fornication, and to eate meates ſacrificed vnto Idolls. Hitherto concerning the praiſes and diſpraiſes of the churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:18003:25"/>Now followeth to ſpeake of the admonitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> hauing fallen from their firſt loue, is admoniſhed to remember from whence they were fallen, to repent, and to do their firſt workes. Alſo the church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> is admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and exhorted to ſtand faſt in the midſt of thoſe perſecutions &amp; troubles, which ſhould be raiſed vp againſt it, by the Emperour <hi>Traianus,</hi> and continue for the ſpace of tenne yeares. They are therefore exhorted and encouraged by our Lorde Ieſus, not to feare the things which they ſhould ſuffer: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the diuel and his inſtruments ſhould haue ſcope to perſecute and impriſon them for ten daies, that is ten yeares, according to prophetical account; yet if they did continue faithfull to the death, they ſhould haue the crowne of life. The church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> ſuffering and maintaining the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitanes,</hi> is admoniſhed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and amend. The Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which ſuffered the falſe doctrine of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> is admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to looke to her ſelfe, and to hold faſt the truth of Religion. <hi>Sardis</hi> being dull and dead, is admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to awake, and ſtrengthen the things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, that were readie to die. <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to holde that which they had, that no man take their crowne. <hi>Laodicea</hi> being neither hotte nor colde, but luke-warme, is admoniſhed to be zealous and amend. And although they thought their ſtate good inough, being puft vp with conceitednes, yet are they charged to be poore, naked and blinde, and therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> counſelled &amp; admoniſhed to buy ſpiritual gold, that they may be rich: and ſpirituall garments
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18003:26"/>
to hide their nakedneſſe and ſpirituall eye-ſalue, to annoint their eyes that they might ſee.</p>
               <p>Concerning reprehenſions, <hi>Epheſus</hi> is reproued for going backward. <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and maintaining corrupt doctrine, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath bene ſhewed. <hi>Sardis</hi> for dulneſſe, deadneſſe, and vnſoundneſſe in their manner of worſhipping God. <hi>Laodicea</hi> for lukewarmneſſe and conceitednes.</p>
               <p>Touching threats, <hi>Epheſus</hi> is threatned, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repent and do their firſt workes, their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke ſhould be remoued out of his place; that is, the Church ſhould bee tranſlated to ſome other place, but not deſtroied. For God doth remoue, but not deſtroy his Candleſtickes. <hi>Pergamus</hi> is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that vnleſſe they did ſpeedily repent, Ieſus Chriſt would come ſhortly, and fight againſt them with the ſword of his mouth. <hi>Thyatira</hi> is threatned, that except they repent them of their workes, they ſhould be caſt into a bed of affliction, and all their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourites ſhould be ſlaine with death. <hi>Sardis</hi> is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if they did not watch and awake, Chriſt would come ſuddenly vpon them as a thiefe, and they ſhould not knowe what houre hee would come.</p>
               <p>Concerning promiſes, they be very great &amp; large for euerlaſting ioy, and the very fulneſſe of glory is promiſed to all that fight the good fight of faith, and ouercome in the ſpirituall battell againſt the fleſh, the world, and the diuell. <hi>Epheſus</hi> is promiſed, that if they fight it out couragiouſly and conſtantly to the ende, they ſhould eate of the tree of life, which is in the middeſt of the paradiſe of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:18003:26"/>
                  <hi>Smyrna</hi> is promiſed in like caſe, that they ſhould not be hurt of the ſecond death. <hi>Pergamus</hi> likewiſe is promiſed to eate of the <hi>Manna</hi> that is hid, and to haue the white ſtone of victorie giuen them. <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> is promiſed to haue power giuen them to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Nations, &amp; to be lightned with heauenly bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, like the morning ſtarre. <hi>Sardis</hi> is promiſed to be cloathed with white aray; that is, with heauenly glorie, and to haue their name continued in the booke of life. <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is promiſed to haue a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar made in the Temple of God; that is, a firme and vnmoueable place of eternall glory. <hi>Laodicea</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſup with Chriſt, and to ſit with him vpon his throne for euermore.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee what great and precious promiſes are made to all Churches that fight and ouercome in this their ſpirituall battell and conflict.</p>
               <p>Concerning the concluſion, it is one &amp; the ſame to all theſe ſeuen churches. Wherein they are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſuch as haue eares to heare, ſhould heare, ponder, and conſider all the foreſaid praiſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſes, admonitions, reprehenſions, threates, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And it is therefore ſaid, ſuch as haue eares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are very fewe to be found that haue cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and ſanctified eares, to heare and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand heauenly things. This is proper to the elect, this is but, to whom it is giuen. And thus briefly and generally we ſee what was the preſent ſtate of euerie one of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> vnto which this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was to be ſent: ſo that by them we may ſee in what eſtate the vniuerſall Church militant was at that time. For as ſome of theſe ſeuen as yet ſtood
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18003:27"/>
firme, and others had much declined, ſo was it with all other churches.</p>
               <p>Hitherto concerning the firſt viſion, containing generally the inſcription of this booke: <hi>Iohns</hi> ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Churches: <hi>Iohns</hi> new calling: The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Chriſt which called him: And the preſent eſtate of the Church. Now we are to proceed to the ſecond viſion, contained in the next 8. chapters to the 12. wherein is ſhewed, what ſhould be the future eſtate of the Church in all ages, euen vnto the ende of the world.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words (<hi>After this</hi>) haue relation to the firſt viſion ſpoken of before, as if hee ſhould ſay, after I had receiued the former viſion, concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate of the Church, now I had an other viſion concerning the future eſtate therof; and therfore he ſaith, <hi>a doore was open in heauen,</hi> that he might come in and ſee al theſe things which ſhould be reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

                  <p>God for his admirable glory and beautie, is here compared to two moſt precious ſtones. The one which is the Iaſper, being of a perfect green colour,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18003:28"/>
as Philoſophers write: the other, which is the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, being of a moſt bright redde colour. Nothing can ſufficiently reſemble the glory of God, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit: But theſe things, being of the moſt pretious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, do after a ſort ſhadow it vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>There was a raine-bowe round about the throne, which may ſignifie, that Gods throne in glorie and beautie doth farre excell all other thrones of mortall Princes; yea, euen that of <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which was of moſt pure Iuorie: or rather it may ſignifie, that although God in himſelfe is moſt glorious and admirable, yet he keepeth promiſe &amp; couenant with the ſonnes of men. For the Raine-bowe was a ſigne of his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as appeareth, <hi>Gen. 9.</hi> and aſſuredly God will be mindful of his couenant to a thouſand generations. This Rain-bowe is ſaid to be like an emeraud, which is alwaies of a freſh greene colour, ſignifying that Gods couenant of grace and mercie towardes his Church, is alwaies freſh and greene, &amp; his goodnes towards his people perpetuall and vnchangeable.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, God is deſcribed of his glorious reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, &amp; heauenly company about him. For it is ſaid: <hi>Round about the Throne were 24. ſeates,</hi>

the Prophet in a viſion ſeeth foure beaſts, as it were bearing vp and drawing Gods chariot of triumphe. And at the 20. verſe he ſaith expreſſely, that he at laſt vnderſtood they were the Cherubins. The firſt and tenth chapter of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> being throughly looked into, do make this plaine. The reaſon why the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are called by the name of beaſts, is, becauſe in the next verſe they are compared to beaſts, for their qualities of certaine beaſtes.

For the things which fall out vpon the opening of the ſeuerall ſeales, do plainely declare, that all is meant of the particular matters contained in this preſent booke.</p>
               <p>This booke is ſaid to be in the right hand of him that ſitteth vpon the throne, becauſe all the ſecrets reuealed in it, come from the counſell and decree of the moſt high God, and are ordered by his meere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and prouidence.</p>
               <p>It is called a written booke, to ſhewe that the things contained in it, are ſo firmely decreed in the counſell of God, that none of them ſhall faile, but come to paſſe, and bee fulfilled in their ſeaſon. They are ſuch as wee may write of, as wee vſe to ſay: and therefore for the certaintie of them, they are here ſaid to be written in a booke.</p>
               <p>This booke is ſaid to bee written within and without, for the multitude and varietie of matters contained in it. For there were both many and great things which ſhould fall out in the world from the

               <p>This booke is ſealed with ſeuen ſeales, that is to ſay, perfectly ſealed, becauſe the things contained herein, are counſels and ſecrets, onely knowne to God, til it pleaſed him to reueale them to his church by his ſonne.

Such was his loue to the Church: ſuch was his zeale and care for the people of God.

               <q>Vpon this, one of the Elders ſaid vnto <hi>Iohn:</hi> Weepe not, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Here we ſee how <hi>Iohn</hi> is comforted and cheared vp by one of the Elders, being now very penſiue and ſad, and is willed to plucke vp a good heart, and to bee of good cheare, for hee could tell him good newes; to wit, of one that could open and expound this booke, and all the ſecrets in it, and that is Ieſus Chriſt, the great reuealer of ſecrets, and onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of all riddles, and hidden myſteries, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath bene ſpoken.</p>

               <p>He is compared to a Lyon, by alluſion vnto <hi>Iacobs</hi> words in his laſt will and teſtament concerning <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> namely, that <hi>hee ſhould couch as a Lyon,</hi>

               <p>Here <hi>Iohn</hi> taketh a view and ſight of Ieſus Chriſt, from the verie middeſt of the throne, &amp; of the foure beaſtes and the Elders.

               <p>This Lambe Chriſt, is here ſaid to haue <hi>ſeuen hornes,</hi> which ſignifie his manifolde power, or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of power, or perfect power, according as this metaphor or borrowed ſpeech of horne is vſually ſo taken in all the ſcriptures. This Lambe alſo is ſaid to haue <hi>ſeuen eies,</hi> which are interpreted to be the ſeuen ſpirits of God: that is, the manifolde graces and gifts of the Spirit, which hee giueth vnto his Church. Now then to conclude this point, for as much as the number of ſeuen in this booke is a number of perfection, and alwaies noteth perfection, therefore by Chriſts ſeuen hornes, and ſeuen eies, wee may, and that ſoundly, vnderſtand his perfect power, and his perfect ſight and knowledge in all things.

And to the end that he might be throughly awaked, and ſtirred vp to attention in ſo waightie matters, it is ſaide, that the voice of the Angell which ſpake vnto him, was like the voice of a thunder: So that hereby <hi>Iohn</hi> was throughly rowſed, fitted and prepared, to receiue theſe heauenly viſions.</p>
               <q>Therefore I beheld, and loe, there was a white horſe, <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>The white horſe</hi> is taken in this ſenſe in the 19. chapter of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; where our Lorde Ieſus beeing vpon this white horſe, beateth downe all his enemies before him: For who is able to reſiſt his worde, and the miniſtrie of it?</p>

In the 45. Pſalme the church the ſpouſe ſaieth thus to her beloued husbande Chriſt:<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>Gird the ſworde vpon thy thigh, ô thou mightie one, the ſworde of thy glorie and comely beautie, and with thy comely beautie ride on proſperouſly for the buſineſſe of truth, and of meeke righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in all theſe places of the ſcripture, wee do plainely ſee, that when Chriſt goeth about either to broach his Goſpell, or build vp his Church, or to be reuenged on the enemies thereof, hee is brought in on horſebacke. And this doth ſtrongly confirme and warrant this expoſition, ſeeing it is not any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined ſenſe, or new deuice of mans braine, but ſuch a ſenſe as other places of ſcripture will verie fully beare out.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if wee doo ſeriouſly conſider, and deepely weigh the purpoſe and intendment of the holy Ghoſt in all this, it will not a little helpe and further this expoſition. For the chiefe ſcope and drifte of all is, to deſcribe the ſtate of the Church from the Apoſtles time to the ende of the worlde. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>1.1.</label> For this Propheſie ſerueth to <hi>ſhewe vnto</hi> Iohn <hi>the thinges that must ſhortlye come to paſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, wee all knowe by bleſſed experience, that the firſt eſtate of the Church did conſiſt in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:18003:40"/>
the preaching of the Goſpell by Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and therfore this muſt needs be vnderſtood of that time &amp; eſtate of the church. For Ieſus Chriſt is he that ſitteth vpon this white horſe, that is, by the miniſtery of his Goſpell he conquereth and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the nations vnder him.</p>
               <p>There may bee three reaſons alledged why this horſe is ſaide to be of a white colour. Firſt, becauſe the doctrine of the Goſpell which was preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was pure and ſincere, being without all ſpots and blots of error and hereſie. For the white colour in the ſcripture doth ſignifie puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſinceritie, innocency, ioy, glory, and beautie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was full of ioy and comfort: As it is ſaide of <hi>Samaria,</hi> after <hi>Phillip</hi> had ſet the Goſpell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broache there,<note place="margin">Act. 8.8.</note> that <hi>there was great ioy in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the miniſtery of Chriſt and his Apoſtles was very glorious and beautifull, as it is written:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> 
                  <hi>How beautifull are the feete of them which bring the glad tydings of peace, &amp;c.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> 
                  <hi>with thy comely beautie ride on proſperouſly, for the buſineſſe of truth, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man demaund a reaſon of Chriſts ſitting on horſe-backe, and riding forth on horſe-backe: I anſwere, that it doth moſt fitly repreſent that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous ſwiftneſſe wherewith the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould be carried and ſpread, not only through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Iudea, Samaria,</hi> and Galile, but alſo through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the kingdomes of the world. For is it not a wonder, to conſider how ſwiftly, and as it were on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18003:41"/>
horſeback, and alſo how farre ouer the Heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, within a fewe yeares after Chriſts aſcention, the doctrine of the Goſpell was preached, and of multitudes imbraced. He rode forth indeed proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and ſwiftly vpon this white horſe, euen the miniſtrie of the Goſpell, for the buſineſſe of truth, and of meeke righteouſneſſe; and his right hande wrought fearefull things, as ſaith the Pſalmiſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is here ſaide, that <hi>Ieſus Christ hath a bowe in his hand.</hi> And in the 45. Pſalme, from whence it ſeemeth all theſe phraſes and ſpeeches are borrowed, hee is ſaide to haue <hi>sharpe arrowes in his hande,</hi> whereby he pierceth the heart of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Now this bowe and arrowes doo ſignifie the piercing power of the Goſpell, whereby the world hath bene ſubdued vnto Chriſte. For all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the Goſpell which Chriſt ſhooteth out of this bowe, which is euen the tongue of his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, doo ſticke in the hearts of men; yea, they pierce into all the ſecret places of the ſoule. For the miniſtrie of the Goſpell <hi>is liuely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and mightie in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſharper then any two edged ſworde, and entreth through, euen vnto the deuiding aſunder of the ſoule and the ſpirit, of the ioynts and the marrowe, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and the intents of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere is yet further mention made of a crowne which was giuen vnto Chriſt, and that <hi>hee went forth conquering, that hee might ouercome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This crowne ſignifieth the victorie which he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ouer the worlde with his bowe and arrowes. For the Pſalmiſt ſaieth: <hi>By thy ſharpe arrowes in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18003:41"/>
hearts of the kinges enemies, the people ſhall fall vnder them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade in the ſecond of the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that 3000.<note place="margin">Act, 2.37.</note> of the Kings enemies were at once ſhot thorough with this bowe, and theſe arrowes, and did fall vnder him. We reade of many other at other times, and in other places. For the Apoſtle ſaith plainely, that <hi>the weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but ſpirituall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>mightie through God to caſt downe holdes, caſting downe the imaginations, and euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how Chriſt and his Apoſtles and all their true ſucceſſors riding vpon this white horſe which is the miniſtery of the Goſpell, haue gone ouer all the worlde, conquering and ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that ſome doo expound this otherwiſe: but my purpoſe is not to meddle with other mens opinions, and iudgements, but to ſet downe that which God hath giuen me to ſee, and which in mine owne conſcience and perſwaſion, I ſuppoſe to be the truth, referring all to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church, and ſuch therein as are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſpirit of God. For <hi>the ſpirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is ſubiect to the Prophets.</hi> And be it knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men, that my chiefe indeuour throughout this whole booke, ſhall be to ſeeke the ſenſe that is, and not the ſenſe that is not: to meddle only with truth and let falſhood goe.</p>

So that as the firſt eſtate of the Church, vnder the preaching of the Goſpell, was ioyfull and peaceable; ſo this ſecond eſtate of the Church, vnder ſuch outragious perſecutions, was troubleſome and tragicall: and yet for all that, in the middeſt of all theſe ſwordes, bloud and flames of perſecution, the Church did ſtill preuaile and encreaſe.<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> For <hi>the bloud of the Martyrs is the ſeede of the Goſpell.</hi> And the Church oftentimes beeing ſowne in the bloud, yet ſpringeth vp, and groweth in bloud.

               <p>Now, all this is to bee vnderſtood of that moſt grieuous famine which wee reade to haue bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of the Lord, 316. and ſundrie times afterward. And all this for the contempt of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles vpon the white horſe, and the murdering of Gods Saints by him vpon the redde horſe, and his inſtruments. So grieuous and fearefull a thing is the contempt of the Goſpell, and the perſecuting of the Saints. And God did moſt iuſtly cauſe the worlde to ſmart for it, and make them with ſorrowe inough to feele the puniſhment of the Goſpell reiected.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had opened the fourth ſeale, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>7</label> I heard the voice of the fourth beaſt ſay: Come and ſee.</p>

               </q>
               <p>This pale horſe ſignifieth the peſtilence and other contagious diſeaſes, which God moſt iuſtly brought vpon the world for the contempt of the Goſpel, and the murthering of Chriſte and his Apoſtles, and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18003:44"/>
as I noted before out of the ſcriptures, that when God commeth either in mercy or iudgement, he is ſaid to come on horſebacke, to note his expedition, and ſwiftneſſe, both in the one and the other: ſo, as before Chriſt is vppon the white horſe, the diuell vpon the red horſe, famine vpon the black horſe: ſo here <hi>death and hell are ſaid to be vpon the pale horſe:</hi> for peſtilence and death maketh men looke pale: but being dead, hee ſaith hell followed. For aſſuredly hell doth alwaies followe the death of the bodie, excepting thoſe onely whom Chriſt hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from hell and damnation by the power of his death.</p>
               <p>Thus then it is: the redde horſe with blood, the blacke horſe with famine, the pale horſe with peſtilence, haue power giuen them ouer the fourth part of men, to murther, kill and ſlea, as all ſtories doe ſhewe, that for the reiecting of Chriſt and his Goſpell, theſe plagues were carried as it were on horſebacke, ouer a great part of the worlde. Now as touching this famine and peſtilence which fell out vpon the opening of the third and fourth ſeales, they are to bee referred vnto thoſe times eſpecially, wherein the Hunnes, Gothes, and Vandales, and other barbarous nations which were the waſters of the world, did waſte &amp; decaie the Romane Empire both farre and neare. Wherevppon grew this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſcarſitie, and peſtilence, and ſtraunge diſeaſes heere ſpoken of, about ſome 300. yeares after Chriſt, and ſomewhat more.</p>

               <p>Heere is diſcouered the ſtate of the Martyrs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, and the condition of the ſpirits of all iuſt and perfect men.

               <p>Here wee ſee plainely, that the ſoules of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs doo very vehemently crye for vengeance vpon theſe cruell tyrants which ſhead their bloud. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they crie for it ſpeedily, and ſeeme to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of delay. But it is to be obſerued, that they doo not this in any hatred, or priuate deſire of reuenge, in reſpect of any wrong or crueltie ſhewed to them; but in a very loue and burning zeale of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and glory of Chriſt, and whatſoeuer deſire they haue, it is wholy to that ende. Wherefore they are here vnder a figure brought in crying for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, rather to expreſſe what iudgement of God tarrieth for the cruell perſecutors, then to ſhewe what minde they beare towards them. For it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede their cauſe that cryeth for vengeance. And as <hi>Abels</hi> bloud: ſo theyr bloud cryeth aloude in the eares of the Lorde of Hoaſtes for reuenge.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee may not imagine or gather out of this loude crying of the Martyrs in heauen, that they haue any diſturbance, impatience, diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or any diſcontentment there. But this they do in a feruent deſire of that fulneſſe of glorie which they aſſuredly hope for and looke for in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all things, when both their ſoules and bodies ſhall be ioyned together.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:18003:45"/>And long white robes were giuen vnto euery one; <label type="milestone">

               <p>Theſe white robes do ſignifie that honour, glory, and dignitie, wherevnto not onely the Martyrs, but alſo all other faithfull beleeuers are aduanced in the chambers of peace: for ſo white robes are to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in ſundrie other places of this booke.<note place="margin">Chap. 3.18.

               <p>Now, as concerning the anſwere to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and crie, it was this, that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and haue patience for a little ſeaſon, (for the time remaining, to the ende of the worlde, was but as a day with God, and as a moment in compariſon of eternitie) and the reaſon of the delay is yeelded, which is this, that there were numbers of others, their bretheren in the worlde, which ſhould bee martyred and ſlaine for the truth, as well as they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Antichriſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the bloudie Turke, at and vpon the opening of the ſixt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth ſeale.

For now after the crie of the Martyrs for vengeance, GOD the auenger of the bloude of the righteous doeth ſhewe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18003:46"/>
himſelf from heauen, and declare his wrath in more fearefull manner then before, euen to the great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all the creatures in heauen and earth. So horrible a thing is the ſheading of the bloud of the Chriſtians. For now we ſee plainely, that God heareth the cries of his Martyrs, and commeth as a Giant, or as an armed man, to take vengeance of all their enemies. For <hi>Pretious in the ſight of the Lorde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.15.</note> 
                  <hi>is the death of his Saints</hi>: and hee is much mooued with the crie of their bloud, as here wee ſee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now threatneth to holde a generall Aſſiſes, wherein hee will make inquiſition after bloud, and arraigne and condemne all ſuch as are founde guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof: according as the perſecuting Emperours and many others, did finde and feele by wofull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For if God be angry but a little, who may endure it?</p>
               <p>Now, although the Stories do report, that in thoſe dayes, which was aboue 300. yeares after Chriſt, there were many great and fearefull Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in diuers nations and cities of the world: yet it is apparant, that the Earth-quake here ſpoken of, cannot bee taken literally, nor any of the reſt here mentioned. For there was neuer any time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it mentioned in any Chronicle, that euer the Sunne was as blacke as ſacke-cloth of haire; or the Moone turned into bloud; or the Starres fell from heauen; or the Heauens rolled together like a ſcrole; or that Mountaines and Ilandes were mooued out of their places. Therefore of neceſſitie all this muſt bee vnderſtood metaphorically; that is, that God did in ſo ſtraunge and fearefull a manner manifeſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18003:47"/>
his wrath from heauen by tumults, commotions, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, &amp; alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of kingdomes, as if theſe things of the Sun, Moone, and Starres, had bene viſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the eye. An earth-quake in this booke, and other bookes alſo of the ſcriptures, doth by a borrowed ſpeech ſignifie commotions of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, troubles, tumults, vprores, and great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſtates &amp; kingdoms. The darkning of the Sun, Moone, and Starres, &amp; rolling together of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, do by a metaphor in the ſcriptures, ſignifie the fearefull wrath and angrie face of God; which they being not able to endure, are ſaid here to bluſh at, to couer themſelues, to hide themſelues, to be aſhamed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to remoue out of their places, no more to do their offices, &amp;c. For as birds doo hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and thruſt their heads into buſhes when the Eagle commeth abroade: And as all the beaſtes of the forreſt doo tremble and couch in their dennes when the Lyon roareth: And as that ſubiect doth hide himſelfe, and dare not ſhewe his head, with whom the King is diſpleaſed: So here it is ſaide, that the whole earth doth tremble, and all the celeſtiall creatures are amazed and confounded with behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the angry face of God againſt the worlde, in ſo much that they do as it were, drawe a canopie ouer them, hide themſelues vnder a cloude, and ſurceaſe to do their offices.</p>
               <p>The darkning of the Sunne and Moone is taken in this ſenſe in the ſecond of <hi>Ioel,</hi> and alſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles.

all fleſh (which is to be vnderſtood of the plentifull preaching of the Goſpell in the Apoſtles time, and the aboundance of grace that was giuen with the ſame) addeth, that for the contempt of ſo great grace and mercie, he would ſhewe wonders in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aboue, and tokens in the earth beneath.

               <p>Euen ſo here, vnder the opening of the ſixt ſeale, God dooth threaten, that for the murdering of his ſonne Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and innumerable Chriſtians, hee would bring ſtraunge iudgements and extraordinarie calamities vpon the worlde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as all ſtories do ſhewe, that thoſe times were full of bloud-ſheads, commotions, famines, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and miſeries of all ſortes.

Thirdly, becauſe the kings and captaines of the earth here immediatly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, would neuer haue bene caſt into any ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and horrours vpon any corruption of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and the miniſtrie, as here we reade of. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly men are not any whit touched or moued with that, or ſuch like things. Laſt of all, becauſe the ſcope and drift of the holy Ghoſt, vnder the opening of this ſixt ſeale, is to deſcribe corporall, not ſpirituall; viſible, not inuiſible iudgements. For he doth order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of purpoſe; handle them in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, it ſheweth, that as God did moſt fearefully puniſh the world with viſible &amp; ſenſible iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as we haue heard before: ſo now he would ſet vpon them with inuiſible and ſpirituall plagues, which are of all other moſt grieuous and intollerable. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Theſe foure angels are angels of darkneſſe, or foure diuels, which is proued by this reaſon, that they holde the foure windes from blowing on the earth: that is, ſtop the courſe of the Goſpell, which is a ſpirituall plague.</p>
                  <p>They are ſaid to ſtand vpon the foure corners of the earth, becauſe power was giuen them to plague not ſome one or two countries, but the vniuerſall world, both Eaſt, Weſt, North and South.</p>
                  <p>The blowing of the windes, doth very fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the preaching of the Goſpell, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly inſpiration and breathing of the holy Ghoſt which goeth with it. Winde is ſo taken, <hi>Ioh. 3.</hi> where our Lord Ieſus ſaith; <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, &amp;c:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 4.16.</note> 
                     <hi>So is euery man that is borne of the ſpirit.</hi> And again in the 4. of the <hi>Cantic.</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Ariſe ô North, and come ô South and blowe on my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flowe out.</hi> Where it plainly appeareth, that the Church craueth the inſpiration of the ſpirit, that her fruites may abound: For what can be meant by theſe windes which ſhe wiſheth to blow vppon her garden, but the heauenly breathings of Gods holy ſpirit and word. It followeth then, that if the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the windes in the ſcriptures doo ſignifie the breathing of Gods grace, and holy ſpirite, that the ſtopping of the windes by a reaſon of the contraries
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18003:51"/>
doth here ſignifie the ſtopping of the ſame, and the depriuation of all heauenly bleſſings. So that it is cleare, that a ſpirituall plague is heere repreſented, which alſo is the more apparant, becauſe here is ſuch ſpeciall <hi>prouiſo</hi> and care had for the churches ſafetie, that it might not be infected with this ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now all this doth plainly fore-propheſie, not only the ſtopping of the courſe of the Goſpell: but euen the vtter taking of it away from the world, for their great contempt thereof, and the horrible mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering &amp; maſſacring of all the true profeſſors of it: according as it came to paſſe afterward in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing firſt of hereſies, and afterward of the Popiſh and Mahometiſh religion, as in the two next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters following ſhall plainly appeare.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>And I ſawe another Angell come vp from the Eaſt, <label type="milestone">

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>3</label> neither the trees, till wee haue ſealed the ſeruants of our God in their foreheads.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Angell is Ieſus Chriſt, who by the Prophet is called <hi>the Angell of the couenant.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> That Angels do repreſent &amp; ſuſtaine the perſon of Chriſt their head, is ſo common &amp; vſuall a thing in the ſcriptures, that I ſhall not neede to ſtaie in it.</p>
                  <p>That this Angell is Chriſt, it doth plainly appeare by the things heere attributed vnto him, which can agree to none other. Firſt, in that he hath the ſeale of

                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe examples do manifeſtly declare what tender care the Lorde in all ages hath had of his owne people, that they might be deliuered and ſet in ſafetie in the midſt of all extremities. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo heere we ſee that God is verie carefull, that his owne children might not be infected with thoſe damnable hereſies which now alreadie vppon the ſtopping of the courſe of the Goſpell beganne to be hatched, and afterward did ſpring and growe vp in the Church both thicke and three-folde.</p>
                  <q>And I heard the number of them that were ſealed, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>4</label> and there were ſealed an hundred fortie and foure thouſande of all the Tribes of the Children: Of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> were ſealed twelue thouſand, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>Now <hi>Iohn</hi> heareth the number of them that were ſealed, and hee reckeneth vp the whole Church militant, conſiſting both of the Iewes, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Hee ſaith, that <hi>of the Church of the Iewes there were ſealed 144000.</hi> Wherein he putteth a certaine number for an vncertaine, and a definite number for an indefinite: for his meaning is not that there were iuſt ſo many, and neither moe nor leſſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but this number doth ariſe of twelue times twelue, in that hee ſaith <hi>of euery Tribe twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande:</hi> for twelue times twelue thouſande make an hundred fortie and foure thouſand. Neither
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18003:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet may we thinke, that of euery Tribe there were an equall number ſealed, not moe nor leſſe of one Tribe then an other: but this number of twelue, is vſed as the perfect and full number; in as much as the Church of the Iewes was founded vpon the twelue Patriarkes: vnto which our Sauiour had reſpect, when for to gather the diſperſed and loſt ſheepe of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he choſe twelue Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Now here we are to obſerue, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the horrible perſecutions and calamities which fell out vpon the opening of foure of the ſeales; yet God had his Church euen of the Iewes, which in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of reaſon, a man would haue thought long ere now, had bene vtterly extinct and aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> But the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>God hath not caſt off his people which he had choſen</hi>: that is, vtterly caſt them off.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a moſt ſure and certaine poſition in diuinitie, that God hath alwaies his; that is, in all ages, in all times, in all places, in all countries, euen in the middeſt of all troubles and flames of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet God hath his hidde and inuiſible Church euen vpon the face of the earth.

                     <note place="margin">1 King. 19.18. Math. 27.</note> As was in Chriſts time, when <hi>the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard was ſmit, and the ſheepe ſcattered.</hi> And as it was in the daies of the great Antichriſt; as afterwarde wee ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is to be obſerued, that in the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the 12. Tribes, the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> is left out, and the Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> taken in. The cauſe of the omiſſion and skipping of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> was their continuance in Idolatrie from the time of the

This Tribe is alſo omitted in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Tribes mentioned 1. Chron. chap. 2.3.4.5.6.7. Then the reaſon of this omiſſion, is firſt their vnworthineſſe. And ſecondly, that there might be a place and roomth for the Tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in: which in this Catalogue, for ſingular reaſon, &amp; a ſpeciall myſterie, might not be pretermitted.

                  </p>

which afterward did inuade the Church in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing of errours and hereſies: yet <hi>Iohn</hi> heareth and ſeeth ſuch an huge number ſealed vp to ſaluation through Chriſt, both of the Iewes and Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>The Church of the Gentiles exceeding in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Church of the Iewes, are here ſaid <hi>to haue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whiterobes,</hi> in token of their puritie and innocencie; <hi>and Palmes in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,</hi> in ſigne of their victorie ouer the world, fleſh, and the diuell.

               <p>WE haue heard out of the ſeuenth Chapter how the diuels and their inſtruments, the Romaine Emperors, did ſtop the courſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.

So that the principall ſcope and drift of this chapter, is to ſhewe, that God for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Goſpel, and great indignities offered to the true profeſſors thereof did giue vp the worlde to blindneſſe, to errour, to ſuperſtition and hereſie: and as the Apoſtle ſaith;<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Becauſe they receiued not the loue of the truth, therefore God ſent them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue lies.</hi> For, as before we haue heard how the worlde was moſt fearefully puniſhed with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18003:55"/>
externall plagues and iudgements: So here we are to vnderſtand how the ſame was puniſhed with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſpirituall and internall, as formerly hath bene ſaid, vpon the ſtopping of the foure windes. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that ſpirituall plague was very great, yet theſe ſpirituall plagues which follow vpon the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeuenth ſeale, are farre greater. For now we are to heare and vnderſtand, not onely of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſies, whereby a way and paſſage was made by degrees, as it were by certaine ſtaires, for Antichriſt to climbe vp into his curſed chaire, and to take poſſeſſion thereof: but alſo wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of his very tyrannie and kingdome it ſelfe: and alſo of the kingdome of the Turke, and the laſt iudgement. For the things contained vnder the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeuenth ſeale, do reach vnto the ende of the worlde. For the booke ſealed with ſeuen ſeales containeth all the whole matters which were to bee reuealed.</p>
               <p>This chapter containeth foure principall things, as it were the foure parts thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the reuerent attention and ſilence, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, before the execution of theſe moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable plagues, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>2.3.4.5.</label> the Church is remembred and ſet in ſafetie with all her children, by her great mediator Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>6</label> which commeth forth at the blowing of the ſeuen trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets by ſeuen Angels.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the vengeance it ſelfe contained in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18003:56"/>
preuailing of errour and hereſie: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>7.8.9.10.11.12.13.</label> the falling away of the Paſtors of the Church, and the vniuerſall darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that followed therevpon.</p>
               <q>And when hee had opened the 7. ſeale, there was ſilence in heauen about halfe an houre.</q>
               <p>By heauen in this place he meaneth not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory after this life: but by heauen is meant the Church here vpon earth: as it is ſo taken, chap. 12. verſe 1. and chap. 14. verſe 2. There may bee three reaſons yeelded, why the church is called hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the birth thereof is from heauen; for <hi>it is borne of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>the conuerſation therof is in heauen,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, that our Lorde Ieſus in his Goſpell dooth ſo often call his viſible Church <hi>the Kingdome of heauen</hi> by a trope,<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> becauſe Chriſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his raigne in the faithfull therein, whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he tranſlateth actually into the very kingdome of glory.</p>
               <p>By ſilence here is meant the great attention of the church, becauſe great things were now in hand. For now vpon the opening of the 7. ſeale, farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters are threatned then any before: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church doth liſten vnto them in deepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; as it were in horror and trembling through
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18003:56"/>
admiration: for now there appeare ſuch dreadfull iudgements of God to be executed vpon the earth, that all the heauenly company are aſtoniſhed, and amazed to behold it, and do as it were quake and tremble to thinke vpon it. For as when heauie newes commeth downe from the Prince, to bee proclaimed in open markets, all good ſubiects doe liſten and giue eare with ſilence and trembling: ſo it fareth in this caſe.</p>
               <p>By halfe an houre, hee meaneth that ſhort time, wherein the minds of the godly were prepared, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſpoſed, wiſely to conſider of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to make good vſe of them. I know right well, that this Verſe is farre otherwiſe interpreted of ſome: but I take this to bee moſt ſound, and ſimple, and beſt agreeing to all that followeth: for the next Verſe is ioyned vnto this by a coniunction copulatiue, to note a coherence of the matter, and to draw the ſenſe together: for he ſaith. <hi>And I ſaw 7.</hi>

               <p>Theſe ſeuen Trumpets ſignifie, that God would proceede againſt the worlde in fearefull hoſtilitie, and come againſt it as an open enemie vnto battell, proclaiming open warre againſt it, as it were with ſound of Trumpet and Dromme, ſetting vp the flag of defiance againſt it. And hereupon groweth this ſilence and trembling in the Church, which onely is mooued with the ſignes of Gods wrath,<note place="margin">Chap. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe Angels are propounded as 7. in number, becauſe it pleaſed not God at once to powre downe his wrath vpon the rebellious worlde, but at diuers times, and by peecemeale.</p>

               <p>Moreouer, it is ſpecially to be obſerued, that the blowing of theſe ſeuen trumpets, doo all belong to the opening of the ſeuenth ſeale, and are as it were the ſeuen parts thereof: for the things which fall out vpon the blowing of theſe ſeuen trumpets, do reach euen vnto the laſt iudgement, as the Angell ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, chap. 10.6.7.</p>

               <p>We heard before, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the courſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was ſtopt by the diuell and his inſtruments, yet God was very carefull for the ſafetie and ſealing vp of his owne ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: ſo likewiſe we are now to heare of the like care and prouidence. For now, that errors and hereſies were to be ſowne in the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18003:57"/>
many were corrupted: and that he himſelfe from heauen dooth proclaime open enmitie againſt the deſpiſers of his Goſpell, by giuing them vp to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and error: hee doth double his care and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to all his faithfull worſhippers. For here wee do plainely ſee, that the Church hath a mediator, and that he which keepeth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth. And therfore when the wrath of God doth moſt of all breake forth vpon the world for the contempt of his graces, yet the Church is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and ſet in ſafetie, with all her children. For her praiers come vp before God, and are accepted through the ſame mediator. And this is the ſenſe and drift of this third verſe.</p>
               <p>By this Angell is meant Ieſus Chriſt, the Angell of the couenant, as we haue heard before: who is not an Angell by nature, but by office.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt, that in the olde lawe there was a golden Aultar, and a golden Cenſor, in which the Prieſt did burne ſweete incenſe before the Lorde, which did figure the mediation of Chriſte, in whome the prayers of the Saintes are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Now heere the holy Ghoſt alludeth to that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing Prieſt-hood of the olde Teſtament, where incenſe was offered at the Aultar, which now is the ſweet ſauour of the death of Chriſt, through whom both we and all our ſacrifices are ſeaſoned &amp; ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Who therefore is this Angell but Chriſt? Who is the golden Aultar but Chriſt? What are the ſweete odours with the which the prayers of all Saintes
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18003:58"/>
come before God, but the moſt ſweet mediation of the Lord Ieſus? What is meant by the ſmoake of the odours, which with the praiers of the Saints, went vp before God out of the Angels hand? Surely the ſweete incenſe of Chriſts mediation, wherwith our praiers are ſpiced and perfumed, that they might be as ſweete ſmelling ſacrifices in the noſthrils of God. For, as water caſt into a fire, raiſeth a ſmoake: ſo the teares of the faithfull, beſprinkeled in their praiers, make them as ſweete incenſe, acceptable to God through Chriſt. The ſumme of all is this, that in the midſt of all theſe hereſies, and thoſe helliſh troubles which ſhould be raiſed vp by the Pope &amp; his Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, the Turke and his armies, as in the next chapter wee ſhall ſee, the elect haue their praiers heard for their preſeruation by the merits of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Here we ſee how Ieſus Chriſt taketh the Cenſor and filleth it with the fire of the Aultar; that is, the graces and gifts of the ſpirit: for ſo the fire of the Aultar is taken in <hi>Eſay.</hi>

               <p>The holy Ghoſt is compared to fire, becauſe hee
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18003:58"/>
burneth out our droſſe, purgeth the hearts of the faithfull, and ſetteth them on fire with the burning loue and zeale of Gods glorie. So then it followeth, that as before there was prouiſion had for the ſafetie of the Church, by her Mediator: ſo here many heauenly giftes and graces are beſtowed vpon her. For Chriſte caſteth this fire of the Aultar vpon the earth; that is, vpon his elect dwelling in the earth.</p>
               <p>Herevpon it is ſaide, that there were voices and thundrings, &amp;c. that is, all manner of broiles, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, vprores, ſlaughters, and diuiſions. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Goſpell was ſounded forth in the Church by the power of the holy Ghoſt, the diuell is diſturbed, and the worlde moleſted. And hence ſpring all theſe broiles and tumults, thundring and lightning: and wee muſt looke for ſuch ſtirres after the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, whileſt there is a worlde and a diuell.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Lord Ieſus ſaith, <hi>hee came not to bring peace into the earth, but fire and ſworde, and to ſette a man at variance againſt his father,</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>11</label> for it is called <hi>Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi> becauſe through the fall of it, the ſweete
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18003:60"/>
waters into which it fell, were turned into bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and men died of them: that is, the pure doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was corrupted, which turned to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many.</p>
               <q>And the fourth Angell blewe the Trumpet, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>12</label> and the third part of the Sunne was ſmitten, and the third part of the Moone, and the third part of the ſtarres, ſo that the third part of them was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>This darkning of the Sunne, Moone, and ſtarres, doth ſignifie that great darknes which was brought vppon the Church by ſuch teachers as did daily more and more degenerate.</p>
               <p>Three things are generally to be obſerued in the blowing of theſe firſt foure trumpets.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the plagues here mentioned, are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be vnderſtood of ſpirituall plagues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there is a progreſſion from leſſer to greater in theſe plagues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that in euery one there is mentioned but a third part deſtroyed; which plainly ſheweth, that although the Church was greatly annoyed and peſtred with theſe errors and hereſies, yet it was not deſtroyed and brought to vtter deſolation: for the full ſetting vp of Antichriſt was not yet come. All theſe errors and hereſies which were thus caſt vpon the world, and did ſpring and grow apace in all places, did (as it were) make way for Antichriſt, and (as it were ſtirrops) hoiſt and helpe him vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his curſed chaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:18003:61"/>By the ſtories of the Church, and courſe of times, it ſeemeth that the holy Ghoſt pointeth at thoſe manifolde hereſies which ſprung vp in the Church after the firſt three hundred yeares, eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, who procured peace to the Church, deſtroied Idolatrie, and ſet vp true religion in his daies.</p>
               <p>Now, after his raigne, and the raigne of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> that good Emperour, <hi>Constantius, Iulianus, Arcadius, Honorius,</hi> and many other wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſucceeded; by whoſe meanes all thinges in the Church grew worſe and worſe: yet this one thing is to bee obſerued, that all truth of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not vtterly extinct and put out, till the full looſing of Sathan, which was a thouſand yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, as wee ſhall plainely ſee when wee come to the 20. chapter, concerning the binding of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than for a thouſand yeares. For ſure it is, that the maine principles and groundes of Religion, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church till this full looſing of Sathan; which was about the time of Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> the ſeconde, that monſter, as afterwarde wee ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>But now in the meane time, wee ſee what here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſprung vp, what corruption grew and encreaſed more and more, what darkneſſe began to ouerſpread a third part of the world: &amp; theſe things grew worſe and worſe, euen vntill by theſe meanes the great Antichriſt came to bee poſſeſſed of his curſed ſeate and Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was about ſome 600. yeares after Chriſt.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:18003:61"/>And I behelde, and heard one Angell flying in the middeſt of heauen, ſaying with a loud voice: Woe, woe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>13</label> woe to the inhabitants of the earth, becauſe of the ſounds to come of the three Angels which were yet to blowe the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets.</q>
               <p>Becauſe the iudgements which were to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereafter, vpon the blowing of the next three trumpets, were farre more dreadfull and horrible then any that went before: therefore here is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Angell or meſſenger of God, ſent of purpoſe to giue warning thereof, and to proclaime openly in the Church, three fearfull woes, which ſhould come vpon the inhabitants of the earth; that is, all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men, as worldlings, Papiſts, and Atheiſts, at ſuch time as the next three Angels ſhould blowe the trumpets.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe three great woes, is to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Papacie. The ſecond of Turciſme. The third of the laſt iudgement. As if hee ſhould haue ſaid: Woe vnto the worlde, becauſe of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Woe vnto the worlde becauſe of Turciſme. Woe vnto the world becauſe of the laſt iudgement. Woe vnto the worlde for Poperie, becauſe thereby men ſhould be puniſhed in their ſoules. Woe vnto the world for Turciſme, becauſe thereby thouſands ſhould bee murdered in their bodies by the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh armies. Woe vnto the world, becauſe of the laſt iudgement, for thereby all worldlings ſhall bee plagued both in body and ſoule in hell fire, for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:18003:62"/>Sith then theſe three laſt plagues which were to come vpon the worlde, are more fearefull and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible then any of the other foure, no maruell though here is ſent of purpoſe a ſpeciall meſſenger to giue intelligence thereof, that euery man might looke to himſelfe, ſeeing ſuch great dangers were at hand.

               <p>THe principall ſcope and drift of this Chapter, is to paint out both the Pope and his Cleargy, and alſo the kingdome of the Turke, and his cruell armies. For hauing alreadie ſet downe how a way and paſſage was made for the Pope to climbe vp into his curſed chaire by the preuailing of hereſies, the falling away of the Paſtors of the Church, and the great ouerſpreading of darkneſſe &amp; ignorance: now hee commeth to deſcribe the Pope in his full height and greateſt exaltation, being now vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhop, and in full poſſeſſion of his ſeate and ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was about ſome ſixe hundred yeares after Chriſt, as formerly hath bene ſhewed.

               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:18003:62"/>This ninth Chapter may very fitly be diuided into two partes.<note place="margin">In the firſt 12. verſes.</note> The firſt is a liuely deſcription of the Pope himſelfe, his kingdome, and his cleargie. The ſecond, is a deſcription of the kingdome of the Turke, and his moſt ſauage armies:<note place="margin">In the laſt 9. verſes.</note> ſo that this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a full opening of the firſt two great woes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, concerning the Papacie, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme.</p>
               <q>And the fift Angell blew the trumpet, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>1</label> and I ſawe a ſtarre which fell from heauen, and to him was giuen the key of the bottomeleſſe pit.</q>
               <p>Warning was giuen before, that when this 5. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſhould blowe the trumpet, a moſt fearefull woe ſhould come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world, ſurpaſſing all that went before, which is the ſetting vp of Antichriſt in his pride; that man of ſinne, that ſonne of perdition.</p>
               <p>The Pope is here compared to a ſtarre, as well as other godly Miniſters in this booke, becauſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt were godly and excellent men: for amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the firſt thirtie of them, there were ſome Martyrs. But it is here ſaid, that now this ſtarre was fallen from heauen vnto the earth; that is, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were greatly degenerated &amp; fallen cleane away from heauenly things to earthly: for they declined from time to time, &amp; grew worſe and worſe, ſo farre as to become the great Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay, why may not this ſtarre falling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen vnto the earth, be vnderſtood of other Paſtors falling from the truth, as well as the Pope, as it is taken in the former chapter, &amp; in the 12.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18003:63"/>
chapter, verſe 4. I anſwere, that the circumſtances will not here beare it. Therefore to perſwade euery honeſt mans conſcience, that this muſt needs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Pope in his pride, let vs giue eare to thoſe three reaſons following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wee are to conſider, that the maine drift of the holy Ghoſt in the opening of the ſeuen ſeales, and blowing of the ſeuen trumpets, is to lay out the ſtate of the church in all ages, till the comming of Chriſt. Further, wee are diligently to obſerue, that the things contained vnder the opening of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth ſeale (wherof the blowing of the ſeuen trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets are as it were parts, and do all belong vnto it) do ſtretch euen vnto the ende of the worlde; ſo as there is no ſtraunge accident, or any wofull condition of the Church in any age, but it is ſet forth vnder the opening of theſe ſeales, and blowing of theſe trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. But the Papacie was a ſtate of the Church, and that moſt wofull and lamentable, therefore it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnder the opening of theſe ſeales, and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe trumpets. But it is not deſcribed vnder the opening of any other ſeale, or blowing of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trumpet: therefore of neceſſitie it muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this ſeuenth ſeale, and fift trumpet: And this is my firſt reaſon. If any man obiect, that the Pope and his kingdome are moſt liuely deſcribed in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the 12. to the laſt: I anſwere, that all thoſe chapters belong to a new viſion, wherin ſome things propounded vnder the opening of the ſeuen ſeales, are more fully opened &amp; expounded. But this I ſay, that in this 2. viſion, the whole eſtate of the Church in euery age is laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen vntil the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18003:63"/>
and therfore when the 7. Angel here doth blow the 7. trumpet, immediatly followeth the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; as appeareth, cap. 10. ver. 6.7. &amp; cap. 11. ver. 15.16.</p>
               <p>My ſecond reaſon is drawne from the courſe and conſideration of times: for the great preuailing of errors and hereſies mentioned before, which made way for Antichriſt, was from the firſt 300. yeares, vntill the 600. yeare, and ſo forwarde. But now, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vpon this great encreaſe of error &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ, commeth the deſcription of a ſpeciall ſtarre fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from heauen at this time, which was about 600. yeares after Chriſt, and therfore it muſt needs be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Pope. And this is my ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p>My third and laſt reaſon is drawne from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Pope and his Cleargie in the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen verſes of this chapter. For he is ſo liuely deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed &amp; painted out in particulars, that all men that know him, or euer heard of him, muſt needes ſay it is he. For this deſcription here ſet downe by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, can fitly agree to none other.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts themſelues do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that this ſtarre here mentioned, muſt needs be vnderſtood of ſome Arch-hereticke. And full wiſely forſoothe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin.</hi> But wee affirme, that it is to be vnderſtood of the Pope: For was there euer any ſuch Arch-hereticke as he? <hi>which oppoſeth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelfe againſt all that is called God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.4.</note> and againſt all imperiall powers, as the Apoſtle ſaith. But now let vs proceed to the deſcription of him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he is ſaid to haue the keie of the bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pitte, which agreeth well to the Pope: for hee hath power giuen him to open hell gates, to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18003:64"/>
let in thouſands thither: but no power to open hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen gates, to let in any thither: for he furthereth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to hell, none to heauen. Hee doth indeed falſely challenge vnto himſelfe the keies of the kingdome of heauen, to let in, and ſhut out at his pleaſure. But here wee ſee the holy Ghoſt doth attribute no ſuch power vnto him, but onely telleth vs, that his power and iuriſdiction is in hell, and ouer hell, &amp; as for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he hath nothing to do with it. It were needleſſe to ſhewe how this metaphor of keies is taken for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and iuriſdiction in the ſcriptures, as hath bene proued before, cap. 1. ver. 18. &amp; as needleſſe to proue that by the bottomeleſſe pit, is here meant hell, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, chap. 11.7. chap. 20.1.</p>
               <q> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>2</label> And hee opened the bottomeleſſe pit, and there aroſe the ſmoake of the pit, as the ſmoake of a great furnace, &amp; the ſunne and the aire were darkned by the ſmoake of the pit.</q>
               <p>Here we ſee how the Pope openeth hell gates with his key, &amp; a moſt horrible, groſſe, &amp; ſtinking ſmoake aſcendeth vp into the ayre preſently vpon it, in ſo much, that both the Sunne &amp; the aire were darkned with it. Which all is to bee vnderſtood of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual darkneſſe, ignorance, ſuperſtition, and Idolatry, wherewith the whole church was ouerſpread, after the great Antichriſt came to the poſſeſſion of his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed chaire, &amp; was in his pride &amp; height, ruling &amp; raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer the kings of the earth. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed the ſun was darkned and eclipſed; that is, the light of the Goſpell was almoſt cleane put out. For that which is ſpoken here of the darkning of the aire &amp; the Sun, is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18003:64"/>
to be vnderſtood of a greater and more general dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then that which was mentioned in the former chapter, wherein but a third part of the worlde was darkened. But now that Antichriſt inuadeth the church, all is ouerſpread with groſſe and palpable darkneſſe, all is as darke as pitch: no man can ſee where he is, or which way hee goeth. For the whole aire is filled with this moſt odious and thick ſmoake, which came out of hell pit.</p>
               <q>And there came out of the ſmoake Locuſts vpon the earth, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>3</label> and vnto them was giuen power, as the ſcorpions of the earth haue power.</q>
               <p>By theſe Locuſts, is meant the Popes Cleargie, as Abbots, Monkes, Friers, Prieſts, Shauelings, &amp; ſuch like vermine; which are therefore compared to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, becauſe they waſte and deſtroy the Church, euen as Locuſts deſtroy the fruites of the earth. For both Hiſtoriographers &amp; trauellers do affirme, that whole fieldes of greene corne new come vp, haue bene waſted and eaten vp in one night as bare as the earth, by ſwarmes of Locuſts in the Eaſt-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. For in thoſe parts of the world,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> multitudes of this litle vermine are to be found: euen ſo the Popiſh Cleargie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumeth and deuoureth all greene things in the Church.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is to bee noted, that theſe Locuſts came out of the ſmoake of the pit; that is, they were bred out of it: for Monkes, Friers, Prieſts, &amp; ſuch like caterpillers, were bred of ignorance, error, hereſie, ſuperſtition, &amp; the very ſmoake of hell: for from hell
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18003:65"/>
they came, &amp; to hell they wil. They are diſcended of the black houſe of hell, &amp; thither they will returne.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is ſaid, that power was giuen them to ſting like ſcorpions. For whom haue they not ſtung with their moſt venemous ſtings? I mean their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable errors, and diueliſh deuices. Whom haue they not wounded with their corrupt doctrine, &amp; diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh authority? They are the ſoreſt ſoule-ſtingers that euer the world had, who haue left their venimous ſtings in the ſoules of thouſand thouſands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they haue bene poiſoned and ſtung to death.</p>
               <q> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>4</label> And it was commaunded them, that they ſhould not hurt the graſſe of the earth, neither any greene thing, neither any tree, but onely thoſe which haue not the ſeale of God in their foreheads.</q>
               <p>It may be demanded, what became of the church when as the whole earth was full of theſe crawling and ſtinging Locuſts. This queſtion is now here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; to wit, that theſe Locuſts are charged and commaunded, that they ſhould not hurt any of the elect: for this woe and this plague, extendeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the inhabitants of the earth, as wee haue heard before. Their power is limited only to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, they haue nothing to do with Gods choſen people. And here againe we ſee what great care God hath for his in the midſt of the greateſt dangers, as hath bene twiſe noted before, chap. 7. chap. 8. For now Antichriſt raigning in his ful pride, yet his elect are preſerued in the midſt of theſe ſcorpion Locuſts, flying about their eares like ſwarmes of Hornets, not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18003:65"/>
one of them is ſtung to death. Chriſts litle flocke is alwaies defended, and ſet in ſafetie.</p>
               <q>And to them was commaunded, that they ſhould not hurt them, but that they ſhould be vexed fiue monethes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>5</label> and that their paine ſhould be as the paine that commeth of a ſcorpion when he hath ſtung a man.</q>
               <p>Some write, that ſuch as are ſtung of a ſcorpion, do not die forthwith, but haue a lingring paine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are miſerably vexed three or foure dayes before they die of it. Now, vnto this lingring paine is this ſpiritual ſtinging compared: for theſe Locuſts are commanded of God, that they ſhould not kil the very reprobates outright, &amp; at once, but torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a lingring death for the ſpace of fiue moneths, that is, 500. yeares: for ſo long did the Papacie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his height &amp; pride, full ſtrength and vertue: and ſo long did the Pope &amp; his Cleargie ſting men with lingring and ſcorpion-like paine.</p>
               <q>Therefore in thoſe daies ſhall men ſeeke death, and ſhall not finde it, and ſhall deſire to die, and death ſhal flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>6</label> 
               </q>
               <p>This verſe doth ſhewe, that all Papiſts being thus ſtung and tormented in their conſciences with this lingring paine of Popiſh doctrine, ſhall wiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues out of the world, and buried quicke, that they might be ridde of their ſpirituall ſtinging, and helliſh torments which they had in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. For the Popiſh doctrine hath no ſound comfort in it, it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth men in deſperation in ſickneſſe, and vpon their death-beds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:18003:66"/>For alas, what comfort can a poore diſtreſſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue in Popes pardons, Indulgences, Maſſes, Dirges, Merits, Workes, Pilgrimages, Purgatory, Croſſes, Crucifixes, <hi>Agnus deis,</hi> &amp; ſuch like traſh and trumpery? theſe alas are too weake remedies for any ſpirituall diſeaſes: they are not ſufficient to procure pardon at Gods hand for any ſinne. Alas, the poore blinde Papiſts did know &amp; feele that they were vile ſinners: they knew they muſt come to iudgement: they knew that the reward of ſinne was death, euen the ſecond death: they knew all this full wel, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had horrible convulſions in their conſciences, and knew no way nor meanes how to winde out of them. For the doctrine of free iuſtification in the bloud of Chriſt, was hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, they knew it not: and therefore all aſſurance of Gods fauour, all peace of conſcience, &amp; all ioy in the holy Ghoſt, was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken from them, &amp; therefore many of them died in moſt deſperate &amp; vncomfortable maner.

Now we are to vnderſtand of their form and likeneſſe: for the ſpirit of God dooth here paint them out in their colours, that all men may diſcerne them, and beware of them. Firſt, it is ſaid that they were like vnto horſes prepared vnto battell: that is, they were as ſtrong and fierce as barred horſes, to ruſh and run vpon all ſuch as ſhould but once mute or mutter againſt them, or their authoritie. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, they haue crownes of golde vpon their heads, which ſheweth and ſignifieth, that they were the conquerors of the earth, &amp; Lords of the world, and who but they? for in thoſe daies no man, nay, no Lord or King, durſt quitch againſt a Monke, a Frier, or a pild Prieſt: for if any did, they were ſure to ſmart for it. They had alſo faces like the faces of men; that is, they ſet faire faces vpon matters, and pretended great deuotion in religion, flattering the people, and making them beleeue that they could giue them pardon of all their ſinnes, and bring them to heauen; when as in very truth, for their bellies, and for their gaine, they did cunningly ſmoothe with the nobles, the rich, &amp; the mightie, ſetting faire faces vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al their proceedings; and as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Through couetouſnes with fained words, they made merchandiſe of mens ſoules,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.3.</note> and did cloſely winde themſelues into the hearts of the ſimple people, by their fawning inſinuations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in very deede moſt notable flatterers and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. They had haire, as the haire of women; that is, they were altogether effeminate, being giuen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacie, luſt, and wantonneſſe; they were drowned in whoredome &amp; al kind of beaſtlineſſe, being a ſhoale
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18003:67"/>
of moſt filthy villaines. Their teeth were as the teeth of Lyons, to catch &amp; ſnatch all that they could come by. They deuoured all the fat morſels euery where: they got the church-liuings into their hands: they firſt made impropriations: they incroached vpon temporall mens lands: they ſwallowed vp all euerie where. If we looke vpon the Abbeys, Priories, and Nunneries, wee may eaſily iudge what teeth they had. Moreouer, it is ſaid they had Habbergions, like to Habbergions of Iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that is, they were ſo ſtrongly armed with the defence &amp; countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Pope, that no ſecular power durſt once quitch againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Their wings were like the ſounde of chariots, when many horſes runne vnto battell: that is, with flutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring noiſe, &amp; terrible threatnings, they ſtroue to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde their kingdome. Alſo in Churches and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, they make a roaring noiſe, and take on terribly to maintaine their abhominable Idolatry.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18003:68"/>
They are ſaide <hi>to bee foure in number,</hi> becauſe they ſhould raiſe an horrible plague in the foure corners of the earth, both Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South. The ſenſe is, that the diuels haue yet further and greater ſcope giuen them to plague and deſtroy the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth. Theſe diuels had exceeding great power in the kingdome of Antichriſt, but they are vnſatiable in miſchiefe, and ſo after a ſorte lie ſtill bound till they haue their deſire. The place where they lie bounde, is <hi>Euphrates,</hi> wherein is a myſterie: for <hi>Euphrates</hi> literally taken, is a great Riuer, which ranne ſo nigh the citie <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> that it was a mightie defence vnto it, ſo that the citie could not be taken, vntill they that laide ſiege vnto it, cut out trenches, and deriued the waters an other way. Now for the myſterie, it is this: <hi>Rome</hi> in this booke is called <hi>Babylon.</hi> By a metaphor, and after the ſame manner, the great Riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> as wee ſhall ſee afterward, chap. 16. ſignifieth the power, wealth, and authoritie, which that citie <hi>Rome,</hi> euen this we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne <hi>Babel,</hi> hath to defend it ſelfe. Then it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in this power, authoritie, and ſtrength of <hi>Rome,</hi> the diuels lie bounde: for they waited through the power of <hi>Rome,</hi> to worke yet farre greater miſchiefe, and therefore are ſaide to bee bounde, ſo long as they were reſtrained. The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which they plotted, and purpoſed to bring to paſſe by the authoritie and power of <hi>Rome,</hi> was the hatching and bringing forth of the Mahometiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which in very deed did ſpring from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> as from his proper roote and originall cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:18003:69"/>The diuels did foreſee, that out of the ſuperſtitions and Idolatries of <hi>Rome,</hi> defended by their great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie, Mahometiſh religion, might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well bee framed, and therefore not being content to plague the Weſt part of the worlde with Poperie and Idolatrie, they do greedily deſire alſo to plague the Eaſt part of the worlde with the falſe religion of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They are not ſatiſfied with plaguing and poiſoning all <hi>Europe</hi> with abhominable Idolatries, except alſo they plague and infect all <hi>Aſia</hi> &amp; <hi>Affrica</hi> with the Turkes moſt execrable religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo inſatiable are the diuels in working miſchiefe. Now in the meane time they think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues too much ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bound and tied vp in <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; Romiſh religion, except they may be looſed, and proceede further to ouerſpread the whole world with all impieties, and moſt horrible abhominations. A man would thinke that when the diuels had preuailed ſo far, as to place Antichriſt in his curſed chaire, and to breede the ſwarmes of Locuſts out of the ſmoake of hell, they might haue bene ſatiſfied: for then, as wee ſay, hell ſeemed to be broken looſe. But yet all this cannot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the vnſatiable diuels, but they will haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> eſtabliſhed, to poiſon and plague all the Eaſt parts of the world in their ſoules: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they will haue the moſt huge, cruell, and ſauage armies of the Turkes raiſed vp, to murder and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men in their bodies, in the weſt parts of the world, as preſently we ſhall heare.</p>
               <p>Now till all this bee effected, they are ſaide to lie bound at <hi>Rome.</hi> But here we ſee, that this ſixt Angell hath a preciſe commaundement from Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18003:69"/>
to looſe theſe diuels which lay bound at the great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that they might plague the whole world farre and neare, at their pleaſure: ſo now all the diuels of hell are let looſe, and let vs heare what followeth.</p>
               <q>And the foure Angels were looſed, which were prepared at an houre, at a day, at a moneth, and at a yeare, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>15</label> to ſlay the third part of men.</q>
               <p>Now the diuels being looſed and vnbounde by ſpeciall commandement from Chriſt, were in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to execute their miſchiefe. This aſcending by degrees from a ſhort time vnto longer &amp; longer; <hi>From an houre to a day, &amp;c.</hi> dooth ſignifie, that as the diuels were preſt, &amp; at hand at an houres warning, as we ſay, to put in practiſe whatſoeuer they had plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo they were as forwarde to continue the ſame, <hi>From an houre to a day, from a day to a moneth, &amp; from a moneth to a yeare,</hi> that is fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, vntil the date of their commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was out: for their time was limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their commiſſion bounded, as afterward we ſhall ſee. And this is our comfort, that both the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is limited to fiue monethes, and the Turciſme to houres, daies, monethes, and yeares. The diuels po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is limited, though it grieueth them full ſore. They cannot doo what they liſt: they cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as long as they would.</p>
               <q>After the number of horſemen of warre were twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand, for I heard the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Moreouer, it is to be noted, that as this army did exceed in number, ſo alſo in terror and ſtrength: and therefore they are ſaid to be all <hi>horſemen.</hi> For an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of horſemen are both more ſtrong and more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, then any arm of footemen.</p>

               <p>Heere is the deſcription of theſe horſemen and horſes, as they appeared to <hi>Iohn</hi> in a viſion. Firſt, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the horſemen, it is ſaide that they were very well armed <hi>with Habbergions</hi>; that is, coates of Maile, Corſelets, or Curets, and that <hi>of a fiery colour, and of the colour of Iacinth</hi>; that is, of ſmoake, as appeareth in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18003:70"/>
the laſt clauſe of this verſe, and alſo <hi>of the colour of Brimſtone.</hi> For as horſemen in compleate armour were wont to weare in their breaſt-plates and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets certaine enſignes and colours, whereby they might be made terrible to their enemies: So theſe Turkiſh warriours and horſemen do holde out their colours of fire, ſmoake, and brimſtone, as it were flagges of defiance againſt the whole world, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning preſent death to al that ſhould withſtand them; or as if they meant to ſpet fire and flame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, or to choake them with ſmoake and brimſtone, &amp; then burne them vp with fire &amp; brimſtone. All this their colours and enſignes in their breaſt-plates and Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergions did portend. Now, as concerning their horſes, no doubt they were as fierce as the horſmen. They were great Launces, they had <hi>heads like Lyons</hi>; that is, they were full of ſtomack &amp; fiercenes, <hi>and out of their mouthes went forth fire, &amp; ſmoake, and brimſtone</hi>; that is, they had the ſame colours and enſignes vpon them that their riders had.</p>

murthered in their bodies by cruell death, &amp; others violently drawne to the wicked religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> For partly by externall violence, and partly by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhewe of religion and deuotion, they deſtroied thouſands both in their ſoules &amp; bodies.

                  <hi>Their power is in their mouthes, and in their tailes.</hi> For their tailes were like vnto ſerpents, and had heads wherewith they hurt. But for the better vnderſtanding of theſe things, I thinke it not amiſſe a little to open and lay forth the riſing vp, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the power of the Turke.</p>
               <p>About the yeare of our Lord, 591. was <hi>Mahomet</hi> borne in a certaine village of <hi>Arabia,</hi> called <hi>Itrarix,</hi> for ſo Hiſtories do report.

               <p>After this, hee married a rich wife, and by that meanes he wonne the hearts of many with gifts. In the daies of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour, which was in the yeare of our Lord, 623. he grew to be very migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. After this, he faigned himſelfe to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and ſaid, that he had viſions and reuelations, and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Angels. And ſo by the helpe of <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monke, hee framed a new worſhip and religion, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched partly out of the olde Teſtament, partly from the Papiſts, and partly from the Heathen. Hee raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nine yeares, and ſo died.</p>
               <p>After him, ſucceeded in the kingdome of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens <hi>Ebubezer,</hi> who raigned two yeares. <hi>Haumar,</hi> who raigned twelue yeares. <hi>Muhauias</hi> who raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18003:71"/>
24. yeares. All theſe made great warres againſt the Perſians, and ſundrie other nations, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them, and ſet vp the religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and ſo the kingdome of the Saracens grew mightie: but in proceſſe of time the kingdome of the Turkes grew great, and the kingdome of the Saracens diminiſhed. Within a ſhort time after this, the Tartarians, a barbarous people, waxed ſtrong, and made warre againſt the Turkes, and preuailed greatly for a time. But about the yeare of our Lord 1300. the Empire of the Tartarians was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and the Empire of the Turkes did flouriſh more then euer before: For now come the greateſt monſters, and moſt ſauage and cruell tyrants of all. The firſt of them was <hi>Ottomanus.</hi> The ſecond <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zethes.</hi> The third, <hi>Amurathes.</hi> Theſe made bloudie warres againſt the Chriſtians; I meane the Papiſts in <hi>Europe,</hi> and enlarged the Turkes dominions very farre.</p>
               <p>They did from time to time ſo cruelly murther and maſſacre the inhabitants of the Weſt, with their huge and bloudie armies, that at laſt both the Pope, the Emperour, the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> and almoſt all the Potentates in <hi>Europe,</hi> did ioyne together to make warre againſt the Turkes, and did leuie huge armies, but yet could not preuaile: ſo ſtrong were the Turkes: ſo huge and dreadfull were their armies. Then wee ſee that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified which here was foretolde, to wit, <hi>that the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous armies of the Turkes, with their horſes and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, should ſlay the third parte of men:</hi> that is, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18003:72"/>
Idolaters in <hi>Europe</hi> by heapes and infinit numbers. To ſet downe the particular battailes betwixt the Turkes and the Chriſtians in <hi>Europe,</hi> and their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible bloudſheaddings, would require a volume: but this which I haue briefly ſet downe, may ſerue to giue ſome light vnto it, &amp; may ſuffice for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this text. <label type="milestone">

               <p>HAuing opened and expounded the two firſt woes which fel out vpon the blowing of the fift and ſixt trumpet, containing the two great plagues of Poperie and Turciſme, wherewith the world was puniſhed many hundred yeares: now in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we are to heare of good newes, and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, after ſo much ſorrowe. For here Ieſus Chriſt commeth downe from heauen to relieue his poore afflicted Church, and to be reuenged of all his cruell enemies. For now, before the 3. and laſt woe, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the greateſt plague of al vpon the world, which is, the laſt iudgement; wherein the wicked ſhall bee tormented in hel fire for euer, both in body &amp; ſoule, I ſay, before the blowing of the 7. trumpet, by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth angel, of which we ſhal heare in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Now in the meane time is ſhewed in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what care God had for his little flocke, which no doubt were hid in thoſe daies, and did not appeare, and yet were ſcattered in corners, euen in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the darkneſſe of Poperie, and the moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; helliſh rage of the Turkiſh armies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the principall ſcope and drift of this chapter, is to ſhewe how the Goſpell ſhould bee preached in many kingdomes, now after this generall darkneſſe, for the diſcouering and ouerthrow, both of Poperie and Turciſme, and to ſhewe what ſhould fall out in the church now in the middle time, before the 7. &amp; laſt trumpet blow: for then commeth the laſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Angel ſweareth in this chapter, ver. 6.7.</p>

                  <hi>His feete are as pillars of Braſſe</hi>; which ſignifieth that he ſhould tread downe all his enemies vnder his feete, both Pope and Turke:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>for hee muſt raigne till hee haue deſtroied them all.</hi> The Pope a long time kept all the kings of <hi>Europe</hi> in awe. The Locuſts were of great power. The Turkes preuailed exceedingly. But what are they all to this mightie and glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell Chriſt? What is their power to withſtand him?

               <q>And hee had in his hand a little booke open, <label type="milestone">

               <p>It is called little, in reſpect of the great and huge volumes of Popiſh bookes, though in it ſelfe it bee large.</p>
               <p>It is ſaide to bee open, that all men might looke into it, becauſe it had bene ſhut a long time before, euen during all the time of the darkening of the Sun and the Ayre, by the ſmoake which came out of the bottomleſſe pit. But although it was long ſhut vp in the time of Poperie, and lay buried in a ſtraunge tongue: yet now it is opened, and publikely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto all the ſeruants of God. And all this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18003:74"/>
no doubt is to be vnderſtood of <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and all the times euer ſince the Goſpell was ſpread abroade after the great darkeneſſe. For ſome hundred yeares agoe it was hard to finde an Engliſh Bible: but now God be thanked, there are thouſands to be found in the hands of Gods people. And therfore the things here propheſied of, are fulfilled in our daies: for wee liue vnder the opening of the ſeuenth ſeale, and the blowing of the ſixt trumpet, and the powring forth of the ſixt viall, as here doth partly appeare, and ſhall God willing, be made more manifeſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come to the 16. chapter. Now wee are diligently to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that as the opening of this booke, &amp; the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell by <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his ſucceſſors, hath diſperſed the former darkeneſſe, and beaten downe Poperie: ſo alſo hath it driuen backe the Turke, and taken from vs all feare of him, which in former ages, was the terrour of the worlde: for ſince men haue looked into this booke, repented of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and turned vnto God with all their hearts.</p>
               <p>The Turke and his power hath not bene feared, eſpecially in theſe parts where the Goſpell is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For God in his mercifull prouidence towards his Church, hath diuerted his power an other way, and ſet him aworke elſe-where. So that if men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be brought to beleeue, that God raiſed him vp as a ſcourge for Idolaters, and a plague for Idolatrie and other foule ſinnes, according to the wordes in the former chapter; where it is ſaid, <hi>They repented not of the workes of their hands, &amp;c.</hi> yet when they ſee, that at the opening of the booke of God, and forſaking Idolatrie, the feare of him is remoued, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

it. What can be more plaine, then that this ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> booke in the hand of the Angell, hath deliuered vs from the Pope, and from the Turke: A moſt happie opening of this bleſſed booke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is ſaid, that <hi>hee put his right foote vpon the ſea, and his left on the earth.</hi> The ſetting of Chriſts right foote vpon the ſea, ſignifieth that he is ruler of the ſea, and ſtandeth as firmely vpon the ſea, as vpon the land. The ſetting of his left foote vpon the earth, doth ſignifie, that he is Lord of the earth, and true heire to all things in it.</p>
               <q>And cried with a loude voice, as when a Lyon roareth, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>3</label> and when he had cried, ſeuen thunders vttered their voices.</q>
               <p>This crying with a loude voice, like the roaring of a Lyon, doth ſignifie the manifeſtation of the wrath of Chriſt againſt all his enemies: for now hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to roare againſt them, as a Lyon whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, roareth for his pray. Therefore now both the ſcorpion, Locuſts, &amp; the fierce horſes and horſemen are like to goe to the pot.</p>
               <p>By the 7. thunders which vttered their voices, is meant thoſe perfect and exquiſite iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which now were to be infflicted both vpon the kingdome of the Pope and of the Turke.

And this is the reaſon of this interpretation.</p>
               <q>And when the ſeuen thunders had vttered their voices, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>4</label> I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heauen, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto me: Seale vp thoſe things which the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders haue ſpoken, and write them not.</q>

But he receiueth a commandement to the contrarie, for he is willed, not to write them, but to conceale them vntill the appointed time.</p>

               <p>The briefe ſenſe of theſe foure verſes is, that the Preachers of the Goſpell being called, allowed, and authoriſed by Chriſt vnto their miniſtry, ſhould ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the ſcriptures with great diligence, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntil they had eaten vp the booke of God, &amp; then they ſhould preach &amp; publiſh vnto all nations &amp; kingdomes that truth of God, &amp; doctrine of the Goſpell, which now a long time had lien hid in the raigne of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerued, that <hi>Iohn</hi> in this place repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the perſon of all the miniſters of the Goſpell which ſhould be raiſed vp in theſe laſt dayes, for the ouerthrowe of Antichriſt, and the reſtauration of true religion: for <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe did not liue to theſe times.</p>
               <p>Further, it is to be noted, that all godly Students and zealous Miniſters do eate vp the booke of God by reading, ſtudy, praier, &amp; meditation, &amp; they finde it ſweete in their mouth, that is, they finde and feele
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18003:76"/>
great ioy and comfort in the ſtudie and meditation thereof, eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God reuealeth therby great and hid ſecrets vnto them, &amp; giueth them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the myſteries of the Goſpell, &amp; counſels of his will, which are locked vp from the wiſe and prudent of this world. This I ſay, is ſweeter vnto their mouth then hony, and the hony combe. Concerning this phraſe of eating vp the booke, looke <hi>Ezech. 2.9.</hi> for here the holy Ghoſt alludeth therevnto.</p>
               <p>This booke being ſo ſweete in the mouth, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten and digeſted, is bitter in the belly.</p>
               <p>There may bee three reaſons yeelded of this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it being once taken downe into our ſoule by godly meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth mortifie our corrupt nature, &amp; bring vnder our luſts, &amp; therefore ſeemeth bitter to fleſh and bloud.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe afflictions &amp; trials do alwaies neceſſarily followe the ſounde digeſtion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the doctrine of the Goſpel being ſwallowed by the Miniſters therof, muſt not be kept to themſelues, as it were cloſed vp in their ſtomacks, but they muſt out with it againe, as if it were ſome loathſome &amp; bitter thing, which muſt needes be caſt vp again.

               <p>WE haue heard that the little Booke ſhould be opened, and the Goſpell preached and publiſhed to many nations and kingdomes, after the great darkeneſſe of Popery: and that this was done by <hi>Luther, Melancton, Caluin, Peter Viret, Peter Martir, Bullinger, Bucer,</hi> and all their faithfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors vnto this day.

So then the principall drift of this Chapter is, to ſhewe thoſe thinges which yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to be fulfilled vnder the blowing of the ſixt trumpet, which is the preaching and preuailing of the Goſpell, euen vnto the worldes ende: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the thinges which follow vppon the blowing of the ſeuenth trumpet, which is the reſurrection &amp; laſt iudgement.</p>
               <p>This Chapter containeth ſixe principall things, as it were the ſixe parts thereof.</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">ver. </seg>11.12.13.</label> it ſheweth that notwithſtanding the rage and fury of the world in perſecuting them to death, God would not onely receiue their ſoules to glorie, but alſo raiſe vp others endued with the ſame ſpirit, which ſhould preach, profeſſe, &amp; witneſſe the ſame truth conſtantly &amp; continually, euen vnto the ende of the world.</p>
               <p>Laſtly it ſheweth, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>14.15.16.17.18.19.</label> that after the preaching of the Goſpell ſome good time in this laſt age, the ſeuenth Angel ſhould blowe the trumpet, and the worlde ſhould end.
<q>And there was giuen me a reede like vnto a rodde, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>1</label> and the Angel ſtood by ſaying, Ariſe and meaſure the temple of God and the aultar, and them that worſhip therein.</q>
Here Ieſus Chriſt giueth a reede vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> like vnto a rodde, and thervpon he is commanded by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to goe about the meaſuring of the temple, the aultar, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:18003:78"/>By this meaſuring with a reede like a rodde, is ſignified the reſtoring and building vp of Gods houſe, which now was greatly ruinated and runne into decay through the long preuailing of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 40.5. Zach. 1.16. Zac. 2.1.2. Apoc. 21.15.</note>Meaſuring with a reede, is taken for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of Gods Church, after the decaied eſtate thereof, both in <hi>Ezechiel, Zachary,</hi> and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> in the perſons of all faithfull Miniſters, hath this meaſuring rodde giuen him, becauſe the church was to be reſtored and built vp by the Miniſters and Miniſtrie of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The thing to be meaſured, is the Temple, the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and them that worſhip therein.</p>
               <p>This is an alluſion to the legall worſhip, whereby our ſpirituall worſhip is repreſented. For by the materiall Temple, is meant the ſpirituall Temple, or Church of God. By the Aultar of ſtone, is meant the ſpirituall worſhip. By them that worſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with carnall ſacrifices, is meant all the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, which worſhip God in ſpirit and truth.</p>
               <p>Now then, both the Church, the true worſhip and worſhippers, were all to be meaſured, repaired, and built vp by the miniſtrie of the word, which all were decaied and almoſt laide waſte, by the Popes tyrannie.
<q>But the court which is without the temple caſt out and meaſure it not, for it is giuen to the Gentiles; and the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18003:78"/>
holy citie ſhall they treade vnder foote two and fortie moneths.</q>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> is heere forbidden to meaſure and build vp the court which is without the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Wherby is ment all heretikes, hypocrites, worldlings, &amp; all ſuch as haue a place in the Church, but are not of the Church. This phraſe of ſpeech is taken from the olde ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh worſhip as the reſt before. For in the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> there was an outward court which was common to all, good &amp; bad: the holy place which was proper to the Prieſts and Leuites: and the holy of holieſt, or moſt holy place, where none might come but the high Prieſt onely.</p>
               <p>Here is a reaſon added why the Lord God refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all Papiſts and hypocrites, and all ſuch as belong to the outward court onely, and it is this: that this outward court <hi>is giuen vnto the Gentiles</hi>; that is, to all falſe Chriſtians and counterfaits in Religion, which are members of the viſible Church, but haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the inuiſible. Theſe are compared to Gentiles in two reſpects. Firſt, in regard of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe, for they are as prophane as the Heathen. Secondly, in reſpect of perſecuting the truth: for hypocrites and Atheiſts are as forward in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the people of God as the Heathen Emperours, which perſecuted the Church by the ſpace of 300. yeares. All comes to this, that when the Church ſhould bee gathered and built by the Preaching of the Goſpell, God would haue all Papiſts, Atheiſts, and hypocrites ſhut out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:18003:79"/>Moreouer, here is the ſecond reaſon yeelded, why the outward court ſhould be caſt out, and not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured: to wit, becauſe <hi>they should tread the holy Cittie vnder foote, forty and two monethes</hi>: That is, they ſhould perſecute the Church all the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts raigne. For forty two moneths in this verſe: and <hi>1260. dayes</hi> in the next verſe, and <hi>three dayes and a halfe</hi> verſe 9. <hi>and time; times, and halfe a time,</hi> in the 12. Chapter, verſe 14. and <hi>1260 dayes,</hi> Chapter 12. verſe 6. doe ſignifie all one thing, which is, the ſhort raigne of Antichriſt: for theſe moneths, theſe dayes, and theſe times, doe euery one of them make three yeares, and a halfe. For who knoweth not that 42. monethes make iuſt three yeares, and an halfe, and that 1260. dayes, maketh euen ſo much alſo: and by time he meaneth a yeare, by times, two yeare, and by halfe a time, halfe a yeare. Now the reaſon, why Antichriſts raigne is numbred by dayes, monethes, and halfe times, &amp; all amounting but to three yeares and a halfe, is to note the ſhort continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,<note place="margin">Chap. 12.12. Chap. 17.10. Chap. 20.3.</note> for the comfort of the Church, as appeareth more fully and plainely, in ſundry places of this Propheſie, where it is ſet downe in plaine wordes, that Antichriſt ſhould raigne but a ſhort time: for what is fiue or ſixe hundred yeares, in compariſon of eternitie.</p>
               <p>But here the Papiſts doe ſhew themſelues moſt ſottiſh and ridiculous, in that they would gather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, that the Pope is not Antichriſt: for (ſay they) Antichriſt ſhall raigne but three yeares and an halfe, but the Pope hath raigned many yeares: therefore the Pope is not Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:18003:79"/>Now to anſwer the propoſition of their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t taken from this place. Firſt, it may bee anſwered that this place is not to be vnderſtoode litterally, but miſtically: as many other things in this booke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is a certaine number put for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, a definit number for an indefinit, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is vſuall in this booke, as we heard before, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>7</label> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſealing of the Tribes, of euery Tribe 12000. which maketh 144000. Now no man is ſo mad as to thinke there were iuſt ſo many ſealed, and neither more, nor leſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is an alluſion to <hi>Daniels</hi> weekes,<note place="margin">Dan 9.</note> and other propheticall computatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherin ſometimes a day is put for a yere, a weeke for 7. yeares, as in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> ſeauens, and a moneth for 30. yeares. So then I conclude, that it is extreame folly to interpret this place litterally. The curious and friuolous interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this place, and ſuch like in this booke, by ſome writers, I do of purpoſe omit, as matters vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, vnſound, &amp; vniudiciall: for I only in this booke ſeeke the ſenſe that is, and not the ſenſe which is not, as hath beene ſaid before.</p>
               <q>But I will giue power vnto my <hi>2.</hi> witneſſes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>3</label> and they shall propheſie 1260. dayes cloathed in ſackcloth.</q>
               <p>Hauing ſet down how Antichriſt &amp; his company, being thoſe Gentiles which poſſeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> outward court ſhould tread downe the holy citie, that is, the true churh of God for a ſhort time: now he commeth to ſhew, that euen in the height and pride of the Popes power, and gouernment, yet the Church was not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18003:80"/>
vtterly extinct, God did neuer vtterly forſake it, but in all ages, and at all times, God did raiſe vp one or other to withſtand all Popiſh proceedings, which is here meant by the two witneſſes. For aſſuredly theſe two witneſſes do not ſignifie <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> as the Papiſts and ſome others do dreame: but they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all the faithfull Preachers and profeſſors of the truth, which in all ages both former and later, haue oppoſed themſelues againſt the Pope, his Cleargie, his doctrine, his religion, and all his abhominable proceedings.</p>
               <p>They are called <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> becauſe they ſhould beare witneſſe vnto the truth.</p>
               <p>They are ſaid to be <hi>two</hi> in number, for three reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe they were very fewe in thoſe dayes when Popery did ſo generally preuaile: for two is the ſmalleſt number.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 19.15. Iohn 8.17. Hebr. 10.28.</note>Secondly, becauſe the law of God doth admit of no leſſe number in witneſſe-bearing, as it is written; <hi>In the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhal euery word ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi>

               <p>Chriſt ſaith here, that <hi>hee will giue power to his two witneſſes</hi>: for no man hath any power in heauenly things, except it be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him from aboue: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſtand faſt to the truth in the heate of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and troubles.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that theſe <hi>two witneſſes ſhall Propheſie:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.3.</note> Preach, declare, and ſpeake.

               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:18003:80"/>The time of their propheſieng being 1260. daies, hath bene expounded before.</p>
               <p>Theſe two witneſſes <hi>are cloathed in ſackcloth,</hi> which ſignifieth that they ſhould lead a ſorrowfull life here in this world. For in old time when men did faſt and mourne, they did vſe to put on ſackcloth. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then that theſe faithfull Preachers and witneſſes of the truth, did not ſpend their daies in mirth, iolitie and worldly pompe and brauery, as did the Popes Cleargie, and pompous prelates of Antichriſt.</p>

Now then the ſenſe and meaning of the holy Ghoſt is, that when there once beginneth to be <hi>an earthquake,</hi> that is, broiles, contentions, alterations, queſtions &amp; diſputations, about religion: and that the popiſh doctrine which had ſo long preuailed in the world, ſhould be called in queſtion, yea openly preached againſt, conuicted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, that then <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould begin to fall, and Romiſh religion to ſuffer a great eclipſe, yea the tenth part; that is, ſome part of the citie of <hi>Rome</hi>: I meane the doctrine and authoritie of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be ouerthrowne.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18003:86"/>
number ſeuen thouſand, that is, many thouſands; for the number of ſeuen is a perfect and vniuerſall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as formerly hath bene declared. But the ſenſe of this clauſe is, that all ſuch as wil not yeeld to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell after matters once come in queſtion, and the light therof breaketh forth, but continue ſtill in their blindneſſe and hardneſſe, ſtanding out ſturdily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, ſhall feele the heauie iudgements of God vpon them, and come to miſerable and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched endes, as did here in England <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> bloudie <hi>Bonner,</hi> and many other ſuch open perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in other nations and countries, as the booke of Martyrs doth plentifully witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all it is ſaid, that <hi>the reſt were terrified, &amp; gaue glorie to the God of heauen</hi>: that is, the elect of God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe horrible iudgements vpon the perſecutors of the Goſpel, and hauing their eies opened through theſe contentions and broiles about religion, ſhould repent of their former Idolatries, blindneſſe, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſhould yeeld to the truth, and giue glorie to the God of heauen, as at this day we ſee thouſands doo, God be thanked. <label type="milestone">

               <p>By the <hi>arke of the couenant,</hi> is meant Chriſt, who is ſaide heere to be ſeene in the Temple or kingdome of glory, becauſe through his mediation only (in whom the couenant of peace is eſtabliſhed with his church) the 24 Elders are made partakers of their Crownes, and enter in with him, and his Angels into the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Temple made without handes, and eternall in the heauens.

                     <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: A woman clothed with the ſunne, and the moone was vnder her feete, and vpon her head a crowne of</hi> 12 <hi>ſtarres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt the Holy-ghoſt calleth the matters of this chapter <hi>a great wonder,</hi> to ſtir vs vp to attention. For men are much mooued with wonders; and a wonder indeede it is in the literall ſenſe to ſee a woman clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the ſunne, &amp;c. but a farre greater wonder in the ſpiritual ſenſe, as we ſhal heare; and the greateſt wonder of al, that a poore weake woman ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with a great red dragon, and ouercome him.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid to <hi>be a wonder in heauen,</hi> becauſe the church here in viſion appeareth not vpon the earth, but in heauen, in aſmuch as her birth is from heauen, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in heauen, and her conuerſation in heauen.</p>
                  <p>The Church is here compared to a woman, as in the 45 Pſalme, and the whole booke of the Canticles, and that for three reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as a woman is weake and feeble, and in lawe can do nothing of herſelf without her husband: ſo we of our ſelues are weake and feeble, and in matters of Gods lawe and worſhip can doe nothing without our husband Chriſt, as he ſaith: <hi>without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as a woman thorough the company of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18003:90"/>
her husband is fruitful, and bringeth forth children: ſo the Church by her coniunction with Chriſt, and his word, doth bring forth many children vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the loue and affection of a woman is to her husband, as Gen. 2.16. ſo the loue and affection of the Church is altogether to Chriſt, and Chriſt to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This woman is clothed with the Sunne</hi>: that is,<note place="margin">Mal. 4.2.</note> the Church is clothed with Chriſt <hi>the Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Moone was vnder her feete.</hi> Whereby is meant, that the church treadeth vnder her feete al worldly things, which are compared to the moone for their often changes, waxings, wanings, increaſings decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and continual mutations, and vncertainties.</p>
                  <p>The church treadeth al tranſitory things vnder her feet: that is, ſhe maketh light account of them; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth them not in compariſon of heauenly things. For he that is clothed with the ſunne, careth little for the light of the moone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>She hath vpon her head a crowne of</hi> 12 <hi>ſtarres</hi>: which ſignifieth that the church is adorned, and beautified with the doctrine of the twelue Apoſtles, that is, the doctrine of the Goſpel, as it were with a crowne of gold, of pearle, and pretious ſtones. For the doctrine of the Goſpel is the crowne of the church.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now although Chriſt was borne but of one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the church, which is the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi>: yet may it be ſaid that the whole church, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, did euen trauaile with paine to bring him forth, becauſe they had through faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a longing, &amp; feruent deſire &amp; expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his comming. For from the firſt promiſe made to <hi>Adam,</hi> and afterward renewed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity; the church ſtood in a continual expectation of the promiſed Meſſias, looking wiſhely euery day when he ſhould be actually exhibited to the world. For which cauſe here ſhe is ſaid <hi>to cry trauailing in birth.</hi> And not vnſauerly alſo may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church be ſaid to cry trauailing in birth, when through many perſecutions, &amp; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhe bringeth forth children vnto God by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word. For the church bringeth forth no children at eaſe, but with hard trauaile, and much adoe, hauing ſo few friends to helpe her, and ſo many enemies againſt her, as anon we ſhal heare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there appeared another wonder in heauen. For behold a great red dragon,</hi>

                     <hi>And his taile drew the third part of the ſtarres of heauen, and caſt them to the earth. And the dragon ſtood
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:18003:91"/>
before the woman, which was ready to be deliuered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now we are come to the deſcription of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches great &amp; capitall enemie, which is the diuel: who becauſe he ſtudieth and laboureth continually to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the good eſtate of the Church in heauenly things, to deiect her from her dignitie, and diſpoſſeſſe her of her inheritance, therefore here in viſion hee is ſaid to appeare in heauen. For he medleth with the Church, in and about heauenlie things, practiſing to pull her out of heauen, from whence ſhe came, and whither ſhe muſt returne, euen to caſt her into hell, and condemnation with himſelfe, if it were poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The diuell is compared to a dragon for his furie &amp; felneſſe; to a great dragon for his power &amp; might; and a <hi>red dragon,</hi> for his bloudy crueltie, malice, and madneſſe againſt Chriſt, and all his mmbers.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>ſeuen heads</hi> ſignifie his manifold ſleights, and ſubtilties, wherein he is a crafts-maiſter.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>ten hornes</hi> ſignifie his dreadful power. For who knoweth not that he is ſtronger then anie other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, hauing not loſt his ſtrength by his fall, but remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as ſtrong as an Angell of light.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>ſeuen crownes vpon his heads,</hi> do ſignifie his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold victories ouer the world. For hee hath from time to time, and from age to age, got ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the world, through his ſleights and power, that now <hi>he is the god of the world,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>and raigneth as king ouer them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This dragon hath a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous taile both for length and ſtrength. For it is ſo long, that it reacheth vp to heauen, &amp; ſo ſtrong that it bruſheth downe the ſtarres from thence. That is, the diuel through ambition and

                     <hi>where ſhee hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feede her there a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after the womans child was ſet in ſafetie, here is ſhewed what became of the woman her ſelfe: To wit, that ſhe was ſo ſore purſued by the Scribes and Phariſees, and by the Prieſts and Elders, that ſhe was faine to flie into the wilderneſſe. The naturall ſenſe &amp; plaine meaning of this place is, that when the church began to grow, after Chriſts aſcenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the number of the Diſciples to increaſe exceedingly, as we reade in the 2. of the <hi>Acts</hi>; Sathan did ſo greatly maligne it, and began to bee in ſuch a rage, that he would haue eaten them vp all at a bit, and rooted them out at once, that ſo the woman might haue no more being in the earth. And therefore we reade, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. that after the ſtoning of <hi>Steuen,</hi> there was ſuch a perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on raiſed vp againſt the Church by the high Prieſts, the Princes of the Iewes, the Phariſees, and all that curſed crue, that all the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt were ſcattered, and diſperſed here and there in the Heathen countries, and among the heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which here are called <hi>the wilderneſse,</hi> that is to ſay, a ground vntilled, deſolate, and barren of all fruits of godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>But now may ſome man ſay, how ſhal the Church doe in the wilderneſſe? how ſhal ſhe liue? how ſhall ſhe be ſuſtained? There is no tilling, no ſowing, no planting, there groweth no corne, there is nothing to

be had either for food or raiment. Here it is anſwered, that God prepared a place for her, where ſhe ſhould be fed. God tooke vp an Inne for her. She wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther food nor raiment in her perſecutions &amp; troubles. Which teacheth that God doth alwayes prouide for his owne, euen in greateſt miſeries, ſcarſities, famines, baniſhments, and perſecutions. As ſometimes he did for <hi>Elias</hi> in the time of dearth,<note place="margin">1. King. 17. Numb. 11. Numb. 14.</note> and for the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The time, wherein the Church was fed in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, was <hi>a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes</hi>: that is, during the time of her perſecutions, as before hath been ſhewed, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Now we are come to the third part of this chapter, which is the battell betwixt Chriſt and the diuel.

Wherein he ſheweth both his impudencie and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous madneſſe.</p>

                  <p>That Chriſt hath his Angels ioyned with him, is not to note any weakeneſſe or want of ſtrength in Chriſt, alone to ouercome his enemies, but to ſhew, that as Chriſt doth effect great wonders in the world; ſo for the moſt part hee doth it by inſtruments, and meanes: as ſometimes Angels, ſometimes men.

for the diuel knew right wel, that if Chriſt roſe again, hee ſhould loſe the field. For the reſurrection of Chriſt is our actuall iuſtification,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25. Rom. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>And Chriſt was mightily declared to be the Sonne of God by his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the dead.</hi> Wel, do the dragon and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels what they can, yet Chriſt is riſen againe, and hath ſpoiled principalities and powers; yea al the infernall armie, and hath made a ſhew of them openly, and hath led them all in triumph vpon his croſſe: So that we ſee in this firſt and greateſt battell, the diuell hath the foile. And it is further ſaid, <hi>that the diuell and all his Angels were caſt out of heauen, and their place was no more found:</hi> which is not to be vnderſtood of their firſt caſting out of heauen, immediately after their creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For at that time they were no diuels, nor ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the church, but Angels of light: but nowe ſince their fall, and ſince they were diuels; they are ſaid to be caſt out of heauen, not becauſe they euer came in heauen ſince they were diuels, but becauſe they can no longer impeach the church touching her bleſſed eſtate in heauen. They are without all hope to diſpoſſeſſe her of her inheritance: for that is ratified, and made ſure vnto her in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt. And for this cauſe it is ſaid, that the diuell hath no more to do in heauen: that is, he cannot for his heart ouerthrow the ſaluation of Gods children. <hi>For who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen? It is God that iuſtifieth,</hi>

                  <p>Now becauſe the diuel cannot ouerthrow the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of Gods elect, hee is ſaid to <hi>be caſt out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the earth</hi>: that is, amongſt earthlie and carnall men, that he may exerciſe his tyranny, and wrecke his malice vpon them.

downe, which accuſed them before God day and night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the triumphant ſong of victorie, which al the Saints &amp; Angels do ſing vnto God, prayſing and magnifying his power, and the power of his Sonne Chriſt, for ouercomming the dragon, and giuing the victory to the church through Chriſt. For now with great ioy and loude voices they ſing and ſay, that the churches ſaluation is ſealed, and made ſure vnto her for euer. It can neuer be ſhaken. The diuel is foiled and caſt down into the earth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſongs of ioie after great victories, are of great antiquity in the church: as we read of the children of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Exod. 15 Iudg. 5. 1. Sam. 18</note> after the ouerthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his army in the red ſea: of <hi>Deborah,</hi> after the great victory ouer <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſara</hi>: of the women, that ſung after the victory of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> by <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The deuil is called the accuſer of the brethren for two cauſes. Firſt becauſe he accuſeth Gods elect of much ſinne, and calleth for iuſtice againſt them day and night at Gods hands, that they might be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon ſuch articles, as he is able to proue againſt them: for he knowing right well that the iudge of al the world is a iuſt God, and muſt needs deale vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doth daily vrge him to doe iuſtice vnto ſinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willingly ignorant that al Gods People, though ſinners, are cleared and diſcharged in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon is, becauſe of the calumniations, reproches and ſlaunders, which in al ages, at al times, and in al places and countries, hee hath alwaies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly raiſed vp againſt the true worſhippers of God.</p>

The reaſon is added, why the diuel is in ſuch a rage with the world, and commeth vpon them in ſo great wrath and furie, to wit, becauſe <hi>hee hath but a ſhort time</hi>: that is, becauſe his kingdome

                  <p>Now the church being ſecretly hid and nouriſhed by Gods prouidence in the wilderneſſe, ſo as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel and his inſtruments cannot find her out, nor come at her, he taketh another courſe, and caſteth about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way to annoy her; &amp; that is by caſting a floud of water after her to drowne her withal. Whereby is meant, the innumerable lies, reproches, &amp; ſlaunders, which he raiſed vp by ſundry hereticks againſt her in al ages; as the Arrians, Donatiſts, Papiſts, and ſuch like, and al to bring her into the hatred of Princes; Potentates, and al that were in loue with her; that ſith otherwiſe he could not preuaile againſt her, yet at leaſt he might vtterly ſinke her in this gulfe of reproches.</p>
                  <p>

him; &amp; after that againe miraculouſly hid hir &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued her in the wilderneſſe, doth not now at a dead lift forſake her, nor ſuffer her to be drowned in this floud of reproches, &amp; vniuſt calumniations, which the dragon caſt vp after her. But cauſeth the <hi>earth to help her, &amp; to ſwallow vp the floud</hi>: That is, he vſeth al crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the earth to helpe his church: and not onely ſo, but alſo he ſtirreth vp many earthly and carnal men to befrend the church, and to take part with her againſt her enemies. As ſometimes he did <hi>Cyrus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedmelech, Nebuzaradan, Gamaliel,</hi> and ſundry others, whoſe power and policy he vſed for the good of his church, and for the drying vp of that flood of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which Sathan hath in al ages caſt vp againſt her. And God be thanked, we ſee at this day that this floud of ſlaunders and calumnies, which papiſts &amp; atheiſts caſt out againſt the church, and her particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, do dry vp dayly, and ſhal dry vp more and more, being drunk in by the earth.

                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> And as is the malice of Sathan againſt the church; ſo is the rage and fury of al his members, euen al the wicked and vngodly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true worſhippers of God.

                  <p>WEe haue heard in the former chapter the deſcription of the church, and of her arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemie the diuel, and of the battell betwixt them, with the ſucceſſe thereof. Now in this chapter wee are to heare of the dragons two great inſtruments, whereby he fighteth againſt the woman: that is, the Romane empire, and the Papacie. For by theſe two, as it were his two hands, he hath in all ages, from the Apoſtles time to this day, moſt cruelly aſſailed, and afflicted the church. Therefore the maine drift of this chapter is, to deſcribe at large theſe two beaſts, together with all their beaſtly proceedings. So that this chapter may fitly be deuided into two principal parts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is a deſcription of the Roman monarchy, when it was at the higheſt pitch, vntil the 11. verſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, is a deſcription of the Papacie, when it was in his pride, and exaltation; in all the verſes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vnto the end of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt of theſe two maine branches, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire is diuerſly deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the petigree thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of her ſeuen ſeuerall gouernments.</p>

a great part of the world, and had many nations ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it, eſpecially, when the Popes were the heads thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond maine part is the Papacie very liuely deſcribed.</p>

                     <hi>And I ſaw a beaſt riſe out of the ſea, hauing ſeuen heades, and tenne hornes, and vpon his hornes were tenne crownes, and vpon his heads the name of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, we are to vnderſtand that a beaſt in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſignifie a kingdome, or monarchie; and that not in reſpect of the ciuil power therof, which is of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> as it is written, <hi>There is no power but of God</hi>: but in reſpect of the tyrannie, crueltie, ambition, pride, and other ſuch like beaſtly qualities thereof, which are of the diuell: and therefore this beaſt is ſaid to aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, chap. 17.8.</p>
                  <p>This word beaſt is thus taken in the ſeuenth of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 7.4.5.6.</note> where the three great Monarchies of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, Medes and Perſians, and of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are compared for their pride, rapine and cruelty, to a Lyon, a Beare, and a Leopard. The Angell in that chapter ſaith expreſly,<note place="margin">Dan. 7.17.</note> that theſe beaſts were kings, that is, kingly gouernments or Dominions.</p>
                  <p>By the beaſt in this place is meant the Romane Monarchie, not in regard of the ciuill power thereof, but eſpecially in reſpect of the tyranny of it, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Church.</p>
                  <p>By the ſea here is meant the troubleſome ſtate of the nations: as it is taken chap. 4. verſ. 6. and chap. 21. verſ. 1. For from the boyling, and broyling e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the former kingdomes and heathen nations, which were as a raging ſea, did the Roman Empire ſpring vp, as all ſtories do witneſſe. And the Prophet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18003:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> doth flatly teach that through the diuiſion of the Greeke Empire,<note place="margin">Dan. 10.</note> which fell out in the poſteritie of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,<note place="margin">Dan. 11.</note> eſpecially betwixt his two ſonnes <hi>Ptolemeus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> this Romane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie by degrees made a head, till at laſt it came to this pitch, which now we ſhall heare of.</p>
                  <p>By the ſeuen heads of this beaſt, are meant the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſeuerall gouernments of the Roman Empire. Firſt, by Kings. Secondly, by Conſuls. Thirdly, by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemuiri. Fourthly, by Dictators. Fiftly, by Triumuiri. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17.9.</label> Sixtly, by Emperours. And laſtly, by Popes, as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhal more plainly appeare.</p>
                  <p>By the tenne hornes of this beaſt, is meant the great power and large dominion of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or as the Angell himſelfe doth expound it, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17.12.</label> thereby is meant tenne kings, that is, manie king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which ſhould be ſubiect to the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, and wherein in verie deede the power and ſtrength of the Empire did conſiſt. For by theſe hornes the Roman Empire did not only puſh downe other nations: but eſpecially doſſe againſt the Church, and as it were, cruelly gore the ſides thereof.</p>
                  <p>Nowe then we ſee that the Roman Emperours both in homes and heads, were like their Father the diuel or the dragon.</p>
                  <p>By the tenne crownes vpon his tenne hornes, are meant his great and manifolde victories ouer other countries and kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>The hornes of this beaſt are ſaid to be crowned, &amp; not his heads, becauſe the Roman Empire hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes more preuailed by power then by policie, by ſtrength then by ſubtilty. But the Dragon hath his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18003:100"/>
heads crowned, and not his homes, becauſe he hath alwayes done more hurt by policie, then pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; by ſubtiltie, then ſtrength. One thing in all this is greatly to bee heeded, that the holy Ghoſt in this chapter doth ſpecially ſpeake of the Roman monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, as the Popes were heads thereof; or as it was vnder the dominion of the Popes in their pride, when as the Emperours were almoſt troden vnder foote: and not ſimply and ſoly, as the Emperours were heads thereof.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is ſaid, <hi>that vpon the ſeuen heads of this beaſt was written the name of blaſphemie.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the blaſphemies of <hi>Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Diocleſian, Iulianus,</hi> and the other old heatheniſh, and perſecuting Emperours, which haue arrogated vnto themſelues diuine honour, wee ſhall anon heare of the ſurpaſſing blaſphemies of the Popes againſt God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ver. </seg>5.6.</label> and all goodneſſe.</p>

                     <hi>And the Beaſt which I ſaw was like a Leopard, and his feete like a Beares, and his mouth as the mouth of a Lyon, and the Dragon gaue him his power, &amp; his throne, and great authoritie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Roman Empire is deſcribed of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of qualities, which it had with the other three Empires going before it. For firſt, it is compared to a Leopard, for ſwiftneſſe to pray vpon others; and alſo for firceneſſe, and ſubtiltie, as did the Greeke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie. Secondly, it is compared to a Beare for rapine and rauening, as the monarchie of the Medes and Perſians. Thirdly, it is compared to a Lyon for pride and inſolencie, as the monarchie of the Chaldaeans. So then by this deſcription it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18003:100"/>
verie cleere, that this beaſt ſignifieth the Roman monarchie, becauſe it containeth in it the whole power of the other three Empires: and is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as a compound of diuers beaſts, yea as a verie monſter of monſters, hauing the body of a Leopard, the feete of a Beare, and the mouth of a Lyon.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is ſaid, <hi>that the Dragon gaue him his power, and his throne, and great authoritie.</hi> Which plainely ſheweth, that the power and authoritie of the Roman Empire is of the diuell, in reſpect of the euill qualitie thereof, that is, fraud, rapine, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17. v. 8.</label> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: In which reſpect it is ſaid to aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, as was declared before. But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, and the gouernement it ſelfe, was of God. <hi>For the powers that be, are ordained of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 13.2.</note> as ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>

                     <hi>as it were wounded vnto death: but his deadly wound was healed, and all the world wondred, and followed the beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere <hi>Iohn</hi> in a viſion ſeeth one of the ſeuen heads of the beaſt, almoſt wounded vnto death. There bee diuers and differing opinions of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned touching this wound of the Empire, both when it ſhould bee, and howe, and by whom. Some vnderſtand it of the death of <hi>Iulius Caeſar:</hi> ſome of <hi>Nero</hi>: ſome of the oppreſſion of the Gothes and Vandales: ſome of the great preuailing of <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> of Prage in the greateſt part of Bohemia. But to let all theſe paſſe, if wee do wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider and weigh with our ſelues, that by a beaſt in this place, is not meant anie lawfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of gouernement: but a tyrannicall
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18003:101"/>
power in perſecuting the Church, wee ſhall find that a head of the beaſt was then wounded, when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great ſlew <hi>Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> the two laſt perſecuting Emperours, ſet vp true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and brought peace to the Churches. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Roman Empire was greatly wounded, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the tyrannie of it. The holy Ghoſt doth not ſet downe which of the ſeuen heads were thus woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but in generall ſaith, one of them. Nowe it is verie probable, that he meaneth the ſixt head: For we doe not reade of anie ſuch wound in the former fiue which were paſt. Neither can it be vnderſtood of the ſeuenth head, which was the Papacie, becauſe it receiued no ſuch wounde as yet. It followeth then, <hi>that the wound was in the ſixt head,</hi> that is, in the Empire. But we reade of no Emperour that did ſo wound the beaſt, as did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. And therefore it is verie probable, nay, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one, that the holy Ghoſt here pointeth at him.</p>
                  <p>But it followeth, that his deadly wound was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to wit, by theſe wicked Emperours which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as <hi>Conſtantius, Iulianus, Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others, which afreſh did ſet vp Idolatrie, and perſecuted the Church. Nowe vppon the healing of this wound, it is ſaid, that all the world wondred, and followed the beaſt: that is, manie nations, or the greateſt part of the world did ſubmit themſelues to the Roman tyrannie. For ſure it is, ſome kingdomes were neuer ſubiect to the Empire of Rome, as ſome part of Aſia, and ſome part of Africa.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now is ſhewed how all the ſubiects of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, did worſhip the Dragon: that is, they maintained that worſhip, which he liked and loued, that is, the worſhip of idols, which the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>the worſhip of diuels.</hi> And it is ſaid alſo,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.20.21.</note> 
                     <hi>they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the beaſt</hi>: that is, they did all with one accord ſubmit themſelues both to the religion, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the beaſt: that is, to the Popes, as they were the ſeuenth head of the Empire. For, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo I ſay againe, the holy Ghoſt heere ſpeaketh of the Empire, when it was in the greateſt glorie and exaltation; yea when all the worlde wondred and followed the beaſt; yea, when all admired the great and large dominion of the Roman empire; and ſaid within themſelues, who is like vnto the beaſt? who is able to warre with him? Now, the Empire of Rome was neuer ſo great and powerful, as when the Popes were heads thereof, I meane when they executed the whole ciuill iuriſdiction of the empire, beſides their Eccleſiaſticall power, which now did both meete in one. For now the Papacie was aloft, and the Roman Empire ioyned with it: ſo that the eyes of the world were dazeled with the pompe and magnificence thereof, and they ſaid, What is like vnto it? or who is comparable to the Pope, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth head thereof? For then the blinde worlde thought that the power of the Popes, was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboue all things in this world, but alſo did reach euen vnto heauen and hell. For they imagined that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18003:102"/>
the Pope might carie to heauen whom hee would; and whom he would, he might caſt downe to hell: and therefore who could warre with the beaſt? And thus wee ſee the reaſon of their wonderment, and of their ſpeech. All ſtories and experience it ſelfe doe ſhew, that there was neuer anie power in the world ſo wondred at, as the vſurped power and maieſtie of the Pope, after he came to bee the head of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man monarchie. For then the world ſuppoſed that hee had power, euen as God: and that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſet vp kings and Emperours at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Then it is cleere, that vnder the dominion of the Popes, Rome hath beene in her higheſt exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glorie. For the Papacie was the ſeuenth head of the beaſt, whereby the whoore of Babylon was ſupported in her moſt magnificall pompe and pride.</p>

                  <p>Here are ſet down the proud and blaſphemous ſpeeches both of the old, and new Romane Empire; and of the old, and new Romane Emperours. For this beaſt (as I ſaid before) comprehendeth al the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, both vnder the Heathen Emperours, and the Popes. Touching the great things, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, which the old perſecuting Emperours haue belched out againſt the God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it wold require
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18003:102"/>
a volume to ſet them downe in particulars. I wil ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only mention two or three for exampels ſake: As firſt that of <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> which would haue his image ſet vp in temples to be worſhipped as God, and that the people ſhould ſweare by his name. <hi>Nero</hi> alſo did openly blaſpheme the name of Chriſt, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red diuine honour to be giuen vnto him. <hi>Domitian</hi> commanded that he ſhould be called God and Lord. Many others required the like things: and ſo al the world woondred and worſhipped this blaſphemous beaſt. Now as the ſixt head, which was the old em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Rome, was ful of the names of blaſphemy; ſo the ſeuenth head, which is the new Empire vnder the dominion of the Popes, which he here chiefely ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, did moſt of al blaſpheme. For the Pope did challenge vnto himſelfe al power both in heauen and earth: he would be worſhipped as God: he vſurped authority ouer the worde of God: he did take vpon him to forgiue ſinnes. He did moſt blaſphemouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon all the offices of Chriſt, as king, prieſt, &amp; prophet. He hath comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the Angels. He hath erected blaſphemous images, and cauſed pictures to be made of the Godhead. He boaſteth and craketh great things of his Papal power, of <hi>Peters</hi> keies, of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> chaire, of <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſion, of his miracles, of his two ſwords, and of his manifold praerogatiues roial. One of the Popes poiſoned his God: another caſt his God into the fire: another would eate his peacocke in deſpite of God. Some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> counted the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt a tale or a fable: ſome drank to the diuel: ſome ſaid, they could doe as much as God. It were infinit to ſet downe al their blaſphemies: for it is ſaide of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18003:103"/>
whoore of Babylon, that <hi>ſhe was full of the names of blaſphemy.</hi> Let this ſuffice for the vnderſtanding of this text, that as the olde heatheniſh Emperours did blaſpheme, ſo the Popes being heades of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, did moſt of al blaſpheme. And as it is here ſaid, they did not only blaſpheme the name of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did open their black and blaſphemous mouthes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>his tabernacle,</hi> that is, his church, calling it a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of heretickes, ſchiſmatickes, apoſtataes and ſuch like; <hi>and alſo againſt them that dwell in heauen,</hi> that is, the ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men, which are in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>Luther, Caluin, Melancthon</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is to be noted, that this mouth was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto this monſtrous beaſt, thus to blaſpheme and ſpeake great things.

But it is added, that this power of the beaſt thus to worke his actions, was limited vnto 42. monethes; ſo that although he rule and rage for a time, yet ſhal he not long continue.</p>

                  <p>Theſe two verſes do ſet forth the great power which was giuen vnto this beaſt, both in fighting againſt Gods people, and alſo ouercomming of them, and murdering of them by heapes. As we reade of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18003:103"/>
murdered in the firſt ten great perſecutions, and ten thouſands by the Popes, ſince they came to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ciuill authority and iuriſdiction of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire, and that in al countries and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Europe; as it is here ſaid, that <hi>power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him ouer euery kindred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tongue and nation.</hi> And it is added, that <hi>all that dwell vpon the earth,</hi> that is, al the ſubiects of the Roman monarchy, ſhal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the beaſt, and make a God of him; as we read they haue don. And the chiefe motiue therof, was his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous mouth, boaſting &amp; threatning great things if any did withſtand him: and alſo his mighty power and authority, whereby he bare downe al before him. For if any did but mute againſt him, he was ſure to ſmart for it. And thus through his tyrannicall power he ſubdued al nations vnder him, and made them ſtoupe and fal downe and worſhip him. But it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that for al this, none of Gods elect did worſhip him, or ſubmit themſelues to his religion, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but only thoſe that <hi>dwell vpon the earth,</hi> that is, earthly men: as papiſts, atheiſts, and reprobates, and al ſuch, <hi>whoſe names are not written in the booke of life.</hi>

                  <p>In the 10. verſe the iudgement and vengeance of God is denounced againſt the Romane monarchie, both former and latter; which, as it hath long oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the church with cruel bondage, and drawne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands into perpetual captiuity; ſo it ſelfe alſo ſhould be caſt downe, with al the adherents thereof, both in this life and that which is to come. For as the Romane Empire did tyranniſe ouer the world, and led milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into ſpirituall captiuity and bondage: ſo here it is auouched, that according to the iuſt lawe of quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it ſelfe ſhould be brought to the ſame lore. And as this beaſt had murdered many by the ſword; ſo he him ſelfe muſt be murdered by the ſword alſo: As the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 1.6</note> 
                     <hi>God is iuſt, and therefore will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe tribulation to them that trouble his Church.</hi> Now al this ſeemeth vnto me, to be a cleere prophecy of the fal and final deſtruction of the Romane Empire, which indeede conſidering the pitch that it was at, may ſeeme a thing ſtrange and incredible: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy-ghoſt ſtirreth vs vp to attention in the ninth verſe, as to a thing of great woonderment, and admiration: for if the Romane monarchie fall, the Papacy muſt of neceſſity fal with it. For the Romane Empire is that beaſt, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17. verse 3.</label> which beareth vp the whoore of Babylon, as appeareth in the 17. Chapter of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,

where we ſhal (God willing) plainely, and at large heare of the ioint deſtruction of them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>It is added: <hi>Heere is the patience and faith of the Saints.</hi> That is, here is required great patience of al Gods children, to waite, and carry til the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance and accompliſhment of thoſe things; and alſo faith and ful aſſurance to beleeue, that they ſhal in Gods appointed time come to paſſe. For few doo beleeue theſe things, and therfore wait not with pati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence for the accompliſhment thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I beheld another beaſt comming out of the earth,</hi>

                     <hi>which had two hornes like the Lamb, but he ſpake like the dragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing deſcribed the firſt beaſt which is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire: now the Holy-ghoſt commeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſecond beaſt, which is the Papacy, or the kingdome of the great Antichriſt: for although hee bee deſcribed before in regard of his monarchy, that is, the ciuill iuriſdiction, which hee exerciſed as he was the ſeuenth head of the beaſt, and head of the Empire; yet here he is deſcribed after another ſort, that is, according to his eccleſiaſtical authority: and therfore he is called another beaſt, or a beaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the former, in that he exerciſeth an other power, beſides the power of the heathen Emperours of Rome, which is his ſpirituall iuriſdiction,<note place="margin">Chap. 16 Ver. 13. Chap. 19. Ver. 20.</note> in which reſpect he is called the falſe prophet.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond beaſt riſeth out of the earth, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer roſe out of the ſea: then it appeareth that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is, by his breed, a ſonne of the earth; obſcurely borne, &amp; by little and little creeping vp out of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18003:105"/>
eſtate; as did the Turke. It is here moſt truly ſaid, that the kingdome of Antichriſt ariſeth out of the earth, &amp; is the very breed of the earth: for aſſuredly it neuer came from heauen. It was firſt hatched out of couetuouſneſſe, ambition, pride, murders, treaſons, poiſonings, ſorceries, enchantments, and ſuch like. For al ſtories do ſhew, that from theſe roots the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy grew to his exceeding height and altitude.</p>
                  <p>This ſecond beaſt hath <hi>two hornes, like the Lambe</hi>: Whereby is meant his ciuil and eccleſiaſtical power, or his kingdome, and Prieſthood; which he falſly pretendeth to come from the Lamb: and therefore he giueth in his armes two keies, and hath two ſwords carried before him. So <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight ſhewed himſelfe one day in apparrel as a Pope, and the next day in armour as the Emperour; and the two hornes in the Popes miter are ſignes hereof. But the Holy-ghoſt here telleth vs, that theſe two hornes are not the hornes of the Lambe, but only like the hornes of the Lamb: for he receiued not his power from the Lamb Chriſt; but from the diuel, that is, the dragon with ten hornes. Then thus it is, the Papacy is the ſeauenth head of the firſt beaſt, that is, the Empire; &amp; yet a beaſt by it ſelfe, with two hornes like the Lamb, in reſpect of his ioint power and authority, both ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and ciuil, in which reſpect he is called euen the eight: and one of the ſeuen, Chap. 17. ver. 11.</p>
                  <p>Although this ſecond <hi>beaſt haue two hornes like the Lamb, yet he ſpake like the dragon,</hi> that is, al his words and workes, practiſes and proceedings, lawes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, are for the dragon, of whom he hath his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and throne, and great authority. So that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18003:105"/>
he pretendeth in religion, and matters of Gods worſhip, as though he would be like the Lamb; yet aſſuredly hee is altogether for the dragon and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel: he is aſſured vnto them, as al experience doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he did all that the firſt beaſt could doe before him: &amp; he cauſed the earth, &amp; them that dwel therin,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>12</label> 
                     <hi>to worſhip the firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is ſhewed, that this ſecond beaſt was as migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtronge as the firſt beaſt, and could doo as much as he, euen in his preſence. Whereby is noted the great power, and authority of the Papacy, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming as much in the ſeruice of the dragon againſt God and his church, as euer the Empire of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and thoſe wicked Emperours could doo: yea he did much more againſt Chriſt and his religion, then euer the perſecuting Emperours could do, euen then when they were at their higheſt pitch. And al this he did in his preſence, that is, in the ſight and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen view of the whole Empire, or whole world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he cauſed the earth, and them that dwell therin,</hi> that is, al Papiſts, and worldlings, <hi>to worſhip the firſt beaſt,</hi> that is, to receiue the worſhip and religion of the old Roman tyranny, which ſet vp and maintained Idolatry. So then, although the power in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy came vnder the name of Chriſt, yet in truth it was the ſame that the power of the perſecuting Empire: for the heathen emperours condemned the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and ſet vp falſe worſhip, euen the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of diuels, which is Idolatry, and ſo do the Popes alſo. So then we ſee, that this ſecond beaſt is al for the firſt beaſt, that is, he leuieth al his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18003:106"/>
to ſet vp the worſhip and religion of the old Romane tyrants; and to force al men by cruel lawes and decrees, to receiue and embrace the ſame. So this ſecond beaſt is nothing better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt; nay in truth a great deale worſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two verſes do containe two ſpecial things: The one is, the falſe &amp; fained miracles of Antichriſt. The other is, the curſed effect thereof.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, which is the woonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which Antichriſt ſhould worke, it is here ſaid that he ſhould <hi>make fire come downe from heauen,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> did. The meaning whereof is not, that the Popes could indeed cauſe fire to come downe from heauen, as <hi>Elias</hi> did: but in the opinion of the blind world, they ſeemed to haue as great power as euer had <hi>Elias.</hi> For partly by counterfeit miracles, and partly by ſome ſtrange things done by the power of Sathan, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced world hath verily beleeued, that the Pope and his clergie had as great power to worke miracles, as euer had <hi>Elias.</hi>

                  <p>Touching the ſecond thing, which is the effect of theſe woonders: It is here ſayd that the inhabitants of the earth, that is, Papiſts and Worldlings, were groſſelie deceiued and deluded by them, euen by

                  <p>Now Antichriſt hauing gotten the world vnder him, by his counterfeit miracles, dooth lay his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make the Image of the beaſt. Now what is here meant by the image of the beaſt, is ſomewhat hard to diſcuſſe: ſome thinke, that by the image of the beaſt, which had the wound of a ſword, and did liue, is meant the repairing, and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the decaied eſtate of the empire, by the Popes, to his ful ſtrength and vertue. We doe read that the ſtate of the empire vnder <hi>Nero, Otho, Galba, and Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> was weak &amp; feeble, in compariſon of that which it was before, vnder <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Claudius.</hi> We doo reade alſo that the Gothes and Vandales made horrible rents and diſſipations in the Romane em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. We doe further reade, that the empire was deuided and rent in peeces; ſo that there was the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Eaſt, &amp; the emperour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Weſt; yea at
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18003:107"/>
laſt, the empire of the Weſt fel quite downe: ſo that for the ſpace of three hundred yeares and more, there was no Emperour of the Weſt, vntill the Biſhop of Rome <hi>Leo</hi> the third made <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the king of France, Emperour: Then was the empire of the Weſt againe erected, and in time grew to as great an height vnder the dominion of the Popes, as euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea and farre greater. Now I ſay, ſome do take this reſtoring of the decayed eſtate of the Empire, by the Popes, to his former ſtrength and power, to be the <hi>making of the image of the beaſt, which had the wound of a ſword, and did liue.</hi> But for mine owne part I cannot be of that opinion; and my reaſon is, that the reſtoring of the decaied eſtate of the empire to his former condition, was the ſetting vp of the beaſt himſelfe: for the empire is the beaſt, and not the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the beaſt: for we muſt needes graunt, that the beaſt, and the image of the beaſt, are two ſeueral things. But the Popes in recouering the empire to his priſtinate eſtate, ſet vp the beaſt againe: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the image of the beaſt. Therefore the image of the beaſt, cannot be vnderſtood of the reſtauration of the decaied eſtate of the empire. Beſides this, it is here ſaid, that the inhabitants of the earth had a great ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in making of this image. But the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the earth bare ſmal ſway in the recouering and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the empire. (For therein the Popes were al in al, after it came into their hands) Therfore this cannot be vnderſtood of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empire, but of ſome other thing: let vs then diligently ſearch out what may be the true meaning of this place. It muſt needes be graunted, that by the beaſt, which had the wound of a ſworde,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:18003:107"/>
and did liue, is meant the recouered eſtate of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as before verſ. 12. and by the image thereof, I vnderſtande the forme of gouerment: for an image doth ſignifie a likenes, a ſimilitude, a figure or forme of a thing. And as in all ciuil and eccleſiaſticall regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there is both a ſubſtance and a forme; a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a manner: ſo here, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>12</label> hauing before ſet downe that Antichriſt had erected the ſubſtance and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the old Romane tyranny; now he ſheweth, that he ſhould alſo ſet vp the image and forme of the ſame. For before ver. 12. it is ſaid, that Antichriſt this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d beaſt, cauſed the world to worſhip the firſt beaſt, that is, to receiue and imbrace the lawes, worſhip, and religion of the olde heatheniſh Romane tyrants, as before hath bin ſhewed: and now here is added, that hee did not content himſelfe with cauſing the inhabitants of the earth to worſhip the old beaſt, in the ſubſtance of his religion; but alſo he laieth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements vpon them, to make his Image, that is, to erect an externall forme of Eccleſiaſticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, after the verie patterne and forme of the gouernement of the old Empire; yea ſo like it, that it is called the verie image of the ſame. For as the forme of gouernement vnder the old Emperours, was cruell and tyrannicall, and altogether bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church: ſo the forme of Eccleſiaſticall gouernement vnder the Popes, was cruell and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, and altogether bent againſt the Church; and therefore heere it is called the Image of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is as like it as it can looke. Then it followeth, that Antichriſt hath ſet vp that externall forme of worſhip, which the Idolatrous Romans of old vſed;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18003:108"/>
and that he hath renewed the perſecuting Empire, not onely in ſubſtance of matter, but alſo in forme of gouernement: and therefore I conclude, that the Popiſh Church-policie, and externall regiment, is the verie Image of the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>Heere the inhabitants of the earth are ſaid to make the Image of the beaſt, becauſe they gaue their conſent to the making of it: for indeede the Popes themſelues were the chiefe agents and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in it.</p>
                  <q> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ver. </seg>15</label> And it was permitted vnto him, to giue a ſpirit vnto the Image of the beaſt; ſo that the Image of the beaſt ſhould ſpeake, and ſhould cauſe that as many as would not worſhip the Image of the beaſt, ſhould bee killed.</q>
                  <p>Heere is ſhewed, that this image of the beaſt was not a dead image, but a liuing image: for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt put a ſpirit into it; that is, life and power, and great authoritie; inſomuch that this Image could ſpeake; and not onely ſpeake, but ſpeake with great authoritie and terrour: ſo as whoſoeuer would not worſhip this Image, that is, ſubmit himſelfe to the Popiſh Hierarchie, ſhould bee put to death. But may ſome man ſay, How did this image ſpeake? I anſwer, by the Popes Clergie. For the Romiſh rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Cardinals, Abbots, Monks, Prieſts, Friers, and all that curſed corporation, were the verie breath, life, and ſpirit of this image: I meane, that the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud of their externall regiment, did lie in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof by the Clergie, as it were in certaine arteries and veines. For what was their outwarde
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18003:108"/>
forme of gouernement, without this cruell execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſtinging Clergie men, but as a dead I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage without life? But when Antichriſt had once conſecrated and erected his Romiſh prieſthood, then did hee put life into his Image, which before he had cauſed to bee made and erected. Then wee doe plainely ſee, that the popiſh Hierarchie is not a bare reſemblance of the old Roman policie, to ſtand as a picture on a wall, but hath a ſpirit put into it by the falſe Prophet, and ſpeaketh with ſuch power and terrour in all kingdomes, that it cauſeth all to bee put to death that will not ſubmit themſelues vnto it, and fall downe and worſhip the beaſt. Who knoweth not this, that as manie in all countries, as would not embrace poperie, and the old Roman ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie; the Popiſh Clergie, their inquiſitors, and other Officers, did condemne them in their Courts, as heretikes, ſchiſmatikes, and deliuered them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, being condemned, to the ſecular power to bee put to death.</p>

                     <p>And that no man might buy or ſell, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">verſ. </seg>17</label> ſaue he that had the marke, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name.</p>

                  <p>Antichriſt is not content to murder and maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre all in all countries, which will not worſhip the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the beaſt; that is, ſtoupe to his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authoritie: but hee will goe yet a ſteppe further, and will haue all ſorts of people brought in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18003:109"/>
bondage vnto him, as his marked ſeruants. For as men vſe to ſet a brand vpon their ſheepe and other cattell, and to eare-marke them, that it may openly and manifeſtly appeare to whom they appertaine: ſo doth Antichriſt this Romiſh beaſt, cauſe all men in all kingdoms to carie in open viewe his marke or brand, whereby all may ſee that they do appertaine vnto him.</p>
                  <p>It is heere ſaid, that all the vaſſals of Antichriſt, of what degree, eſtate, or condition ſoeuer, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his marke in their right hand, or in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: that is, they muſt openly profeſſe and practiſe the worſhip and religion of the beaſt. For the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is put for the profeſſion; and the right hand, for the action: ſo that in one of them at the leaſt, euery man muſt openly declare, that hee acknowledgeth the Pope of Rome to be Lord of his faith.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is added, <hi>That no man might buy or ſell, ſaue hee that had the marke, or the name of the beaſt, or the number of his name</hi>: the meaning is, that no man might traffique in the world, or haue anie doings amongſt men; nay, hee might not be ſuffered to liue, except hee had the marke of the beaſt in his forehead, or in his right hand; that is, vnleſſe he did profeſſe and practiſe the worſhip, the religion, the lawes, and decrees of the Pope. For the marke of the beaſt is put for his worſhip, religion, lawes, decrees, regiments, and policie.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer the Popes vaſſals haue not onely his marke vpon them, whereby they may be knowne, but alſo the name of the beaſt; for they muſt bee named after him, euen as children beare the name of their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18003:109"/>
Fathers, and muſt bee called of the Pope, or <hi>Papa,</hi> Papiſts. And not onely ſo, but alſo they haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuie marke vpon them, and that is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his name, which is <hi>Latinos,</hi> or profeſſours of the Latine religion, Latine kingdome, and Italian Church, as ſhall by and by appeare.</p>
                  <p>Now then to grow to a concluſion, and to make a briefe recapitulation of all thinges heere ſpoken concerning the ſecond beaſt, which is Antichriſt: Let vs conſider what increaſings and proceedings hee hath made, as it were by degrees.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, although he haue two hornes like the Lamb, that is, ciuill and eccleſiaſticall power; yet he ſpeaketh like the Dragon, that is, he bendeth all his power and authoritie, words and works for the diuell.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth as much as the firſt beaſt could do in the ſeruice of the Dragon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he cauſeth the firſt beaſt to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that is, eſtabliſheth the ſubſtance of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he maketh the image of the beaſt, that is, addeth a forme to the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, hee putteth life into his Image by his Clergie.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, he will haue this Image worſhipped, and yeelded vnto, on paine of death.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, he will haue all men of all conditions to weare his liuerie, and to receiue his marke, as it were his hired and couenant ſeruants.</p>
                  <q>Heere is wiſdome: Let him that hath wit, count the the number of the beaſt: for it is the number of a man,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18003:110"/>
and his number is ſixe hundred theeſcore and ſixe.</q>
                  <p>Now laſt of all the holy Ghoſt telleth vs that it is a verie high point of wiſedome and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to count the number of the beaſt, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſharpe and pregnant wit; and withall telleth vs, that it is the number of a man; that is, ſuch as a man endued with Gods Spirite may finde out. Then wee are encouraged to ſearch into it, ſith it is within the compaſſe of mans reach. It is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing. If therefore wee could find out his name, wee would deſire no more; then the field were wonne: for his name would diſcouer him, and deſcrie him to all the world, and quite ſtoppe the mouthes of the Papiſts, ſo as they ſhould neuer haue anie thing more to ſay. For if Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had ſaid expreſly and in plaine tearmes, that the Popes of Rome are this ſecond beaſt, and the verie Antichriſt himſelfe, then the Papiſts had beene put to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſilence, all matters quaſht, and all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies ended betwixt them and vs for euer. But heere the holy Ghoſt doth not tell vs his name plainely, but myſtically, as manie other things in this booke, that the worldlings which ſhould ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill them might be blinded, whileſt the eyes of Gods elect are opened to ſee into the truth of all theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Well, to come to the point: Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth onely heere ſet downe the numeratiue letters of the beaſts name. Hee wrote in Greeke, and he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetteth downe three Greeke letters or characters, which in Greeke numeration make ſixe hundred ſixtie ſixe.<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>
                     </note> Now further wee are to note, that the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18003:110"/>
numeratiue letters of the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doe make iuſt this number. And yet further we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue as a verie ſpeciall thing, that <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iren. lib. 5. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra haereſ.</note> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Father of the Church, who liued verie neere vnto the Apoſtles times, mentioneth this worde <hi>Lateinos,</hi> as the name of the beaſt. And moreouer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that it was a common receiued opinion in his time, and before, that the Beaſt ſhould be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Now then let vs conſider how this fitteth. Firſt, we know that the numeratiue letters of <hi>Lateinos</hi> doe iuſtly fit Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Greeke numeratiue letters. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we know that Antichriſt is the head of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church, or Latine Empire: and therefore this verie <hi>Lateinos.</hi> For here we doe not enquire after the name of anie particular man, but about the name of a kingdome; for the beaſt is a kingdome, and a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of men. Now Italy in old time was called <hi>Latinum,</hi> &amp; the Italians <hi>Latini</hi>: which noteth of what countrey the beaſt ſhould come. Moreouer, the beaſts name, or name of the Romane Empire is <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinos,</hi> becauſe the Empire both vnder the heathen tyrants, and the Popes eſpecially, had all their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeruice, prayers, lawes, decrees, writings, and tranſlations in Latine: all was in Latine, Latine. The Pope preferred his Latine tranſlation of the Bible, before the Hebrue and Greeke originals.</p>
                  <p>Thus then it is. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs flatly, that <hi>the number of the beaſt is ſixe hundred ſixtie ſixe: Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Lateinos</hi> is his name, which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iuſt that number. Therefore heere wee haue his name, heere hee is found. For if his name bee <hi>Lateinos,</hi> wee neede ſearch no further, wee
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18003:111"/>
know who it is, we know who is meant: for is not the Pope <hi>Lateinos</hi>? are not the ſucceſſion of them <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini</hi>? are they not the heads of the Latine Church, and Latine Empire? Haue they not all their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice in Latine? Are they not Latines? for what is the name of the Romane Empire but <hi>Latei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>? And what is the name of the Popiſh Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie but <hi>Lateinos</hi>? True it is indeed which the papiſts ſay, that manie names may bee inuented, whoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters make this number: but the Spirit of God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of fained names, for thereof can come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vncertaintie: but he willeth vs to count the number of his name, which then the beaſt had, that is, <hi>Lateinos.</hi> I doe thus then conclude. The beaſt is a kingdome, and the Papacie is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Latines: Therefore the Papacie is the beaſt. The papacie is <hi>Lateinos,</hi> and containeth the number of the beaſt. For what other monarchie can bee ſhewed ſince this Reuelation was giuen, whoſe numeratiue letters containe this foreſaid number? Aſſuredly none. And therefore out of all doubt Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> pointeth at the Roman Empire, and monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of the Popes. For <hi>Lateinos</hi> doth both containe the number of the beaſt, according to Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> computation, and alſo his name, which is the Latine Empire, or Romane Empire. And thus haue wee heard the deſcription of theſe two huge and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beaſts, the ſea beaſt, and the land beaſt; which both from the Apoſtles times hitherto haue indeede played the beaſts againſt Chriſt and his Church, and ſtill doe play the beaſts, and will neuer ceaſe playing the beaſts, till their hornes, and hoofes, heads, and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18003:111"/>
bodies be cleane cut off, which will be ſhortly, as we ſhall heare anon.</p>

                     <hi>Then I looked, and behold a Lambe ſtood on mount Sion, and with him an hundred fourtie and foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, hauing the Fathers name written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe at laſt the holy Ghoſt bringeth in Ieſus Chriſt vpon the Theater of the world, as it were to play his part in this tragedie, and to helpe the poore weake woman, which we heard of before, againſt the Dragon, and the two monſtrous beaſts, which would haue torne her in peeces, and vtterly deuoured her, if this Lambe Ieſus Chriſt had not ſtept in and reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. Well, now commeth in our Lord Ieſus, and beginneth to ſtirre in theſe matters, and to take vpon him the protection and defence of the poore help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe woman, againſt both the dragon, &amp; the dragons two great inſtruments. But may ſome man ſay, What is a poore Lambe to encounter with a dragon, with a Lyon, with a Leopard, and a Beare? I anſwer, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt be a lamb to his church, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world, and the Lamb that was a ſlaine ſacrifice from the beginning,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18003:112"/>
for the redemption of his elect: Yet to all his enemies he is a moſt ſtrong and terrible Lyon, euen the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> as he is called before. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>5.5</label> Now this moſt terrible Lyon, euen the Lord of hoſts, the Lord mightie in battell, commeth forth to protect and defend his Church againſt all her enemies, who is of ſuch infinite might and puiſſance, that neither the old Dragon, nor his young imps, nor all the curſed helhounds that barke and bite, and take their part, ſhall euer bee able to ſtand in his hands: For rage they neuer ſo much, hee will hamper them all well enough. For though he haue giuen them the reine a long time, and let them alone, and ſuffred them to play the tyrants with the woman his ſpouſe; yet now he will no longer put it vp at their hands, but will vp and maintaine the womans cauſe, and beare her out againſt them all: nay, hee will make readie his bow, that he may ſhoote off, and make his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes drunke in the bloud of her and his enemies, and will whette his glittering ſword, that hee may ſheath it in the heart of Antichriſt and all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Therefore now let both the great beaſts and their Sire looke to themſelues: for heere comes in one that will knocke them all downe, and lay them in the duſt, that they ſhall neuer riſe vp againe. For this cauſe now at length Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in a viſion ſeeth a Lambe ſtand vpon mount Sion; that is, Chriſt preſent with his Church. For mount Sion was an ancient figure of the Church; as it is written: Mount Sion lying Northward is faire in ſituation:<note place="margin">Pſal. 48.2.</note> it is <hi>the ioy of the whole earth,</hi> and <hi>the citie of the great king.</hi> And againe, <hi>The law ſhall goe forth of Sion,</hi>

                     <hi>and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18003:113"/>
the word of the Lord from Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeth heere <hi>with the Lambe an hundred fortie and foure thouſand</hi>: that is, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members of the Church, putting a certaine number for an vncertaine, and ſpecially alluding to the ſealing of the twelue tribes of Iſrael, as before hath beene ſhewed. For it might bee demaunded, where the Church was, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>7.4.</label> when all the world wondred, and followed the firſt Beaſt? and alſo when all, both ſmall and great, rich and poore, receiued the marke of the ſecond Beaſt? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> anſwereth, that euen then in the middeſt of the heate of perſecutions God had his hid &amp; inuiſible church, whom Ieſus Chriſt did protect and preſerue euen in the verie flames of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, being alwayes preſent with them, and amongſt them, as he ſaid to his Diſciples a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his bodily departure from them. <hi>Lo, I am with you euen vnto the end of the world.</hi> And heere hee is ſaid to <hi>ſtand vpon mount Sion with his hundred fortie and foure thouſand.</hi> And it is added, that this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods faithfull elect children <hi>had the Fathers name written in their foreheads</hi>: That is, they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and practiſe the doctrine and religion of God their Father onely, vtterly renouncing and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the worſhip and religion of the Beaſt. For the Fathers name in this place is ſet oppoſite to the marke of the Beaſt; to ſignifie, that as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Antichriſt receiued his marke: ſo the true worſhippers of God receiued his brand, which is his Spirit, and the fruits therof, whereby they were perfectly diſcerned from thoſe which had the beaſts
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18003:113"/>
marke. So then it cleerely appeareth from this place, that God preſerued many thouſands of his true worſhippers, euen in the daies of the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, when there ſeemed to bee verie fewe or none remaining vppon the earth, as it was in the dayes of <hi>Elias.</hi> In vaine therefore doe the Papiſts aske vs, where our Church was before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, ſith the holy Apoſtle heere ſtoppeth their mouth, and telleth vs plainely, that Chriſt had his little flocke in the wilderneſſe, euen then, when it was in greateſt ſtreightes, and as wee ſay, driuen to the wals. And therfore viſibilitie is no ſound note of the Church, as the Papiſts doe moſt ignorantly diſpute. For it is a fond and abſurd kind of reaſoning, to ſay there is no Church at all, becauſe it doth not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appeare: as if a man ſhould reaſon that there is no Moone in the heauens, becauſe ſometimes there is none ſeene, as in the change.</p>
                  <q>And I heard a voice from heauen, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Heere is ſet forth how this companie of true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers doe magnifie and praiſe God, for his great mercies towards them. Firſt, <hi>Iohn heareth a voyce from heauen,</hi> that is, an heauenly voice, or the voice of the Church praiſing and glorifying God. For wee haue heard before, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>8.1</label> that heauen in this Booke is ſometimes put for the Church vppon

the earth, and the reaſons thereof: Wherſoeuer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church is aſſembled to heare the word, and to pray, and giue thanks; there is a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or an heauenly voice.

                  <p>Hitherto the holy Ghoſt hath taught vs how the Church was preſerued vnder the tyrannie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and greateſt waues of perſecutions; and that euen then they did purely and faithfully worſhip the true God. Now he proceedeth to foreſhew the ruine and downfall of Antichriſt, and plainely to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the vtter decay of the kingdome of Babell. This doctrine therefore we are to hearken vnto with great attention and cheerefulneſſe, becauſe it doth ſo much concerne our good, &amp; the good of the whole church, alſo becauſe we liue in the dayes, wherin we ſee it is in part fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore wee are to vnderſtand, what is meant by this Angell heere mentioned, to wit, not anie celeſtiall Angell, or inuiſible ſpirit, as it is ſundrie
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18003:115"/>
times taken before: but by this Angell, and the two Angels following, are meant all the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell, which ſhould bee raiſed vp in theſe laſt dayes, for the ouerthrow of Rome, and the deliuering of the Church from vnder the captiuitie of Antichriſt: which may plaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y appeare by this, that it is ſaid, this Angell preacheth the euerlaſting Goſpell vnto them that dwell on the earth, which cannot properly agree to the celeſtiall ſpirits. Wee haue heard out of the tenth chapter, that Ieſus Chriſt did open the little booke, which is the Bible, and did giue authoritie to his faithfull Miniſters to goe preach and publiſh the doctrine thereof to manie nations, countries, and kingdomes: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>10.11.</label> nowe vnto that agreeth this which is heere ſpoken of, and is a further opening and declaring of that which is there ſet downe. For as there Ieſus Chriſt commeth downe from heauen, and openeth the little booke, which had beene long ſhut vp vnder the darkneſſe of Poperie, and the ſmoake which came out of the bottomleſſe pit: ſo heere Chriſt Ieſus raiſeth vp his faithfull Miniſters and preachers, to publiſh and proclaime the doctrine of the Goſpell, which had long lyen hidde vnder the outragious perſecutions of the two monſtrous and moſt hideous beaſts. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>18.1</label> To this alſo agreeth that which is written in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of this Booke, where Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſeeth an Angell come downe from heauen, hauing great power, ſo that the earth was lightened with his glorie. By which Angell is meant all the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of this age. And the Angell is ſaide to haue great power: For what is more powerfull then the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18003:116"/>
miniſterie of the word. And moreouer it is ſayd, that the earth was lightened with his glorie, that is, with the brightneſſe of the preaching of the Goſpel, whereby the darkeneſſe of Poperie was diſperſed and driuen away, and Babylon falleth vpon it, as there you may reade, and as heere we ſhall ſee the like effect by and by.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is heere ſayd, that <hi>this Angell flieth in the middeſt of heauen</hi>: that is, verie ſwiftly carrieth this euerlaſting Goſpell thorough all the Churches. For when Gods appointed time was come, wherein he would goe about the ouerthrowe of Poperie, he cauſed his euerlaſting Goſpell to be ſet abroach, and to ſpread ouer many kingdoms and nations, as wee ſee this day. Now becauſe theſe kingdoms, where God would haue the knowledge of his Goſpell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulged, were manie and great, therefore heere is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition required: and this Angell doth carie it, not ſtanding but flying. And all this we ſee perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with our eyes, when God raiſed vp <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Melancthon, Peter Viret, Caluin, Bucer, Bullinger, Peter Martyr,</hi> and all their worthy ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours vnto this day, which haue ſpred the euerlaſting Goſpell verie farre, and caried it verie ſwiftly ouer England, Scotland, Germanie, Denmarke, Polonia, Sweuia, Ruſſia, and many parts of France and Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Another reaſon why this Angell is ſaid to flie in the middeſt of heauen, is becauſe no power of man ſhall euer be able to ſtay the courſe of this euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel which this Angel carieth abroad, no more then men are able to ſtoppe the courſe of the Sunne in the heauens, or a cloud in the skie. For this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18003:116"/>
Angel flyeth in the midſt of heauen, far aboue the reach of the beaſt, and al Kinges and Potentates that ſtand for the kingdom of the beaſt: Therefore let them doe al what they can, they ſhal neuer be able to ſtop the courſe of the Goſpel. For it is called the arme of God, &amp; his very arme holdeth it forth to the world, and who is able to bend it in, or to turne it backward?</p>
                  <p>There be three reaſons, why the Goſpell is called euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is in his owne nature euerlaſting,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.25.</note> as it is written, <hi>the worde of the Lord indureth for euer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe it putteth vs in poſſeſſion of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting things. As it is written; <hi>Thy word, O Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> 
                     <hi>endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer in heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly &amp; principally, becauſe as it was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichriſt was hatched: ſo it ſhal continue, when he and his kingdome is dead and rotten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saying with a loud voice; Feare God,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ver. </seg>7</label> 
                     <hi>and giue glory vnto him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is ſette down the doctrine, which this Angel preacheth with a loud voice, that is, with great zeale. The ſumme whereof is this, <hi>Feare God, and giue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto him, and worſhip him that made heauen and earth, &amp;c.</hi> The ſenſe is, that the true and euerliuing God ſhould only be feared, and worſhipped, and all glory ſhould be giuen to him alone through Chriſt, and none to Antichriſt, none to Cardinals, and Legats; none to Angelles, none to Saintes, none to images, roods, croſſes, and crucifixes. Here then is ſet downe an abridgement of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this euerlaſting Goſpell, namely that men
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18003:117"/>
ſhould onely feare God and worſhip him, and giue all glory to him alone, and not to any creatures. And the reaſon is yeelded, becauſe the houre of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is come,<note place="margin">Deut. 33 10 Iſay 42.4 Zeph. 2 3. Pſal. 119.13</note> that is, the time of the manifeſtation of the Goſpel, or lawes of the moſt high God: for ſo the word iudgement is often taken in the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>Here we are to obſerue one ſpeciall thing, to wit, that the Goſpel, which this Angel flyeth withal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the briefe ſumme of al the doctrine which <hi>Luther, Caluin, Peter Martyr</hi> and the reſt haue taught out of Gods word, &amp; agreeth in al points with it. For what other thing did they al preach, teach and write, but that men ſhould turne from idols to the liuing God? from fearing, glorifying, &amp; worſhipping crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to feare, worſhip, and glorifie God alone which hath made al things? What other thing doo all the Preachers of this age publiſh &amp; proclaime in al their ſermons, but this; <hi>Feare God and giue glory onely to him?</hi> Is not this the Epirome and ſhort ſumme of the doctrine of all the Preachers of England, Scotland, Germany, Fraunce, Denmarke, and all the reſt? and therefore I conclude, that this Angel muſt needes be vnderſtood of the preachers of this laſt age, which now theſe foureſcore yeares haue founded the Trumpet of the Goſpell againſt all the inuentions of Popery. And bleſſed bee God, wee ſee theſe thinges fall out in our daies, and are eye-witneſſes of the fulfilling of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there followed another Angell, ſaying, It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon that great City: for ſhe gaue to all nations to drinke the wine of the wrath of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:18003:117"/>Here is ſet downe the bleſſed effect of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of this euerlaſting Goſpel, which is the downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Babylon. For as when the cleere ſunne ariſeth vppon the earth, the thick miſts and cloudes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed: euen ſo when the bright beames of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel do ſhine forth vnto the world, Babylon that darke kingdome vaniſheth away incontinently. And as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the eighteenth Chapter: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>18.1.2.</label> 
                     <hi>So ſoone as the earth was lightened with the glory of this euerlaſting Goſpell, Babylon immediately falleth.</hi> Therefore now before I goe any further, my purpoſe through the aſſiſtance of God, is to prooue theſe fiue points out of this verſe, and that which follweth vnto the twentith Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit:</p>

                  <p>Secondly, that Rome ſhal fall, and how.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that Rome ſhal fal finally, and come to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſolation in this life.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, the cauſes of the vtter ruine and ouerthrow thereof.</p>
                  <p>But before I go about to prooue that Babylon here is Rome, I would haue it carefully obſerued,<note place="margin">How Rome is to be taken.</note> what is meant by Rome, <hi>viz.</hi> not the topographie of Rome, that is, ſo much grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d only as is compaſſed within the wals of that City, but the regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, gouerment, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue that is claimed by vertue of that monarchie, whereof Rome is the head. By Rome is meant the power and authority of Rome: or to ſpeake plainelie, by Rome is meant the Romane monarchy. Further, we are here to obſerue the reaſon why the Holy-Ghoſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:18003:118"/>
calleth Rome Babylon: for Rome litterally &amp; proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, is not Babylon, in as much as they were two diuers Cities, one in Italy, the other in Chaldaea: But Rome is called Babylon myſtically, figuratiuely, &amp;, as the Holy-ghoſt ſpeaketh, ſpiritually, and by a kind of alluſion.<note place="margin">Chap. 11 Verſ. 8. A reaſon why Rome is called Babylon.</note> For as the old Eaſterne Babylon did a long time oppreſſe the church of the Iewes: ſo Rome this Weſterne Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath long oppreſſed the church of the Chriſtians. As the Eaſterne Babylon did many yeeres hold downe the people of God, in miſerable bondage and ſeruitude: ſo the Weſterne Babylon did a long time keepe the Chriſtian Church, in ſpiritual thraldome and miſery. In which reſpectes Rome is ſpiritually compared to Sodome and Egypt: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>11.8.</label> To So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for filthineſſe, and to Egypt for idolatry, and keeping Gods Church in ſpirituall bondage, and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. And thus we ſee the reaſon why Rome is called Babylon, which is not ſimply, and properly, but after a ſort, that is, by a phraſe of ſpeech, or trope which they call a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> or changing of names, when that is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to one thing, which is proper to another, for the likeneſſe of quality that it hath with it, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing ſhewed the reaſon why Rome is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Babylon, and what is meant by Rome; we are to proceed to the firſt point, which is, to prooue that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon in this place ſignifieth Rome, which although it bee granted of all ſound diuines, and auouched in the writings of the beſt learned both new and olde, ſo as it ſhal need no great proofe: yet I wil ad three or foure reaſons out of this booke, to make it more plaine and apparant. Firſt therefore, I doe thus reaſon out of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18003:118"/>
the ſeuenteenth Chapter and laſte verſe: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17.18.</label> 
                     <hi>Babylon is that great City which reigneth ouer the Kinges of the earth</hi>: but there was no other City which did reigne ouer the Kings of the earth, when <hi>Iohn</hi> writte this book, but only Rome: Therefore Rome is Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. For as for Ieruſalem, it was at that time made an heap of ſtones. The firſt propoſition is auouched by the Angel of God, expounding vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> what is meant by the great whoore, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17.1.</label> whoſe damnation he had ſhewed him before; and by the woman which ſate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a ſcarlet coloured beaſt. <hi>The woman which thou ſaweſt, ſaith the Angel to Saint Iohn, is the great City, which raigneth ouer the Kinges of the earth,</hi> That is to ſay, Rome, or the Romiſh ſynagogue, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Church. For the Angel could not ſpeake more plainely, except he ſhould haue named Rome, then to ſay thus, <hi>The woman the great whoore of Babylon is the great City, which raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth.</hi> For if one ſhould ſay, the great City of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, euery man knoweth that thereby is meant London; if one ſhould ſay, the great City of France, euery one know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that thereby is meant Paris: ſo when the Angell ſayth, <hi>the great city which raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth</hi>; all that liued in thoſe times knew that,<note place="margin">Babylon is Rome.</note> therby was meant Rome. For Rome was the chiefe City of the monarchie, and is put in this booke for the whole monarchie, and the religion thereof, as hath beene ſayd before.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond reaſon is this. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17 verse 5.</label> 
                     <hi>Babylon is the mother of whoredomes, and abominations of the earth. Babylon is that great whoore, with whom haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings of the earth,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But Rome, &amp; none but Rome is ſuch a one. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rome is Babylon.</p>
                  <p>My third argument is this. Babylon is that City which hath had ſeuen ſeuerall gouerments. But only Rome hath had ſeuen ſeueral kind of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rome is Babylon.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition is prooued from the words of the Angel, expounding vnto Iohn what is meant by the ſeuen heads of the ſcarlet coloured beaſt, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the woman ſate. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17 9.</label> 
                     <hi>The ſeuen heads (ſayth he) are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Kings,</hi> that is, ſeauen orders, or ſtates of kingly gouerment: for ſeuen Kings in this place are not put for ſeuen ſeueral men, which were Kings, as ſome do take it:<note place="margin">Dan 7.17.</note> but for ſeuen ſeueral gouerments, as it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Daniel. The foure great beaſtes,</hi> ſayth the Angel there, <hi>are foure Kinges,</hi> that is, foure kingdomes, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerments, or monarchies, as al men know. So here by ſeuen Kinges is meant the ſeuen ſeuerall regiments of Rome: That is to ſay, by Kings, Conſuls, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiri, Dictators, Triumuiri, Emperours, and Popes, wherof <hi>the firſt fiue were then fallen</hi> when <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote, <hi>one was,</hi>

                  <p>My laſt argument is this. Babylon is that City which is ſituate vpon ſeuen hilles: but onely Rome of all Cities in the world is ſituated vppon ſeuen hilles: therefore Rome is Babylon.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition is auouched by the Angel, which ſaith in the ſeuenteenth chapter, that the ſeuen heads of the ſcarlet coloured beaſt, <hi>are ſeuen mountaines, whereon the woman ſitteth,</hi> that is, ſeuen hilles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the City of Rome is ſcituated, whoſe names are theſe: Capitolinus, Palatinus, Auentinus, Exquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Celius, Viminalis, and Quirinalis, as al Poets, and Hiſtoriographers doo teſtifie. One ſayth thus of Rome.

                     </gap>, <hi>the City with ſeuen heades,</hi> that is, ſeuen hilles. It is cleere then by theſe reaſons, that Babylon in this place ſignifieth Rome. As for the expoſition of the Papiſts, which affirme that Babylon here ſignifieth the vniuerſall ſociety of the wicked, it is fond &amp; ridiculous: for the Holy ghoſt ſayth,<note place="margin">Chap. 17. Chap. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Babylon is that City which raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth.</hi> But to ſay that the vniuerſall ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the wicked raigneth ouer the Kinges of the earth, is abſurd and ridiculous. Therefore to ſay that Babylon is the vniuerſall ſociety of the wicked, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde and ridiculous. The diſtinction of the Ieſuits here is alſo as friuolous as their expoſition: for they ſay, if Babylon be Rome, then it muſt be vnderſtood of Rome vnder the heathen Emperours: but not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes. But the Angel ſayth, <hi>the woman, that is, the whoore of Babylon,</hi> or Antichriſt <hi>ſitteth vpon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mountaines: ergo</hi> ſhee ſitteth at Rome, and Rome is the ſeat of Antichriſt; and conſequently Rome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes is Babylon. Moreouer, we may reaſon thus againſt the Popiſh diſtinction: That which was Babylon vnder the heathen Emperours, is the ſame which is here prophecied to bee the chiefe City and ſeat of Antichriſt. But Rome was then Babylon:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18003:120"/>
                     <hi>ergo</hi> Rome is now Babylon: for Rome is that City which the Angel ſayth ſhoulde bee the ſeat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: And this book doth ſhew, that the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhoulde raigne in the ſame City, where the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours had raigned: &amp; therfore it ſtandeth firme, that Rome vnder the Popes is Babylon.</p>
                  <p>This then beeing graunted, that Babylon here is Rome; it followeth that Rome ſhall fall: for the Holy-Ghoſt ſayth, <hi>Babylon is fallen,</hi> ſpeaking in the preſent tenſe, as the maner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture is in prophecying of things to come. For whatſoeuer God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to paſſe, is, as it were, already don, becauſe of the certainty of it:<note place="margin">Rome ſhall fall.</note> and for this cauſe alſo the word is doubled: <hi>It is fallen, It is fallen.</hi> Wee ſee then moſt cleerly, that almoſt 1500. yeers before Rome began to fal, the certaine fall thereof was foretold. This place of it ſelfe, is cleere inough to prooue my ſecond point, which is, that Rome ſhal fal. But my purpoſe is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and gather all the fiue Chapters following to certaine heades, to prooue the maine points which I haue propounded: firſt then I reaſon thus to proue the ſecond point, that Rome ſhall fall. That City and kingdome which hath the ſeuen vialles of Gods wrath emptied and powred downe vppon it, cannot ſtand, but muſt needes fall. But Rome is that City, which hath the ſeuen vialles of Gods wrath powred downe vppon it: Therefore Rome cannot ſtande long, but muſt needes fall. The propoſition is manifeſt, and not to bee denied. The aſſumption is prooued throughout al the ſixteene Chapter, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the tenth and the twelfth verſes, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>16. Ver. 10 Verſ. 12</label> where <hi>the vials of Gods wrath are expresſlie ſaide to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18003:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
downe vpon the throne of the beaſt</hi>: and in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe of that Chapter it is auouched, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ver. </seg>2</label> that <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond viall was powred down vpon the men which had the marke of the beaſt, and vppon them which worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his image:</hi> Howe then can the throne of the beaſt hould out? or how can they which haue receiued the beaſtes marke ſtand vp long? For there is a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis or vehemency in the manner of ſpeeche. For he dooth not ſimply ſay, the wrath of God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>15. verse 7.</label> but the fulneſſe of Gods wrath: he dooth not ſay, ſhould bee a little ſprinkled, but powred downe as it were by pailefulles vppon the kingdome of the beaſt. How then can the kingdome of the beaſt ſtande, which hath ſo many great ordinances, and ſo many double cannons diſcharged and ſhot off againſt it? Surely it muſt needes fal.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond reaſon is this. <hi>The beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is, ſhall go into perdition.</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17</label> But Rome is the beaſt that was and is not, and yet is: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rome ſhal goe into perdition. The aſſumption is ſet downe Chapter. 17. verſe. 8. For the Romane mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie was great in the daies of <hi>Iulius Caeſar, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, Claudius, Tiberius;</hi> and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>it was.</hi> But in the raigne of <hi>Nero, Otho, Galba,</hi> and <hi>Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> it was greatlie decayed: and therfore it is ſaid, <hi>it is not</hi>; meaning ſo great as it had beene: and yet in ſome ſort it was: and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>and yet is. Now this beaſt ſhall go into perdition.</hi> Therefore the Romane monarchie ſhall bee deſtroyed; and conſequently, the Papacie. For the Romane Empire holdeth vp the Papacie, as it is written, <hi>that the woman or whoore
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18003:121"/>
of Babylon ſitteth vppon the Scarlet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coloured beaſt, which had ſeuen heades and tenne hornes</hi>: that is, the Roman monarchie, which beareth vp the whoore, and beareth vp the Papacy: but the Holy-ghoſt ſayth, <hi>this beaſt,</hi> that is, the Romane Empire, <hi>ſhall go into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17. verse 8.</label> Then it followeth that the papacy ſhal follow after: for if the beaſt that ſhe ſitteth vpon, &amp; which beareth her, fal vnder her, then ſhee muſt needes fall together with him. But we ſee, God be thanked, that the Roman monarchie is in a manner quite fallen, therefore the Papacy cannot ſtand long.</p>
                  <p>My third argument is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The beaſt that was and is not, being euen the eight, &amp; one of the ſeuenth, ſhall go into deſtruction.</hi> But Rome is the beaſt that was and is not, being the eight, and one of the ſeuenth: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>17. verse 11</label> therefore Rome ſhall go into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The aſſumption is ſet downe Chapter 17. verſe 11. For the Papacy or dominion of the Popes, is the ſeuenth head of the beaſt in reſpect of their ciuil power; and yet a beaſt by themſelues, that is, an eight in reſpect of their eccleſiaſticall power. Nowe the Angel ſayth flatly, <hi>they ſhall both together go into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> that is, both the Empire and the Papacy. For as the dominion of the Popes goeth downe, ſo alſo their worſhip and religion, goeth downe with it, and for this cauſe it is expreſly ſet downe in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>19. verse 20</label> that <hi>the beaſt and the falſe Prophet,</hi> that is, the Romane Empire, and the Papacy, <hi>were both deſtroied together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sith then the Holy-Ghoſt hath ſpoken it twiſe for failing, that Rome ſhall goe into perdition, and ſhall
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18003:121"/>
goe into deſtruction; I take it to be a very ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that Rome ſhall fall, and ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But how ſhall it fall, may ſome man ſay? or wherein ſhall it fall? I anſwer, that it ſhall fall in the credite and eſtimation of her doctrine: It ſhall fall in wealth and riches:<note place="margin">How Rome ſhall fall.</note> It ſhall fall in power and authoritie. And in all theſe it ſhall fall by degrees, as it did riſe vp by degrees: It ſhall not fall at once, as it did not riſe vp at once.</p>
                  <p>This is ſet downe in the ſixteenth chapter, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>16. v. 12</label> where the fall of Rome is compared to the drying vppe of the riuer Euphrates, which was dried vp by degrees: Thus it is: Euphrates was a great Riuer, which did runne very neere vnto the olde Babylon in Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea, and it was the wall and fortification of the Citie; in ſo much that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> the kings of the Medes and Perſians, laying ſiege againſt it, could not take it till by policie they digged great trenches, and deriued the waters another way, and ſo dried them vppe, that the Holie Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>The vvay vvas prepared for them to paſſe ouer.</hi> Now, as this Euphrates was the ſtrength and fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of old Babylon: ſo the honour, wealth, riches, power, and authoritie of Rome, is the verie forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>16.12.</label> But the puniſhing Angell is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to poure downe the Viall of wrath vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Euphrates: that is, vppon all that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth Rome, or fortifieth Rome, and foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it dried vppe; that is, all the credite, power, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and authoritie of ROME did diminiſh day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vppon it, doeth diminiſh, and ſhall diminiſh
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18003:122"/>
by degrees vnto the end of the world. For the vtter deſtruction of Rome is not yet come, but it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decayed from that it was foureſcore yeares ago: And if it continue decaying foureſcore yeeres mo, as aſſuredly it ſhall, then will it bee brought to a lowe ebbe. Since <hi>Luthers</hi> time wee knowe how the Popes Euphrates hath dried vp; but there is yet much water left, and it is yet too deepe for the kings of the earth to paſſe ouer and take it. But it ſhall ebbe ſo lowe, that the kings of Europe ſhall eaſily paſſe ouer, and take it, as wee ſhall heare anon. But in the meane time we ſee that it falleth, and that it is in falling, and the worke of God goeth forward euerie day. For now in this age, God bee thanked, manie kings and princes, with great multitudes of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, haue their eyes opened to behold, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh religion is abominable;<note place="margin">The kings of the earth in this age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Pope.</note> and that the Papacie is the verie kingdome of the great Antichriſt. And whereas before they worſhipped the beaſt, now they holde vp their hands onely to the God of heauen, and glorifie him in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. Now wee ſee that manie lawes are made in ſundrie kingdoms and prouinces to aboliſh that vſurped power of the Biſhop of Rome: Manie acts, edicts, and iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſet forth in ſundrie nations and kingdomes of Europe to deſtroy, roote out, and deface all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Idolatrie and ſuperſtition, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt had erected in all kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Now the Popes which were honoured as Gods in the earth, are accounted, and adiudged as the moſt vile and abominable creatures that liue vpon
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:18003:122"/>
the earth. Doth not all this experimentally ſhew that Babylon is fallen, and that Babylon doth fall by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees? It is very palpable: we need no further proofe for this ſecond point. But heere wee are further to obſerue, that the Ieſuits perceiuing the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Rome,<note place="margin">The Ieſuits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir them, and why.</note> and the continuall drying of their Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, doe beſtirre them to ſtoppe the leake, that it might not drie vp altogether. Euen as when men let out the waters of great fiſh-ponds, ſo as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waxeth lowe, wee ſee the fiſhes skip and plunge, and take on wonderfully: So the Ieſuits perceiuing the waters of their Romiſh Euphrates to emptie and drie vp daily, doe mightily take on, digging and ſearching euerie day to open the ſprings, and to find out ſome freſh fountaines to maintaine their great fiſhpond, and to keepe the waters deepe enough, that there may be no ſafe paſſage ouer, for the kings of the earth to come and take their great Babylon. All this doth appeare out of the ſixteenth Chapter of this Propheſie: where Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in viſion ſeeth <hi>three vncleane ſpirits like Frogges,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>comming out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet.</hi> By which frogges the holy Ghoſt meaneth the Ieſuits and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie Prieſts,<note place="margin">The Ieſuits compared to frogs, and why.</note> which are compared to frogges for three reaſons. Firſt, that as frogges delight in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie lakes, and puddles; ſo the Ieſuits delight in the filthie puddles of idolatrie and ſuperſtition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as frogges make a great croaking in their mariſh grounds; ſo the Ieſuits make a great croaking in kings courts, in Noblemens houſes, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18003:123"/>

Thirdly, as frogs are all of one nature and qualitie, delighting in croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and liuing in puddle: ſo the Ieſuits are al of one mind and diſpoſition in euil, croaking euerie where to maintaine their Euphrates, and liuing dayly in whoredome, Sodomitrie, and al kind of outragious beaſtlineſſe. But that I may more fully perſwade the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of the reader, that by theſe frogs are meant the Ieſuits &amp; ſeminarie prieſts: let vs ſeriouſly weigh that which goeth before, and that which followeth after in this text, and wee ſhal diſcerne it to be verie cleere and apparant.

And preſently it followeth, that <hi>they gnawed their tongues for ſorrow</hi>: that is, they were ful of furie and rage, <label type="milestone">

And this is one circumſtantiall reaſon to proue theſe three frogges be vnderſtood of the Ieſuits.

                     </gap>he beaſt, and the falſe Prophet. Thirdly, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>three</hi> in number, being in the truth neerer vnto three thouſand, becauſe they proceed out of three ſeuerall mouthes the Dragon, the beaſt, and the falſe Prophet: that is, the diuell, the Roman Empire, and the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Three horrible monſters, three terrible bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares, which with one conſent conſpire together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpell, to vphold their Babylon, and to ſtop the leake of their Euphrates. Nowe theſe three Frogges are ſaid to come out of the mouth of the Dragon, the beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, becauſe they come with the verie mind and meſſage of the Pope, and the Roman Empire, and ſo conſequently with the verie mind and ſpirit of the Dragon. For they are the verie breath of the Pope, and the ſpirits of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, as like him, as if they had beene ſpitte out of his mouth. They are ſent on the diuels errand, and the Popes embaſſage into all countries and kingdomes, and are taught their leſſon what they ſhall ſay, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed what they ſhall doe, and what courſes they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18003:124"/>
ſhal take with all ſorts of men, both Kings, Nobles, and the meaner ſort: and for this cauſe the holy Ghoſt ſaith, they came out of the verie mouth, the verie heart, and the very bowels of the Pope, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. And although theſe Ieſuits and ſeminarie prieſts are called of their fauorits, Catholike doctors,<note place="margin">The holy ghoſt calleth the Ieſuits the ſpirits of diuels Chap. 16.14.</note> holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c. yet the holy Ghoſt ſaith flatly, they are the ſpirits of diuels, working falſe and fained miracles, and with great efficacie of errour, deluding and deceiuing the ſimple and blind multitude. Wee ſee then, that the holy Ghoſt in al this deſcription, doth plainly note out the Ieſuits and ſeminary prieſts. For to whom can theſe things here ſpoken of agree, but only to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And do not we which liue in theſe daies, ſenſibly ſee and diſcerne the fulfilling of al theſe things? Surely we can not but ſee &amp; feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnles we be wilfully blind, and do of purpoſe blindfold and hoodwink our ſelues.

God, againſt Chriſt, and againſt all true profeſſours of religion. The bettell betwixt them is heere called, <hi>The battell of the great day of God Almighty</hi>: that is, that Battell, wherein the Almightie God will haue the day, and goe away with the victorie. For it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the Ieſuits and ſeminarie Prieſts did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with the ſeduced kings of the earth ſo farre, as to gather them together to place,<note place="margin">The Ieſuits by their craftie perſwaſions ſhall bring the popiſh kings, and their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to a place where they ſhal be deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Some deriue <hi>Armageddon</hi> of <hi>Har,</hi> which in Hebrue ſignifieth a mountaine, and <hi>Megiddo,</hi> which is the place where the godly king <hi>Ioſias</hi> was ſlaine: and ſo this place ſhould be called <hi>Armageddon,</hi> the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> for the ſlaughter of kings that ſhall be there.<note place="margin">Zach. 12.11·</note> To the which the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> alludeth, ſaying: <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in Ieruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon, in the valley of Megiddo.</hi> Well, we doe ſee that all theſe ſignifications and deriuations of <hi>Armageddon</hi> come to one thing in effect; which is, that the great armies which aſſemble themſelues in battaile againſt the Lord, ſhall bee deſtroyed: and therefore it is not much materiall to diſpute, which is the more likely ſignification of the Word. But this let vs obſerue for our comfort, that whenſoeuer wee ſhal ſee the kings &amp; Captaines, Nobles and Potentates of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolicited by the Ieſuites, prieſts, and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to leuy great armies, and make great powers to fight againſt the Goſpell, and the true profeſſours thereof, for the maintenance of great Babylon, they ſhall not preuaile, but bee vtterly ouerthrowne and deſtroyed. As in part wee ſee fulfilled in the yeare of our Lorde 1588. when the great and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Armado of the Spaniards, as they thought, which was long in preparing againſt vs, and at laſt, by the inſtigation of the Ieſuites, brought vpon vs, came to <hi>Armageddon,</hi> as we know, God be praiſed. And in all time to come, in the like caſe, let them look for the like ſucceſſe. Well, now to grow to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this point; wee doe plainely ſee that Rome
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18003:126"/>
falleth, their kingdome waxeth darke, their Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes drieth vp, they eſpie it. The Dragon, the beaſt, &amp; the falſe Prophet ſend out their frogs into all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and kingdomes, hoping to preuent it by the help of the kings of the earth, and eſpecially the king of Spaine: but alas all in vaine! for they muſt come to <hi>Armageddon,</hi> when they haue done all that they can. For God fighteth from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt them, God bringeth them downe, and no power of man is able to vphold them.</p>
                  <p>But now let vs proceede to prooue the third maine point; which is, that Rome ſhall fall finally, and come to vtter deſolation. For all ſound Diuines are perſwaded of the fall of Babylon, and doe graunt that it falleth, and is in falling: but all are not ſo thoroughly perſwaded of the finall fall thereof in this life. Therefore now I wil proue by manifeſt Scripture, that Rome ſhall fall for a doo.<note place="margin">Rome ſhall fall finally.</note> Firſt, if the things be deeply conſidered and narrowly looked into, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith ſhall fall out vpon the pouring forth of the ſeuenth vial of Gods wrath, by the ſeuenth Angel, they doe fully portend a deadly downfall, and vtter ouerthrowe of Rome. For the ſeuenth vial is not poured vpon the earth, or ſea, or fountaines of waters, or on the Sunne, as the firſt foure vials were, which ſignified ſome particular iudgements; but it was poured forth into the verie aire, <label type="milestone">

For this ſeuenth viall of Gods wrath vpon the kingdome of the beaſt, is compared to a moſt horrible and bluſtering tempeſt, raiſed vp in the whole aire, that is, in all places of Antichriſts dominions. And it is ſpecially to be noted, as a thing of great moment, that the holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>There was neuer ſuch an earthquake as this, ſince the world beganne, and ſince men were vpon the earth.</hi> For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, ſo ſoone as the ſeuenth Angell poureth forth his viall, the kingdome of Poperie ſhall go downe a maine, which ſhall not belong before the end of the world, as all circumſtances heere doe ſhew.

is a ſtrong Lord, will oppoſe himſelfe againſt Rome, and condemne her. If this ſtrong God take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, who can vpholde her? Can the king of Spaine? can the Cardinalles? can the Emperour? can all the Dukes of Italy, and al the potentates of the earth, that take part with her? No, no,<note place="margin">Iob. 23.</note> they are al too weake. <hi>For if God take againſt a man, who can reclaime him,</hi> ſayth the Holy-Ghoſt? <hi>For he dooth whatſoeuer he will.</hi> And againe, <hi>God is wiſe in heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and mighty in ſtrength, who euer hardened his hart againſt him and proſpered? If God call not backe his anger, the moſt proud helpes are bowed vnder him.</hi> And God ſayth by the Prophet: <hi>Can thy hands be ſtrong,</hi>

                     <hi>or can thy hart endure in the day that I ſhal haue to do with thee?</hi> Then it followeth, that though Babylon ſit as a Queene, &amp; al her louers take part with her, yet becauſe the ſtrong Lord is againſt her, therefore ſhee ſhal come to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction. Some of good iudgement in the truth, haue gathered from this place, that the very City of Rome ſhal be burnt with fire;<note place="margin">Amos. 1. ver. 4.7.10.14.

But this I am ſure of, that the phraſe of <hi>burning with fire,</hi> doth in the Prophets alwaies ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie an vtter deſtruction and deſolation of a City, or a kingdome, and therefore it followeth that Rome ſhal be vtterly deſtroied.</p>
                  <p>But behold yet ſtronger, and plainer proofe. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>18. verse 2.</label> For <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> ſayth, <hi>a mighty Angel tooke vp a ſtone like a great milſtone, and caſt it into the ſea, ſaying, with ſuch violence ſhal that great City Babylon be caſt downe, and ſhal be found no more.</hi> Al men know, that old Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon in Chaldaea was deſtroied by the Medes, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18003:129"/>
long before Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writte this booke: and therefore that is not here meant, but the new Babylon which is Rome, as afore hath bin prooued. The Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſpeech, and the ſignes which the Prophets v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to declare the deſtruction and deſolation of olde Babylon, are heere alluded vnto in the deſtruction of Rome. For we reade in the prophecy of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that the Prophet hauing written in a booke al the euil that ſhould come vpon Babel, for holding Gods people ſo long in moſt miſerable captiuity, ſayd to <hi>Seraiah, When thou commeſt vnto Babel,</hi>

                     <hi>thou ſhalt reade all theſe words, and when thou haſt made an end of reading this book, thou ſhalt bind a ſtone to it, and caſt it into the middeſt of Euphrates, and ſhalt ſay: Thus ſhall Babel be drowned, and ſhall not riſe vp from the euill that I will bring vpon her, although they wearie themſelues.</hi> Now let vs conſider how this agreeth with the ſame which is heere ſet downe, and wee ſhal finde, that all thinges are here ſet downe, with greater force, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, as it were, a deeper vengeance, and a more heauie (and vnrecouerable deſtruction). Firſt, there is a man, here is a mighty Angel: there the man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp a ſtone, heere the Angell taketh vp a great ſtone, like a milſtone: there the ſtone is caſte into the riuer, here into the deepe ſea. Al theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being applied to Rome, doo greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the matter,<note place="margin">Rome ſhall fall without all hope of recouery.</note> and verie plainely ſhewe, that it ſhal fal, Without al hope of recouery. For the Lorde declareth by this forcible ſigne, of caſting a milſtone into the ſea, that the City and kingdome of Antichriſt ſhal bee caſt deepe downe into perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18003:129"/>
and ſhall lie ouerwhelmed, and drowned in the ſame for euer. For if olde Babylon was vtterly deſtroied, and came to a final deſolation in this life; much more ſhal Rome, as the Holy Ghoſt diſputeth. But olde Babylon came to vtter ruine and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life, as both <hi>Iſay</hi> and <hi>Ieremy</hi> doe witneſſe: Therefore newe Babylon; that is, Rome, ſhal come to vtter deſtruction: and as the Holy-ghoſt here ſayth, <hi>ſhall be found no more,</hi> or ſhal fal without all hope of recouery. Stories doe report that Rome hath beene ſundry times deſtroied by the Gothes and Vandales, and others, yea once fired and quite burnt vp, but afterward built and raiſed vp againe by the Emperours: But here the Holy-ghoſt ſayth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that it ſhal haue a final fal, and an vnrecouerable deſtruction. For can a milſtone, caſt into the bottome of the ſea, euer be gotte vp againe? no, no, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Therefore, let the Ieſuits, and Seminarie Prieſts, doe what they can, they ſhal neuer ſet vp Rome againe; they ſhal neuer reſtore her to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate and dignity; they ſhal neuer repaire her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit againe. Let he Pope, and Cardinals, and the King of Spaine, and al the world, and al the diuels in hel, ioyne together, they ſhal neuer get vp this mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone out of the bottome of the ſea. For the Angel hath caſt it in with ſuch a violence, that no power of man ſhal euer fetch it out againe. True it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that the Ieſuits beſtir them, and the Seminary Prieſts, and Papiſts doe worke apace in al landes, and aduenture themſelues in moſt deſperate manner, to recouer againe the credit of Popery, and to ſet vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18003:130"/>
the dignity and the power of the Pope, and the glory of their Church and City, and their bold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, doe make many euen to doubt that they wil againe one day preuaile. But aſſuredly wee are to make ful reckoning, that although heere and there they may ſupport for a time, ſome ruinous partes of their rotten frame: yet doo what they can, it ſhal in the end downe vpon their heades, and come to vtter deſolation. Indeede, Rome ſtandeth yet, and Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not quite fallen downe. But they are diſcloſed, their credit is cracked, their power decaieth: and ſo this thinge is begunne, and the time draweth on when it ſhal bee fully accompliſhed. He that had beheld the Power, the Pompe, the riches and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of Rome aboute ſome foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoure yeeres paſte, and looketh vpon it now, ſhal ſee a woonderfull alteration.

                  <p>But beholde yet more, and more plaine proofe for the vtter deſolation of Rome. For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> deſcribeth the eternal deſolation thereof, by denial of thoſe things which are in Cities inhabited: Firſt hee ſayth, <hi>there ſhall be no more any voice of harpers, Muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:18003:130"/>Secondly, hee ſayth <hi>there ſhall be no craftes man of what trade ſoeuer found in Rome</hi>;<note place="margin">Rome ſhall come to vtter deſolation.</note> which argueth an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſolation.

                  <p>Thirdly, he ſayth, <hi>no light of a candle ſhall any more ſhine in Rome,</hi> which argueth an vtter deſolation. For what inhabited Citie is without candles?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee ſayth, <hi>no ſounde of a milſtone ſhal bee heard in Rome,</hi> which argueth an vtter deſolation. For what Citie is without milles to grinde their corne?</p>

For while Rome had dominion ouer the kingdomes, and the Pope ruled ouer al, euen as a God vppon the earth, there was nothing but trudging ouer the ſeas to Rome out of al landes, and againe from thence, there was carrying and recarrying; in ſomuch that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Mariners and Shipmaſters were continually ſet on worke, &amp; gained greately therby.

And therefore now at laſt I conclude, that Rome ſhal fall finally, and come to vtter deſtruction in this life.

For it were an abſurde thing to ſay, anie of theſe things ſhal bee after this life; or to ſay that theſe things ſhal not bee til the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie comming of Chriſt; for they are all things to be effected heere in this earth: and the holy Ghoſt doth deſcribe them as things to be done vpon the face of the earth: for otherwiſe wee could haue ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in anie of theſe things, if they ſhould not bee done heere in earth, or if they ſhould all bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till the verie comming of Chriſt, and in the meane time Antichriſt ſhal ſtil preuaile.<note place="margin">2.

Hath God ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and ſhal it not come to paſſe? Shall any iote of his word faile? Shall wee thinke hee ieſteth with vs, when hee doth ſo often and ſo ſeriouſly tell vs of the downefall of Rome? Surelie, ſurelie, the cauſe why men are not fully perſwaded of the finall fall of Rome, is, becauſe they doe not diligentlie peruſe this booke of the Apocalypſe. But let men be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent in this booke, and they ſhall bee out of al doubt, that Rome is the great whoore of Babylon; that the Pope is Antichriſt, and the Papacy the beaſt.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as this kingdome hath happily begun to hate the whore, and to make her deſolate and naked: ſo vndoubtedly ſhee ſhall continue vnto the end of the world.

Then it ſhould ſeeme, the beaſt ſhall reuiue and recouer himſelfe againe, and ſo S. Iohn ſhall be found a falſe prophet.

till (as the holy ghoſt ſaith) <hi>they haue eaten her fleſh, &amp; burnt her with fire</hi>: that is, till they haue vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured her. But heere it will be obiected, that in the latter daies iniquitie ſhall haue the vpper hand. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere firſt, that I finde no ſuch place of ſcripture.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>11. ver. 1 ver. 11. ver. 13.</label> ſhall bee very many, as this booke doth alſo teach.

                  <p>But now me thinketh I heare ſome man ſay, what likelyhood is there of all this which you write touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18003:137"/>
the ouerthrow of <hi>Rome?</hi> Doe wee not ſee, that <hi>Rome</hi> is yet ſtrong?

Hath not the whore ſtill many and great bearers, and vpholders, what likelyhood is there the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that euer ſhe ſhal be brought ſo low as you ſpeake of? I anſwere,<note place="margin">Wee may not ſay, what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood is ther of this?</note> that in this caſe we muſt not aske this queſtion what likelyhood. We muſt not conſult with fleſh and bloud. Wee muſt not take counſell of humane reaſon. For God is maruellous in his deuiſes, and when hee hath once decreed and determined of any future euent, he will compaſſe it by meanes far ſurpaſſing all humane reach and capacitie: yea by ſuch plots and deuiſes, as mans wit could neuer haue once dreamed of. For hee hath all meanes in heauen &amp; earth in his hands, and is admirable in all his proceedings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not aske this queſtion, what likelyhood, or how can it bee, or how can it poſſiblie come to paſſe?

What likelyhood was there, that when the Pope could commaund the Emperor, and all the kings of Europe, and their kingdomes, that euer hee ſhould haue beene brought ſo low as at this day hee is, God bee thanked? What likelyhood was there that euer poore <hi>Martin Luther</hi> ſhould ſtand out with the euerlaſting goſpell in his mouth
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18003:138"/>
againſt the Pope, Emperour, &amp; as it were the whole world, &amp; yet dye in his bed in a good old age?

Therefore I conclude, that when God hath decreed the vtter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of <hi>Rome,</hi> wee muſt not aske this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how can it be? or which way ſhall it be brought about?

hornes: the eight, which is <hi>France,</hi> beginneth to be ſomewhat looſe, and to ſhake a little, which if it fall off, the reſt will follow after a pace. The reſon why the kingdomes, which were ſubiect to the <hi>Romane</hi> empire, are compared to hornes, is, becauſe that as hornes are the ſtrength &amp; defence of a beaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo hee puſheth downe other creatures: ſo the ſtrength and defence of the <hi>Romane</hi> empire, and the papacie, was in the kingdomes which were ſubiect vnto them, and tooke part with them, whereby alſo they did mightily puſh at other nations and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Moreouer wee are to obſerue, that whereas S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, the ſame hornes which did vphold and defend the whore, ſhall pull hir downe, it is not to be vnderſtood of the ſame men, but of their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in the ſame kingdomes. For the kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Denmarke, Polonia,</hi> and other countries, which gaue their power and authoritie vnto the beaſt, are dead and gone. If vvee reſpect the perſons of the men, and thoſe which ſucceed them novv in theſe kingdomes, and pull downe the whore, are other perſons: but becauſe they ſucceed &amp; gouerne in theſe kingdomes, they are ſaid to bee thoſe ten hornes of the beaſt. Then thus it is: theſe ten kings which novv hate the harlot, are called the ten hornes of the beaſt, not becauſe they bee any defence and ſtrength vnto him, but becauſe they ſit vpon the ſame thrones of their aunceſtors, which did vphold and maintaine him But this one thing is very cleare and apparant out of the interpretation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18003:143"/>
that the ſame kingdomes which haue maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Popery, ſhall put it downe, as we ſee alredy ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in <hi>England, Scotland, Denmarke,</hi> &amp; the reſt which haue embraced the Goſpell.

For this ſeemeth vnto mee, to bee a very good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from the words of the interpreting Angel.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18003:144"/>
hath ſet downe the iuſt period, and preciſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all the greateſt afflictions &amp; perſecutions, that euer came to his Church, before the comming of his Son in the fleſh, for the comfort thereof, as that of Egipt, after the expiration of foure hundred and thirtie yeeres: that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> after the date of ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres: that of the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 8.</note> after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of an hundred &amp; thirtie yeeres: that of <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſtate after ſixe yeeres:<note place="margin">Dan. 11.</note> that of <hi>Magog</hi> and <hi>Egipt,</hi> after 294 yeeres. So likewiſe that of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death and reſurrection, after ſeauentie ſeauens, or ſeauentie weekes, which make 490 yeeres, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <hi>Gabriell</hi> foretold, vnto the prophet <hi>Daniell.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9 42.</note> But concerning the iuſt period and preciſe determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the perſecutions of the Church, ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and the papacy, we find not the like ſet downe: &amp; heere of there may be two reaſons yeelded. Firſt becauſe the Church of the Iewes were not vnder ſo cleere, and pretious promiſes as we are, therefore it was needfull, for the better ſtrengthning of their hope &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they ſhould know the very time determined: but becauſe the Church of the chriſtians liueth vnder moſt cleere &amp; comfortable promiſes of deliuerance, therfore God according to his deepe wiſedome would haue our faith exerciſed in an aſſured expectation of the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment therof, though the preciſe time be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. An other reaſon may bee this: the vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Rome,</hi> falleth out to bee, but a little before the comming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to iudgement, as appereth in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18003:145"/>
this propheſie. Now then, if wee knew the day or yeere certainely, when <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould fall finally, it would giue vs too much light, vnto the knowledge of the laſt day, which God in great wiſedome, hath of purpoſe hid from the knowledge of all men: yea, and of Angels. I know right well, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine learned writer, doth preciſely determine the vtter deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> to fall out, in the yeere of our Lord 1639.<note place="margin">Napier in Apo. 14. page. 183.</note> But by the fauour of ſo excellent a man bee it ſpoken, I ſee no ſufficient ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But touching this matter, of the time of <hi>Romes</hi> finall fall, I will deliuer mine opinion, and my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſubmitting my ſelfe to the iudgement of the learned, for I would bee loth, in this or any other thing, to goe beyond my compaſſe, or to paſſe the bounds of modeſtie, and humilitie, and therefore doe refer all to bee tryed by the ſicle of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I doe therefore thus iudge, that the vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall bee in this age, I meane with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the age of a man: my reaſon is this. We of this age, liue vnder the opening of the ſeauenth ſeale, the blowing of the ſixt trumpet, and the powring foorth of the ſixt vial. For the firſt it is manifeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the opening of the ſeauenth ſeale, containeth all things, that ſhall fall out to the end of the world: as hath beene ſhewed and proued before.<note place="margin">Apoc. 8.1.</note> For the blowing of the ſixt trumpet, that alſo is plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnder the blowing thereof, the little booke was opened, and the goſpell preached, as wee ſee in this age.<note place="margin">Apoc 10.2. ver. 10.11.</note> For the powring downe of the ſixt viall
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18003:145"/>
of Gods wrath, that alſo is moſt cleere, becauſe thereupon the great riuer <hi>Euphrates</hi> drieth vp, and the Ieſuits are ſent out, to ſollicit the kings of the earth to battaile againſt the Church, as wee ſee fulfilled in theſe our daies. Then I reaſon thus, <hi>Rome</hi> muſt fall downe finally,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14. voc. 6.8.</note> in that age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the little booke is opened, and the euerlaſting goſpell preached: but in this age, the little booke is opened, and the euerlaſting goſpell preached, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this age, <hi>Rome</hi> muſt fall downe finally. And againe I reaſon thus: <hi>Rome</hi> muſt fall downe finally, in that age, wherein the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Apoc. 16.16.</note> the fortification of <hi>Rome</hi> drieth vp, and the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are ſent forth, to ſtop the leake thereof: but all this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out in this age, as wee ſee with our eies. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this age <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall downe finally.<note place="margin">It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Rome ſhall fall finally in this age. Apoc. 10.6.7.</note> The reaſon of the propoſition is, becauſe in this age the popiſh armies ſhall come to <hi>Armageddon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer this I ſay, and not I, but the Lord, when the ſeauenth Angell bloweth the ſeauenth trumpet, then commeth the end of the world: But the ſixt Angell, hath ſounded the ſixt trumpet long agoe, as appeereth by the effects: Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be long ere the ſeauenth Angell blow. But <hi>Rome</hi> muſt fall downe finally, before the ſeauenth Angell blow, as hath beene ſhewed before. Therefore the vtter fall of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot bee long deferred. I doe not determine either of day, month, or yeere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not reuealed. But I gueſſe at an age, becauſe the holy ghoſt pointeth vs vnto an agent.</p>

                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:18003:149"/>The cauſe why hee was now bound and chained vp, was, for that hee had a long time ſeduced all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and raigned as King and Lord ouer the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and greatly ſeduced the Iewes alſo.</p>

But heere it is to bee obſerued, that this binding of <hi>Sathan,</hi> is not to bee taken ſimply, and abſolutely, as though <hi>Sathan</hi> was ſo bound and chained vp, for this thouſand yeere, that hee could not ſeduce at all, or doe no miſchiefe at all, after the preaching of the Goſpell by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles: I ſay this is not to bee taken ſimply, but afrer a ſort, that is, that hee could not ſo generally and vniuerſally ſeduce all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hee had in former time, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For otherwiſe it is well knowne, that euen after <hi>Chriſts</hi> time, hee did greatly perſecute the Church, bring in many errors and hereſies, and harden and blind many mens hearts: but yet all this was nothing, in compariſon of that which hee had wrought in former ages, when hee was euen as it were the god of the world, and the Gentiles wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him as God, as the Apoſtle teacheth,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>Moreouer, it is to be noted, that notwithſtanding all <hi>Sathans</hi> power and might, craft and ſubteltie, yet this Angell vvhich hath the key of the bottomleſſe pit, doth apprehend him and ſhut him vp, and ſeale the dore vpon him: ſo that he cannot get abroad to ſeduce ſo generally, as in former time.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>S.

For it is ſayd heere, that the Church dyd grow and flouriſh: yea, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe her power and aucthoritie, during that time. And therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that <hi>he ſaw ſeates, and they ſate vpon them, and iudgement was giuen vnto them.</hi> Whereby he meaneth, that the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, had their chaires, ſeates, and conſiſtories, vvherein they did both preach the vvord, and execute the Church cenſures: as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſeies</hi> beefore had ſit in the chaire of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> and I take it, the latter part of the fourth verſe, is to be referred to the firſt clauſe, to vvit, that <hi>the Church dyd liue and raigne with Chriſt, a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18003:151"/>
yeeres.</hi> Which is not to be vnderſtood of the Church triumphant, as ſome doe take it, &amp; all the reſt of this fourth verſe, but of the flouriſhing eſtate of the Church militant, during the time of <hi>Sathans</hi> capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie: for all the faithfull do after a ſort liue, &amp; raigne with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> euen heere in the earth, when they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world by faith, and ſubdue <hi>Sathan</hi> &amp; ſinne, by the power of grace.</p>
                  <p>Now where it is ſaid that <hi>Iohn ſaw the ſoules of them that were beheaded, for the witneſſe of Ieſus, &amp;c.</hi> It is to bee vnderſtood of thoſe, which in the time of the perſecuting empire, and growing of the papacie, vvere ſlaine for the truth. For the ſecond beaſt, which is the dominion of Popes, raigned not in thoſe thouſand yeere, in the which <hi>Sathan</hi> vvas bound, but yet did grow by degrees towards their height, and vſed great tyrannie againſt the ſeruants of God, before <hi>Sathans</hi> full looſing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> or <hi>Millenaries,</hi> doe fondly gather from this ſcripture, that after the ouerthrow of Antichriſt, the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> would come &amp; raigne vvith the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, heere a thouſand yeeres vpon the earth, and that in this time, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſo raigne, as a great and glorious king vpon the earth, his ſubiects ſhould enioy all manner of earthly pleaſures, and delights. This fooliſh error is confuted by the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv in the text; as wee ſhall ſee afterward.</p>
                  <p>Whereas hee ſaith, <hi>the reſt of the dead ſhall not liue againe.</hi> It is to bee vnderſtood, of ſuch as were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead, that is, ſuch as did deſpiſe the Goſpell,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18003:151"/>
which vvas preached thoſe thouſand yeeres, &amp; were not thereby reuiued and quickened vnto eternall life, but did ſtill remaine, as men dead in ſinnes, and treſpaſſes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the meaning of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is, that as in the thouſand yeeres, many that heard <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and their ſucceſſors, were raiſed vp from the death of ſinne, to the life of righteouſneſſe, ſo many others were not quickened by their doctrine, but ſtil dwelt in their ſinnes, whom hee calleth <hi>the reſt of the dead:</hi> and hee ſaith, <hi>theſe ſhall not liue againe,</hi> meaning the life of God, or the life of grace, and whereas hee addeth <hi>vntill the thouſand yeeres be finiſhed,</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth neuer, or not at all, for ſo the word <hi>vntill,</hi> is often taken in the ſcriptures: and it is ſure, that after the expiration of the thouſand yeeres, they did not liue the life of God, and the life of the ſpirit. For then the diuell was let looſe vpon the world, to worke his pleaſure, and to ſeduce with all efficacie of error and iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is ſaid, <hi>this is the firſt reſurrection,</hi> he meaneth the riſing from ſinne, to the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which was in the thouſand yeeres, of the goſpells preaching, and therefore hee addeth, <hi>that he is bleſſed that hath part in the firſt reſurrection, &amp;c.</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that all ſuch ſhall raigne with Chriſt a thouſand yeers.</hi> Which is meant of the raigne of the faithfull, euen vpon earth, for the ſpace of that thouſand yeeres, in which <hi>Sathan</hi> was bound: but yet excludeth not their eternall glory in the heauens.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But wee are to obſerue, that as <hi>Sathan</hi> was bound by degrees, through the miniſtery of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles, and their immediat ſucceſſors: ſo alſo he was looſed by degrees, by the preuailing of hereſies, till the great Antichriſt was hatched, and brought into the poſſeſſion of his curſed chaire. For <hi>Sathan</hi> was not fully looſed, till the yeere of our Lord 998. At what time <hi>Silueſter</hi> the ſecond, came to bee Pope, who was in league with the Diuell. Stories doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that at his death hee called for the Cardinals,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18003:152"/>
and confeſſed that hee had familiaritie with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and how hee had giuen himſelfe vnto him body and ſoule, ſo that hee might come to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall dignitie.</p>
                  <p>After him ſucceeded ſundry other Popes, which were notorious monſters, ſome of them murderers, ſome poiſoners, ſome ſorcerers, ſome coniurers. By whom the diuell was fully looſed, all light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and true religion being in a manner cleane put out, &amp; moſt abhominable Idolatrie, &amp; all manner of villany ſpreading ouer the face of the earth, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Sathan being thus fully looſed, hee went forth to deceiue the people, which were in the foure corners of the earth, euen Gog and Magog, &amp;c.</hi> This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing by <hi>Sathan,</hi> heere ſpoken of, is the ſame with that which is ſpoken Chapter 13. onely this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is more generall.

                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore it is to bee noted, that the prophet <hi>Ezechiell</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Gog is the chiefe prince of Meſech, and Tuball.</hi>

of <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſer, of <hi>Siria,</hi> and of <hi>Scithia.</hi> Now then to conclude: <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> are put for the princes of thoſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, which were the chiefe Captaines in gathering great and mightie armies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to battaile, againſt the children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> after they were come out of the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And the prophet there in one ſumme vnder the armies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> comprehendeth all the enemies that fought againſt them, from time to time, after the captiuitie, vnto the comming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And now for the application of this, vnto the enemies of the Church, vnder the Goſpell, wee muſt firſt note, that through this booke, the figures and phraſes of ſpeech are taken out of the law &amp; the prophets.

But marke vvhat followeth, and conſider the iſſue of the battaile.

Chapter, that <hi>when this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſhewed Iohn the great whore of Babylon, he carried him away into the wilderneſſe in the ſpirit:</hi> becauſe the vvhore of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould make the Church barren and deſolate, as a vvilderneſſe. But now that he is to ſhew him the ſpouſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in her glory, and to deſcribe the euerlaſting <hi>Ieruſalem, he carrieth him in the ſpirit, vnto a very high mountaine,</hi> that he might take a ſight of it, as <hi>Moiſes</hi> was carried vp to the top of mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> that from thence he might take a view of the holy Land. Which teacheth, that none can take a right view of Heauen and heauenly things, but onely ſuch as fly an high pitch, and mount far
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18003:158"/>
aboue this earth in holy affections, and heauenly contemplation.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that aſſone as hee tooke a ſight of this new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> far paſsing all <hi>Sinai</hi> ſights: foorthwith he eſpied in it the <hi>very glory of God.</hi> If he had ſaid, he had eſpied the glory of a King, it had bene much. If he had ſaid, he eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glory of an Angell, it had bene more. But that he eſpieth the very glory of God, it is moſt of all. For vvho can conceiue or expreſſe, vvhat the glory of God is, beeing infinit. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God dwelleth in vnacceſsible light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Tim 6.</note> or ſuch light as none can approch vnto.</p>
                  <p>Then this is one vvord for all, touching the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſuperexcellencie of the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that it comprehendeth in it, the very glory of God: but yet for amplifications ſake, it is compared to a <hi>Iaſper ſtone,</hi> for neuer fading greenneſſe: and to a <hi>Chryſtall ſtone,</hi> for bright ſhining and glittering for euer.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>On the Eaſt part, there were three gates: and on the Northſide three gates: on the Southſide three gates:</hi>

                  <p>Now Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> procedeth to the deſcription of the wall &amp; gates of this great citie. This we all know,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:18003:159"/>
that a ſtrong wall ſerueth for the ſafety and defence of a citie, and for the ſecuritie of ſuch as dwell in it. For if it bee ſo high that none can it ſcale, &amp; ſo thick that none can batter it, then is it indeed impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Citizens in great ſecuritie. But the wall of heauen is ſo high, as none can ſcale it, as is ſet downe in this twelfe verſe, and ſo thicke, that no double Cannon can pierce it, as appeareth verſe 17. therefore all the inhabitants of this new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> are out of all feare of dangers.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer this citie hath <hi>twelue gates,</hi> to ſignifie an hard acceſſe for enemies to breake in: and an eaſie paſſage, for the Citizens themſelues to goe in and out. And at thoſe twelue gates <hi>twelue Angels,</hi> at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gate <hi>an Angell,</hi> as it were a porter, to ſee that none bee let in, but the true Citizens, and free deniſons, and ſuch as haue to doe there, which are heere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee <hi>the twelue tribes of Iſraell,</hi> that is, all the elect of God, both of the iewes and gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer it is ſaid, that there were <hi>three gates on euery ſide the citie, both Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South,</hi> to note that out of all quarters of the earth, the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſhould bee gathered, and as our ſauiour ſaith, <hi>many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and the Weſt, the North, and the South,</hi>

                     <hi>and the length is as large as the breadth of it, and hee meaſured the citie, with the reed twelue thouſand furlongs, and the length and the breadth, and the height of it are equall.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And hee meaſured the wall thereof, an hundred forty and foure cubits, by the meaſure of man,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now S. <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>the Angell which tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with him, had a golden reed to meaſure both the citie, and the gates and walls thereof.</hi> Meaſuring with reeds was a thing of great vſe in ancient times, as wee read in the propheſie of <hi>Ezechiell</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezechiel. 40. Zacharie. 2.</note> and as wee heard before in the eleauenth Chapter. But becauſe all things belonging to this celeſtiall <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> are ſuper excellent and glorious, therfore the very mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring rod and reed, is of pure gold. This great and glorious citie is ſaid <hi>to lye foure ſquare,</hi> to note vnto vs, that it ſtandeth faſt, and vnmoueable, for round things are eaſily rolled, &amp; mooued this way or that way, hither and thither. But ſquare things are not apt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18003:160"/>
to rolle or mooue. This euerlaſting <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> therfore lieth foure ſquare, becauſe it can neuer be moued, but ſtandeth faſt for euer. As the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Seeing we receiue a kingdome which cannot be ſhaken,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12. ve. 28</note> 
                     <hi>let vs haue grace whereby we may ſo ſerue God, that we may pleaſe him with reuerence and feare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Angell with his golden meaſuring rod, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth the ſquare ſides of the citie, both the length, breadth, height and depth of it, and findeth each of them to bee 12000 furlongs, which after eight fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the mile, maketh in our accompt 1500 miles, and ſo the whole ſquare of this great citie, commeth to ſixe thouſand miles, which is a goodly compaſſe, &amp; noteth vnto vs the great largeneſſe of gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; that there is romth inough for all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof.

                  </p>
                  <p>After this, hee meaſureth the thickneſſe of the wall, and findeth it to be an hundred forty and foure cubits, which after our common accompt of two cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits to a yard, amount to ſeauentie and two yardes, which is a iolly thickneſſe, euen ſo thick as no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non can pierce, and therefore altogether in expug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as hath beene ſaid before.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As we haue heard of the forme of this goodly citie: ſo now wee are to heare of the matter of it, that is to ſay, of what ſtuffe it is made. Firſt, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> telleth vs, that the whole Citie is of moſt pure and glittering gold, like vnto glaſſe: and that the wall was of <hi>Iaſper</hi> moſt greene and flouriſhing, and alſo that the very foundation of the wall was beautified and adorned with twelue ſundry kindes of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, which hee reckoneth vp. We count it a great matter heere below, to compaſſe and cloſe in our houſes with a wall of bricke, and none can do it but men of place: but alas, what is that to his wall? what is bricke to precious ſtones: &amp; pibbles, to pearle. But S. <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth that the gates were of pearle, and the ſtreete of the citie of pure gold! Oh how braue, how beautifull, how glorious, how glittering, how gorgeous, how admirable, a citie is this: for if the gates be of pearle, &amp; the ſtreets of gold, then what are the inner roomes, what are the dining chambers, and what are the lodging roomes. But heere we may not groſſely imagine, that the kingdome of God is

of ſuch mettall and matter inded, as is heere deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.

                  <p>And as this Citie hath no neede of any Temple, ſo hath it <hi>no neede of any light either of Sunne or Moone. For the glory of God and the brightneſſe of the Lamb doe light it for euer</hi>: vvhoſe incomprehenſible bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth as far excell the brightneſſe of the Sunne and Moone, as they doe excell a little candle at noone day. But it may be demaunded vvho ſhall dwell in this ſo glorious a Citie, and in this ſo great a light.

                  </p>
                  <p>Oh how vnſpeakeable is the glory of this citie, that Kings ſhall throw downe their Crownes and Scepters beefore it: counting all theyr pomp and glory but as duſt, in reſpect of it. And the magnificence and pomp of all the potentates of

And although the gates of this citie alwaies ſtand open both night and day, as not fearing any danger of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: <hi>yet no vncleane thing ſhall enter into it, but onely they which are written in the Lambs booke of life.</hi> Thus wee ſee how gloriouſly the holy ghoſt hath deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto vs, this citie of the Saints, and habitation of the iuſt, for euermore.

                  <p>Moreouer, heere is great proteſtation made in the eightene and ninteene verſes, of <hi>great plagues to bee inflicted vpon all ſuch as ſhall adde any thing vnto this booke, or take away any thing from it.</hi> Which alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth greatly for the confirmation of the authoritie of this booke, for that to the which nothing may be added, and from the which nothing may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, muſt needes bee abſolute and perfect.
