            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving taken in Brunteland, and the enemie ſtill continuing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Trenches at Sterling, it was unanimouſly concluded a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and a quick work to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor the reduction of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which, as I hinted in my laſt, is a place of great importance lying in the Center of that part of Scotland, which is on the other ſide Forth. The enemie had put in a Regiment of foot into the Town, not above two hours ere our Van came up, who were boated from the other ſide of the water into the Town, which made them very high and peremptorie: but our men having broken down the ſluces and let out the water out of their graff, their courage fail'd, and the Lord's Daie morning laſt the Town was ſurrendred to us upon Brunteland Articles: My Lord went in and view'd it: and wee finde the place everie way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54610:3"/>
our thoughts of it: and that night the whole Armie marcht back towards Brunteland, eleven miles: On Munday laſt wee came to Brunteland, and that night ſhipt over our whole foot to Leith, and ſom of our Horſ: and the reſidue were tranſporting with all expedition. Lievtenant General <hi>Munk</hi> is left in Scotland, Commander in chief, and march't from us directly to Sterling the ſame day wee came to Brunte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and wee are confident hee was the next day poſſeſſed of Sterling Town, and doubt not of the hearing a ſpeedie account of the Caſtle. Wee have left with him of Foot and Horſ a field-force of 7 or 8000. Col. <hi>Overton</hi> is made Governour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johnſtouns:</hi> hee hath with him Colonel <hi>Daniel's</hi> Regiment of Foot, Col. <hi>Aldridges</hi> Regiment of Horſ, and 500 Dragoons. Tueſdaie in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> with about 3000 Horſ and Dragoons, marcht towards the Enemie, who will with all expedition, get into the Reer of them: and my Lord hath now ſent mee with Orders to Maj. Gen. <hi>Harriſon</hi> to get into the Van of them, to ſtop them what hee can, and do what further hee think's fit in the Counties as he marche's: I am to keep with him till the Armie com up. Both Maj. Generals will march night and daie till they get to them: Yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my Lord General, with the Foot, and Reſidue of the Horſ, march't from <hi>Leith:</hi> hee will eaſ himſelf ſo of his Train as may expedite his Marches: hee bring's out of Scotland 8 Regiments of Horſ, beſides Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons; and 8 or 9 (if Col. <hi>Weſt</hi> com with him) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot. Truly, the Lord hath don wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for his poor ſervants, with you, and here, beyond what wee could have thought; and now the whole

hopes of the Enemie is cooped up in this partie that march't by <hi>Carlile</hi> yeſterdaie. Thurſday the Enemie remov'd from <hi>Sterling:</hi> Friday wee had intelligence thereof, but however wee reſolved to go on with our work: after that their marches were in ſuch traverſes, that wee knew not well what to conjecture: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wee reſolved after them, aſſoon as the buſineſs of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Johnstouns</hi> was over. After their march, they firſt reſolved <hi>Middleton</hi> ſhould return to keep the North: then that <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> (who was on the other ſide <hi>Forth</hi>) ſhould go: and this a little put us to thoughts what they will do: but, in concluſion, <hi>Robert Mountgomery</hi> and all were ordered to follow them. They are not above 11000 men at moſt; they have very little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion with them; through all the countrey in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> wee finde their run-awaies: in a word, nothing was left them but a deſperate cure, or a deſperate ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> my heart is fill'd in the confident exſpectation of.
