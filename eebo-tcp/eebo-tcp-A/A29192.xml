         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You designed chiefly to Aim at me, not
that I intend to make my self to cheap as

made it his great business not so much to
tell the truth, as to praise and flatter his
Emperour. To be shot, Sir; when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

I have made it a great part of my business

of <hi>Achilles</hi> his <hi>Horse</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> or

the one Repeated a number of <hi>Verses,</hi>
the other a great deal of <hi>Prose,</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abused the Authour, or made him
speak other than his own Sense.</p>
            <p>I shall not disturb the Ashes of Old
<hi>Ferdinando</hi> so far, as to guess at the true
reason why you would not Reply to my

a Riddle, that I dedie any man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
<hi>Trap</hi> to resolve it.</p>
            <p>You tell me indeed, that I <hi>Iump</hi> in
<hi>some Passages</hi> with <hi>W. S.</hi> and that you
had <hi>Answered him half a year before.</hi> And
is it not a strange thing that two several

own; yet, since you are so good at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering,</hi>
pray answer me one Question:
Did you ever hear of St. <hi>Dunstan?</hi> But—
did you ever see a little Book called the
<hi>Method of Preaching,</hi> Printed about Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years ago, the Authour whereof writes
himself <hi>T. V.</hi> as you do <hi>T. B?</hi> They
say he and you jump in your Notions, that
there you had your story of the <hi>Weepers,</hi>
(though you have added two of your own
to his Six, and made it consist of Eight
parts) and to mention no more, your
<hi>Preface</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> from his <hi>beginning</hi> of
the <hi>World,</hi> which some Ancient Historians
will have to be much about the same
time. In some things indeed you seem to
differ, for He was a Divine, you say you
are none; He pretends to Instruct <hi>young</hi>
Preachers serionsly, whilst you Laugh and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54323:15"/>
Droll upon the very <hi>Old</hi> ones. Now I am
not so vain, as from this and such like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to Indict you for a <hi>Plagiary,</hi> but
only to let you know, that when ever you
speak Sense or Truth, somebody else hath
done it before you, so that you cannot
claim the whole Credit thereof, more than
of your late happy Intention of <hi>English
Exercises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I stumble upon <hi>them</hi> again, Sir,
out of a mere malicious design of moving
your cholerick Particles, but only because
I am now passing on to consider your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Antipathy to a piece of <hi>Greek,</hi> or
<hi>Latine;</hi> for you proclaim open War, and
profess you <hi>hate</hi> it like a <hi>Viper</hi> or <hi>Toad;</hi>
as if the little Vermine struck so fiercely,
that he left his Sting behind him. Now,
Sir, were I disposed to Mischief, what a
fair Advantage have you given me to pelt
you with, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and an

yours, my <hi>Duck,</hi> my <hi>Dear,</hi> &amp;c. and
then Tack about, with a—<hi>Tendimus

Triumph, and I hate to use any true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>

the Question once put to a Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<hi>Philosophist,</hi> after he had made a

calmly and seriously with you. I hope,
Sir, you don't think there lies any <hi>Moral
Turpitude</hi> lurking under the Skirts of those
<hi>hateful</hi> Languages, or, that they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and point blanck against the Law
of the Land: Our Statutes for <hi>English
Manufactures,</hi> and the Encouragement
of <hi>Trade,</hi> were never intended to bolt out
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> sure, as Forein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.
I confess, I love the Smoak of
my own Country as well as you, or any
of them that were lately Press'd for his
Majesties Service abroad; but I would
not willingly be such a meer <hi>English</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
as not to be able to Write a piece
of <hi>Latine</hi> to borrow Money (upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion)
or to teach a Thief his Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
But yet you must not hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
I'm one that reverence <hi>Gr.</hi> and <hi>L.</hi>
purely out of Honour to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;</hi>
alas, Sir, I never saw either of them
in all my Travels, yet I have met with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54323:16"/>
diverse <hi>Dead</hi> men that have been there,
and say, they were very <hi>Fine</hi> Places.
And truly when I find more Flesh, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Food in one of their <hi>Scraps</hi> (as you
term them) than in twenty whole Pages
of some late <hi>English</hi> Scriblers, I can't but
stand amaz'd to hear such a dismal outcry
against them. There was Learning in
the World, Sir, above fourty years ago,
nay before that doubty Grammarian
<hi>Palaemon's</hi> time, albeit he boasted, it was
born and would also die with Him. And
though it be the mode of late amongst
some pedling Pilferers to rend an ancient
Authors sense, concealing his Name and
Language both, out of a superstitious
fear of disobliging Monsieur <hi>Multitude,</hi>
their <hi>Patron;</hi> yet I don't find my self at
leisure to admire them in this, more than
their other Affections of Singularity. For
let them Phancy and Swagger what they
please to the contrary, so long as there
is a <hi>Scholar</hi> alive, so long as it is not <hi>death</hi>
to use any other Language besides our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>English,</hi> there will be a laudable use
of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authours, and that
in their own Dialect; their Brevity, Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Elegance, being not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54323:17"/>
something by the most exact Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations.
Besides, Sir, the constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our best <hi>English</hi> Writers is so
much against your private Humour, that
I must either conclude them a company
of Fools, or continue my Respects to
those Ancient Languages, you would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode,
or at least beat down their Price.
I presume you may have seen or heard of
<hi>Iewel, Laud, White, Mountague, Field,
Hooker, Chillingworth, Iackson, Taylor,
Bramhal, Hall, Hammond, Sanderson,
Thorndike,</hi> and an hundred more I could

yet very full of <hi>Vipers</hi> and <hi>Toads,</hi> nay
<hi>Crocodils</hi> and <hi>Basilisks</hi> too, if these be

I would gladly be civil to you, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find in my heart to call such Learned

<hi>Scrap-Monkers,</hi> meerly because

and a Dram of <hi>Greek</hi> quite turns your

            <p>There is indeed, and ever will be, an

so long as all men have not the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

those that Cite Authors in the way of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry,
Affectation, and most elaborate
Impertinence, without any regard to
those useful Circumstances of Time,
Place, or Company; and if they can but
shoot a Pellet or two of <hi>Latine</hi> now and

then (though no more to the purpose
then Eggs and Moonshine) they'l Huff

as the One-ey'd man is said to do

you hate <hi>Latine,</hi> and that you had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a <hi>Book</hi> against it, they would be at

I'm sure I have been tormented with them

            <p>To supply my want of Company upon

withal that he had Read of one <hi>Vlysses,</hi>
who was a great Traveller, and always
went on foot. Why think you so, said I?
'Tis very clear in <hi>Homer</hi> upon my word,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54323:20"/>
said he,—<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, you meet

that was the man? At which he crav'd my

a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.
Whereupon I could not but gratifie him
so far as to observe how well he was Read
in all sorts of Poets; but he confess'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously
he was only a Smattereer and a
Well-wisher, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e had not Read
above 30 or 40 of the best of them, which
he had at his fingers ends, and that he was

Having no more of that Poem about him,
and fearing I should catch Cold (as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume)
he ask'd me, whether Business or
Pleasure drew me into those Parts?
Thought I, he has me as sure in this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi>
as Louse in <hi>Pontesract:</hi> But I'le
avoid him if I can, by answering, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And yet that would not do, for he
(not doubting I would have said Pleasure)
fastens on that, like a true Echo, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54323:20"/>
tells me <hi>Virgil</hi> commends it for a rart

By this time I was grown so surly as to
mind him from whence he had digre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(that he was not so solicitous of <hi>News</hi> as

               </gap>eem'd to be at first) for I was so vain
as to think to put him out of his Road.
But alas, his Stock being not yet at an
end, he replied nimbly upon me; Oh yes,
Sir, with your pardon, <hi>In nova fert ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

and tell him, It begins to grow late, Sir,
and I shall rather chuse to sleep upon what
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54323:21"/>
I am already indebted to you for. And
thus, when he had spent the remainder of
his Ammunition; and poured in a volley
of Small-shot upon me for a parting blow,
—<hi>Nox ingruit atra—Fefsos so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por
irrigat artus—Per amica silentia
lunae;</hi> and about twenty of the same,
which for brevities sake I omit. He took
his solemn leave of me, adding, I am
yours, Sir, <hi>Dum juga montis aper, fluvios
dum piscis amabit,</hi> and so on till he came
to the long-look'd for and best bit of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
he had reserv'd for the last, <hi>Vale,

            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I have as little Kindness for
such a Coxcombe's Impertinence as you
or any man Living: It suits no more
with my Humour than Oyl or Caveere
does with my Palate, though as a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I can for once, and so must you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
endure it. But would you have me

some men are mad? Is there no way
to enforce Temperance, but to cut down

me as I get up? Neither ought you to

things from their Abuse. To bring
the Business between us to a short Issue,
the Question is, Whether you or I be
guilty of the Abuse aforesaid? I answer
positively, that—<hi>Facit Indignatio</hi>—

Pray, Sir, let me Rise, don't Kill me out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
and I'le promise you never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54323:22"/>
This I am assured of, that when I thought
I had cut off two Heads at a Blow (you

sprung up a third, one <hi>I. E.</hi> a bold Lad,
who lays claim to all that ever you have

Gentlemen, who is the right and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

you was <hi>gentile.</hi> in hussing our Clergy in

your own way of talking (or Wit as you

            <p>In the first place, Sir, though you would

For according to the best Authors that

you may possibly be of the same mind,

Humour you are so fond of: other men

that invidious <hi>Theopompus,</hi> who is said
to write rather like an <hi>Accuser,</hi> than <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian.</hi>
That Advice he gives his <hi>Son,</hi>
was intended for you also; <hi>make your
wit rather a Buckler to defend your self, then
a Sword to wound others: For a word cuts
deeper then a sharp weapon, and is longer in
Curing.</hi> And the Proverb founded upon
great Experience, bids every man take
heed of a <hi>Tongue</hi> that will cut his own
<hi>Throat.</hi> A little modesty blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with as much Prudence never did
any man hurt.</p>
            <p>Now if you will take these Advisoes
you may; nay, if not, you may take your
own course. And so, with my due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to the whole <hi>Club,</hi> wishing you all
