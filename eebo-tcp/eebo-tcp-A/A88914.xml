         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:119875:5"/>
that a <hi>Cacoethes ſcribendi</hi> had ſome mixture with my more juſtifiable inducements to this work; which if thou deſireſt furthar to be ſatisfied in, take this account. Having often in the diverſion of my ſtudies (For I muſt tell thee they are much of another nature) occaſionally glanced upon ſome ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; a long time as lightly paſſed from them, I began at length to queſtion whether I were not injurious to my Genius, or rather a ſuperiour benevolence to bury ſuch thoughts in their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb facs="tcp:119875:6"/>
Muſing a while here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I found at length that what was ſo eaſily repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted was not as eaſily recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that I had cauſe to ſuſpect that poſſibly whilſt I laboured with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to <hi>gather grapes of</hi> thornes, I might looſe <hi>figges</hi> ready to drop into my mouth. Hereupon I uſed more providence for the future, and as I had ſuch a thought ſuggeſted, I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed it to paper. At length upon a review I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited them ſuch (for I will not conceale this weakneſſe from thee) as might perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:119875:6"/>
not without ſome profit be ſent to the Preſſe, and ſo I gave them my <hi>Inprimantur.</hi> Thus Reader thou hadſt my deſignes, and my motives thereunto in their true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I confeſſe I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be accounted a foole, than an hypocrite, and yet rather be accounted a hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, than be one. That I ſubjoyn'd a caution now and then, was becauſe I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red divers in this age to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>Thornes David</hi> mentioned at his laſt, <hi>that cannot be taken with</hi> [bare] <hi>hands but the man that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them muſt be fenced with</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119875:7"/>
               <hi>iron</hi> &amp;c: and if the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader think the like wanting in other places, I deſire his charity to believe them underſtood. And now if I can perceive that theſe few notions procure any Chriſtian the leaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as I pray God they may, I ſhall not be quite diſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated either by the harſh cenſure from others, which I expect, or the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſentence of raſhneſſe &amp; precocity, which I am more ſure of from my ſelfe; but ſhall think it a buſineſſe not wholly to be repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of, that another has been benefitted
<pb facs="tcp:119875:7"/>
though by my indiſcretion.

when it turns the free grace of God, and the ſanctifying power of the ſpirit into it's nutriment: which is done when a man ſhall be convinced of a groſſe ſin (and the leaſt allowed is ſuch) and ſhall pray God by his omnipotent power to deliver him from it, and here ſet up his reſt, not <hi>cooperating</hi> with Gods grace, nor in his heart hating the ſin, or deſiring it's mortification, but confuting his frequent praiers by continuall practiſe.
