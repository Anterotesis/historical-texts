         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Foraſmuch as We, from the great care We always had of the Advancement of the Trade and Manufactories of this Our Ancient Kingdom, have made ſeveral good Laws and Acts thereanent, and particularly, by the 18th. Act of our Current Parliament, in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> 1681. Relative to our former Proclamation in <hi>April,</hi> preceeding; The Importing, Selling, Venting, Bartering, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of diverſe Commodities therein named, is Prohibited and Diſcharged, under the Certifications and Penalties expreſt therein: And albeit We then underſtood that the Importing, and Venting of theſe Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commodities could hardly be reſtrained without a total Prohibition had been given to the wearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yet out of a tenderneſs to the Merchants, who might have had great parts of their Stocks in theſe Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities upon their hands, We thought it not then fit to make a total and immediate Prohibition to the Wearing, but ordained them to be put under Bond, not to Import any of theſe Prohibited Goods thereafter, nor to Vent, Sell, Barter, or Exchange any thereof, upon hazard of incurring the Certifications contained therein: And notwithſtanding there hath been more then ſufficient time allowed to the Merchants to have ſold off theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Goods, yet upon pretext thereof, and of the Abiguity of the words in the Bond, that they are only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged not to Vent, Sell, Barter, or Exchange any of theſe Goods, that at the buying or receiving thereof were known to have been Imported, contrary to the Laws; diverſe Perſons have preſumed to Import, at the leaſt to Reſet Commodities unwarrantable Imported, and to Vent, Sell, Barter, and Exchange the ſame, ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Execution of the Law hath been hitherto evacuated and eluded, and honeſt Men, who out of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Duty have given obedience, in hazard to be ruined, and the Trade and Manufactory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom overturned and deſtroyed; and although we had more then reaſon to have inforced the Execution of the ſaids good Laws, by the examplary puniſhment of perſons moſt guilty: Nevertheleſs We, according to Our accuſtomed Clemency, have thought fit to continue any Sentence upon the Proceſs in dependence a gainſt them, at the inſtance of our Advocat, till we ſhall have occaſion to know their future behaviour. And in the mean time, for Explicating and making the ſaid Act of Parliament effectual for the good ends therein deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We with Advice of Our Privy Council hereby Prohibit and Diſcharge all Merchants within this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or other Trafficquers, Men, or Women, to Buy, Sell, or Barter, or Exchange with themſelves, or among others, any Cloaths, Stuffs, Sarges, Holland, Cambridge, Silk ſtockings, or any Goods made of Wool, or Lint, after tho Date hereof, except they know and can be able to declare upon Oath they were either made in the Kingdom, or lawfully Imported, preceding the Prohibition contained in the Act of Parliament and Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aforeſaid, under the Penalties and Certifications therein contained, to be inflicted on them, without favour or defalcation. And in reſpect diverſe Perſons have, or may pretend to have ſuch Goods in their cuſtody, as to which they cannot poſitively declare upon Oath that they were Imported before the Prohibition, as having come through ſeveral hands: We do allow the Merchants Burgeſſes of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and others, havers of ſuch Goods in their Poſſeſſion, before the Date hereof (who did take the Bond, and give up Inventar, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) liberty to Retail the ſame to the Liedges, or Export them out of the Kingdom at any time betwixt <hi>this</hi> and the firſt of <hi>November</hi> next; Certifying ſuch as ſhall upon pretext hereof Import any Prohibited Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Vent, Sell, Barter, or Exchange any thereof after the ſaid day, the ſame ſhall be Confiſcat, Burnt, and Deſtroyed, and the Perſons guilty otherwiſe puniſhed, conform to the ſaid Act of Parliament.</p>
