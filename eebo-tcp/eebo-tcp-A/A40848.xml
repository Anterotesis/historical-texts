            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YEſterday came here Mr. <hi>Henry Scardivile,</hi> one of the Prebends of <hi>St. Patrick</hi>'s <hi>Dublin,</hi> there being a Warrant againſt him, and ſeveral others of the Clergy, Iſſued by the Late King <hi>James.</hi> He made his Eſcape, and fled to a place called <hi>Old Patrick,</hi> Nine Miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> to one Mr. <hi>Cottingtons,</hi> who, with his Father In-Law, their Wives, and the ſaid <hi>Scardivile,</hi> a Man-Servant, and an Old Man (who undertook to be Pilot) on Thurſday Morning laſt took a ſmall open Boat, and, God be praiſed, all Landed ſafe on Saturday at <hi>Beaumorris</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay that the Late King, on Thurſday laſt was Seven-night, came to his Houſe of Lords, and having ſent for the Houſe of Commons, made a Speech to them, in which he acquainted them, <hi>That he expected an Invaſion from</hi> England <hi>in 10 days, and that he muſt Prorogue them.</hi> They deſired two days longer time to fit, bnt he denied it; whereupon he prorogued them till the latter end of <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately he ordered Warrants to be Iſſued againſt the principal Citizens and Clergy of <hi>Dublin,</hi> on pretence of ſome Diſaffection to him There are ſome in Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>viz.</hi> Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi> under a ſtrong Guard at their Houſes.

            <p>The Proteſtants there, and in other Parts, live in a moſt miſerable and ſad Condition, the little All they had left being taken from them by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, and their Bodies thrown into Dungeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Late King has Iſſued a Proclamation, Requiring all Proteſtants to bring in their Arms and Horſes, (theſe, to my knowledge, were taken from them five Months ago) and if any, of what ſort ſoever, be found with them, they are to be left to the mercy of the Soldiers, and the Diſcoverer to have 20 <hi>l.</hi> to be Levied of the Perſon's Goods.</p>
