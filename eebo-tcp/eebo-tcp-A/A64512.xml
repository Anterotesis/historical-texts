            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LAST INSTRUCTIONS TO A PAINTER.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AFter two sittings, now our <hi>Lady State,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To end her Picture, does the third time wait.</l>
               <l>But er'e thou fal'st to work, first <hi>Painter</hi> see</l>
               <l>It be'nt too slight grown, or too hard for thee.</l>
               <l>Canst thou paint without Colours? Then 'tis right:</l>
               <l>For so we too without a Fleet can fight.</l>
               <l>Or hast thou dawb a Sign-post, and that ill?</l>
               <l>'Twill suit our great debauch and little skill.</l>
               <l>Or hast thou mark't how antique Masters limn</l>
               <l>The Aly roof, with snuff of Candle dimm,</l>
               <l>Sketching in shady smoke prodigious tools,</l>
               <l>'Twill serve this race of Drunkards, Pimps, and Fools.</l>
               <l>But if to match our Crimes thy skill presumes,</l>
               <l>As th' <hi>Indians</hi> draw our Luxury in Plumes.</l>
               <l>Or if to score out our compendious Fame,</l>
               <l>With <hi>Hook</hi> then, through the <hi>microscope,</hi> take aim:</l>
               <l>Where, like the new <hi>Controller,</hi> all men laugh</l>
               <l>To see a tall Lowse brandish the white Staff.</l>
               <l>Else shalt thou oft thy guiltless Pencil curse,</l>
               <l>Stamp on thy Pallat, nor perhaps the worse.</l>
               <l>The Painter so, long having vext his cloth,</l>
               <l>Of his Hound's Mouth to feign the raging froth,</l>
               <l>His desperate Pencil at the work did dart,</l>
               <l>His Anger reacht that rage which past his Art;</l>
               <l>Chance finisht that which Art could but begin,</l>
               <l>And he sat smiling how his Dog did grinn.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62287:3"/>
So may'st thou perfect, by a lucky blow,</l>
               <l>What all thy softest touches cannot do.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Paint then St. <hi>A—s</hi> full of soup and gold,</l>
               <l>The new <hi>Courts</hi> pattern, Stallion of the old.</l>
               <l>Him neither Wit nor Courage did exalt,</l>
               <l>But Fortune chose him for her pleasure salt.</l>
               <l>Paint him with <hi>Drayman</hi>'s Shoulders, butchers <hi>Mien,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Member'd like Mules, with Elephantine chine.</l>
               <l>Well he the Title of St. <hi>A—s</hi> bore,</l>
               <l>For never <hi>Bacon</hi> study'd Nature more.</l>
               <l>But Age, allaying now that youthful heat,</l>
               <l>Fits him in <hi>France</hi> to play at Cards and treat.</l>
               <l>Draw no Commission lest the <hi>Court</hi> should lye,</l>
               <l>That, disavowing Treaty, ask supply.</l>
               <l>He needs no Seal, but to St. <hi>James</hi>'s lease,</l>
               <l>Whose Breeches were the Instrument of Peace.</l>
               <l>Who, if the <hi>French</hi> dispute his Pow'r, from thence</l>
               <l>Can straight produce them a <hi>Plenipotence.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nor fears he <hi>the most Christian</hi> should trepan</l>

               <l>How after Childbirth to renew a Maid.</l>
               <l>And found how <hi>Royal Heirs</hi> might be matur'd,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Paint her with Oyster Lip, and breath of Fame,</l>
               <l>Wide Mouth that Sparagus may well proclaim:</l>
               <l>With <hi>Chanc'lor's</hi> Belly, and so large a Rump.</l>
               <l>There, not behind the Coach, her Pages jump.</l>

               <l>And nightly hears the hated Guards away</l>

               <l>Discern'd Love's Cause, and a new Flame began.</l>
               <l>Her wonted joys thenceforth and <hi>Court</hi> she shuns,</l>
               <l>And still within her mind the Footman runs:</l>
               <l>His brazen Calves, his brawny Thighs, (the Face</l>

               <l>Poring within her Glass she re-adjusts</l>

               <l>TIr'd with the noysom Follies of the Age,</l>
               <l>And weary of my Part, I quit the Stage;</l>
               <l>For who in Life's dull Farce a Part would bear,</l>
               <l>Where Rogues, Whores, Bawds, all the head Actors are?</l>
               <l>Long I with Charitable Malice strove,</l>

               <l>Scarce will there greater Grief pierce every heart,</l>

               <l>Make thee come short of all thy Lewdness past:</l>
               <l>Though on thy Head, Grey-hairs like <hi>Etna</hi>'s Snow</l>
               <l>Are shed, thou'rt Fire and Brimstone all below.</l>
               <l>Thou monstrous thing, in whom at once does rage</l>
               <l>The flames of Youth, and Impotence of Age.</l>
               <l>My Lady <hi>D—s</hi> takes the second place,</l>
               <l>Proud with thy favour, and peculiar grace;</l>
               <l>E'n she with all her Piety and Zeal,</l>
               <l>The hotter flames that burn in thee does feel.</l>
               <l>Thou dost into her kindling breast inspire,</l>
               <l>The Lustful seeds of thy Contagious fire;</l>
               <l>So well the Spirit and the Flesh agree,</l>
               <l>Lust and Devotion, Zeal and Letchery.</l>
               <l>Important use Religion's made,</l>
               <l>By those who wisely drive the Cheating Trade;</l>
               <l>As Wines Prohibited securely pass,</l>
               <l>Changing the Name of their own Native place.</l>
               <l>So Vice grows safe, drest in Devotions Name,</l>
               <l>Unquestion'd by the Custom-house of Fame:</l>
               <l>Where e're so much of Sanctity you see,</l>
               <l>Be more suspicious of hid Villany;</l>
               <l>

Whoseever Zeal is than his Neighbours more,</l>
               <l>If man think he's a Rogue, if Woman Whore:</l>
               <l>And such a thing art thou Religious Pride,</l>
               <l>So very Lewd, and yet so Sanctify'd.</l>
               <l>Let now the <hi>D—s</hi> take no further care</l>
               <l>Of humorous Stallions, let her not dispair,</l>
               <l>Since her Indulgent Stars so kind have been,</l>
               <l>To send her <hi>B—y</hi> and <hi>M—e,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>This last doth banisht <hi>M—s</hi> Place supply,</l>
               <l>And Wit supplanted is by Letcher</l>
               <l>For <hi>M—h</hi> he had Parts, and Wit, and Sense,</l>
               <l>To all which <hi>M—e</hi> had no pretence;</l>
               <l>A proof that since such things as he prevail,</l>
               <l>Her <hi>H—s</hi> Head is lighter than her Tail.</l>
               <l>But stay, I <hi>P—h</hi> almost had forgot,</l>
               <l>The common Theam of ev'ry Rhiming <hi>Sot;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>She'll after railing make us laugh a while,</l>
               <l>For at her Folly who can choose but smile?</l>
               <l>While them who always slight her great she makes,</l>
               <l>And so much pains to be despis'd she takes.</l>
               <l>Goes sauntring with her Highness up to Town,</l>
               <l>To an Old Play, and in the Dark come down;</l>
               <l>Still makes her Court to her as to the Queen,</l>
               <l>But still is Justled out by <hi>M—e.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>So much more Worthy a kind Bawd is thought,</l>
               <l>Than ever she who her from Exile brought.</l>
               <l>O <hi>P—h,</hi> foolish <hi>P—h!</hi> Not to take</l>
               <l>The offer the great <hi>S—d</hi> did make,</l>
               <l>When Cringing at thy Feet; e're <hi>M—h</hi> bow'd,</l>
               <l>The Golden Calf, that's Worshipp'd by the Crowd.</l>
               <l>But thou for <hi>Y—k,</hi> who now despises thee,</l>
               <l>To leave both him and Pow'rful <hi>S—v:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If this is all the Policy you know,</l>

               <l>How wisely did thy Country's Laws ordain,</l>
               <l>Never to let the foolish Women Reign.</l>
               <l>But what must we expect, who daily see</l>
               <l>Unthinking <hi>C—s</hi> Rul'd by Unthinking thee.</l>
