         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Is it not torment enough not to love thee, or need we be tied by laws and threats to love thee?

And now if love ought to be requited with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving again, what love is that which can equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize thy love? Thou lovedst me from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, before I was, or could gainſay thy love. Thou createdſt ſoul &amp; body and all things elſe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120044:16"/>
which were nothing to thee, for my ſake; and conſerveſt them for me to this day. Thou hast given thy Angells charge over me, to keep me in my wayes, even then (ah wretch) when I am ſinning againſt thee. Thou hast prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for me an exceeding great reward, and hast called me into thy grace that I might inherit it. And when I fell away ſo oft and loſt thy love, yet didst thou call me
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120044:17"/>
back again unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The cogitation of this is pleaſant to my ſoul: But, O far more ſweet (O ſweetest Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt daigne to become Man, to ſuffer ſo bitter and horrid things, and at laſt to die upon the Croſſe for me; O cruell me! who crucified thee. But that which lies ſweeteſt of all upon my ſoul, is, That when thou wert about to die, thou ordaineſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:120044:17"/>
of thy precious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full token of thy love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. And now to make amends for ſo great benefits, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt onely that I love thee again, O Love! exſtaſie of love! How doeſt thou deſerve, O thou infinite goodneſſe! to be loved of all and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all created things! So let me love thee therefore, O Jeſus! Thou Saviour of lovers, and onely love of all that

with all my ſtrength, &amp; am ſtedfaſtly purpoſed to keep all thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commandments, and to conform my ſelf to thy moſt holy will. And why do I love thee thus? but becauſe thou art infinitely more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it is poſsible thou canst be loved of me: for thy unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perfections ſake, thy incomprehenſible power, most unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wiſdome, for thy unbounded Holineſſe

               <hi>O my moſt Gracious God! O my moſt ſweet Jeſus! I repent from the bottom of my heart, that by my foul tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions I have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Majeſtie and moſt infinite Goodneſſe, which I ought and will now love above all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things; and this,

cauſe thou art the God Almightie, wiſe, holy, and good, to whom all ſinne is more odious and deteſtable then can be poſſibly imagined. Wherefore for this thy Love ſake I firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve never to offend thee any more, to ſhun all occaſions of evil, and perform all that thou hast commanded me: Forgive I beſeech thee, as I forgive all trespaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes against me: and as I humbly crave pardon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120044:35"/>
of my offences ſo I hope by thy merits of thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud, O Jeſus! I ſhall obtain what I ask for, and by thy Grace ſhall amend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my life and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in thy ſervice unto my death.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Let this be thy conſtant dutie, morning and evening, and as oft as thou ſhalt fall into any ſinne, that ſo thou mayeſt recover Gods favour to thee again.</p>
            <p n="5">5 And to prove thy
