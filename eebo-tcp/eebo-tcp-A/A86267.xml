            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have no cauſe to think that you have not at any time taken me along with
you in the daily walk upon your knees to Heaven, but I beſeech you and
all my Brethren to be (now eſpecially) very mindfull to call upon God
for me. The more company I go withal, the more welcom I ſhall be made.
I ſhould be loath either to leave out of my Creed, or to be left out of the
benefit of the Communion of Saints Two are better then one. Two or three have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a Promiſe; but to go with a multitude to the Houſe of God, where all commers
are welcome, is to be aſſured before-hand of good entertainment. Admiſſion will hardly
be denyed to any, for whom there is great importunity of many: If the Gate be ſhut,
much knocking will open it; or if that would not doe it, united Forces would offer an
Holy violence. Many will prevail, where one alone can do but little good. <hi>Woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that is alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore dear Brother, ſith it is the infirmity of our nature, that we live not without
the occaſions of giving and taking of offence. And 'tis the corruption of our nature that
the offences we give, we write in the duſt; Thoſe we take, we engrave in Marble. If you
know, or ſhall heare of any one either of my Brethren, or other perſons whom by any act
of ſcandall I have tempted, or provoked, or leſſened or diſturbed, to exclude me the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of their charitable prayers or wiſhes I beſeech you beg of them from me, for me,
their pardon. And let not any private wild-fire of paſſion put out the holy flames of a
diffuſive charity: And as for my ſelfe, I doe here proteſt before God that I doe heartily
deſire to forget the injuries of whoſoever has treſpaſſed againſt me, either by word or
deed. And if God ſhould have been pleaſed to have granted a longer life, I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
(yea I am ſtedfaſtly reſolved to ſollicite termes of Reconciliation with them that
have done me the wrong) And if my owne heart doe not deceive me, I would give my
life to ſave the ſoule of any of my Chriſtian Brethren, and would be content to want
ſome degrees of glory in Heaven, ſo that my very greateſt Enemies might be ſo happy
as to have ſome. The God of Mercy ſhed forth his Bowels for them that ſhed my blood,
and the blood of Chriſt ſave, &amp; the Spirit of Chriſt ſanctifie, and ſupport him who deſires
to live no longer then to honour the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, and both living and
dying craves yours, and the prayers of the whole Church for her unworthy Child, and</p>
