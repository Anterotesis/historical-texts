         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE pretty Bantling that has lately been laid to the charge of our four Pariſhes, and had probably as many (if not more) Fathers (for the Mother was without doubt true to the Troop, and the Babe has ſome of the features of ſeveral Faces well-known among us) one the <hi>B.</hi> of the Burrough, who (notwithſtanding the pretences of Intereſt to byaſs him for <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi>) did certainly with his under-<hi>Janizaries</hi> engage for them as the <hi>French</hi> did for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the late <hi>Dutch</hi> War; another ſhrewdly ſuſpected to be too much inclined to St. <hi>Thomas a Beckets</hi> Religion, though he appear an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> in that one inſtance of never having Chriſtened any of his Children; a third ſo undeniably Popiſhly-affected that he has made choice to live in Tripple-Crown-Court; and the fourth, one who perhaps thought he might the more ſafely venture upon playing a trick of Youth becauſe of his Intereſt in the Baudy-Court; (All which will yet doubtleſs be ready to declare themſelves as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent in the matter as the child unborn); this hopeful Babe I ſay, having as yet no other Name than that of it's Godfathers, <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> I ſhall take the liberty to add to it the Title of a <hi>Scurrilous Jeering Pamphlet,</hi> which the following ſerious Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination will make appear to be it's due.</p>
            <p>After the reproachful term of <hi>Bromidgham-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> which they faſten upon the Intelligencer Mr. <hi>F. S.</hi> and which without queſtion they hope will ſtick as a Brand upon the Sober-party in like manner as that of <hi>Papiſt in Maſquerade</hi> does upon another ſort of men. They hint at ſome ſtrangers who concern'd themſelves in our Election, and ſlily call them <hi>no ſmall</hi>—with a ſpace, which they knew common uſe would prompt any ordinary Reader to ſupply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently, whereas it is ſuppoſed that it was well known to the Authors, that among thoſe ſtrangers there were ſeveral true Proteſtant Peers that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in behalf of <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> againſt <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich;</hi> to whom though thoſe famous Patriots were content to allow the Character of <hi>honeſt men,</hi> (which they may be for ought I know) yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our noble Friend was very much in the right, who at one of our meetings told us that we ought to chuſe <hi>ſuch hardy, rough-hewn Repreſentatives as the preſent juncture of Affairs requir'd, and ſuch as might effectually do the buſineſs of the King and Kingdom;</hi> and if Steward <hi>Smith</hi> be not ſuch a one as well as his Partner, which I begin to ſuſpect from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe Pamphleters (who it may be know him better than I) give of him, I recall my Vote, which before did him ho good, and my revocation of it I doubt can now do him no harm.</p>
            <p>For it cannot be denied that that part of the Tory-Pamphlet which is purely Narrative, is agreeable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to matter of Fact. And beſides by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Pole-book with the Poors-book of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pariſhes, the Majority even of Scot and Lot men is on the one ſide of <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> by near a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; ſo that, I muſt be content to be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe two perſons whom the Proteſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Miniſter I moſtly hear, and who is (I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) the perſon upon whom the Authors have in one part of the Pamphlet ſo ſcandalouſly reflected, has taught me not to make Arbitrators of my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The reaſonably-to-be ſuſpected-and not juſtly-to-be-defended-Authors of that Pamphlet have laid hold of all advantages to render the honeſt party obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to cenſure; elſe they would not ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly have expoſed their ſlips and falls, particularly thoſe of Mr. <hi>F. S.</hi> whom they would inſinuate to the World to have been mad or drunk under the phraſe of being <hi>overcharg'd with Ale and Zeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by the Abuſes ſaid to be put upon <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich</hi> to weaken their Intereſt, are meant the ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad and poſting up libellous Papers againſt them by ſome of our party, thoſe who did ſo muſt anſwer at Law for their imprudence, if <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> are not ſo good <hi>Chriſtians and Gentlemen</hi> as the Scriblers of that Paper repreſent them to be; for I for my part am no more able to juſtifie ſuch than our Tantivy-men are to defend what they are pleas'd to call <hi>Town-raillery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We never pretended to make uſe of an Appeal but upon grounds, which the diſcovery about Scot and Lot men has now removed; and the Pamphle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot be thought to have been ſerious when they inſinuated that the Inmates above all others had ſuch a deſign; their condition in the World render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them leſs to be ſuſpected to appear in behalf of a Member whoſe true <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſpoſition might incline him to require the antiently accuſtomed compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the trouble and charge of his ſervice. So that the Scriblers might e'en have left off before they had begun; for I ſuppoſe that by this time I have made it appear that their Paper is a ſcurrilous jeering Pamphlet, <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi>
