            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Acts 2. 37, 38, 40.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>37, Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid to Peter, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</p>
                  <p>38, Then ſaid Peter vnto them, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>40. And with many other words did he teſtifie, and exhort them, ſaying, Saue your ſelues from this vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHo knowes not that <hi>Simon Peter</hi> was a Fiſher? that was his trade both by Sea and Land, if we may not rather ſay, that as <hi>Simon,</hi> he was a Fiſherman, but, as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3931:3"/>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> he was a fiſher of men; He that call'd him ſo, made him ſo; And ſurely his firſt draught of fiſhes, which, as <hi>Simon,</hi> he made at our Sauiours comand, might well be a true type of the firſt draught of men, which, as <hi>Peter,</hi> hee made in this place; for, as then, the nets were ready to cracke, and the ſhip to ſinke, with ſtore; ſo here, when he threw forth his firſt drag net of heauenly doctrine, &amp; reproofe, three thouſand ſoules were drawne vp at once. This text was as the ſacred cord, that drew the net together; and pull'd vp this wondrous ſhole of conuerts to God; It is the ſumme of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, if not at a Faſt, yet at a generall humiliation, which is more and better; (for wherefore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3931:3"/>
faſt we but to be humbled? and if wee could bee duely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, without faſting, it would pleaſe God a thouſand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to faſt formally, without true humiliation; Indeed, for the time, this was a feaſt, the feaſt of Pentecoſt; but for the eſtate of theſe Iewes, it was <hi>dies cinerum,</hi> a day of contrition; a day of deepe hunger, and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi> Neither doubt I to ſay, that the feſtiuity of the ſeaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not a little to their humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; like as wee are neuer ſo apt to take cold, as vpon a ſweat: and that winde is euer the keeneſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> blowes cold out of a warm coaſt; No day could be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiue then an Aſhwedneſday,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3931:4"/>
that ſhould light vpon a ſolemne Pentecoſt; ſo it was here: Euery thing anſwered well; The Spirit came downe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty winde; and behold, it hath rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their harts together; the houſe ſhooke in the deſcent, and behold here, the foundations of the ſoule were moued; Fiery tongues appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; here their breſts were infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; Clouen tongues; and here their hearts were cut in ſunder. The words were miraculous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in a ſupernaturall, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den variety of language; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diuine, laying before them both the truth of the Meſſiah, and their bloody meaſure offered to that Lord of life, and now <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puncti cordibus,</hi> they were pricked in their hearts. Wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayes,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3931:4"/>
               <hi>The words of the wiſe are like goads, and nayles;</hi> here they were ſo; Goades, for they were, <hi>compuncti,</hi> pricked; yea, but the goad could not goe ſo deepe, that paſſeth but the skin; they were nayles, driuen into the very heart of the auditors, vp to the head; the great Maſter of the Aſſembly, the diuine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſet them home, <hi>they were pricked in their hearts.</hi> Neuer were words better beſtowed. It is an happy blood-letting that ſaues the life, this did ſo here: wee looke to the ſigne commonly in phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy, it is a ſigne of our idle and ignorant ſuperſtition, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> here ſaw the ſigne to be in the heart, and he ſtrikes happily, <hi>Compuncti cordibus, they were pricked in their hearts, and ſaid,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3931:5"/>
               <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, what ſweet Muſick was this to the Apoſtles eare? I dare ſay, none but heauen could afford better; what a pleaſing ſpectacle was this anguiſh of their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſoules? To ſee men come in their zealous deuotions, and lay downe their moneyes (the price of their alienated poſſeſſions) at thoſe Apoſtolike feet, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this; that they came in a bleeding contrition, &amp; proſtrated their penitent and humbled ſoules at the beautifull feet of the meſſengers of peace; with <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> Oh when, when ſhall our eyes be bleſſed with ſo happy a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect? How long ſhall wee thunder out Gods fearfull iudgements
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3931:5"/>
againſt wilfull ſinners; how long ſhall wee threaten the flames of hell to thoſe impious wretches, who crucifie againe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, the Lord of life, ere we can wring a ſigh, or a teare from the rocks of their hearts or eyes? Woe is me that wee may ſay too truely, as this <hi>Peter</hi> did of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiſhing; <hi>Maſter, we haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed all the night and caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Surely, it may well goe for night with vs, whiles wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and preuaile not.

worthy then thy firſt meſſengers; yet what excuſe is this to the beſotted world, that through ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duredneſſe and infidelity it will needs periſh? no man will ſo much as ſay with the Iewes, What haue I done, or with Saint <hi>Peters</hi> auditors, what ſhall I doe? Oh fooliſh ſinners, ſhall yee liue here alwayes; care ye not for your ſoules; is there not an hell that gapes for your ſtubborne impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence? Goe on, if there bee no remedy, goe on, and dye for euer; we are guiltleſſe, God is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, your damnation is iuſt; But, if your life bee fickle, death vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auoydable, if an euerlaſting ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grance be the neceſſary reward of your momentany wickednes, Oh turne, turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your euill waies;

and in an holy diſtraction of your remorſed ſoules ſay, with theſe Iewes, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> This from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall view of the occaſion; wee deſcend to a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luke,</hi> the beloued Phyſitian, deſcribes Saint <hi>Peters</hi> proceeding here, much after his owne trade; as of a true ſpirituall phyſitian; who finding his Countrymen the Iewes in a deſperate, and deadly condition, gaſping for life, ſtruggling with death, enters into a ſpeedy and zealous courſe of their cure; And firſt hee begins with the Chyrurgicall part; and finding them rancke of blood, and that foule, and putrified, hee lets it out <hi>(compuncti cordibus)</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:3931:7"/>
where wee might ſhow you the inciſion, the veine, the lancet, the orifice, the anguiſh of the ſtroke: The inciſion, <hi>compuncti, they were pricked;</hi> The veine in their hearts; Smile not now, ye Phyſitians, if any heare me this day, as if I had paſſed a ſolaeciſme, in telling you theſe men were pricked in the veine of the heart, talke you of your <hi>Cephalica,</hi> and the reſt, and tel vs of another ciſtern from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce theſe <hi>tubuli ſanguinis</hi> are deriued; I tell you againe (with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of more incongruities ſtill) that God and his diuine Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe ſtill let blood in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian veine of the hart; The lancet is the keene and cutting reproofe of their late barbarous cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of their holy and moſt innocent

and benigne Sauiour; The orifice, is the eare, <hi>(when they heard this:)</hi> what euer the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſtance bee of theſe parts; ſpiritually, the eare is the very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the heart; and whoſoeuer would giue a medicinall ſtroke to the heart muſt paſſe it through the eare, the ſenſe of diſcipline and correction: The anguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes it ſelfe in their paſſionate exclamation; <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi>

            <p>There is none of theſe, which my ſpeech might not well take vp, if not as an houſe to dwell in, yet as an Inne to reſt and lodge in; but I will not ſo much as bayt here; onely wee make this a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row fare tothoſe other ſacred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of ſauing remedies:

but groſſe idolatry in paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, in miſ-beleeuing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and (woe is me that I muſt ſay it) a coloured impiety ſhares too much of the reſt; My ſpeech is glided, ere I was aware, into the third head of our diſcourſe; and is ſuddenly falne vpon the practiſe of that, which S. <hi>Peters</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample here warrants, the cenſure of ill deſeruing times: which I muſt craue leaue of your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; Chriſtian patience, with an holy and iuſt freedome, to proſecute.</p>

Now, what need I waſte the time in dehorting your Noble and Chriſtian ingenuity from partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Epidemicall ſinnes of a froward generation? It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough motiue to you, that ſinne is a baſe, ſordid, diſhonourable thing; but, withall, let me adde only one diſſuaſiue from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, implyed in the very word <hi>Saue;</hi> for how are wee ſaued but from a danger? The danger both of corruption, and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Corruption; ye ſee before your eies that one yawning mouth makes many; This pitch will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file vs; One rotten kernell of the Pomegranate infects the fellowes; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made that verſe of the heathen Poet, Canonicall, Euill conuerſation corrupts good manners;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3931:33"/>
What wofull experience haue we, euerie day, of thoſe, who by this meanes from a vigorous heat of zeale, haue declined to a temper of lukewarme indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e deuills? Oh the dangerous, and inſenſible inſinuations of ſinne; If that crafty tempter can hereby worke vs but to one dram of leſſe deteſtation to a familiarly inured euill, hee promiſeth himſelfe the victorie; It is well noted by Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> of that chaſt Patriarch <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> that, ſo ſoone as euer his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Miſtreſſe had laid her impure hand vpon his cloake, he leaues it behinde him, that he might
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3931:33"/>
bee ſure to auoyd the danger of her contagious touch; If the Spouſe of Chriſt bee a Lilly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes; (by the mighty protection of her omnipotent husband) yet take thou heed, how thou walkeſt amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt thoſe thornes, for that Lilly: Shortly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wouldeſt thou not bee tainted with wickedneſſe, abhorre the peſtilent ſocietie of leud men; and by a ſeaſonable ſubduction, thus, <hi>Saue thy ſelfe from a froward generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt and vtmoſt of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers is confuſion; That charge of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> is but iuſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 18. Depart, I pray you, from the tents of theſe men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt ye periſh in all their ſinnes; Lo, the very ſtation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3931:34"/>
the very touch is mortall. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what reaſon is there to hope or to plead for an immunity; If wee ſhare in the worke, why ſhould wee not take part of the wages? <hi>The wages of ſinne is death;</hi> If the ſtorke be taken damage fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the Cranes, ſhee is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped in the ſame net, and can not complaine to bee ſurprized. <hi>Qui cum lupis eſt, cum lupis vlulet,</hi> as he ſaid; Hee that is with wolues, let him howle with wolues: If we bee <hi>fratres in malo,</hi> brethen in euill, we muſt looke to bee inuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſame curſe; bee not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; honorable and beloued, here is no exemption of greatneſs; nay, contrarily, eminence of place aggrauates both the ſinne, and the iudgement; when <hi>Ezra</hi> heard that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3931:34"/>
the hand of the Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had beene chiefe in that great offence, then he rent his cloathes, and tore his haire, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 3.</p>
            <p>Certainly this caſe is dangerous and fearfull, wherſoeuer it lights; Hardly are thoſe ſinnes redreſſed that are taken vp by the great; Eaſily are thoſe ſins diffuſed, that are warranted by great examples: The great lights of heauen, the moſt conſpicuous Planets, if they be eclipſed, all the Almanacks of all Nations write of it; whereas the ſmall Starres of the Galaxy are not heeded; All the Country runs to a Beacon on fire, no body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards to ſee a ſhrub flaming in a valley; Know then, that your ſins are ſo much greater, as your ſelues are; and, all the comfort
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3931:35"/>
that I can giue you with out your true repentance, is, That mighty men ſhall bee mightily tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Of all other men therefore be ye moſt carefull to keepe your ſelues vntainted with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſins; and to renew your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with God; No man cares for a ſpot vpon a plaine, ruſſet, riding ſuit; but we are curious of a rich robe, euery mote there is an eye-ſore; Oh, bee yee carefull to preſerue your honour from all the foule blemiſhes of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as thoſe that know vertue hath a greater ſhare in nobilitie, then blood; Imitate in this, the great frame of the Creation, which ſtill, the more it is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the dregs of this earth, the purer it is; Oh ſaue yee your

ſelues from this vntoward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo ſhall yee helpe to ſaue your nation from the imminent iudgements of our iuſt God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ſhall ye ſaue your ſoules in the day of the appearance of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; to whom with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, one infinite God, be all honour, and glory aſcribed, now, and for euer.</p>
