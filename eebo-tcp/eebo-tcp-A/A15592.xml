            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Patent is grounded in point of Law vpon the Certificate of Maſter Serieant <hi>Crew,</hi> Maſter <hi>Atturny</hi> Generall, and Sir <hi>Henry Yeluerton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is grounded in the point of conueniencie vpon the returne of a Commiſſion vnder the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> directed for the tryall thereof, where the Aldermen, Burgeſſes, Maſters of Shipping, Fiſhermen of great <hi>Yarmouth</hi> and <hi>Winterton</hi> were examined vpon Oath, And the neceſſity thereof certified in the high Court of Chauncery, As may appeare by the Copie of the Commiſſion, Examination, Certificate, and returne vnder the Officer his hand of that Court.</p>
            <p>It is grounded in point of charge vpon the halfe of the voluntary Contributions graunted to Sir <hi>Edward Howard</hi> for one Light-houſe at <hi>Dongeonneſſe,</hi> although there be three Light-houſes at <hi>Winterton,</hi> and that the Patentee is tyed to ſet vp all other Light-houſes within the compaſſe of foure miles, which heereafter (by the alteration of Channels and Sands) may be found neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, a great number of the ſame Maſters haue ſet their hands voluntarily to giue the ſame allowance of a penny vpon the Tunne for a Light-houſe at <hi>Kelſey</hi> in the Riuer of <hi>Humber,</hi> as appeareth by Certificate.</p>
            <p>The Scottiſh-men doe all willingly pay a penny vpon the Tun, as may appeare by Certificate vnder more then threeſcore Maſters hands.</p>
            <p>The party who is expreſly imployed by the Coaſt Townes to proſecute the buſineſſe againſt the Patentee, hath confeſſed that the Shipping trading to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> doe make a voyage in a yeare more then euer they did before, and that by the benefit of the Lights, whereby it will clearely appeare, that the profit made by this voyage, will ſurmount the charge payd in a whole yeare.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the ſame party with diuers others haue moſt willingly offered a halfe penny vpon the Tunne, if the Patentee would condiſcend: he ſaid further, that hee and all the reſt of the Maſters would be ſutors to the Court of Parliament, that no man liuing ſhould haue the performance of the ſeruice except the Patentee, in regard that there could be no exceptions taken againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>The voluntary contribution for <hi>Caſter</hi> and <hi>Stamport</hi> Lights, is more then twice as much as ſixe pence in the twenty Chaldron, which if they doe take onely from ſuch Shipping as haue vſe of the Lights at <hi>Winterton,</hi> as the Patentee doth, will not exceede 128. pounds a yeare, out of which deducting 60. pounds for the intereſt of 600. pounds imployed for their Tower, It will follow by conſequent that they muſt entertaine the Lights at <hi>Winterton</hi> (beſides the loſſe of their ſtocke) for 68. pounds a yeare, and the Patentees will abide any indifferent tryall whatſoeuer, that the Lights at <hi>Winterton,</hi> by an vnauoydable charge (if the preſeruation of the Shipping, Goods, and liues of men, be to be preferred to a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous frugality in that kinde by pinching the ſeruice) will exceede 230. pounds a yeare in Coales, Candles, and Seruants wages, beſides other charge which cannot be eſchewed. The which appeareth euidently by this example.</p>
            <p>The Lights at <hi>Caſter</hi> and <hi>Stamport</hi> erected by <hi>Thomas Buſſell,</hi> and now kept by the Maſters of the Trinity-houſe, with one Candle oftentimes, and at moſt two of ſixe in the pound, there hath within this laſt yeare falne out fiue Shipwracks, whereof three was in the night time, and diuers other Wracks, ſince they had the keeping thereof. Whereas in <hi>Thomas Buſſell</hi> and <hi>Graue Villet</hi> their time, there was no loſſe at all neither at <hi>Dongeonneſſe,</hi> nor at <hi>Wintertonneſſe,</hi> whilſt priuate men haue had the care thereof. And it ſhall be ſufficiently proued if need be, that at <hi>Dongeoneſſe</hi> and at <hi>Wintertonneſſe,</hi> there haue periſhed aboue one hundred Ships ſince the date of the Statute 8. <hi>Eliz.</hi> which (if this power be proper to that Corporation) ſhould be laid to their charge, as by whoſe careleſneſſe and neglect all theſe wofull loſſes haue happened, and which by all appearance would neuer haue beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by them if <hi>Thomas Buſſell</hi> had not beene an humble ſutor to the King for <hi>Caſter</hi> and <hi>Stamport</hi> Lights. Sir <hi>Edw. Howard</hi> for <hi>Dongeonneſſe,</hi> and the Patentees for <hi>Wintertonneſſe</hi> Lights.</p>
            <p>The Maſters of Shipping that repine at the payment of this penny, whereby their Shipping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Goods and liues are preſerued, beſides the gaine they make by the voyage more in a yeare, Doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> for meaſuring their Coales vpon the ſhore at <hi>London</hi> eight pence vpon the <hi>London</hi> Chaldron. The difference of which ſeruices it may be conſidered by this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Court.</p>
            <p>There hath beene no exceptions taken againſt the proſecution of the buſineſſe before it paſt the great Seale: execution of the Patent after it was paſt, nor in the truſt repoſed in the Patentee.</p>
            <p>By all which Arguments aboue written, and their voluntary Contributions graunted to others for ſeruice leſſe important and leſſe chargeable, it would appeare that they ayme rather at the Patentee then the penny, and that this vnſeaſonable offer of ſixe pence vpon euery twenty Chaldron: (Beſides, that it is impoſſible, and that a Statute can hardly tye any man to giue vnder hand what he pleaſeth) is but a fraudulent Compact betwixt the Maſters of the Trinity houſe, and the Maſters of Shipping, who to wreſt the authority from the King, and to defeate the Patent, will offer to maintaine them for nothing at all, when in the meane time it will be as eaſie a matter to the Maſters of the Trinity-houſe, after they haue gotten ſole power in their hands to improue their voluntary Contributions by the ſuperintendency they haue of Sea-faring men, being for the moſt part yonger brothers of their Corporation, as to extort from the Strangers vnder colour of Pilottage, fiue, ſixe, ſeauen and eight pounds euery voyage made. Notwithſtanding, that they are limitted by their Charter, to take onely two ſhillings of twenty, one of tenne, and eight pence out of a noble of the Pilots wages. As alſo to take eight pence a foote as the Ship draweth deepe: Beſides Boyage, Beaconage, and Anchorage, payable by both Subiect and Stranger.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the benefit redounding to the Common-wealth by many degrees exceeding the charge, beſides the ſafety of mens liues, the debt of the Patentee which hath beene occaſioned by the performance of this ſeruice, being ſo heauy vpon him and his ſuerties: The charge that he is at yearely in the execution of it being ſo great, and the profit in regard of the vncertaine charge not anſwerable vnto the common opinion, and it appeareth that the Patentee hath performed the truſt repoſed in him better then the Maſters of the Trinity-houſe, who not onely in this particular, but in euery thing elſe haue neglected the truſt repoſed in them, He is an humble ſutor vnto this Honourable Aſſembly, that they may not Monopolize all vnto themſelues, but that the Patentee may enioy the benefit graunted vnto him by his Maieſtie.</p>
