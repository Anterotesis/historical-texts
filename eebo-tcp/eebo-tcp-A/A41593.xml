         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHAP. I. OF the Veneration ſhewn to Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. Whether the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Pray to Images? in Relation to a Paſſage of a Book, Entituled, <hi>A Catechiſm truly Repreſenting the Doctrines and Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome: and its Vindication.</p>
            <p>CHAP. II. Whether <hi>Papiſts</hi> Pray directly to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as is poſitively Aſſerted by a <hi>Proteſtant?</hi> with an Eſſay of a <hi>Heathen-Catechiſm,</hi> after the Copy of the <hi>Truly-repreſenting Proteſtant-Catechiſm,</hi> in which this Calumny is publiſh'd.</p>
            <p>CHAP. III. Whether the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be contrary to the Writings of the Primitive Fathers, or agreeable to them? The <hi>Papiſt</hi> believes his <hi>Senſes</hi> in this Myſtery as much as the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;</hi> being Notes upon a late Pamphlet, Entituled, <hi>The Papiſts Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, not agreeable to the Primitive Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHAP. IV. The Form of the Catholic Church Eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> No hopes of Salvation out of it. The Practice of the Apoſtles and Primitive Church in this Point, Good at this day. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as uncharitably Damn the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as Theſe are ſaid to do the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> In reference to the Preface of <hi>Wholſom Advices from the B. V.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>CHAP. V. The <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as to the Articles of his <hi>Belief,</hi> follows the <hi>Method</hi> preſcrib'd by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> practis'd by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</hi> The Method is of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Reaſon</hi> than what <hi>Others</hi> follow. The Word <hi>Worſhip</hi> is <hi>Equivocal,</hi> and acknowledg'd ſo by St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHAP. VI. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> do's not <hi>Believe,</hi> but upon moſt <hi>Convincing Reaſons. Myſteries</hi> of Faith <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> not <hi>contrary</hi> to it. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> is not depriv'd of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> nor kept from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> He do's not <hi>Pray</hi> to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> more than <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Pray</hi> to their <hi>Bibles,</hi> or the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Three <hi>Proteſtant Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>CHAP. VII. The <hi>Vulgar</hi> among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> not depriv'd of the <hi>Word</hi> of God. They are better Inſtructed in the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of it, than thoſe of <hi>other Perſwaſions</hi> who Teach themſelves. The <hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:47310:3"/>
CHAP. VIII. The <hi>Vulgar</hi> not permitted to read the Bible among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for fear they ſhould diſcover the Errors of their Religion, an Abſurd Calumny. The Reſtraint is, That there may not be as many different <hi>Words</hi> of God, as there are <hi>Heads</hi> amongſt them; and may have ſomething better Ground than their own <hi>Imagination</hi> to direct their Faith. A Word to a Lay-Friend.</p>
            <p>CHAP. IX. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> not always the <hi>Same</hi> to the <hi>ſame</hi> Perſon. No Poſſibility of meeting in <hi>One Faith,</hi> whilſt <hi>Private Reaſon</hi> ſets up for Interpreter of the <hi>Word</hi> of God. The Sham-Story of the <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Crabs.</hi> The Truth of the <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Solemnity.</p>
            <p>CHAP. X. <hi>Private Interpretation</hi> of Scriptures, the Occaſion of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</hi> Some Proteſtant Divines call in the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Guides;</hi> but all ends in the <hi>Private Spirit.</hi> The Queſtion ſtarted; Where was the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> as it is now Reform'd, before <hi>Luther?</hi> The Anſwers of ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divines.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XI. <hi>An Enquiry into the</hi> Religion <hi>of the</hi> Primitive Times, <hi>and particularly That of</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the</hi> Firſt Chriſtian Emperor; <hi>For the Satisfaction of thoſe, who deſire to know, whether the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>was</hi> generally <hi>Profeſs'd amongſt the Chriſtians of thoſe</hi> Purer Times.</p>
            <p>CHAP. XII. <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Hiſtorians ſhew us <hi>Popery</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> but no <hi>Proteſtancy.</hi> The Chriſtians of that Age never <hi>Proteſted againſt the Popiſh Doctrines</hi> profeſſedly Taught and Practis'd in thoſe Times; Therefore they were <hi>no Proteſtants.</hi> An Enquiry into the Religion of the <hi>Ages</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>

No <hi>Canons</hi> made by the ſaid <hi>Fathers</hi> to prevent the Growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> at that Time profeſſedly Taught and Practis'd, is an Argument that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of thoſe Councils were no <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Lutheran Proteſtants</hi> have their Altars and Church Walls ſet out with the <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who think the beſt temper of Religion to be in the Compounding <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> together, dare not go ſo far; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> expoſe only two Saints of the old Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in their holy Places, admitting generally too the Judaical
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47310:4"/>
Ornament of the <hi>Ark,</hi> ſome <hi>Cberubims</hi> over their Church doors and Windows; but nothing of a <hi>Cbriſtian Repreſentation,</hi> beſides a <hi>Modern Sainted Queen.</hi> This is in ſuch Churches, where the Clamours of the Croud overrule; where nothing more of <hi>Cbriſt</hi> muſt appear, for fear of offending tender Conſciences with the looks and ſmell of <hi>Popery:</hi> whilſt yet in other Places, as in ſome <hi>Cathedrals</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> where the People don't awe the Clergy, where the Charge of <hi>Popery</hi> is neglected, and the Walls and Windows not left as naked, as ſenceleſs Fears would have them, <hi>Cbriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſtand with as much Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> elſwhere; and a <hi>Primitive Martyr</hi> is as becoming an Ornament, as Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And this ſeems ſo reaſonable to ſome true Sons of this Church, that they think nothing more ſuitable to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, where they deſign to converſe with Heaven than a <hi>Crucifix:</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this Practice ſome think fit to wave, for fear of raiſing Jealouſies in their Family, and becoming the talk of the Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>And this which he ſees thus approv'd by many, and practis'd by ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he owns and declares for the allow'd and eſtabliſh'd Practice of his Church. So that to be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in this particular, is nothing more, than to think the <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> to be as ornamental in a <hi>Cbriſtian Houſe,</hi> as others of <hi>Relations, Benefactors,</hi> or <hi>Emperours,</hi> &amp;c. And not to joyn hands with him, who broke in pieces the Image of Chriſt upon the Croſs, while he left thoſe of the <hi>Two Thieves,</hi> ſtand untoucht. 'Tis to look upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> or <hi>Crucifix</hi> as proper in a <hi>Church,</hi> to ſhew that that Place and Congregation belongs to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as the <hi>Lion</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> or <hi>Kings Arms,</hi> to Intimate that they own the King, as Supreme Governour. 'Tis to eſteem the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> as fit to have place there, for preaching the Goſpel there deliver'd, and ratifying it with their Bloud; as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for publiſhing the Commandments; or as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for eſtabliſhing the Religion by her Statutes.</p>
               <p>As he is a <hi>Papiſt</hi> therefore he cannot have a good Opinion of thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who love all ſorts of <hi>Pictures,</hi> whether of <hi>Relations, Landskips, Monſters, Dogs</hi> or <hi>Devils;</hi> but can brook nothing of <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Mother:</hi> who with Satisfaction enough can Admit of <hi>Mahomet, Luther, Calvin,</hi> a ſuffering <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> or <hi>Sidney,</hi> The <hi>Saviour</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> any <hi>Prophane</hi> or <hi>Immodest</hi> Picture whatſoever; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn Stomach at the ſight of the Worlds Redeemer upon the Croſs, at any Paſſage of <hi>Chriſts Paſſion,</hi> or ſacred <hi>Myſtery</hi> of our Religion repreſented in Colours. No better Chriſtians can he eſteem thoſe who cannot endure to be without their Signet, to ſhew their Family: who cannot ſee their <hi>Shops</hi> or <hi>Sign-Poſts</hi> without the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Company</hi> they are Free of: who muſt have their <hi>Scutcheon</hi> over their <hi>Hall</hi> doors, to publiſh the <hi>Corporation</hi> they belong to: and yet can allow of nothing to ſhew they are <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> who can ſee <hi>Croſſes</hi> on their <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Walls</hi> both private and public, on their <hi>Signs, Barges,</hi> their <hi>Ships,</hi> and <hi>Colours,</hi> as often as you will, to ſpeak them belonging to <hi>Citizens:</hi> but a <hi>Croſs</hi> to declare themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they repute as intollerable. Theſe he cannot much eſteem for their Chriſtianity as to this Point, ſince he ſees they are aſhamed of nothing, but what is to ſhew them to be <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as to what concerns the <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Veneration</hi> He ſhews to Sacred <hi>Images</hi> of Chriſt, his Mother, or Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he does nothing but what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon oblige him too: and to explicate what this is, he needs no more than declare, that as a Loyal Wife, who has a tender Love and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47310:5"/>
Reſpect for her Husband, cannot chuſe, from the preſſing Impulſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Nature, but have a Love and Reſpect for his Picture, and expreſſes that Love by kiſſing it, and hanging it at her Breaſt: in the ſame manner, He having a hearty Love and true Honour in his Soul for his Bleſſed Redeemer, Apoſtles and Martyrs of Chriſt, cannot hinder the irreſiſtable force of Nature, from having a Reſpect and Honour for their Pictures, and this ſame Reſpect he expreſſes by kiſſing them, placing them in his Oratory the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as Chriſtians Honour and Reſpect the <hi>Bible</hi> above all other Books; and tho it be made of nothing but Paper, Ink, Leather, Paſtboard, like all other Volumes; yet becauſe the Stroks of that Ink are ſo order'd and joyn'd in that Paper, that they <hi>Signifie</hi> and <hi>Repreſent</hi> to him the Doctrine and Paſſion of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this Reaſon they cannot chuſe but Love and Reſpect and Honour this Book; and if in reading and peruſing it, any more devout than the reſt, expreſs theſe Sentiments of their Souls by <hi>kiſſing it,</hi> never taking it into their Hands, but with an awful Reverence, with their Heads uncove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and on their bended knees: they do nothing but to the Honour, and Glory of God, and what may, without Superſtition, or Suſpicion of giving I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Worſhip to the Paper or Ink of that Book, be paid to that Sacred Volume, and what has been the Practice of many holy Chriſtians and Saints. Upon the ſame Account, and for the ſame Reaſon, tho the <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> are nothing but Ink and Paper, like others; yet becauſe the Stroks of that Ink are ſo ordered and drawn there, that they <hi>Signifie</hi> and <hi>Repreſent</hi> to him <hi>Chriſts Nativity,</hi> his <hi>Scourging at the Pillar,</hi> or <hi>Paſſion on the Croſs &amp;c.</hi> they are to him like a Chapter of the Bible it ſelf, informing him of the ſame Sacred Myſtery, teaching him the ſame Divine Truth, and upon this Conſideration, are to him a part of Gods holy Word, without any difference from that Chapter of the Bible, which treats of that Myſtery, beſides in the different Faſhion of the Stroks and manner of laying on the Ink. And if in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Conſideration of theſe Divine Truths and Sacred Myſteries thus Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, he ſtands with his <hi>Head uncover'd,</hi> or <hi>on his knees,</hi> he do's it only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> which at that time enflame his heart towards God, and the <hi>Veneration</hi> which he has for Chriſt in thoſe endearing Paſſages: And in theſe Actions and Poſtures he do's no more make a God of, or give Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip to the <hi>Paper, Ink,</hi> or <hi>Colours</hi> of thoſe Pictures, or the <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Images;</hi> than he makes a God of the <hi>Bible,</hi> when in taking an Oath, he ſtands with his Head uncover'd and kiſſes it, or reads it on his <hi>knees;</hi> or gives Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip to a <hi>Preacher,</hi> when he hears him deliver Gods <hi>Word</hi> with his <hi>Headbare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Divines therefore wrangle to the Worlds end, and diſpute, whether this <hi>Honour,</hi> this <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> ſhewn to the <hi>Bible,</hi> to a Preachers <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to <hi>Pictures</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> be the <hi>ſame,</hi> or <hi>diſtinct</hi> from what is given to the <hi>Things Repreſented;</hi> whether it terminates on them <hi>abſolutely</hi> after an Inferiour manner, or only <hi>relatively,</hi> and ſo forth. This they may go on with for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Wits and Tongues; and others may ſcatter theſe Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Crowd for the Confuſion of Mankind, and the Diſturbance of weak Brains: but for his part, he's little concern'd with theſe Debates. He's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he believes in, Worſhips and Adores only One God, who Created and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him, and by whoſe Mercy and Grace he expects Salvation: and he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47310:5"/>
confeſſes, that all <hi>Pictures, Images,</hi> &amp;c. relating to Him or his Saints, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than <hi>Paper, Colours, Wood, Stone. &amp;c.</hi> meer Creatures not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in. Yet as long as he ſees, that Chriſtians full of Devotion and Zeal can <hi>kneel down</hi> before a piece of Bread, for its being a <hi>Figure</hi> or a <hi>Repreſentative Commemoration</hi> of Chriſt, his Goodneſs and Paſſion; and yet to the Honour, and Glory of God. As long as he ſees Men full of Scorn and Rage can ſhew their Malice to a great Prelate, by expoſing his <hi>Effigies</hi> to the contemptuous Shouts of the Rabble, carrying it in a mock-Proceſſion, and committing it to the flames; and this without having it decided, whether it be the <hi>ſame Diſhonour</hi> ſhewn to the <hi>Image</hi> and to the <hi>Perſon:</hi> and whether it be the <hi>ſame Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> given to the Sacramental <hi>Figure</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or a <hi>different:</hi> As long as he ſees this, he cannot doubt to Honour and Reverence Chriſt before an <hi>Image</hi> relating to him; notwithſtanding the <hi>Speculative Scruple,</hi> whether it be the ſame, or a diſtinct Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration given to God and to the Image.</p>
               <p>'Tis a ſufficient ſatisfaction to him, that all the <hi>Love, Reſpect, Honour</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> he has for the <hi>Bible,</hi> for a <hi>Sermon,</hi> for a <hi>Picture</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is wholly for the <hi>Sake,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> he bears to Chriſt; and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he expreſſes it, whether by <hi>kiſſing</hi> theſe Commemorative Signs, by <hi>Bowing,</hi> by <hi>Kneeling,</hi> by <hi>Incenſing,</hi> &amp;c. yet as long as theſe are only ſo many different ways, or ſpeaking Teſtimonies of the affection of his Soul towards God (as God is his Witneſs who ſees his heart) he can have no ſcruple in performing them: no more than others, who being ſenſible of a diflerent motion in their Souls towards Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and her Siſter Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> expreſs the <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> they have for the latter, by placing her <hi>Picture</hi> in their <hi>Churches,</hi> by keeping her <hi>Day</hi> in a certain <hi>Veneration,</hi> by <hi>ringing of Bells, burning Candles, lighting Bonfires,</hi> all which are nothing but ſo much <hi>Street-incenſe</hi> offer'd up to her <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Memory.</hi> For what reaſon can he have, to think that to be idolatrous, when done to the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> which he ſees thus without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or fear of <hi>Idolatry</hi> perform'd to a <hi>Queen,</hi> no otherwiſe Canoniz'd, but by the <hi>Sainting</hi> breath of the Rabble?</p>
               <p>This then is what he do's as to Sacred Images, and tho his Adverſaries, by calling this <hi>worſhipping, adoring, falling down to</hi> Images, can preſently raiſe a Notion of Idolatry in their unthinking Auditory: yet 'tis upon ſuch Principles, that their Diſſenting Brethren purſuing the ſame Reaſonings a little farther, draw them under the ſame <hi>Infamy,</hi> throwing the Coat over their Heads, which they had cut out for others Shoulders.</p>
               <p>But now as for <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> 'tis what the utterly deteſts, as a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Reaſon and Religion. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> expreſly declares to all of his Communion, that <hi>no Vertue or Divinity is to be believ'd to be in Images, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be asked of them, nor confidence to be placed in them.</hi> What praying then can there be to Images, if nothing be to be ask'd of them? For his part, he could as well <hi>pray to</hi> the <hi>Monument,</hi> to the <hi>Statues</hi> of the Kings in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> or to the <hi>Giants</hi> in <hi>Guild-ball,</hi> as to the Image of the Greateſt Saint in Heaven; and thinks 'twould be as much to the purpoſe: and vet if the <hi>True-repreſenting Catechiſme</hi> is to be heard, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do not only kiſs the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> but they likewiſe <hi>Pray to them.</hi> God deliver him from <hi>ſuch true. Repreſenting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>The Papiſts Miſrepreſented</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(p.</hi> 17) is ſo juſt to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as to grant, that They do not <hi>abſolutely</hi> Pray to Images; this, in his opinion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47310:6"/>
being a charge too abſurd, to be urg'd againſt the moſt brutiſh of Heathens. And afterwards <hi>(p.</hi> 22.) when he comes to ſpeak of <hi>Praying to Images,</hi> he tells you of a <hi>Senſe</hi> in which <hi>it may be taken</hi> (that is, If the world be ſo pleas'd to take it ſo) and 'tis that <hi>Praying to Images</hi> ſhall ſignifie, not an oblation of Prayers to Chriſt's Image, ſo as to expect to be heard by the Image: but ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be rather heard by Chriſt himſelf, for praying to him by his Image. So that praying <hi>to Images,</hi> comes to be the ſame, as praying to Chriſt <hi>by his Image,</hi> and afterwards, within a line or two is nothing but praying <hi>where Images are,</hi> or <hi>before</hi> Images. Thus he do's not <hi>poſitively</hi> charge the Papiſts with <hi>praying to Images;</hi> but only endeavours to prove it in <hi>ſome ſenſe;</hi> and then honeſtly and fairly explicates what he means by thoſe words; and at laſt do's not impute it as a Doctrine, but only as a <hi>conſequence,</hi> that he thinks may be deduc'd from ſome Practice of theirs, as may be ſeen, <hi>(p.</hi> 22.) now mention'd.</p>
               <p>But now comes the <hi>Faithful-repreſenting</hi> Catechiſm, and without mincing it at all, he aſſures all ſuch as will be catechis'd, that the Papiſts <hi>Pray to Images,</hi> and this <hi>poſitively, abſolutely,</hi> without explaining any ſenſe, in which thoſe words are to be taken: not a Word for the preventing any Miſtake in his Readers: if they'l think the Papiſts ſo ſottiſh, as to Pray to Stocks and Stones, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect relief from thoſe Wooden Mediators, they may do it for all his true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting: Such Chriſtian Calumny he'l help to transfuſe into the Heads of the Ignorant: but not a Syllable to obviate the working of ſuch Poyſon.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, he tells his Reader, that the <hi>Honour</hi> given by Papiſts to Images, is referr'd to the Perſons Repreſented by them: but no mention of what is meant by <hi>Praying to Images:</hi> that he leaves to the diſcretion of every one, that can afford to lay out ſix-pence upon a Catechiſm againſt Popery. And now at laſt in his <hi>Vindication</hi> of this paſſage, he tells ye, he did not intend to inſinuate by thoſe Words, as if the Papiſts did <hi>Pray to Images abſolutely,</hi> ſo as to expect to be heard by the Images, but ſo as to expect to be heard by Chriſt, for praying to him by his Image, in the ſenſe 'twas taken above, in the <hi>Anſwer to the Papiſts Miſrepreſented,</hi> &amp;c. And here he confidently affirms, that from the two <hi>Anſwers</hi> in his Catechiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Queſt.</hi> 44. and 45. <hi>laid together, or either of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, it manifeſtly appears</hi> what he intended by that charge. But I muſt ask him; To whom do's this manifeſtly appear? Is he aſſur'd, that all the zealous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertiſts of <hi>Spittle-fields</hi> and <hi>Wapping</hi> will dive into this ſubtilty, and underſtand his meaning, tho there be not one word in either of the two <hi>Anſwers</hi> to explicate it? Do's he think thoſe Favourers of Popery, will lay things together, to take off from the blackneſs of the Charge, which is <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment? He that leaves the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> their <hi>Credit</hi> and their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Jury,</hi> muſt certainly be very willing to hear <hi>Oats</hi>'s Tune of eighty one plaid over again. No, when Doctors and Divines charge bluntly and downright, 'tis not to be expected from the Crowd to make a favourable Interpretation. But at laſt the <hi>Catechiſt</hi> in his Poſtſcript will prove, that the Papiſts do in ſome manner <hi>Pray to Images:</hi> His Argument is thus; <hi>Prayer is to the Object to which the Veneration is to be given; but the Veneration, is to be given to the Image, as repreſenting; and ſo is the Prayer.</hi> A piece of Sophiſtry, by which he may prove (for the next Edition of his Catechiſm) that the Papiſts <hi>Pray to the Bible,</hi> as well as <hi>to Images;</hi> they having a <hi>Veneration</hi> for both the one and the other. And if he can but once make out, that People <hi>Pray to</hi> every thing, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47310:6"/>
which they give a <hi>Veneration;</hi> will not this ſerve to prove, that every one, who going into <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> takes off his Hat, do's, by paying that <hi>Veneration,</hi> in ſome manner <hi>

But ſuppoſe he could in any ſenſe have prov'd <hi>Praying to Images</hi> againſt the Papiſts by ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argument than this, which is not fit to lie under a Univerſity-threſhold: yet would this be <hi>true Repreſenting</hi> to inſert this <hi>Conſequence</hi> of his into the Character of a Papiſt? It has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided long ago by his own Party, that he that puts the <hi>Interpretations</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of Mens Doctrines and Practices into their Character, is a <hi>Proper Miſrepreſenter:</hi> Do's not the <hi>Catechiſt</hi> then juſtly fall under this Infamy, who in giving an account of the Papiſts Doctrine and Practices, inſtead of ſuch a Doctrine or Practice, inſerts a <hi>Conſequence</hi> of his own into their Character? And yet this Catechiſm in the Title, is the <hi>truly repreſenting</hi> Catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Again, he ſays he has compos'd this Catechiſm out of the Papiſts <note place="margin">Pref.</note> own Writings, out of their own approv'd Authors and Councils; and by this his Reader is to underſtand, that every <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> he there imputes to the Papiſts, is what their own Authors and Councils expreſly own and profeſs: Now to make good this pretext, and juſtifie himſelf, he is oblig'd to point out to ſome of the Papiſts approv'd Authors and Councils, which do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and declare this Point of <hi>Praying to Images</hi> to be the receiv'd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice of their Church, if not abſolutly, at leaſt in that ſenſe in which he has explicated himſelf in his Vindication. For if he do's not do this, he has moſt unchriſtianly wrong'd the Papiſts, in imputing to them a Doctrine and Practice pretendedly according to their moſt receiv'd Authors, but no where found in ſuch Authors or Councils, being only a miſinterpretation of his own, paſs'd upon the World for a Popiſh Doctrine: and this will moſt unluckily draw him into the number of Miſrepreſenters.</p>

               <p>And is it not ſtrange now, that when ſuch things as theſe are charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Papiſts, and publiſh'd to the world for their Doctrine, it is taken ill of them, when they diſclaim all ſuch Tenets? 'tis call'd <note place="margin">Poſtſcr.</note> a <hi>Clamour</hi> and a Noiſe when they juſtifie themſelves in <hi>Proteſting</hi> againſt ſuch falſe Imputations: And if they ſay, they are <hi>fouly Miſrepreſented,</hi> this draws out a Vindication in a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> to ſink the dirt in deeper. For his part, 'tis no ſatisfaction to him, to be engag'd in Diſputes or Quarrels: But yet he confeſſes, he can no more forbear <hi>crying out,</hi> when he ſees Dirt unworthily thrown at his <hi>Religion,</hi> than if it were caſt in the Face of his Deareſt Relations, his Father or Mother: and therefore he muſt needs ſay, that if he finds any one dreſſing up a <hi>Papiſt</hi> to the Multitude as a <hi>Monſter,</hi> and ſhewing his Horns and cloven Foot to the Crowds, he cannot ſtand by in ſilence, but will cry out, <hi>A Cheat, A Cheat;</hi> with endeavours to find out, who the cloven Foot belongs to.</p>
               <p>But however, he could heartily wiſh, there were no occaſion for this: that there were more Charity in the World, and when Men ſpeak of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> that they would be truly ſerious; and not think it a leſs Crime to caſt an Aſperſion in this particular, than in other Concerns of their <hi>Good Name</hi> and <hi>Reputation;</hi> he that wrongfully defames him for a <hi>Thief,</hi> only injures his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and at moſt his <hi>Family:</hi> But he that caſts an Infamy upon his <hi>Religion,</hi> wrongs Millions; and abuſes the Multitude into a falſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that upon this ſcore, 'tis now more a Chriſtians Duty to <hi>hate,</hi> than to <hi>love</hi> one another. The <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Animoſities</hi> amongſt Chriſtians at this day are but a ſad Spectacle; And God knows how far the <hi>Paſſionate Exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerations,</hi> and <hi>Raſh Charges</hi> upon others <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> have been an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to theſe Evils. He heartily wiſhes there were ſome Moderation in this Particular: It being no Commendation to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtianity, that her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers like the <hi>Canibals</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> have no other way of Thriving, than by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring each other; nor a good Argument of the Truth of any Perſwaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can make the greater Devil of their Neighbour.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Catechiſt</hi> in his Poſtſcript will convince his Reader, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <hi>Pray to Images:</hi> For why (ſays he) do they direct their Prayers to them?

               <p>THe <hi>Papiſt Repreſented</hi> confeſſes and believes God to be the Fountain of all Goodneſs, to be the Centre of all Vertue, Power and Wiſdom; and that there is no Good whatſoever, whether Spiritual or Temporal, can arrive to him, but what is to come immediately from <hi>God the Father,</hi> through the Merits and Paſſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his only Son, Our Redeemer Bleſſed for ever more, in the Vertue of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the Comforter.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47310:8"/>
from God, the Author of all Good Gifts, and Father of Mercies. This Truth he owns and profeſſes, and believes himſelf bound rather to loſe his Life, then any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict or deny it: it being the very Doctrine deliver'd by St. <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle, <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17. that <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having thus acknowledg'd, that in <hi>God</hi> is infinitly treaſur'd up all that can be called <hi>Good,</hi> he likewiſe confeſſes, that Man can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe partaker of any of theſe Bleſſings, but according to the Pleaſure and Ordinance of this infinit Being, who eſſentially comprehends them all: ſo that no Creature whatſoever, whether in Earth or in Heaven, tho the greateſt Angel or Saint, has power of themſelves to beſtow any of theſe Gifts upon Man; they being wholy in the diſpoſure of Him who is their Author, and not to be communicated to any, but as He ſhall order and appoint.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Principal Means,</hi> by which theſe Heavenly Bleſſings are deriv'd to the World, is the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of Chriſt. And the <hi>Way</hi> ordain'd for Chriſtians to apply to themſelves the Bleſſings thus purchas'd by our Redeemer, is the <hi>Doing the Will of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> By theſe he has acceſs to that Heavenly Treaſure, and is made partaker of that rich ſtore, without which he can be nothing but eternally miſerable. Whenſoever therefore he deſires <hi>Increaſe of Grace, Forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> or any other Divine Benefit from the Hand of God, he endeavours to compoſe his Life and Actions according to the Preſcript of the Commandments and Will of Heaven, and raiſes his Heart and Soul by Prayer, to petition aſſiſtance, and a ſupply of his neceſſities from the Divine Throne. And becauſe he is taught from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that God <hi>hears the Prayer of the Righteous,</hi> he therefore deſires ſometimes the <hi>Juſt</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 29.</note> ſometimes thoſe in <hi>Heaven,</hi> to unite in Prayer, to be joynt-petitioners with him to the Seat of the Divine Majeſty, that ſo he may find more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the ſight of God, and obtain his deſires through the Merits and Paſſion of Him who died for all.</p>
               <p>But to think that he prays to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or from any material <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix</hi> expects relief either for Body or Soul, is only to render him more ſottiſh than the worſt of Heathens, and in one extravagancy to make him out-do all the Frenzies of <hi>Bedlam.</hi> He confeſſes it evident to the leaſt glimpſe of Reaſon, that a piece of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone</hi> faſhioned into a <hi>Croſs,</hi> is no more capable of <hi>hearing his prayers,</hi> or <hi>praying for him,</hi> or <hi>granting his Requeſts,</hi> than when it lay regardleſs upon the ground without either ſhape or figure: And that if his Religion did either teach or practice ſuch ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Zidonians</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> pray to <hi>Aſhtoroth,</hi> or <hi>Milcom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He does not deny, but in one of the Hymns us'd in his Church, are found theſe words: <hi>Hail, O Croſs, our only Hope! In this time of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, encreaſe Righteouſneſs in the Juſt, and blot out the Sins of the Guilty.</hi> And theſe ſame words, as likewiſe the whole Hymn are found in St. <hi>Ambroſe's</hi> Works, tho compos'd, by that Learned Biſhop <hi>Vincentius Fortunatus,</hi> who liv'd in the fifth Age, to be ſung on <hi>Paſſion Sunday,</hi> upon which day it is ſtill us'd by his Church, as part of that days Solemnity. And if for theſe words of this Prelate (whoſe Name is ſo often celebrated by Pious and Learned Men) and his whole Church, muſt be blackned with the Infamy of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>praying directly to the Croſs,</hi> then ſtand clear <hi>Paul,</hi> have a care <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> beware, O <hi>Creed;</hi> and you <hi>Common-prayer-Book</hi> look to your felf: for if there be but any that will weigh you in <hi>this Scale;</hi> if you have but a Grave Catechiſt, that according to this Rule, will <hi>Faithfully</hi> repreſent you; you'll be infallibly ſet out for nothing better, then <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Folly and Nonſence, Bundles of Abſurdities and Prophaneneſs,</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the diverſion of Drolling <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> than the Direction of any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Congregation. 'Tis but expoſing ſome <hi>ſentences</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi> found in them, in the <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> ſence of the words, to the Multitude, and they'll preſently loſe all their Authority of being <hi>Divine,</hi> and become as Ridiculous as <hi>Popery,</hi> which by theſe <hi>true-repreſenting Arts</hi> has been made ſo infamous by its Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>As now, if after the Method of this <hi>Faithful Catechiſm,</hi> the Queſtion ſhould be thus ask'd concerning St. <hi>Paul:</hi> Queſt. <hi>What regard had</hi> St. <hi>Paul for the material Croſs? A.</hi> He reverenc'd it above all things in Heaven and Earth: <hi>expreſly</hi> owning it, for the <hi>only</hi> Subject of his Glory: <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſays he, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.) <hi>that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jefus Chriſt.</hi> Again, He look'd upon the Wood of the Croſs, as that which had purchas'd Mans Reconciliation to God: as he directly confeſſes <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 16. where he ſays, Man was Reconcil'd <hi>unto God in one body by the Croſs.</hi> Would not the urging theſe expreſſions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>rigid</hi> ſence of the Words, as they ſignifie the material <hi>Wood</hi> of the Croſs, make him change his Colour in the Eyes of the Multitude, and render him more like an Infidel, than an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt; for thus placing his <hi>Glory</hi> and Mans <hi>Reconciliation</hi> in a piece of <hi>Wood?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if theſe ſame meaſures are applied to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and other <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> who flouriſh'd in the time of the Church's Purity, will not they all appear disfigur'd with the horror of Superſtition and Idolatry, and carry the moſt infamous Marks of <hi>Popery</hi> in the very face of them? St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> ſays expreſly, that the <hi>Croſs has broken the Gates of Hell, has open'd the Paſſage into Heaven, has made Paradiſe again acceſſible, and confounded the power of Satan:</hi> and a little before, that <hi>every thing that contributes to our Salvation, receives its perfection from the Croſs.</hi> St. <hi>Ephrem</hi> in almoſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47310:9"/>
the ſame words thus celebrates the <hi>Croſs. It has triumph'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>over death, 'tis the Hope of true Believers, the Light of the World, the Key of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, the Overthrow of Hereſies, the Help of Religious Men, the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Faith, a great and ſecure Protection, and the perpetual Glory of good Chriſtians for ever.</hi> Now let but theſe words of theſe Eminent and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians be thrown amongſt the Crowds, with an <hi>innuendo,</hi> as if ſpoken meerly of the <hi>material Croſs,</hi> and that they attributed ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies to a <hi>piece of Wood;</hi> what ſcandals would immediately follow? How many contempts and ſcornful reproches would theſe Great Fathers receive from the preſuming Multitude? And how many compaſſionate Moans would the more Pitying Sex ſigh out upon the darkneſs of that Age? This would certainly have follow'd, had it been the Fate of theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians to have faln into <hi>True-repreſenting Proteſtant</hi> hands; or were there any <hi>faithful Catechiſm</hi> to have made <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Faith and Practice.</p>
               <p>But certainly 'tis not only the part of a <hi>Faithful Catechiſm,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give a true account of mens <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> to lay down ſome <hi>words</hi> ſome <hi>expreſſions,</hi> taken out of their <hi>Hymns,</hi> their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> their <hi>Books,</hi> and then leave them to the diſcretion of every undiſcerning or prejudic'd Reader, to interpret as they pleaſe: and more eſpecially, it ought not to have pointed out to a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>miſtaken ſence,</hi> which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>literal,</hi> is yet contrary to the meaning of thoſe, whoſe Doctrine it pretends to deliver. No, this is not doing <hi>faithfully,</hi> 'tis not <hi>true-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting.</hi> If it would have made good its <hi>Title</hi> in the <hi>Frontiſpiece,</hi> it ſhould, beſides relating the bare <hi>words,</hi> have given a faithful account of the <hi>ſence,</hi> in which <hi>Catholicks</hi> underſtand thoſe words. And therefore, as to do right to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> &amp;c. beſides giving a bare Narrative of their <hi>expreſſions,</hi> it ought to be explicated to the people, that in all thoſe high Encomiums, of <hi>infinit and divine Perfections and Effects</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>Croſs;</hi> they do not underſtand the <hi>meer Material Croſs</hi> or <hi>piece of Wood;</hi> but <hi>the Belief in the Myſtery of the Croſs, the Paſſion of the Son of God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt Crucified:</hi> which are all ſignified and repreſented by the Croſs. So to <hi>repreſent truly</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> 'tis not ſufficient to ſet down the <hi>bare words</hi> of the <hi>Hymn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but likewiſe their <hi>meaning</hi> ought to have been propos'd; that with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> St. <hi>Ephrem,</hi> &amp;c. they do not underſtand barely the <hi>Material Croſs,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt crucified;</hi> and that in that Holy time of the <hi>Paſſion;</hi> in which that Hymn is ſung, their whole Devotion and Prayers are directed to Him, who being born for us Men, and our Salvation, <hi>made peace through</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the Blood of his Croſs.</hi> So that the meaning of Catholicks in ſaying that Hymn, is; <hi>Hail, O Chriſt, our only Hope! In this time of the Paſſion, increaſe Righteouſneſs in the Juſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This had been <hi>true-repreſenting</hi> indeed; but to pretend to faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47310:9"/>
and then to ſet down only <hi>Words,</hi> without their due <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Meaning,</hi> is to repreſent by halves; it has more of deceiving in it, then repreſenting; having little of truth in it, beſides in <hi>Brags</hi> and <hi>Pretences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This certainly is ſo inſincere a Method, that if allow'd, there needs no more to blaſt the Credit and Reputation even oſ Truth it ſelf: and 'tis very obſervable, that there is ſcarce an <hi>Argument</hi> taken up by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or any <hi>Means</hi> us'd by them, for the defeating of <hi>Popery,</hi> or making it Ridiculous to the Multitude, but the ſame, if follow'd on, will infallibly ruin all Religion, and turn Chriſtianity out of the World; <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> it ſelf is not proof againſt its own weapons; but that which brought it into the World, will be certainly its overthrow with as many, as have but ſence enough to put it to the Trial.</p>
               <p>There may be occaſion hereafter of evidencing this in many Particulars; at preſent 'twill be ſufficient to let the impartial Reader ſee, how far this one Argument taken up by the <hi>Faithful Catechiſt,</hi> to prove the Papiſts ſo ſtupid, as to <hi>pray directly to a piece of Wood,</hi> will contribute to the ruin of the Chriſtian Faith, and even of Proteſtancy it ſelf, if an Atheiſt or Heathen ſhould take it out of his hands, and uſe it to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Cauſe. The Argument is this; <hi>That it muſt be ſuppos'd ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prov'd againſt Catholicks, that they pray directly to the Material Croſs, becauſe there are ſome words in a Hymn of their Church, which if taken in their literal and rigid ſence, import a direct praying to it.</hi> Now let but ſome honeſt Heathen turn <hi>a True-repreſenting Catechiſm-maker,</hi> and following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly this Copy ſet before him, ſee whether in faithfully deſcribing the Doctrines and Practices of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> according to this Rule, he cannot do as much for them, that is, ſet them out as <hi>Abſurd</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous,</hi> as they have done for the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> And to follow the method exactly, he muſt go by <hi>Queſtions</hi> and <hi>Anſwers.</hi> We muſt ſuppoſe therefore, that the Title of his Book is thus; <hi>A Catechiſm truly repreſenting the Doctrines and Practices of Proteſtants, faithfully drawn out of their own Bible and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Liturgy:</hi> And that thus He begins:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A. <hi>In direful Imprecations, and fearful wiſhes imploring the worſt of evils againſt their Neighbour: as</hi> Pſal. <hi>109. 6. where they thus pray to God:</hi> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan ſtand at his right hand; when he ſhall be judg'd, let him be condemn'd, and let his prayer become ſin. Let his days be few; and let another take his office. Let his children he fatherleſs, and his wife a widow. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: Let them ſeek their bread alſo out of their deſolate places. Let the Extortioner catch all that he hath, and let the Strangers ſpoil his labour. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him, neither let there be any to favour his fatherleſs children <hi>&amp;c. can there be more terrible Wiſhes, more direful Imprecations than theſe?</hi>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> How by defaming one another?</p>
                  <p>A. <hi>By charging one another with the moſt infamous of Crimes in the heat of their Devotions: as in the recital of</hi> Pſ. <hi>50. where the</hi> Clerk <hi>thus begins,</hi> verſ. <hi>18. accuſing the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; When thou ſaweſt a thief, then thou conſentedſt with him, and haſt been partaker with Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>Then the</hi> Miniſter <hi>accuſes the</hi> Clerk; Thou giveſt thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. <hi>Then the</hi> Clerk <hi>falls upon the</hi> Miniſter <hi>again:</hi> Thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy Brother, and ſlandereſt thine own Mothers Son.</p>

                  <p>You are altogether in the right on't.

The cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of three or four words out of a <hi>Hymn,</hi> was Argument enough to lay the <hi>Papiſts</hi> flat for ſo many ſtupid Sots: and has any thing been here aſſerted againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but what has been ſupported by as plain and expreſs words, as thoſe of the Popiſh hymn?

                  <p>The Words, 'tis true, of the Scripture cited in this Mock-Catechiſm, are as plain and expreſs as can be: but they are here made uſe of in a ſence never intended by thoſe Divine Pen-men, the Authors of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, who tho they have the very words cited, yet never meant them, as here they are brought, in their <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> ſence; but ſome of them <hi>Figuratively,</hi> ſome of them in <hi>Conformity to our Apprehenſions,</hi> ſome of them in the <hi>Perſon of another,</hi> &amp;c. and begin thus underſtood, they make no reflection upon Proteſtancy or Chriſtanity, but are truly edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <p>This is honeſtly ſaid: and if you could but do ſo in any others caſe beſides your own; there would be more peace in this Nation, and above half the Devils, that diſturb its quiet, would be laid. Had the <hi>True-repreſenting Catechiſm,</hi> but thus impartially interpreted the words of the <hi>Hymn</hi> above mention'd, and given the true ſence of it, he had never been ſet upon the File of <hi>Miſrepreſenters.</hi> But to charge bluntly an abſurdity upon the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and to pretend to prove it againſt them from their own plain <hi>words,</hi> without diſcovering their <hi>meaning;</hi> is to do the ſame as our Heathen-Catechiſt has perform'd to the life, defaming Chriſtianity from the <hi>expreſs words</hi> of Scripture, and both alike by Miſrepreſenting.</p>
                  <p>Would you, and ſuch whoſe thriving depends much upon your Art, ſee to give every thing its true weight and ſence, and ſhew the right ſide outward of every thing you expoſe to the admiring Crowds; this ſincere and honeſt dealing would much more recommend you to well meaning people, than the more faſhionable way of blackning and ridiculing your Neighbours.

For this Sacrament which thou receiveſt, is made by the Words of Chriſt. And if the words of <hi>Elias</hi> were ſo powerful, as to draw fire from Heaven, ſhall not the words of Chriſt be powerful enough, to change the nature of things? Thou haſt read of the Creation of the World, that God ſpake, and the things were made; he commanded, and they receiv'd a Being. If therefore Chriſt by his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47310:13"/>
Word, was able to make ſomething of nothing; ſhall he not be thought able, to change one thing into another? For it is no leſs a work, to give a Nature <hi>or Being</hi> to things, than to change them from one Nature to another.—'Twas above the order of Nature for a Virgin to conceive; and this Body which we make in the Sacrament, is that which was born of the Virgin. Why do you require here the order of Nature in the Body of Chriſt, when as above all Nature, Chriſt was born of a Virgin?</q>

                  <p>This is thine own true ſelf, Miſrepreſenter: to prove a thing <hi>by halves,</hi> and call that <hi>conſuting of Popery,</hi> is your Maſter-piece. Why, theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> terming the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> a <hi>Figure, a Symbol, a Sign, an Image, a Remembrance,</hi> are ſo far from being contrary to <hi>our Belief,</hi> that they are as <hi>agreeable</hi> to it, as to the Articles of the very <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> it ſelf. For the Catholic Church teaches that the Body and Blood of Chriſt are in the Bleſſed Sacrament really and ſubſtantially, and ſo indeed not <hi>only</hi> as in a <hi>Sign, Symbol</hi> or <hi>Figure.</hi> But it do's not deny the Sacrament to be a <hi>Figure:</hi> for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is a <hi>Figure, or Repreſentation</hi> of the Death of Chriſt. It do's not deny it to be a <hi>Sign;</hi> for the outward and viſible species of Bread are a <hi>Sign</hi> of the Heavenly Bread that is within. It do's not deny it to be a <hi>Remembrance</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration;</hi> for whoſoever receives it, ſhews forth, according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Paſſion and Death of our Redeemer. It do's not deny it to operate by a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,-</hi>for it has Vertue and Power there to work in the Soul. What our Church denys and condemns, is, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt is there <hi>only</hi> as in a <hi>Sign,</hi> or in a <hi>Figure,</hi> or a <hi>Vertue,</hi> and not according to the <hi>Verity</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of it. You prove therefore nothing againſt us, in producing Teſtimonies of the Fathers owning the Sacrament to be a <hi>Figure,</hi> a <hi>Sign,</hi> &amp;c. For this is not to ſhew Them <hi>contrary</hi> to us, but <hi>poſitively agreeing</hi> with our Belief: eſpecially if taken together, with what you ſee cited out of them in our favour. If you will make good your Pretences, and not abuſe your Followers with half-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations; you ſhould ſee firſt to underſtand the Doctrine of your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before you undertake to confute it. Shew that the Fathers maintain the Sacrament to be <hi>only</hi> a Sign, <hi>only</hi> a Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you may do ſomething; but till then don't pretend They believ'd <hi>contrary</hi> to us.</p>

As for what ſome of the Fathers mention of the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of Bread <hi>remaining:</hi> any one that is vers'd in their Writings is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that by thoſe terms they often mean no more than the <hi>Natural qualities</hi> or <hi>viſible appearances</hi> of things; as you your ſelves can tell us upon occaſion, when it ſerves your turn to have it ſo: and in this ſence it do's not at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree with our Belief.

This is true even of the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf, which teaching Chriſt to be <hi>True Man,</hi> do's yet by the occaſional expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying that he <hi>appear'd in Habit as a Man,</hi> and in <hi>the Likeneſs of a Man;</hi> give occaſion to ſome to object, that he was no <hi>Real and Subſtantial Man,</hi> which ſtrikes at the very Fundamental Truth deliver'd in that Sacred Volume: and if this be true, even of the <hi>Word</hi> of God it ſelf; what wonder, to find it in the Works of the <hi>Fathers</hi> much more ample and voluminous?</p>

               <p>And that the People or Flock might have no ſcruple or ſolicitude upon them, for fear of being led into Error by theſe Apoſtles and Paſtors, but might ſecurely and without anxiety of Spirit reſt under their Guidance and Direction, Chriſt did moſt ſolemnly promiſe the ſaid Overſeers, the Apoſtles and Paſtors, the aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit: <hi>I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Mat.</hi> 28. 2c.) <hi>The Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you all things (Jo.</hi> 14. 26.) By which effectual Promiſe they were conſtituted Guides, were taught all Truth, and all thoſe ſecur'd from Error, who committed themſelves to their Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47310:16"/>
The Catholic Church being thus conſtituted, and ordian'd by Chriſt himſelf, and provided with <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Paſtors divinely aſſiſted</hi> for the inſtructing the Flock in the Myſteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith: with an obligation on all that heard them, to believe upon pain of damnation: <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damn'd (Mat.</hi> 16. 16.) it is certain that all ſuch as did <hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelves from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> either by <hi>contradicting or disbelieving their Doctrine,</hi> or being <hi>refractory to their Government,</hi> did in this moſt heinouſly offend the Divine Majeſty, and exclude themſelves from the hopes of Salvation; the former, by rejecting the <hi>true Faith, without which 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe Him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. the latter by <hi>diſobedience,</hi> reſiſting the Ordinance of God; <hi>They that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves damnation, Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>This was the Face and Conſtitution of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt in the time of the Apoſtles; Salvation being promis'd to thoſe that believ'd: <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and Damnation threatned to disbelievers; <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. So that 'twas no Uncharitable, but a moſt Evangelical Aſſertion in the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> to ſay; <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved. (Act.</hi> 2. 47.) And the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that there was no Salvation out of their Church, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a neceſſary Doctrine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> being thus by Chriſt himſelf founded, <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. conſiſting of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> to <hi>inſtruct,</hi> and of the <hi>Flock</hi> under an indiſpenſable obligation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and <hi>Submitting</hi> to their <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> it was ſo to continue to the end of the World: Chriſt's Spirit, being to abide <hi>with her for ever. (Jo.</hi> 14. 16.) The <hi>Promiſe</hi> of his aſſiſtance being not limited to the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the Apoſtles, but annex'd to their <hi>Function.</hi> As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he left <hi>Epheſus (Act.</hi> 20. 28.) appointed others to <hi>overſee</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> the <hi>Flock,</hi> with their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the <hi>holy Ghoſt:</hi> So he and the other Apoſtles, when they departed this Life, had others to ſucceed them, for the Direction and Government of the Faithful. And as thoſe who cut themſelves off from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Apoſtles, incurr'd the guilt of Damnation, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably, in ſo doing, <hi>erring in Faith,</hi> or <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> ſo likewiſe all thoſe, who ſeparated from the Communion of their <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors:</hi> it being at all times moſt certainly true, that there was no <hi>true Faith,</hi> nor <hi>true Charity</hi> in any, that ſeparated themſelves from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47310:17"/>
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, over which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Overſeers</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> for their time, and their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to be ſo after them to the end of the World. This, as to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is evident from the ſevere cenſure of <hi>Deceivers,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt all thoſe who endeavour'd to make <hi>Diviſions</hi> in their time <hi>(Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14.) where they are ſaid to work, <hi>by the ſleight of men and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. Such as diſſented from the Apoſtles, are condemn'd for <hi>erring concerning the Truth, and overthrowing the Faith.</hi> And <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 11. They are ſaid to be <hi>ſubverted and in ſin, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd of themſelves.</hi> And as to their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church</hi> in the time of her confeſs'd Purity, is a moſt convincing Argument; there being none that in the firſt three or four Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, ever ſeparated from <hi>them,</hi> either in point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or making <hi>Schiſms,</hi> tho under the moſt colourable pretext of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Errors, or rejecting Innovation, but were declar'd <hi>Innovators, as men to be avoided, as cut off from the Myſtical Body of Chriſt,</hi> by the Paſtors and Overſeers then in being. The Rule of St. <hi>John</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 6.) being always the ſtandard-Meaſure of the Church; <hi>He that knows God, heareth us; he that is not of God, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then 'tis evident that the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as alſo of their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> was the Depoſitory of the true Faith; and that to diſſent from her in Faith, was to fall into Error, to divide from God; <hi>He that hears you, hears me; and he that deſpiſes you, deſpiſes me, (Luke</hi> 10. 16.) <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen, and a Publican, (Matth.</hi> 18. 17.) and conſequently no Promiſes of Chriſt, nor Salvation to be expected by ſuch, who were not of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>This ſame <hi>One holy Catholic Church,</hi> he believes to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all Ages, it being at all times true, what has been always ſaid by the Faithful in the <hi>Creed, I believe the holy Ca-Cholic Church;</hi> and that 'tis to remain to the end of the World aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, and preſerv'd from teaching errors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe of Chriſt. <hi>(Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16.) So that as then, ſo now at this time there is a Church ſucceeding that of the Apoſtles, which teaches all Truth, and from which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47310:17"/>
none can <hi>ſeparate,</hi> without <hi>erring in Faith,</hi> or incurring the guilt of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> Sins altogether inconſiſtent with Salvation. And becauſe after moſt ſerious Conſiderations, and the weighing of all Reaſons, he believes this Church to be that, in whoſe Communion he is; he do's not queſtion, but what is truly affirm'd of the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>ſucceeding Ages,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>fell from it;</hi> is moſt true of the <hi>ſame Church</hi> now <hi>in being,</hi> of which he's a Member, and of all thoſe who <hi>ſeparate from it,</hi> upon what pretext ſoever. And however this may be painted out for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitablenſs,</hi> yet 'tis certainly the very Doctrine deliver'd by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> And when the worſt has been made of it, yet ſtill he do's not come ſhort of Dr. <hi>Tillotſons</hi> Charity, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, yet <hi>ſo much Charity he has (and he deſires always to have it) as to hope that a great many of other ſeparate Perſwaſions, who live piouſly, and have been almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably</hi>

               <p>THe Papiſt as <hi>Repreſented</hi> has ſo good <hi>Reaſons</hi> for every Point of his Faith and Religion, that whoſoever caſts them by as Weak and Ridiculous, muſt upon the ſame grounds turn Chriſtianity out of doors, and own it to be built on no better foundation, than the Ignorant Zeal and Confidence of its Aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47310:20"/>
The Motive of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> for his embracing the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for the Word of God, was the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> he expreſly declaring <hi>(cont. Ep. Fundam.) That he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, except the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholic Church mov'd him to it.</hi> From this ſame Authority it is he receives every Article of his Faith; and ſince in his very <hi>Creed,</hi> he is taught to <hi>believe the Holy Catholic Church,</hi> he thinks he has <hi>Reaſon enough</hi> to do it. And whoſoever taxes him of <hi>Weakneſs</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> for ſo doing, do's nothing leſs than call him a <hi>Fool</hi> for <hi>believing</hi> his <hi>Creed;</hi> and this is only one Remove from telling him, that if he'll be <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and have <hi>good Reaſons</hi> for what he do's, he muſt be <hi>no Chriſtian.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be ſo Wiſe, as to believe only <hi>Eleven</hi> Articles of their <hi>Creed:</hi> for his part he thinks it no reflection upon his Wiſdom to believe <hi>Twelve:</hi> he was taught ſo many, when he was a Child, and he do's not find he has outgrown any one of the number.</p>
               <p>This Catholic Church, which by the <hi>Creed</hi> every Chriſtian is bound to believe, <hi>is,</hi> as was explicated in our laſt, <hi>the Congregation of all true Believers under the Government and Direction of Paſtors and Teachers in an uninterrupted Succeſſion deſcending from the Apoſtles, who by Gods appointment, are ſet over the Flock, to feed and rule it; and whom the Flock is oblig'd to hear and obey, and whoſe Faith they are bound to follow in each reſpective Age.</hi> 'Tis thus deliver'd to him by St. <hi>Paul (Heb.</hi> 13. 7, 17.) <hi>Remember them which have the Rule over you, whoſe Faith follow. Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves.</hi> And this way of the Faithful receiving their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Chriſtian Belief, from the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them by the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the ſaid Church (which is the Method he obſerves, as to every Article of his Faith) has been always look'd on ſo <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that in the time of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> there was never any us'd but this: 'twas by this means the World firſt became <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47310:20"/>
by the very ſame Orthodox Chriſtianity has been always preſerv'd in its vigour and purity, notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions of Subtle, Malicious, or Self-intereſted Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>He that has but read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cannot but have obſerv'd, that the <hi>Method</hi> preſcrib'd by <hi>Cbriſt</hi> himſelf, for the <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Myſteries of his Holy Faith</hi> in the World, was by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and commiſſionating <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples,</hi> to inform all Mankind of his Doctrine and Religion; and the only <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Means for any at that time, to arrive to the <hi>certain Knowledge</hi> of the <hi>True Faith,</hi> was to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the Doctrine deliver'd by Thoſe that were thus ſent to Preach and Teach it.</p>
               <p>This is the way by which the Chriſtian Religion was firſt planted in the World: and by this it has been ever ſince maintain'd. The ſame <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Overſeers,</hi> that were to <hi>teach</hi> the Goſpel, having <hi>another part</hi> of their <hi>Charge,</hi> viz. <hi>To ſtand up in caſe of any Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Diviſions ariſing in Point of Faith, and by their Deciſion to put an end to the Controverſie;</hi> So to preſerve Unity amongſt the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and defeat all the attempts of Turbulent and Preſuming Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. This <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers directing and feeding,</hi> and the <hi>Obligation</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> to <hi>Submit</hi> and <hi>Obey,</hi> as neceſſary for continuing <hi>One Faith</hi> amongſt Believers, he has learnt to be <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> and of <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> from the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For he finds, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. that a <hi>Controverſie</hi> being ſtarted at <hi>Antioch,</hi> concerning the <hi>neceſſity of Circumciſion;</hi> 'twas not left to every <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Believer</hi> to think and decide the matter, as they judge fit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of their Knowledge and Parts: neither did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with other Overſeers of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to <hi>define</hi> any thing in this Particular. No; what was the <hi>Common</hi> Concern of <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> was not to be determin'd by the Rulers and Paſtors of any <hi>Particular Church:</hi> but as belonging to <hi>All,</hi> 'twas to be remitted to the Conſideration and Deciſion of Thoſe, who had <hi>All</hi> under their <hi>Charge,</hi> that is, the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> or <hi>Catholic</hi> Church. And thus did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> for going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Cauſe was committed to the Hearing and Sentence of All the Apoſtles and Elders aſſembled at <hi>Juruſalem.</hi> And as 'twas determin'd by Them thus in Body, 'twas receiv'd by the Faithful with conſolation; not only at <hi>Antioch;</hi> but in all <hi>other Places,</hi> whereſoever the Goſpel of Chriſt was preach'd by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, who <hi>as they went through the Cities deliver'd them the Decrees</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47310:21"/>
                  <hi>for to keep, that were ordain'd of the Apoſtles and Elders, who were at Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 16. 4.</p>
               <p>This was the Practice of the Apoſtles, as it ſtands recorded in Holy Writ, providentially there deſcrib'd, that their Succeſſors, the Rulers and Paſtors of the Church in future Ages, from this Authentic Preſident, might be provided of a <hi>Means</hi> whereby to maintain a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Faith</hi> amongſt <hi>all True Believers,</hi> however ſpread throughout the different and divided Nations of the Univerſe, and know how to give a check to all <hi>growing Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Hereſies.</hi> As therefore the Apoſtles put a ſtop to this Debate concerning the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> by determining in <hi>Council,</hi> in what manner the Faithful were to be <hi>taught,</hi> were to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>do</hi> in this Particular; and by this Determination preſerv'd <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Spirit in the Bond of Peace</hi> amongſt the Faithful, and prevented the many Diviſions, which otherwiſe might have torn the Flock aſunder, had they been every one leſt to their own thoughts, to judge of it as they pleas'd. In like manner did the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church ſucceeding them in their Charge, in the like Circumſtances: for when there appear'd any <hi>entring in among the Flock,</hi> (as was foretold by St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20. 29.) and like <hi>grievous Wolves not ſparing it, but ſpeaking Perverſe things to draw away Diſciples after them:</hi> The <hi>Overſeers,</hi> who were to feed the Church of God, and commanded by the ſame Apoſtle, to <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>take heed to all the Flock (ib.</hi> v. 28.) aſſembled in Council, and by their Determination declar'd to all under their Charge the <hi>Faith deliver'd,</hi> and directed them which way to <hi>believe,</hi> as to the Point in debate.</p>
               <p>This was the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> when as yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncorrupted.</hi> Thus did the Paſtors then in the <hi>Firſt</hi> General Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> decide the Controverſie rais'd by <hi>Arius:</hi> thus they did in the <hi>Second</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> in the <hi>Third</hi> at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> in the <hi>Foutth</hi> at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> The <hi>Faithful</hi> always receiving with great Veneration the <hi>Determination</hi> of their <hi>Paſtors</hi> thus <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled;</hi> and looking upon this <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to their Doctrine, as the moſt <hi>Reaſonable Means,</hi> whereby to ſecure themſelves from falling into Error. And this ſame Method, thus happily begun by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and continu'd on by the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> it is which he obſerves in every Article of his Faith; there being no one Point, amongſt all thoſe controverted amongſt Chriſtians, which he aſſents to, but as derermin'd by the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church</hi> aſſembled, who have the care of the Flock; and whom, by the

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47310:22"/>
that this one and the ſame Word <hi>Worſhip</hi> ſignifies very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conceptions, and almoſt as many ſorts of <hi>Reſpect, Honour and Veneration,</hi> as there are different <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Excellency</hi> in the World. There's an <hi>Honour</hi> due to <hi>Parents,</hi> and this is properly call'd in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>Colere Parentes,</hi> to worſhip or honour our Parents. There's an <hi>Honour</hi> due to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> which may be term'd a <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as by their Title they are ſtil'd <hi>Worſhipful.</hi> There's an <hi>Honour</hi> due to <hi>Kings,</hi> which in <hi>Scripture</hi> is expreſs'd by <hi>Adoring</hi> or <hi>Worſhiping;</hi> as in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 20. where 'tis ſaid; <hi>All the Congregation—bowed down their heads, and Worſhiped the Lord and the King.</hi> There's an <hi>Honour</hi> due to the <hi>Martyrs</hi> or Saints departed, which is likewiſe call'd a <hi>Worſhip;</hi> and <hi>therefore</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays expreſly <hi>(Contr. Fauſt. l.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 2.) <hi>We Worſhip the Martyrs, with that Worſhip of Love and Society, with which even in this life Holy Men of God are Worſhiped—But we Worſhip them</hi> (the Martyrs) <hi>ſo much the more devoutly, becauſe more ſecurely.</hi> There's <hi>again a certain Reverence</hi> and <hi>ſuitable Reſpect</hi> due to ſome Things, which have an eminent <hi>Relation</hi> to God and his Service (as the <hi>Anſwerer)</hi> here confeſſes, <hi>p.</hi> 5.) ſuch are the <hi>Bible,</hi> the Images of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this <hi>certain Reverence</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> is term'd likewiſe <hi>Worſhip,</hi> ſo 'tis properly ſaid, <hi>Colere Imaginem Chriſti, Colere Sancta Evangelia.</hi> There's an <hi>Honour,</hi> in ſine, due to <hi>God,</hi> which is call'd ſtill by ſome Word, <hi>Worſhip:</hi> in Greek <hi>Latria,</hi> as St. <hi>Auguſtine, ib.</hi> has it, which <hi>is a certain ſervice properly due to the Divinity,</hi> with which <hi>we neither Worſhip the</hi> Martyrs, <hi>nor teach them to be worſhiped, but God alone.</hi>

                  <p>Do you ſee, <hi>Miſrepreſenter,</hi> how many different Conceptions of the Mind, and Affections or Motions of the Heart, are expreſs'd by this <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Word, <hi>Worſhip?</hi> And all theſe the Papiſts give to theſe ſeveral Objects, due proportion being always obſerv'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>different Degree</hi> of <hi>Excellency.</hi> So that tho they are all call'd by the ſame Name of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> yet it ſignifies a different Affection of the Soul as due to each reſpective Object. Upon this hinge turns this Controverſie, and if you would be ſo ſincere, as to explicate this Truth, and not preſently make every thing <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> where you ſee a <hi>Worſhip</hi> paid, much of this Unchriſtian <hi>Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> which has diſturbed the World theſe hundred and fifty years, might be prevented for the future.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> was ſo honeſt, as to give this notice to his Readers. <hi>(Epil.</hi> p. 3. p. 353.) Where he ſays, that the words, <hi>Adoration, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47310:23"/>
                     <hi>Reſpect, Reverence, or howſoever you tranſlate the word</hi> Cultus, <hi>are or may be, in deſpite of our hearts, equivocal:</hi> and the <hi>cauſe of this equivocation is the want of Words, properly to ſignifie Conceptions, which came not from common uſe.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> declar'd this Truth long ago <hi>(l.</hi> 10. <hi>de Civit. Dei, c.</hi> 1.) where he ſhews all theſe Words, <hi>Servitus, Cultus, Religio, Pietas. Service, Worſhip, Religion, Piety</hi> to be <hi>Equivocal,</hi> and may be applied both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Creatures.</hi> And thus <hi>Catholics</hi> many times uſe them, without the leaſt entrenching upon the Divine Prerogative, or ſcandal to their Neighbour, which had never been heightned to that degree as is at this day; had not ſome, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did to our B. <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſtood by, and taken as much pains to <hi>wreſt</hi> every thing into a <hi>Wrong</hi> Senſe, as <hi>Charity</hi> obliges to interpret in a <hi>Right</hi> one.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Worſhip</hi> is underſtood in all this latitude, 'tis hard to make it out, that Men are to <hi>pray</hi> to every thing they <hi>Worſhip:</hi> or that <hi>Prayer</hi> is neceſſarily <hi>depending</hi> on it. But then again, if the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> by his <hi>Praying to,</hi> means no more, than Praying <hi>at</hi> or <hi>before Images,</hi> I have nothing to ſay to it. I only complain'd of it, becauſe by his Expreſſion, as it ſtands there, he ſeems willing to have his Reader underſtand it, that the Papiſts ſo <hi>pray</hi> to Images, as if they expected to be heard by them, or that They ſhould obtain or grant their Requeſt, which is a moſt foul Miſrepreſentation. But as for Praying <hi>before</hi> them, 'tis what we own and Practice. And ſince <hi>to, at</hi> and <hi>before</hi> come to be all one with him; let the Words of Abjuration quoted by <hi>Spelman,</hi> be thus Underſtood; as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> makes <hi>Bowing to</hi> the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>at it, (Idol. of Ch.

'Tis a very hard Caſe, that we ſhould be ſcoff'd at and publickly condemn'd as Abetters of what was <hi>formerly practis'd;</hi> and reprov'd again, for being ſuppos'd to <hi>Reform</hi> it.

Why, it muſt be given out, that the <hi>Papiſts are charg'd; that they are weary of their Religion as practis'd heretofore; that their Way of delivering it, is now leſs Offenſive than in former ages.</hi> And under this Cover the Credit of all ſuch who have painted the Papiſts out otherwiſe than They now appear, is to be ſav'd, and they clear'd from the moſt foul Imputation of <hi>Miſrepreſenting.</hi>

'tis evident to any, that has taken a conſiderate view of the Chriſtian World, in thoſe Countries, where the Scripture is thus permitted, there's as much <hi>Vice,</hi> as much <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> as much <hi>Ignorance,</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> as in any place whatſoever: So that tho they have a <hi>Light</hi> about them, they are either not taught how to <hi>uſe</hi> it; or elſe approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with <hi>too much Confidence</hi> and <hi>Preſumption,</hi> come too near it and put out their eyes.</p>

Or are they any ways injur'd, becauſe they have learneder men than themſelves to teach them? Is the <hi>Multitude</hi> a better <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and more able to diſcover the truth of it, than thoſe, whom God has plac'd over them? Has God ſo deſerted the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> and is the <hi>Flock</hi> of late become ſo <hi>Wiſe?</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt was firſt planted by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Preaching</hi> it to the <hi>Multitude;</hi> by the ſame way 'twas propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apoſtles, and ſo it is to be deliver'd down to the end of the World; <hi>Faith comes by hearing.</hi> By this means many Barbarous Nations, ſaies St. <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 3. <hi>adv. har.</hi> c. 3. <hi>believe in Chriſt, have the Doctrine of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation written in their Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt without the help of Books, and religiouſly obſerve the Traditions, believing in one God,</hi> &amp;c. Now 'tis certain the Truth of this Chriſtian Faith, with all its Myſteries, is unqueſtionably preſerv'd in Chriſts <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and the People are to <hi>receive</hi> it; and not to <hi>find out</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> every one for themſelves.

               <p>The <hi>Papiſt</hi> therefore is taught, that ſince Chriſt has a <hi>Church</hi> upon earth, in which is conſerv'd the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> 'tis ſafer and more pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial for the People to be inſtructed in <hi>this Truth,</hi> from the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of this

               <p>YOu broke off my laſt Diſcourſe, with your Dream of <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Crabs.</hi> But I'll take it up now: and therefore I muſt tell you, I cannot but admire your Procedings in leaving the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> to the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> to be ſcann'd and Interpreted by them at pleaſure. 'Tis evident they being of <hi>Different Capacities</hi> and Inclinations, they can never ſo agree in their Interpretations, as to meet in <hi>One Faith,</hi> to be of <hi>One Mind,</hi> and <hi>One Spirit,</hi> as is commanded by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.) This is too clearly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in the Diſtractions of this our Nation: where ſo many ſetting up for Interpreters of Scripture, there are <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Sects, Diviſions, Perſwaſions, Faiths</hi> and <hi>Creeds</hi> multiplyed without number, to the ſcandal of the Chriſtian Name, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-one pretending to the <hi>Truth,</hi> while yet theſe being ſo <hi>numerous</hi> the <hi>true Faith</hi> is but <hi>One: One God and one Faith</hi> (Eph. 4. 5.) And the Reaſon of theſe <hi>diviſions</hi> is obvious. For tho' the Bible is but <hi>one</hi> in all their Hands; yet this Sacred Book doe's not <hi>inſtruct</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> them, but by <hi>certain means</hi> to be us'd on their part. And theſe <hi>Means</hi> being (according to D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Whitaker)</hi> The <hi>reading it, their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Places, their weighing of the circumſtances of the Text, their skill in the Tongues, their Diligence and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> How is it poſſible they ſhould all <hi>agree</hi> in their Expoſitions of H.

Can all <hi>compare Texts</hi> alike? Can they all <hi>weigh Circumſtances</hi> alike? Are they all skill'd in <hi>Languages</hi> alike? How then ſhall they be <hi>inſtructed</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> alike, when their Inſtruction and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi> depends upon theſe <hi>Means?</hi> And while they thus rely on their own endeavours, their own ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interpreting the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as the <hi>Means</hi> whereby to arrive to the <hi>True Faith;</hi> is it not a miſerable thing to conſider, that theſe <hi>Divided</hi> Chriſtians, having rejected the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> do now every one rely on ſo unſafe <hi>Means</hi> for their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> that no man dares truſt to but themſelves, that is, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Private Perſon</hi> on his own <hi>Private Search</hi> and <hi>Interpretation</hi> of H.

               <p>I confeſs ſome of them, to keep up the Face of a <hi>Church,</hi> do <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively</hi> contend for <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Guides;</hi> but then in <hi>Fact</hi> they again defeat all theſe their Pretenſions, whilſt they own no <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to be ſo <hi>Great</hi> or <hi>Safe</hi> with them, but 'tis to be ſubjected to the control of every <hi>Private Examiner;</hi> and ſo to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, or not follow'd, as every man in his own <hi>Private Capacity</hi> ſhall think fit: So that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltimate Appeal</hi> with them, is not to <hi>Authority,</hi> but to the <hi>Private Spirit.</hi> They maintain the <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> as being to decide <hi>Controverſies of Faith (Art.</hi> 20.) and this is not to ordain or enforce any thing to be believ'd, that is againſt the Scripture. But whether that which it decides, be <hi>againſt</hi> or <hi>according</hi> to Scripture; this every man is to decide again by his <hi>own private Reaſon.</hi> They maintain the Authority of <hi>General Councils.</hi> But becauſe theſe <hi>may err;</hi> (Art. 21.) their <hi>Decrees</hi> have <hi>neither Strength nor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unleſs it may be declar'd, that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>de facto</hi> they be taken out of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> or no; this every <hi>Private Man</hi> muſt judge for himſelf. And this Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> aſſerts poſitively in his <hi>Exam. of Meth. p.</hi> 82. <hi>The Principle of Proteſtants, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the majority, even in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, is, That when any Doctrines are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd or condemn'd upon the Authorities of the Scriptures, thoſe who differ from them, and do think that the Council miſunderſtood the Scriptures, are bound to ſuſpect themſelves a little, and to review the matter with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er application—Yet if they are requir'd to profeſs that they believe opinions which they think falſe, if they were never ſo inconſiderable, no man ought to go againſt his Conſcience.—And if any Synod of Protestants has decreed any thing contrary to this, in ſo far they have departed from the Proteſtant Principles.</hi> But the whole matter is more fully expreſs'd by the Author of the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Concerning a Judge of Controverſy:</hi> Who (p. 11. at the bottom,) clears it thus: <hi>If you ask, whoſe Judgment ought to take place, the Judgment of the Church, or of every private Chriſtian? I anſwer</hi> (ſays he, and mark it) <hi>The Judgment of the Church of neceſſity muſt take place as to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Government, to determine what ſhall be profeſs'd and practis'd in her Communion; and no private Chriſtian has any thing to do in theſe matters. But when the Queſtion is, What is Right or Wrong, True or Falſe, in what we may obey, and in what not? Here every Private Chriſtian, who will not believe without underſtanding, nor follow his Guides</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:47310:34"/>
                  <hi>blindfold, muſt judge for himſelf, and 'tis as much as his Soul is worth to judge right.</hi> Don't you ſee here, there's no <hi>Authority</hi> ſo <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Safe</hi> amongſt them, but what is to be ſubject to the Cenſure of every <hi>Private</hi> Chriſtian? And tho' there be the Name of ſuch a thing as a <hi>Church,</hi> yet let that Command, preſcribe and ordain what it will, to be receiv'd as the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt, 'tis not That is to be obey'd or believ'd: but being eſteem'd as a piece of Formality not to be relied on; every Man when he thinks fit, muſt ſet himſelf up above <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and ee'n judge for himſelf. Is not here every Controverſy left to the deciſion of the <hi>Private Spirit?</hi> And under the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Church,</hi> a gate open'd to all the <hi>Fanaticiſms</hi> and <hi>Quakeriſms</hi> in the World? By the <hi>Creed</hi> all Chriſtians are bound to <hi>Believe the Holy Catholic Church:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul (Heb.</hi> 13. v. 7.) commands all to <hi>Obey</hi> and <hi>Submit</hi> to thoſe that are over them, and this not only as to <hi>External Government;</hi> but likewiſe as to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Belief;</hi> and therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſays he; v. 7. <hi>Whoſe Faith follow.</hi> But here you ſee, tho' your Divines maintain the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Church;</hi> yet there's no Obligation on any Members of ſubmitting to it, as to any Point of <hi>Faith:</hi> They muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it indeed as to the <hi>Governing</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic</hi> part: But as to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> part; here every Chriſtian, as to what he is to obey, and what not, is to <hi>judge for himſelf.</hi> And pray now, what do's all this end in, but the <hi>Private Spirit?</hi> Can it deſire any fairer Plea than this? Certainly this their Church, were it the Catholic Church, the <hi>Ground and Pillar of Truth;</hi> 'twould not thus be commendably left to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rul'd by every <hi>Private</hi> Man's <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> There would not be this liberty for every one to run aſtray from it, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their own Judgment, before the Deciſion and Judgment of the <hi>Church.</hi> 'Twas ſaid heretofore, and we know by whom, <hi>Let him that do's not hear the Church, he as a Heathen and a Publican.</hi> But now it ſeems<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Man alone is as <hi>Blind</hi> as a <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Publican,</hi> who do's not rather <hi>hear himſelf,</hi> than the <hi>Church.</hi> I wonder, how long this has been ſo?</p>

               <p>A ſhort memory makes you Unreaſonable.

               <p>You know 'tis the very <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to <hi>Proteſt</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> But <hi>ſuch Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> there were in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, as <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and other <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> declare, and you your ſelves own.

               <p>'Tis to that Tune; and I think, convincing enough to any ſerious Conſiderer, that is acquainted with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Proteſtantiſm.</hi> Come, I dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to your judgment, tho' ſo perverſly byaſs'd: for the Caſe is clear. Don't you obſerve, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that have been in the world ever ſince <hi>Luther</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformation, have not only Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd and Condemn'd what they call <hi>Romiſh Errors,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe condemn the <hi>ſame</hi> practis'd (as they own) heretofore in the time of <hi>Conſtantine?</hi> And here I ask of you. Don't you think, if <hi>Luther</hi> and his <hi>Fellow-Reformers</hi> had hapned in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, they would as certainly have <hi>Reform'd</hi> the Chriſtian Religion of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Their <hi>loud Proteſting</hi> againſt and condemning the <hi>Pretended Errors</hi> of both the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Others</hi> Religion, is a ſufficient intimation, what they would have done, had the <hi>Sins</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ſo early provok'd the <hi>Divine Vergeance,</hi> and brought them before into the World. Since therefore 'tis evident, it cannot be made appear. That the Chriſtians in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s time, did <hi>Proteſt</hi> againſt any ſuch
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47310:38"/>
                  <hi>pretended Errors,</hi> as the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have done ever ſince <hi>Luther;</hi> 'tis evident there were no ſuch <hi>Christians</hi> in thoſe times, as <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And however Dr. <hi>Swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> confidently derives the Succeſſion of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> not from the <hi>Waldenſes, Wicklifiſts</hi> and <hi>Huſſits;</hi> but from <hi>Constantine, Euſebius,</hi> &amp;c. You have now ſeen the <hi>One</hi> Practiſing, the <hi>Other</hi> relating ſuch Doctrines, (as are by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> now marked out for <hi>Superſtitious)</hi> without the leſt guilt of Conſcience, or making any the leaſt <hi>Proteſtation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and what kind of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> theſe muſt have been, who were thus deep in <hi>Popery,</hi> I leave you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. Only one thing ſtill Ile propoſe to you: We have made hitherto ſome enquiry into the <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> of thoſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times,</hi> and look'd back upon thoſe Chriſtians. Now ſuppoſe it had been your Fate, to have been in thoſe times, juſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> as you are at this day: Had you gone into their <hi>Churches</hi> and ſeen there the <hi>lighted Candles,</hi> the <hi>appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deity with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbloody Sacrifices, and Myſtic Conſecrations. Had you ſeen the Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tranſlation of Holy Relicks;</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>proſtrate at the Sepulcher of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and imploring their Interceſſion; had you ſeen him ſigning his Forehead with the Croſs; and with great veneration repoſiting part of the Holy Croſs for the ſecurity of the City. Had you ſeen him Faſting, and chaſtiſing his Body; honouring Monks, and Virgins by Vow conſecrated to God: Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Primacy to the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and Subjecting all Chriſtian Churches to him. Had you ſeen the Body of the Deceas'd Emperor in the Church upon a ſtately Throne, with the Prieſts and numerous Crouds, in Tears and Sighs praying for his Soul:</hi> Had you ſeen, I ſay, in thoſe days, the Chriſtians ſerving God, and publickly exerciſing their Religion in this manner, would you have thought them <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> Would this have agreed with the Notion of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm,</hi> you have now in your Head? Or, tell me ſeriouſly, ſhould you not have run out of their Churches, and heartily <hi>Proteſted</hi> againſt them as <hi>Rank Papiſts?</hi> And yet theſe are the Chriſtians your Divines appeal to, as the <hi>Antient Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> 'Tis according to theſe times, they ſay, they have <hi>Reform'd</hi> Chriſtianity: And that the Religion as now eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>this Nation,</hi> is the ſame, as was then <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently</hi> and <hi>Generally</hi> profeſs'd and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in thoſe <hi>Primitive Times.</hi>

               <p>No, No, as for your particular I e'en deſpair. 'Tis Good, Well-meaning People, ſuch as have made it the Firſt of their Morning Prayers to God, <hi>to Direct them to the Truth,</hi> ſuch as have dealt juſtly and honeſtly with their Neighbours, have ſpoke ill of none, have rais'd no Lying Reports, nor have been maliciouſly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in ſpreading them; ſuch as theſe I willingly Diſcourſe, and have hopes to prevail with. But for you, that talk loud of Reaſon, and have none: You that fleer, and flurt, and blaſpheme every thing you do not underſtand; You that ſuck in Hatred againſt your Neighbour with your Milk, and afterwards nouriſh it by <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>Paſſion;</hi> and continue to malign him, you know not why. You that condemn your Neighbor upon a bare Preſumption; and paſs Sentence againſt him upon <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Hear-ſays,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all your Acquaintance to do the like; for you, I ſay, nothing leſs than a Miracle can change your Heart; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome favourable Ray of Mercy ſhine upon you to cure this Blindneſs, as you have liv'd, ſo, I fear, you'l die in Darkneſs.</p>

with <hi>Popery,</hi> by the <hi>Centuriators,</hi> by <hi>Oſian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Chemnitius, Melancthon, Bullinger, Beza, Whitaker, Humfrey, Covel, Whitgift, Abbot, Morton, Fulk, Trig, Cartwright, Field, Hooker,</hi> &amp;c. Now I need not ask here, being upon Enquiry into the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> whether Thoſe <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> cannot in all likelihood better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, what was the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of their Times, than other <hi>Modern Teachers,</hi> who had not a Being in the World, till Twelve or Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Hundred Years after? But I may conſider with my ſelf, whether it be not moſt agreeable to Reaſon to think, ſince ſuch <hi>Eminent</hi> and <hi>Vertuous</hi> Men and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, as juſt now recited, are accus'd of <hi>Popery,</hi> that not only ſome <hi>Private Perſons</hi> in thoſe <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> but that the <hi>Whole Church</hi> was then <hi>Popiſh?</hi> I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by all Antiquity, that theſe Perſons, that ſtand thus Indicted, <hi>Govern'd</hi> the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> were <hi>Biſhops, Paſtors,</hi> and the moſt <hi>Exemplary</hi> of their Age; the <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Flock</hi> were Inſtructed and Taught by them; So that ſuch Doctrines as they then Publiſh'd in their Writings, and Preach'd to the People, without Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Reproof, I cannot look on as a <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>Cloſet-Concern;</hi> but as the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> and <hi>Receiv'd</hi> Doctrine of their Times: and that in the Sermons and Works of the <hi>Paſtors</hi> is ſeen the <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Flock.</hi> And this will oblige me to conclude, that Such Doctrines and Practices of which theſe <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> ſtand charg'd by <hi>Moderns,</hi> was not the Doctrine of <hi>Private Men,</hi> but of the <hi>Whole Church</hi> of their Times: It being not at all probable to think, while the <hi>Paſtors</hi> are thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally condemn'd for <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I demand of you, Whether the Writings and Books of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prelates, Doctors</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd under <hi>Edward</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> be not an Argument, that beſides ſhewing their <hi>Private Sentiments,</hi> will prove likewiſe the Doctrine and Belief of <hi>Their Church?</hi> and that whoſoever quarrels with them for their <hi>Proteſtant Negatives,</hi> and <hi>Diſſenting</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do's not in the ſame Breath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their <hi>Whole Church,</hi> of which they were <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Overſeers?</hi> If ſo, have not I equal Grounds to believe, that the Concurring Sentiments of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> was the Senſe of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> and that the accuſing them of <hi>Popiſh Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their <hi>Whole Church,</hi> over which God had plac'd them <hi>Prelates, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers?</hi> So that by all my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can diſcover yet, if I am to be of the Religion of the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> I am to be no <hi>Protestant;</hi> but continue as I am, a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> and if I were not ſo, this your Appealing to the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and our Search into it, would e'en oblige me to renounce <hi>Your Communion,</hi> who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only make a Noiſe of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and are nothing like it: but are as much for <hi>Reforming</hi> that, as you did the Church of <hi>Henry</hi> 8.</p>

               <p>I Hope you are by this time ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd, <hi>Miſrepreſenter,</hi> that the Profeſſors of ſuch <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> as you call <hi>Popiſh,</hi> were every where to be found in the Time of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> when you ſay the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> was Generally Profeſs'd amongſt Chriſtians.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I very freely acknowledge, That in the Time of the</hi> Primitive Church, <hi>and of the</hi> Firſt Four General Councils, <hi>there were very many</hi> Eminent Men, <hi>thro'</hi> Infirmity <hi>or</hi> Blindneſs <hi>Embracing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing</hi> Popiſh Doctrines. <hi>This I will not be ſo obſtinate as to deny; becauſe I find moſt of the</hi> Ancient Fathers <hi>of the Church brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Mark of</hi> Popiſh Errors, <hi>by Our own</hi> Century-Writers, <hi>and other</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Divines.</hi> Hierome, Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Athanaſius, Gregory, Chryſoſtome, <hi>and the reſt of them, do not eſcape this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; They all had their Failings in this Point, They c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But ſtill the Church was</hi> Proteſtant; <hi>and the</hi> Four Firſt General Councils, <hi>as I told you before, were all</hi> Proteſtants. <hi>You may claim ſome</hi> Particular Doctors <hi>of thoſe Times, if you will, and welcom; but for the</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Councils, <hi>theſe were certainly Ours; and their Religion was the ſame True,</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>as is here by Law Eſtabliſh'd.</hi>

               <p>Well, I don't know how far <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>Education,</hi> may work in this Point: But I cannot bring my <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>What you ſay,</hi> to meet, for my Life: and yet I have been trying, and turning and ſtretching it every way, ſince our laſt Meeting, and 'twon't do at laſt. For look you now; You ſay Thoſe <hi>Firſt General Councils</hi> were <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> This preſently raiſes a Notion in my Head, That all thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> there aſſembled, were like our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi> and I preſently reſemble them to our <hi>Convocations</hi> or <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Here I begin to Imagine, what ſo many <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Ours</hi> would have done in thoſe Times, had they been then in Body. I conſider, that the <hi>Times</hi> were then very <hi>Dangerous; Popery,</hi> as you confeſs, began to ſpread, many <hi>Eminent Men</hi> were infected with its Errors: Then think I, Certainly, if
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47310:42"/>
the <hi>Fathers</hi> in <hi>thoſe Councils</hi> had been <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> there could not have been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome <hi>Zealous Doctor,</hi> who would have animated the <hi>Fathers</hi> to the utter <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

You all know what Religion I mean; it is Popery that moſt threatens us.

               <p>Well, and can you ſhew me from any of the Ancient Hiſtorians, that there were any ſuch <hi>Inſpiriting Sermons</hi> at thoſe Times? If you cannot produce any, I ſhall be apt to believe, that either the <hi>Preachers</hi> then were <hi>no Proteſtants,</hi> or elſe that the <hi>Fathers</hi> were none.

               <p>
                  <hi>You may e'en drop this Point; for I don't pin my Faith upon</hi> ſuch Sermons. <hi>I know indeed, as the World goes now, there are ſome who cannot hold their Eyes open at a Sermon, but when the Thunder of</hi> Papiſt <hi>and</hi> Popery, <hi>breaking from the Pulpit, awakens them. But 'tis likely, 'twas not ſo in old Times. The Christians heretofore, I believe, had a greater Portion of the Spirit of</hi> Peace <hi>and</hi> Charity, <hi>they were contented with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Text, and knew to ſpend their Glaſs, without the help of theſe Popular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions.</hi>

               <p>Thou art Good-natur'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>Miſrepreſenter,</hi> and ſo Ingenuous, as to ſhame the Devil and ſpeak Truth: In Return, Ile let fall this Point, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no farther after <hi>Proteſtant Sermons</hi> in thoſe Primitive Times, for the Direction of the Firſt Councils.

                  <hi>Yes, this will be to the Purpoſe: upon this Point turns the whole weight of the Controverſie, if it don't appear they were</hi> Proteſtants; <hi>I muſt needs own, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded many; and that I really am, what you call me, a</hi> Miſrepreſenter.</p>

                  <hi>Yes, yes; I have heard this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. The</hi> Popes <hi>were</hi> Good Prelates <hi>in thoſe Days; they had not then the</hi> Mark <hi>of the</hi> Beaſt <hi>in their Forehead: and ſo that Concludes nothing.</hi>

               <p>If They had not then the <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> 'twas becauſe there were then no ſuch things as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſet it on. The <hi>Popes</hi> had at that Time all Chriſtian Churches Subject to them, as Mr. <hi>Napper</hi> confeſſes, <hi>upon the Revelations:</hi> Nay, he ſays that the <hi>Pope's</hi> Uſurpation and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over all Chriſtian Churches, began before the Year of Chriſt 316, which was before the Time even of the <hi>Firſt General Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> held <hi>An.</hi> 325. Now ſince for this very <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> (as they call it) the <hi>Modern Proteſtants, Luther</hi>'s <hi>Offspring,</hi> have ſet <hi>Horns</hi> upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> and made him <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> if he was not ſo reputed or eſteem'd by the <hi>Firſt General Councils,</hi> there being then the ſame Reaſon, I muſt needs conclude, 'twas becauſe they were then no <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> You your ſelf cannot deny, but if <hi>Thoſe Proteſtants,</hi> who now ſay, that <hi>the Antichriſtian and Papiſtical Reign</hi> began in thoſe Days; had They then liv'd, and been <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> would have ſaid the ſame then, as they do now. And ſince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuch Opprobrious and Infamous Titles, the <hi>Fathers</hi> then ſhew'd him the higheſt Reſpect and Veneration, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aſſures me, Thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> were no <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47310:43"/>
thoſe Councils were <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> You are not ignorant, how ill theſe Doctrines ſuit with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Temper. You know, They look upon the <hi>Interceſſion of Saints,</hi> as injurious to the Mediation of Chriſt, and Idolatrous: The <hi>Pope's Primacy,</hi> is with them an Antichriſtian Uſurpation: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring Relicks</hi> is Superſtitious: <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> an Idle Devotion: The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> Unreaſonable: The <hi>Maſs,</hi> an Evacuating of the Sacrifice of the Croſs. Now can you perſwade me, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of thoſe Firſt Councils could be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and yet let theſe Doctrines and Practices, ſo Deteſtable as they muſt be in their Opinion, paſs without any Condemnation and Uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd? No certainly, The Fathers of thoſe Times were more Zealous than ſo. They were Watchful againſt all <hi>Novel Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſuch as were contrary to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Doctrine of the Church; and there were no ſooner any ſtarted, tho' in Parts remote from them, but they preſently took the Alarm, and by <hi>Writing, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Diſputing, Synods National and Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical,</hi> did make a moſt Vigorous Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and withſtand them: And ſuch as continu'd <hi>Obſtimate</hi> in their <hi>Errors,</hi> with Endeavours of drawing Numbers after them, and Diſturbing the Peace of the Church, ſeldom or never eſcap'd without the Mark of <hi>Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Schiſm.</hi> When I conſider this State of the <hi>Primitive Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> happily Flouriſhing under the Conduct and Care of ſo many Eminent <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> no leſs Zealous in Defending their Charge from the Aſſaults of <hi>Innovators,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart</hi> Opinions, than in Preſerving Them in the <hi>Receiv'd</hi> Doctrines from the Apoſtles; I cannot imagine, how to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them aſſembled in <hi>Full Council,</hi> of ſuch <hi>Groſs Stupidity,</hi> or <hi>Inexcuſable Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> as they muſt of neceſſity be guilty of, in paſſing over ſo Conſiderable an Evil, which had then overſpread the greateſt part of the Church. And yet if I am to take Them for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they of neceſſity fall under theſe Cenſures, in not Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or Condemning thoſe <hi>Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> which (as we are aſſur'd from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Proteſtants) in the Times of thoſe <hi>Councils</hi> had prevail'd upon ſuch great Numbers of the Chriſtian World. And Therefore ſince, as you confeſs, They made no Proviſion by <hi>Decrees</hi> or <hi>Canone,</hi> againſt <hi>thoſe Doctrines,</hi> I am throughly perſwaded, They were no <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

               <p>I <hi>HAVE a Scruple this Morning, that I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you too much room, to look for the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>in the Primitive Times: If I had Confin'd your Search within a Narrower compaſs of years, you had diſcover'd more</hi> Proteſtancy <hi>and leſs</hi> Popery.</p>

               <p>I have not taken in more Years than you agreed to, nor more than are generally allow'd by <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> You know 'tis the Bulwark of the <hi>Pretended Reformers,</hi> to make their Appeal to the <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> They acknowledge their <hi>Separation</hi> from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was in the Time of their Reformation: and they juſtifie themſelves for ſo doing; becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as they pretend) had faln from the <hi>Purity</hi> of Doctrine profeſs'd by the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> into <hi>Groſs Errors, Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And therefore ſince the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it ſelf, 'twas neceſſary They ſhould <hi>Separate</hi> from it, ſo to Reform the Abuſes and Corruptions that had crept in upon Chriſtianity, and bring it back to that State of Purity, in which it had been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by their Forefathers of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church.</hi>

                  <hi>Yes; this is the True Reaſon of the</hi> Proteſtants Separating <hi>themſelves from the Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>and therefore I don't doubt, but the Religion as here Eſtabliſh'd amongſt us by Law, is the ſame as was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Generally profeſs'd by the</hi> Primitive Church. <hi>But the Queſtion is, How many Years the</hi> Primitive Church <hi>continu'd</hi> Pure <hi>and</hi> Uncorrupt, <hi>that is,</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>as we are at this Day? For I ſee, you have look'd back into ſome</hi> Ages <hi>Paſt, which I took for</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>and there has appear'd then ſo much</hi> Popery <hi>publickly Exercis'd and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that I have ſome reaſon to ſuſpect, that the Chriſtians of thoſe Times, were rather</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts <hi>than</hi> Proteſtants: <hi>and that you have been ſomething inſincere in this Point, and not made your Enquiry ſo far back as you ought.</hi>

                  <hi>in this I a am ſure, there was no Miſtake of mine. For Our Dr.</hi> Morton <hi>ſays</hi> (Prot.

And when they have diſown'd all the Fathers one by one, from <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Ignatius, Irenaeus,</hi> who liv'd in the Apoſtles Days, and ſucceeded them in their Function, to S. <hi>Jerome, Austin, Leo, Gregory,</hi> the laſt of which ſurviv'd the <hi>Fifth Century:</hi> when they have declar'd that Antichriſt began his Reign, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd the Light of the Goſpel, even from the Time of the Apoſtles: I wonder what Room, as you ſay, there's left for <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</hi> It ſavours ſomething of a Myſtery, methinks, call'd <hi>Nonſenſe;</hi> to ſay the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> is the ſame Pure Religion as was Anciently and Generally Profeſs'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> and then to condemn the ſame <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church,</hi> for being infected with <hi>Popery,</hi> and giving way to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Wherefore to avoid theſe Inconveniences, if you'l take my Advice, <hi>Miſrepreſenter,</hi> I believe you had better pretend no longer Right to the <hi>Primitive Fathers;</hi> but as you have condemn'd the <hi>Eight hundred</hi> Years next before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> of Damnable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Superſtitions, to take one ſtep further back, and e'en take in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Six hundred</hi> Years too, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them all in the lump, from Chriſt's Time to <hi>Luther,</hi> for being <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected.</hi> Never Mince the matter; They were all Men, you know, and ſubject to Error, and when you are once in, 'tis as eaſily condemning your Fore-fathers for <hi>Fourteen</hi> Ages as for <hi>Eight.</hi> Your Firſt <hi>Reforming-Apoſtles</hi> were ſomething of this mind; and thought it no more difficulty to Cenſure and Condemn the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> than Thoſe they found in the time of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. but were for Reforming all with the ſame Hand. Hearken a little to your courageous <hi>Luther: In the Writings</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of</hi> Jerome <hi>there is not a word of True Faith in Chriſt, and Sound Religion;</hi> Tertullian <hi>is very Superſtitious; I have held</hi> Origen <hi>long ſince Accurſed; of</hi> Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome <hi>I make no account;</hi> Baſil <hi>is of no worth, he is wholly a Monk, I value him not of a Hair;</hi> Cyprian <hi>is a Weak Divine.

And in another place; <hi>The Fathers,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of ſo many Ages have been plainly Blind, and most Ignorant in the Scriptures; They err'd all their Life-time, and unleſs they were mended before their Deaths, they were neither Saints, nor pertaining to God's Church.</hi> To. 2. l. de Serv.
