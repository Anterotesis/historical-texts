         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER formerly sent to Dr. Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

               <head>To the Reader.</head>
               <p>THE Author of the following <hi>Letter</hi> sent the Original to Mrs.
<hi>Tillotson</hi> for her Husband, and a Copy of it to my Lady
<hi>Derby,</hi> for the Princess of <hi>Orange,</hi> several Months ago; and when
he writ it, he hoped the Members of Parliament would have been, against
the Sessions, awakened by their Disappointments and Taxes, to consider
aright, what is the present State of this miserable Nation, and how
much worse is our future prospect; and had he found them in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and acting steddily for their Countrey, he had thoughts to have
presented with his own hands, his Reasons, why he thinks they have
wronged King <hi>James,</hi> over-rated their Disease, and mistaken their
Cure; and he would also have given in Proposals, how the King may
be restored, without hazard, either to our Religion or Property; and
this the Author would have done, because he thinks, that if either Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Religion would prevail, such an Offer must have had some weight;
but whilst the Whigs as much Sacrifice their Understandings to support
this Change, as the Tories did their Consciences to make it, a Man
would be reckoned mad that attempted in such a manner to reclaim such
a Sett of Men, as have no more publick Spirit, than what lies in wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
for their particular Parties; or common sense, than what is
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oper to get into Pensions, and Places, that, at the witty Sir
<hi>Charles Sidley</hi> once said in the House, <hi>They may charge in
Armor.</hi> How wild a Project too, would it be to offer Reason to Men
that so little know their own Minds, that are so inconstant, as that
what they pass unanimously one Sessions, they throw out the next, as
they have done the Judges Bill? The Author would venture himself
against great odds, if it was but an even Wager, that <hi>England</hi>
might reap Good by so bold an Undertaking; for he sees Slavery
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110439:2"/>
coming on so fast, that he thinks Life will be a burden to an honest
and free Spirit; yet nothing that <hi>Cato</hi> (were he here) could do, or
suffer, would repair our broken Constitution, unless God teaches our
Senators more Wisdom, or is pleased to teach the People that a House
of Commons may as scandalously abuse the Trust they repose in them,
as some of his Ministers did King <hi>James;</hi> which that he may, is
the hearty Prayer of the Author, both for the sake of the <hi>English</hi>
Liberties, and Protestant Religion; for the sake of the very Being
of the one, and the Honour of the other.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Shall Preface what I am about to say, with an assurance, That
I have formerly had the greatest Veneration for You, as well
for your Piety as good Sense and Learning; That my Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Government are so large, that the first thing that I
ever doubtfully examin'd, that had Your Name affix'd to it, was
<hi>the Letter to my Lord</hi> Russel: but your Actions since do less quadrate
with that Opinion I had of your Sincerity, and seriously make me
address my self to You, to know how you reconcile your present
Actings to the Principles either of natural or revealed Religion;
especially, how you reconcile them to the Positions and Intentions
of that Letter; and consequently, whether you have a Belief of
<hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>World to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I think it a very extravagant Maxim in Government, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all Insurrections which are only levell'd at Reformation, and
designed to correct Mal-administration, and the Authors of them,
and thereby (when the Common Methods are at a loss) to let the
King know, what are the Measures of his Government, the <hi>Voice</hi>
and <hi>Interest</hi> of his People, that so <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> may prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>illegal Courses</hi> and his <hi>flattering Minions,</hi> and that the <hi>Rights</hi> of
his Crown a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d the <hi>Privileges</hi> of his People may be adiusted and
preserved. I say, I think it an extravagant Position, to affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That
what may be so conducive to publick Peace, and the maintenance
of a Constitution, and the general Ends of all Government, is Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal:
Yet I have often thought, that the Oath that expects a Man
should swear it <hi>unlawful, upon any pretence whatsoever, to rise in Arms
against the King, or any Commissioned by him,</hi> intended to establish
this wild Civil Article; and I thought your Lordship writ upon so
solemn an occasion, designing to justifie the Purport and Doctrin of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110439:2"/>
that Oath; which was carrying Loyalty to a higher pitch than I
ever thought necessary to make a good Man, or a good Christian.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> to lay your <hi>Letter</hi> aside at present, give me leave to
examin this Revolution with the most impartial desire of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
for I solemnly invoke God Almighty to attest, That my
Non-compliance with K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary'</hi>s Title and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
is founded upon Scruples of Conscience, to which I yet
want satisfactory Answers. I am a Protestant of that size, that I
hope God would enable me to undergo all the Persecution that the
Malice of Men and Devils can invent, rather than one moment
prostitute my Conscience so far as to give any reasonable Umbrage
for Protestants to suspect, or Papists to hope, I could be made a
Convert to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I love my <hi>Country</hi> better than my
<hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> and certainly therefore so much, that I would
for no Interest in the World disquiet the present Settlement, if I
thought it was fit for an honest Man to comply with it.</p>
               <p>I have no Personal Obligations to King <hi>James;</hi> and I thank God
I have an obstinate Honesty, that will scarce allow me to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to any King. Whatever I have done, or shall do, for the
<hi>Exil'd Prince,</hi> is upon meer Motives of Conscience. I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe my self uncapable of being forgiven, or perhaps em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
under the present Government; my R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

are many of them <hi>violent,</hi> and almost all <hi>at least for it.</hi> But let us
begin with the Revolution: I acknowledge King <hi>James'</hi>s Ministers
gave great Provocations; I could have joined with any but a <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner</hi>
to have rescu'd our Liberties; and yet I must as freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
I saw nothing done that would have been too hard for a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
redress, or at least for the intrinsick Power of this Island,
the natural Weight of those who are sensible of their Religion and
Property: but I cannot tell how any Provocations tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were given
the People of <hi>England,</hi> can justifie the Invasion of a Nephew and a
Son-in-law. I cannot tell by what distinctions in Morality the <hi>Dutch</hi>
could salve their denial, by their Ambassador, that those Forces were
designed for <hi>England;</hi> I cannot imagin what dispensation gave them
and the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> liberty to tell so many things that were
notoriously untrue, that <hi>they</hi> knew then to be untrue, and that have
been much more apparently proved so by the sequel of things.</p>
               <p>Sure the Morality of the Decalogue is not abolished: Let us see
how many of the Commandments are broken; Has not <hi>Mammon</hi>
been made a <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>Crown</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> to which the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>
and his Adherents have sacrific'd the Lives of many thousands of Men,
as well as the Reputation of our Religion, besides a vast Treasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
tho' it is not fit to be named after the other two Immolations? Have

they not taken God's Name in, when they consecrated to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Religion the Injuries and Violations of it, of which
they have been guilty? I do not know whether you are a strict
<hi>Sabbatarian;</hi> I believe not, and will acknowlege I am none: but I
think the Nation grosly perverts the ends of Humiliations and Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and appointed Days for God's Worship, whilst they pray to
God to prosper any immoral Enterprize. For God's sake, and the
sake of your Soul, and the sake of <hi>your</hi> Queen's Soul, <hi>study the fifth
Commandment,</hi> tho' the performance of it has the promise of length
of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

plunge her into Miseries of a longer duration; <hi>She</hi> has partaken
with <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Liars</hi> against her own <hi>Father; She</hi> is a Receiver of
what has been <hi>by them</hi> from him <hi>wrongfully</hi> taken away, unless it
can be proved that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is Elective, the Kings of
it punishable and deposable. If this is right, <hi>you</hi> know, Sir, all our
Law-books are in the wrong, for they say, <hi>The King can do none;
That he is not accountable to the People, collectively or representatively;
and that the Monarchy of</hi> England <hi>is Hereditary.</hi> This is all in the
Original Contract of our Statute-Books and Law Cases.</p>
               <p>Sir, You know these things, you cannot plead ignorance, nor can
you believe <hi>Abdication:</hi> You know the treatment the King had from
the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> and his own Subjects, and cannot believe he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
resigned. <hi>Are not then our Judges, our Juries, our Fleets, and
our Armies, guilty of Murther, in opposing King</hi> James<hi>'s Return? Don't
your Queen list so many Assassins, whilst she Commissions them for that

                     </gap>se? Is it not as unlawful to steal a</hi> Crown <hi>as a</hi> Trifle? <hi>And till
they have recanted all the false Accusations which were countenanced by
the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>and his Princess, and were instrumental towards
the getting of these Crowns, do they not violate the Ninth Commandment,
as well as covet their Neighbours</hi> (their Fathers) <hi>Goods?</hi> The Civil and
Natural Obligations the <hi>Prince and Princess of Orange</hi> have to King
<hi>James</hi> aggravate their Crime; and, if it were not almost levity to
say so here, I would add as another aggravation, their having co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted
too many of King <hi>James'</hi>s Servants.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> does every thing by his <hi>Officers;</hi> they are
impeachable, they are punishable: The King (who we always said
<hi>was not so</hi>) is dethron'd, whilst those are imploy'd in <hi>this</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who were the Disgraces and Instruments of the <hi>last.</hi> But I
don't intend a Libel, and therefore will not enter into an Account
of such Matters; I will neither give the present Ministers their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
nor shew how little, as meer Men and Subjects, we are the
better for the Change. But I fear, whoever reflects without heat or
byass upon what I have said, will find we have lost at least Nine of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110439:3"/>
the Ten Commandments, which is exceeding Popery in our <hi>Index
Expurgatorius</hi> with a witness.</p>
               <p>But, to come to your more particular Case, I beseech you to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
some Discourse (if you can clear things) to demonstrate <hi>either
your Repentance of what you writ to my Lord</hi> Russel, <hi>or the Reasons that
make</hi> that, <hi>and what you</hi> now <hi>do, consistent; and that you, with the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

you can write unanswerable. <hi>God's Glory, the Reputation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

Devout Man's Archbishoprick; a Man that has given Testimony how
unalterably he is a Protestant! a Sufferer formerly for the Laws and
Church of <hi>England;</hi> a Sufferer for those very Principles upon which
that <hi>Letter to my Lord Russel</hi> was writ; for those very Principles
which you disputed for (when he was about to Communicate)

               <p>Really, Sir, if there be any Truth, if there be any Virtue, if
there be any Religion, What shall we say to these Things? What
will you say to them? You must be at the pains to clear this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that we may not believe the Boundaries of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> the
Measures of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> quite taken away, that we may
not be tempted to <hi>Speculative,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Practical Atheism.</hi>

Commons, and I am not sure that the same Spirit of Integrity,
which has hindred me from succumbing under what we think an
Usurpation, will not the next time there is an Assembly there carry
me that length, (if I don't in the mean time publickly hear from
you.) I beg of God Almighty (in whose Being I bless his Name
I yet believe) to lay a happy constraint upon me, to do what may
be most for his <hi>Glory,</hi> and the Good of these <hi>Nations;</hi> and I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly

               <p>I Was heartily glad to see your Lordship this Morning in that calm
and devout Temper at Receiving the blessed Sacrament; but
Peace of Mind, unless it be well grounded, will avail little: And
because transient Discourse many times hath little effect for want
of time to weigh and consider it; therefore in tender Compassion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110439:4"/>
of your Lordship's Case, and from all the good Will that one Man
can bear to another, I do humbly offer to your Lordships delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Thoughts these following Considerations concerning the Points
of Resistance, if our Religion and Rights should be invaded, as
your Lordship puts the Case; concerning which I understood by
Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> that your Lordship had once received Satisfaction, and
am sorry to find a Change.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Christian Religion doth plainly forbid the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though our Religion be established by Law, (which
your Lordship urges as a difference between our Case, and that
of the Primitive Christians,) yet in the same Law, which establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
our Religion, it is declared, <hi>That it is not lawful upon any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatsoever to take up Arms,</hi> &amp;c. Besides that, there is a particular
Law declaring the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> to be solely in the King.
And that ties the Hands of the Subjects, though the Law of Nature
and the General Rules of Scripture had left us at liberty; which,
I believe, they do not, because the Government and Peace of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society could not well subsist upon these Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your Lordships Opinion is contrary to the declared
Doctrine of all Protestant Churches; and though some particular
Persons have taught otherwise, yet they have been contradicted
herein, and condemned for it by the generality of Protestants: And
I beg your Lordship to consider how it will agree with an avow'd
asserting of the Protestant Religion, to go contrary to the general
Doctrine of Protestants. My end in this is to convince your
Lordship, that you are in a very great and dangerous Mistake;
and being so convinced, that which before was a Sin of Ignorance,
will appear of a much more heinous Nature, as in Truth it is, and
call for a very particular and deep Repentance; which if your
Lordship sincerely exercise upon the sight of your Error, by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
Acknowledgment of it to God and Men, you will not only
obtain Forgiveness of God, but prevent a mighty Scandal to the
Reformed Religion. I am very loth to give your Lordship any
disquiet in the Distress you are in, which I commiserate from my
Heart; but am m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

World in a delusion and false Peace, to the hindrance of your
eternal Happiness. I heartily pray for you, and beseech your

               <p>O Almighty and Merciful God, with whom alone live the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Just Men made perfect, after they are delivered from
these Earthly Prisons; we humbly commend the Soul of this our
dear Brother into thy hands, as into the hands of a Faithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and most Merciful Saviour; humbly beseeching thee, that it
may be precious in thy sight: Wash it, O Lord, from all its Guilt
in the Blood of the immaculate Lamb that was slain to take away
the Sins of the World; that whatsoever Defilements it may have
contracted in the midst of this wicked World, by the Lusts of the
Flesh, or the Wiles of Satan, being purged and done away by a
sincere and unfeigned Repentance, through thy infinite Mercy and
Goodness in our Lord Jesus Christ, it may be presented pure and
holy, and without spot, before thee. O Lord, we humbly beseech
thee to support thy Servant, and stand by him in this last and great
Contest; Deliver him from the Pains of Eternal Death, and save
him, O Lord, for thy Mercies sake; and grant that all we who
survive, by this and other Instances of thy Providence, <hi>may learn
our Duty to God and the King;</hi> and that by this, and other like Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
of our Mortality, we may see how frail and uncertain our
Condition is in this World, that it is all but Vanity; and teach us
so to number our days, that we may seriously apply our hearts to
that holy and heavenly Wisdom while we live, which may bring
us to Life Everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord: In whose
holy Name and Words we conclude our Prayers.</p>
