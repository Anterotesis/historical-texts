            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thou maist gather, first, that it is a

a Christian Common-weale, which
so learned a Byshop would stand to
confute; &amp; secondlie, that to dehort
from plaies is no newe thing, being
condemned so long ago.</p>
            <p>The Lord of his infinite mercie
<pb facs="tcp:6073:4"/>
grant, that his blast maie do more
good with Englishmen, than it did
with the Romans, to which he soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the same. Otherwise I know right
wel, that must needs betide vs which
happened vnto them. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
his saiengs, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of such like good men. Therfore
first came the foraine enimies, the
<hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales</hi> who ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them, and oppressed them with
most grieuous bondage; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they fel into the handes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
who caried them headlong into
al impuritie of life, &amp; abomination,
vnder which curse of God they as yet
continue. So we, assuredlie, vnles
we listen vnto the dehortations of
these good men, and shun plaies, with
such like pompes of Satan, the which
once we, when it was, before God &amp;
his congregation, renounced, shal fal
into some one intolerable plague of
<pb facs="tcp:6073:4"/>
God or other, into the handes if not
of foraine enimies, which I feare; yet
of our spiritual aduersarie, the Pope
or Diuel, which I am sure of.</p>
            <p>Touching the Autor of the latter
blast, thou maist coniecture who he
was, but I maie not name him at
this time for my promise sake: yet this
do I saie of him, that he hath bine, to
vse his verie wordes, <hi>A great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter

&amp;c.</hi> Yea, which I ad, as excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an Autor of those vanities, as
who was best. But the Lord of his
goodnes hath called him home; so
that he did not so much delight in
plaies in times past, but he doth as
much detest them now, and is harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sorie that euer he was such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to set vice afloate: as more
at large in his discourse, thou maist
perceaue. VVhereby first, note with

their seueral portions within vs,
as filthie cogitations the minde;

            <p>For who, without passing the
boundes of shamefastnes, can vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those imitations of vnhonest
things; that filthie speech; that
vile motion, the beastlie gestures,
vsed there? The vilenes whereof
may be gathered euen by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulues
to name them. For som
sinnes, though most hainous, may
wel and honestlie both be named,
&amp; blamed too, as murder, theft, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie,
sacriledge, and such like:
onlie the filthines of Theaters are
such as may not honestlie be no
not so much as blamed. Such new
matter ariseth against the reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
for finding falt with this most
horrible filthines; that albeit he be
a most perfect honest man that

not so doe and keepe his honestie.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:6073:8"/>
Againe, al other euils pollute the
doers onlie, not the beholders, or
the hearers. For a man may heare
a blasphemer, and not be partaker
of his sacriledge, inasmuch as in
minde he dissenteth. And if one
come while a roberie is a doing, he
is cleere, because he abhors the
fact. Onlie the filthines of plaies,
and spectacles is such, as maketh
both the actors &amp; beholders giltie
alike. For while they saie nought,
but gladlie looke on, they al by
sight and assent be actors, that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
may be applied vnto them that
saieng of the apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 1, 31.</note> 
               <hi>How that not

are worthie death, but also which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor

            </p>
            <p>So that in that representation of

plaie the whores. And such as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie

adulterers from plaies. For
they plaie the harlots, not then
onlie when they go awaie, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
when they come. For as soone
as one lusteth after a filthie thing,
whiles he hasteneth to that which

            <p>Now this being so, behold I

plaie the harlots in Theaters? Or
is this our meaning, and doe we
thinke it meete, that forsomuch as
God seeth vs in circles, and Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that what things we see, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth;
and what filthines we
looke on, he seeth it also for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie?
For one of these must
needes be: for if he vouchsafe to
looke vpon vs, it foloweth, that he
must beholde al those thinges,
where we are: or if, which is most
true, he turne awaie his eies from
those thinges, he must likewise
turne his countenance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs who
are there. And the case standing
thus, yet naie-theles we doe these
things which I haue said, and that
without cessing.</p>
            <p>Or thinke we that God hath his
Theaters, and circles, as had the
gods of the Gentils? For thus did
they in old time, because they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6073:10"/>
were persuaded their idols deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in them.<note place="margin">The Diuel delighteth in plaies; God dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth them.</note> But how is it that we
doe so, who are certaine that our
God detesteth them? Or if wee
knowe that this abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
please God, I wil not gaine-saie,
but wee maie frequent it daie by
daie. But if it be in our conscience,
that God abhorreth, that he dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
that God is offended as the
Diuel is fed by Theaters; how saie
we that wee worship God in his
Church, which serue the Diuel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
at plaies, and that wittinglie,
and willinglie? And what hope
shal we haue with God, who not
ignorantlie, or by chance wound
him, but after the example of
those gigants whome we reade, ful
madlie bent themselues against
God, and against the cloudes. So
we through the iniuries which al
the world ouer continualie we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6073:10"/>
doe beate the heauens, as it
were, with a common consent.</p>
            <p>To Christ therfore, O monste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

we offer plaies and tomblers; yea

ouer the enimies, whereby
what else do we show our selues,
but euen iniurious to him which
hath done vs good; to raile vpon
him, who blesseth vs; to strike
him ouer the face with a sworde,
who louinglie doth kisse vs.</p>
            <p>For I aske the mightie and rich
men of this world, of what offence
is that seruant guiltie, which wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6073:11"/>
without controuersie al men

we, which are called Christians;
we stir vp against vs a merciful
God by our vncleannes; we strike
a gratious God by our filthines;
we wound a louing God by our

            <p>To Christ therefore, ô monste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

            <p>What error, I saie, is this, naie

and can wee not laugh except wee

sinne not. What foolishnes, naie
madnes is it, to thinke mirth and
ioie nothing worth, vnles God be
iniuried therebie? yea iniuried, &amp;
that most hainouslie?</p>
            <p>For in showes there is a certaine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6073:13"/>
Apostasie from the faith;<note place="margin">To see plaies a kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie.</note> and a
deadlie declining from our beliefe,
and the heauenlie sacraments. For
what is the first professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
at their baptisme? They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
they wil renounce the Diuel,
and al his workes, his pompes, and
vanities. Therefore by our owne
confession, showes &amp; pompes are
the workes of the Diuel.</p>
            <p>How then, ô Christian, dost
thou haunt plaies and Theaters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
baptisme, which thy selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessest
are the works of the Diuel!
Once thou didst renounce the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel
and al his showes, wherebie it
foloweth, that whiles thou goest
witting and willinglie vnto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
spectacles, thou must thinke
thou returnest again vnto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.
For thou hast renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced both,
and didst confesse one of them to
be both. So that returning vnto
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6073:14"/>
one, thou wentest back vnto both.
For, thou saiest, I renounce the
Diuel, his pompes, showes, and
workes. And what afterward? I
beleeue, thou saiest, in God the
Father almightie, and in Iesus
Christ his sonne. Therefore before
we can beleeue in God, the Diuel
must be renounced. For he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not in God, who renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
not the Diuel. So then he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh
God, who returnes to the
Diuel. But the Diuel is in his
pompes &amp; showes, then it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that by returning vnto his
pompes wee forsake the faith of
Christ. Then hereby al the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Beliefe are vnlosed; and
al which foloweth in the Creede,
is weakened, and tottereth. For
the building cannot stand, if the
principal be downe.</p>
            <p>Then tel me, ô Christian, how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6073:14"/>
canst thou think thy selfe to keepe
that which folowes in the Creed,
when thou hast lost the beginning
of the same? The members with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an head be nothing worth; &amp;
to their beginning al things haue
respect; which once being decaied
euerie thing goes to wracke. For
the roote being gone, either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
remaines; or if there do, it
serues to smal profit, for without
an head nothing can stand.</p>
            <p>He therefore that thinkes it a
light offence to see plaies, let him
consider al what we haue said, and
he shal see that in plaies there is
destruction, and no pleasure. And
what els is it, but to fal into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
to forgo the beginning
of life? For where the fundacion
of the Beliefe is ouerthrown, life it
selfe is destroied.</p>
            <p>Then againe we must needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6073:15"/>
vnto that which we haue
often said: what such thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the barbarous? where be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
stages among them, or Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?
where is the sinne of manie
sinnes, that is the destruction of
our hope,<note place="margin">Pagans might better erect &amp; frequent Theaters than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> and saluation? which
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding if they, being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
did vse, they should erre with
lesse offence of God: because albe
such doing were a defiling of the
sight, yet were it not a breaking of
the sacrament.</p>
            <p>But now, what can we saie for
our selues? we hold the beleefe, &amp;
we ouerthrowe the beleefe; wee
confesse the dutie of saluation, and
also denie the same. And therefore
where is our Christianitie? who,
as it seemeth, hereunto are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
that afterward more hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we might offend? we prefer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
before the Church; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6073:15"/>
the Lordes table, and honor
Theaters; at a worde, we loue al
things, reuerence al things, God
alone seemeth vile to vs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of other things.</p>
            <p>Finalie among the rest which
proue the same, this which I now
saie, doth showe it to be true. For if
it fal out, as often it doth, that at
one &amp; the same time an holie daie
be kept, and common plaies procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
I demaund, whether do men
flock most, to the court of God, or
to the den of plaies; to the temple,
or to Theaters? And what do men
heare most willinglie, the saiengs
of the Euangelists, or the toies of
plaiers; the wordes of life, or the
wordes of death; the wordes of
Christ, or the words of a foole in a
plaie? doubtles we loue that best,
which we prefer. For if the Church
keepe anie feast on that daie when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6073:16"/>
deadlie pastime is showen, men,
such as say they are Christians, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come not at al vnto Church;
or, if not thinking of plaies they
come and heare in the same plaies
to bee abroad, they leaue the
Church. The temple is despised, to
run vnto Theaters; the Church is
emptied, the yeard is filled; wee
leaue the sacrament, to feede our
adulterous eies with the impure, &amp;
whorish sight of most filthie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.
But forsooth we, whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
doth mar, must do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the beginning. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ful rightlie saith the Lord
God vnto vs; <hi>For your vncle annes,
are yee with destruction abolished.</hi>
And againe, <hi>The altars of this mirth
shalbe rooted out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now it maie be answered,
that in al the townes of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
plaies be not vsed. True it is,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6073:16"/>
and I ad moreouer, that neither be
Theaters where in times past they
were. For they are not vsed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at <hi>Magontia,</hi> norat <hi>Massilia,</hi>
because those townes be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
and destroied; They are

hath subdued the same; not
in <hi>Treuers</hi> that famous towne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being foure-times subdued,
it is now brought to ground; to
conclude they are not vsed in most
townes both of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine;</hi>
and therefore wo to vs men, and to
our vncleannes; wo to vs, and to
our wickednes. What hope is there
for Christian people before God?
inasmuch as those euils haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ben in <hi>Roman</hi> cities, since they
came into the hands of <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
Wherby it appeareth that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and impuritie,<note place="margin">Romans singular wicked.</note> is proper &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
vnto the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6073:17"/>
verie nature as it were.<note place="margin">A goodlie praise of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</note> For there
wickednes doth chieflie raigne,
where the <hi>Romans</hi> be.</p>
            <p>But haplie this maie seeme a
grieuous, and vniust complaint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
grieuous indeede, if it be false. But
how, thou wilt saie, how can it be
otherwise, sithence what we haue
said, are done in a few cities of the
<hi>Romans?</hi> And most of them are
not polluted with this spot of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines,
where although the place
and dwelling of ancient error do
abide, yet are not those things now
done which were in times passed.</p>
            <p>It wil be good therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
both these things, that is, both
why the places &amp; houses of plaies
are yet vp; and yet no plaies vsed.
The places and houses of filthines
are therefore yet standing, because
in them all impure things were
wont to be showen: and now the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6073:17"/>
vaine pastime is not vsed, for that
the miserie of the time, and mens
pouertie will not permit. So that it
was of their impietie, why in time
past plaies were frequented, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
is the cause that they are
not now. For the miserable case of
the exchequer, &amp; the emptines of
the <hi>Romane</hi> treasurie wil suffer no
monie to be wasted commonlie
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trifling things. And although
much is lost, and cast as it were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the dunghil: yet nothing so
much can be consumed, because
they haue not wherewithal to do
so. For such is our insatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of filthie plesure, that we could
wish to haue more, onlie to laie it
vpon this dirte of abhomination.
And the thing showes what we
would prodigalie consume, if we
were rich, when we wast so much
being in so poore a state. For this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6073:18"/>
is the spot, and miserie of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time, that although through
pouertie we cannot, yet through
our impietie we would consume
much.</p>
            <p>There is no cause then why we
should deceaue our selues, in sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
that in al cities those things
are not, which were before done.
For therefore they are not in this
time vsed, because the townes
where they were vsed, are not to
be seene: and where they haue a
long time bene vsed, there is not
to bring it to passe: as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
speaketh vnto sinners by the
prophet, <hi>And it ascended vpon his
harte, and the Lord could beare it
no longer: for the wickednes of
your studies, and for the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which you haue committed,
and your land is brought into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
into barrennes, and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:6073:18"/>
This is the cause then whie
the maior part of the <hi>Romane</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
is brought into desolation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
barrennes, and accursed.</p>
            <p>And would to God they were
onlie done in times past, and not
now in these daies, happelie then,
as it is written, God would be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to our sinnes. But we take
not the waie to haue Gods fauor.
For vncessantlie we ad sinne to sin,
&amp; heape wickednes vpon wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that as the better part of vs are
destroied, so we maie al come to
nought.</p>
            <p>For, I demand, who seeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
slaine before his face, and is
not afraide? who beholdeth his
neighbors house on fire, and wil
not by al meanes prouide for the
salfetie of his owne? wee do not
onlie see our neighbors to burne,
but also are set on fire our selues
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6073:19"/>
from the chiefest part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
And, ô abomination! what a
mischiefe is this? we burne, we
burne, yet dread we not the fire
wherwith we burne. For, as I said,
the cause why those things which
before time were vsed, are not
now done, is to be ascribed to the
miserie we are in, not to anie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
or good order which we
haue.</p>
            <p>Finalie, I doe easilie prooue the
same. For make the time as it was,
and forthwith al things shalbe as
they were in those daies. Yea
moreouer, as touching the desire
of men, though those things are
not euerie where, yet in respect of
their minds euerie where they be.
For the <hi>Romans</hi> would haue them
vsed euerie where. For when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
onlie makes an euil thing
to be left vndone, the verie desire
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6073:19"/>
of a filthie thing is condemned in
such sort as if it were done. For, as
I saie, according to the wordes of
our Sauior,<note place="margin">Matt. 5, 28.</note> 
               <hi>VVhosoeuer looketh on
a woman to lust after her, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
adulterie with her alreadie
in his harte:</hi> whereby we maie ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that albe we leaue things fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
&amp; damnable vndone, and that
onelie through necessitie; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our wil is good to haue
them, wee are guiltie of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>And what speake I of wil?
when almost euerie where those
things are committed. For what
stranger soeuer commeth either to
<hi>Rauenna,</hi> or to <hi>Rome,</hi> shal finde a
part of the <hi>Romans</hi> at showes; and
a part of the <hi>Rauenians</hi> at Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
And although anie be either
absent, or distant by place, yet is he
not excused thereby. For as manie
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6073:20"/>
as are ioined togither in likenes of
affection, are guiltie alike of the
same wickednes which either do
commit.</p>
            <p>Yet for al this wee flatter our
selues of our good behauior; wee
flatter our selues of the rarenes of
impuritie. But I say yet more, that
not onelie those foule spots of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
plaies are yet to be seene
as afore time; but also be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominablie
set forth, than euer
they were. For in those daies eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
part of the <hi>Romane</hi> empire was
in health and sound; the riches of
other townes made the common
barnes to be large &amp; big; citizens
did abound in wealth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
so that it was verie hard in
such aboundance of al things, for
religion to continue pure, and
manners vncorrupt. Then euerie
where Autors of filthie pleasure
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6073:20"/>
were cherished; for in al places
men were fat. No man waide the
charge of the Common-weale, no
man feared to come behind hand;
for expenses was not perceaued.
The Common-weale after a sort
did seeke where, and how to wast
wealth, hauing almost no place to
keepe it. And therefore heapes of
wealth, euen wel nigh aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
were consumed vpon vaine
things.</p>
            <p>But now what maie be said? old
aboundance is gone, gone is the
wealth which once we had. Poore
wee are, yet cease wee not to be
vaine. And whereas pouertie doth
reclaime prodigal and prodigious
pupils, so that when their wealth
is gone, they leaue wickednes: we
showe our selues a newe kind of
pupils and vnthriftes, who lacking
wealth wil not leaue wickednes.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6073:21"/>
Whereby it appeareth, that the
cause of our wickednes, is not in
the inticements, as of other men,
but in our hartes: and that our
mindes, is our wickednes; that in
deede not by the taking awaie of
riches, but through the desire of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
things we sinne.</p>
            <p>And although we haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
recited manie vices of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
which the barbarous people
are not polluted withal: yet are
there manie mo, which I will now
ad. But first this I warne you by
the waie, that you account no kind
of sinne light, which tendeth vnto
the dishonor of God. For if no
man maie dishonor him that is
noble and mightie; but if he do so
he is made to answere it where he
would not, and condemned by
lawe: how much more hainous
is that offence, whereby the glorie
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6073:21"/>
of God is defaced? For alwaies the
fault doth increase, according to
the worthines of him that is iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
Because by how much the
person is greater that suffereth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,
by so much is he faultie
that doth the same.<note place="margin">Exod. 31, verse. 13. 14.</note> Whereof it is
which wee read in the lawe, that
they which to mans thinking did

for al that punished: which
was to giue vs to vnderstand that

&amp; that that which man esteemed
a smal offence, because it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against the glorie of God,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 13, verse. 9. 10.</note>

            <p>To be short, <hi>Vzza</hi>

of God he died: not because he
had done anie thing rebelliouslie,
or at leastwise not dutifullie, but
by showing dutie he prooued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutiful,
for taking more vpon him
than he was commanded.</p>

            <p>And what should I speake of

there no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement that they
should not lust, but God, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
would prouide afore hand
for the due obseruation of the
moral law, by restraining their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
concupiscence: euen that
al the people might the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
confesse, how earnestlie they
should auoid those things, which
God in his holie Scripture should
forbid, when they were punished
for that, which as yet they were
not forbidden.</p>
            <p>The same people also complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that they tooke such paines,
for which cause the Lord plagued
them from heauen: not because a
man oppressed with labor might
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6073:23"/>
not complaine; but for that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie
they showed themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
towards GOD, making
God, as it were, the Autor of their
immoderate busines. Wherby we
maie gather, how zelouslie hee
ought to serue God, which enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
prosperitie, when as he maie
not complaine being in aduersitie.</p>
            <p>But perchance, some wil saie,
whereto serues al this? whether
to? doubtles, that we should count

And so, in laughing at filthie and
abhominable thinges, we commit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6073:23"/>
wickednes: &amp; those no smal sins,
but therefore the more damnable:
because though they seeme smal
at the first sight, yet are they most
pestilent in the end. For inasmuch
as there be two most notorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,<note place="margin">Two most notorious offences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by frequenting plaies.</note>
as when a man either slaieth
himselfe, or defaceth the glorie of
God, both they are done in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
plaies. For at plaies both the
euerlasting saluation of Christian
people is quite extinguished tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
wicked filthines, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
of God violated, through sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
superstition. For it is
certaine that it offendeth God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consecrated to idols.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Minerua</hi> in schooles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, <hi>Venus</hi> at Theaters, <hi>Neptune</hi>
at circles, in the field <hi>Mars, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>

had in honor: and so, according to
the qualitie of the Autors, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6073:24"/>
doth encrease.</p>
            <p>Al vncleanes is showed at plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng;
al luxuriousnes at wrestling;
at tumbling al vnshamefastnes;
al madnes in caues. Vncleannes is
one where; wantonnes another<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
anotherwhere intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
and madnes anotherwhere: but
the Diuel is eueriewhere; yea in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
particular place where plaies
be, are al the sortes of Diuels. For
they gouerne those places which
are dedicated vnto them. And
therefore the onelie inticement is
not there, nor wickednes onelie in
such spectacles, or showes. For it
is a kind of sacriledge beside for a
Christian to be at such superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
because he taketh part with
their idolatrie, whose feasts he is
delighted withal.</p>
            <p>The which albeit alwaies it hath
bene a lamentable thing: yet then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6073:24"/>
is it most intollerable, when as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the customable vse of life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our aduersitie, or prosperitie
doth make it the more hainous.
And that because God in aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
should be the more pacified, &amp;
lesse offended in prosperitie. For
Gods fauor should be sought for
when he is angrie; and when he is
merciful, he should not be disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored.
For we fall into aduersitie
through the displeasure of God;
and by his fauor, we enioie pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie.</p>
            <p>But we doe al things cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.<note place="margin">Prosperitie abused.</note> How so? doe you aske?
marke what I saie. And first when
God being intreated of his owne
mercie (for wee do neuer so liue,
that we can deserue to haue him
entreated) but, as I saie, when God
hath entreated himselfe, and giuen
vs a peaceable time, great encrease,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6073:25"/>
a rich tranquillitie, and store of al
thinges more than we can desire;
then we so corrupt our selues with
such prosperitie, and so defile our
liues with wickednes, that we vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie
forget both GOD and our
selues. And whereas the Apostle
saith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2, verse. 2.</note> that <hi>The frute of peace which
God doth send, consisteth in this, that
we should lead a peaceable and quiet
life in al godlines, and honestie:</hi> we
vse the same as though God gaue
it to the end, that we should liue
in al dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kennes, in al riotousnes, in
naughtines, in theft, and in al wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
and dishonestie: as though
the benefite of peace giuen, were
leasure to do wickedlie; and wee
should take the truce of tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
at Gods hand the more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouslie,
and securelie to sinne.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee are vnworthie
Gods gifts, which vse the benefits
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6073:25"/>
of God so wickedly. We make the
occasion of good workes, to be
onlie the matter of wickednes.
Wherebie commeth to passe, that
peace it selfe is against vs. For so
we deale, that better it were for vs
to be without that thing whereby
we proue the worse.</p>
            <p>Who would thinke it? we change
the course of things by our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes; and what God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
made good, we make the same
il for vs, through our vile beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It remaineth that we now proue
that neither the giftes nor allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of God do better vs one iote.
And what are they? what, but euen
our peace, quietnes, &amp; tranquillitie
which we enioie according to our

the matter doth so require, let vs
vtter some special thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:6073:26"/>
Then, as often as we are in feare,
in affliction, in perils; when either
citties with enimies are besieged,
or countries by inuasion or anie
other aduersitie are wasted: then
we beate the members of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale,
and by praier cal for
the assistance of God: If by the
aide of God either townes by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or spoile and pilling hath an
end; or the host of enimies foiled;
&amp; al feare through the blessing of
God is taken awaie, what do wee
straight after al these ehings? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

our Lord God with seruing, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring,

            <p>So happelie we do, &amp; requiting
our GOD at leastwise after the
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of men, we render good for

make recourse vnto the house of

the temple with our gifts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
rewards. And because tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
his gift we are made merrie,
we showe the signes of our ioie in
his temples, or least wise, which he
likes as wel, we renounce the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

we proclaime an holie warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

of simplicitie, or compulsion.</p>
            <p>I write this to none other end
but to showe, that as I ought not,
being wedded too much to mine
owne opinion, to be caried to the
defence of a wrong cause: so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
me not to be ouerlightlie
misled vnto error through the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of those, whose bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
or denial serue onelie to
maintaine, but not to prooue; for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6073:28"/>
that men are not to be satisfied
with wordes, but with reason.
Which if I maie be, I wil not be
counted a peruerse wrangler, but
francklie wil condescend into the
opinion of the wise: otherwise am
to be pardoned though I stand er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and stiffe against that which
is contrarie to virtue; disagreing
from good religion; furthest from
ciuilitie, and maie neither by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of reason, nor power of
learning be defended.</p>
            <p>Such doubtles is mine opinion
of common plaies, vsual iesting,
and riming extempore, that in a
Christian-weale they are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable.
My reason is, because
they are publike enimies to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
&amp; religion; allurements vnto
sinne; corrupters of good manners;
the cause of securitie and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
meere brothel houses of Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derie;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6073:29"/>
and bring both the Gospel
into slander; the Sabboth into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
mens soules into danger;
and finalie the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale
into disorder.</p>
            <p>Great and hainous speeches, no
doubt: yet not so hainous, as the
exercise of them is odious; biting
wordes, yet not so bitter as the
cause requireth.</p>
            <p>It were il painting the Diuel
like an Angel, he must be portraied
forth as he is, that he maie the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be knowen. Sinne hath alwaies
a faire cloake to couer his filthie
bodie. And therefore he is to be
turned out of his case into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
skin, that his nastie filthie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and stinking corruption being
perceaued, he might come into the
hatred and horror of men. For as
we are naturalie of our selues euil
and corrupt: so are we naturalie
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6073:29"/>
giuen to loue our selues, and to be
blinded with our owne affections,
insomuch that, what we knowe
to be euil, we are not ashamed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
openlie to defend, or slilie to
cloake.</p>
            <p>The excuse of wickednes is but
the increase of punishment; &amp; an
il cause defended by auctoritie, &amp;
maintained by learning, bringes
Magistrates into slander, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into contempt.</p>
            <p>This I speake, for that I knowe
those afore-said do want neither
countenance to vphold, nor yet
skil to defend them. But yet, vnder
correction, an euil cause maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is nearetheles euil; &amp;, as pitch
defiles the toucher thereof, be he
neuer so cleane: so the virtuous
bring their life into question ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by suffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or maintenance
of euil. For who wil not iudge but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6073:30"/>
what a mans allowes in another,
he commendes in himselfe?</p>
            <p>I therefore with reuerence not
as a teacher, but as a wel-willer
both to the noble and learned,
would wishe them with <hi>Adrian</hi>
the Emperor to suffer no pastime,
that maie bring them to vanitie;
nor to frequent that recreation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which tendes either to the hurt of
a Common-weale, or to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
of religion.</p>
            <p>It is true that one opinion maie
be contrarie to another; and that
for the disliking of one, or two the
qualitie of plaieng were not to be
laide of, being so highlie esteemed
of al sortes of men, for that euerie
man conceaueth of the goodnes
or badnes of a thing according as it
seemeth in his owne opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And
therefore the thing which they
discommend, maie be both liked,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6073:30"/>
and allowed.</p>
            <p>I confesse the iudgement of one
or two is not to be allowed in such
cases: neuertheles the opinions of
the rude multitude are not alwais
the soundest, which are mooued
with vnconstant motions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
manietimes they like of that
which is most hurtful; and dislike
that which is most profitable: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one pleaseth their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and the other restraineth
their affections. The censure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of them who carie best grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
from Gods worde; and is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to reason, most profitable
for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-weale; least hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our brethren; and tending
alwaie to the reformation of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use,
is soonest to be allowed, and
followed.</p>
            <p>Then whether this my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be admitted or no, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6073:31"/>
the soundest, &amp; respecting the
benefit of this our countrie, I leaue
it to the iudgement of the godlie
wise, and learned. And that I maie
seeme to write nothing without
ground, or to finde fault without
cause, I wil, GOD to freend, set
downe nothing to prooue mine
assertion good, but what Scripture
shal warrant, examples confirme,
reason allowe, and present experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ratifie.</p>
            <p>Which mine arguments, if anie
by more colour of truth can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe,
I am readie to recant, and
to allowe that for good, which I
can yet but condemne as wicked,
and thinke of al other to be the
most intolerable abuse in our Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.
For otherwise I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thinke, vnles I be constrained,
as <hi>Petrarch</hi> saith, to iudge by other
mens iudgements; which who so
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6073:31"/>
doth, iudgeth not of himselfe, but
reporters the opinion of others.</p>
            <p>Manie run on their courses ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vainelie til it please God to cal
them home by the Spirit of his
grace vnto amendment of life. For
when it shal please him to touch
the conscience of the wicked with
repentance, the whole state of their
life doth alter from that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as maie appeare in S. Paule
at his conuersion. And assuredlie
the Lord doth suffer vs manie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to run past our selues, that
when he hath called vs home, we
maie become examples of virtue
and godlines vnto others.</p>
            <p>I confesse that ere this I haue
bene a great affecter of that vaine
art of Plaie-making,<note place="margin">The Autors former stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; and life.</note> insomuch
that I haue thought no time so
wel bestowed, as when my wits
were exercised in the inuention of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6073:32"/>
those follies; I might scarselie with
patience heare anie man speake,
weare he neuer so learned &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that thought to persuade me
from them. So far was I from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
of their good and godlie
admonitions, that I stopped mine
eares, and hardened mine harte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their counsaile. Such is our
peeuish nature; we can like of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which doth dislike vs, or see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
contrarie to our vaine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
And therefore it is God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that must turne our mindes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
wee shal neuer discerne
profitable from hurtful things. For
able we have some about vs who
counsaile vs the best,&amp; seeke our
profit: yet for al that our nature is
so peruerse &amp; froward, that what
is wel said wil take no place. This
found I by my selfe, &amp; this I now
perceaue to be in others: but the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6073:32"/>
Lordes purpose is good in al his
dealings.</p>
            <p>It might haue bene said
of me then,<note place="margin">Hereby learne thou, good Reader, how to shun not onelie the vanitie of plaies, but al other vanities, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of the Author, who by diligent reading the holie Scriptures, and repentance fel into an vtter detestation of plaies.</note> as it was written
of the wicked, that they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
not the waies of the
Lord,</hi> but after when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God of his mercie to cal
mee to the reading of his
worde, and diligent studie of
the Scriptures, I began to
loath my former life, and to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
my owne doings; and I was
no sooner drawen with an hartie
desire to returne vnto the Lorde,
but I found my selfe strengthened
with his grace vnto good desires.
For the Lord neuer faileth them

minds, shalbe so watered with the

wil increase and growe vp in vs to
a more ful grouth and perfection.</p>
            <p>When I came to a streit exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of my life, which I had
vainelie consumed in those exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;<note place="margin">Plaies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide the truth of Gods word;</note> and that I began to cal mine
old doings into question, and to

gold to be but drosse, vile, and of
none account,<note place="margin">Vaine plaies make vaine folkes.</note> hauing the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to make their fauorers of their

            <p>Then to the end that others
should not be deceaued with that
wherewith my selfe was ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">The ende why this booke was made.</note> I thought it my part to laie

&amp; the disorder of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie;
that the abuse being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
euerie man might reforme

take such good waies, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable

be vtterlie put downe. For I am
verilie persuaded, that if they may
be permitted stil to make sale of
sinne, we shal pul on our heads
Gods vengeance, &amp; to our realme
bring an vtter confusion.</p>
            <p>What I shal speake of the abuse
by plaies of my owne knowledge,
I know maie be affirmed by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
to whome those matters are
as wel knowen as to my selfe.
Some citizens wiues,<note place="margin">Frutes of plaies for the Diuels owne mouth</note> vpon whom
the Lord for ensample to others
hath laide his hands, haue euen on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6073:34"/>
their death beds with teares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that they haue receiued at
those spectacles such filthie infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as haue turned their minds
from chast cogitations,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6, verse. 19. 20.</note> and made
them of honest women light hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues;
by them they haue disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
the vessels of holines; and
brought their husbandes into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
their children into questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
their bodies into sicknes, and their
soules to the state of euerlasting
damnation.</p>
            <p>Such is the nature and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">He that toucheth pitch wilbe defiled.</note> that we run whether

as Dauid saith, <hi>VVith the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

            </p>
            <p>The repaire of them that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to those places of euil resort,<note place="margin">Auoid su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> makes their owne good life to be
doubted of; for that the place
breedes suspicion aswel of good, as
of bad. For who can see man or
woman resort to an house which
is notoriouslie wicked, but wil
iudge them to be of the crewe of
the wicked and vngodlie?</p>
            <p>The most honest wife,<note place="margin">The best soonest tempted.</note> is the
soonest assalted, and hath such
snares laid to entrap her, as, if God
assist her not, she must needes be
taken.</p>
            <p>When I gaue my selfe first to
note the abuse of common plaies,
I found mine harte sore smitten
with sorowe (sinne did there so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
&amp; was so openlie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Horrible sinnes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters.</note> that I looked when God in

The Theatre I found to
be an appointed place of Bauderie;<note place="margin">Marke this, ô yee fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, &amp; vpholders of plaies.</note>
mine owne eares haue heard ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
women allured with abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
speeches. Sometime I haue
seene two knaues at once impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
vpon one light huswife,
whereby much quarel hath grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to the disquieting of manie.
There seruants, as it is manifestlie
to be prooued, haue consented to
rob their maisters, to supplie the
want of their harlots; there is the
practising with married wiues to
traine them from their husbands,
and places appointed for meeting
and conference.</p>
            <p>When I had taken a note of al
these abuses,<note place="margin">Who can fauor plaies when the Autors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them.</note> &amp; sawe that the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater
was become a consultorie
house of Satan, I concluded with
my selfe, neuer to imploie my pen
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6073:35"/>
to so vile a purpose, nor to be an
instrument of gathering the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
togither.</p>
            <p>It maie seeme I am ouer lauish
of speech; and that which I haue
publiqulie expressed ofothers by
mine owne knowledge might haue
bene dissembled. But I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that he who dissembles the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
which he knowes in other
men, is as giltie before God ofthe
offence as the offenders the selues.
And the Lord hath expreslie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in <hi>Exodus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23, verse. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that we should
not folowe a multitude to do evil,
neither agree in a controuersie to
decline after many, and overthrowe
the truth.</hi> I cannot therefore but
resist such wickedness, least I might
seeme to maintaine them, For he
that dissembles vngodlines is a
traitor to God.</p>
            <p>Since therefore that the cause is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6073:36"/>
Gods, I dare presse forth my selfe
to be an Advocate against Satan
unto the rooting out of sinne. For
I am fully resolued in Gods truth,
to build so strong and fure a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
against these sellers, &amp; set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
forth of sinne, as neither they,
nor their adherents shal euer be
able to ouerthrowe. And my trust
is that the godile wil ionie with
me to the suppressing of those
which fight against his worde, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their battel on the Sabboth
daie the more conuenientile to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie
the soules of the children of
God.</p>
            <p>The cause is generalie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
for that the contention of
the Aduersaries is about religion,
and therefore none can be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for bare saieng they consent
not to the wicked. For it is the
part of euerie true soldier of lesus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6073:36"/>
Christ with al power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
&amp; resist such as offer wrong
to the maiestie of GOD, by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the service which we owe
unto him. We are to be enimies
unto the death against those up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiolders
of wickedness; and neuer to
giue ouer the battel in so holie, &amp;
iust a quarel.</p>
            <p>We see the wicked are alwaies
readie to maintaine euil causes, &amp;
in these daies the worst men shal
find bearers, and bolsterers, and be
supported by those, who by iustice
are to supress them, or at least to
reforme their abuses, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.
If the wicked lurke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to vphold their lewdenes,
how much more ought the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ioine themselues together
to plucke downe vanitie!</p>
            <p>I knowe my selfe a worme of
al other the weakest to medle in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:6073:37"/>
these cases: yet such is my desire
to ouerthrowe their wickednes,
that I dare, inflamed with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
zeale of <hi>Dauid</hi> in the quarel of
God, unprouided both of armor
and weapon, with one poore sling
resist the strength of their hugest
Champion, and endure the brunt
of his fierce assalts; doubting not
but to finde some that wil stande
with me to ouerthrowe the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of GOD, and to pul downe
those flags of defia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which Satan
hath set vp against the preaching
of the Gospel to the decaie of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Let vs delaie no time, deere bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
their doings are abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the sight and eares of God,
and condemned of the righteous:
if therefore sentence against their
euil workes be not executed spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie,
<hi>The hartes of the children of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6073:37"/>
men,</hi> as Ecclesiastes saith, <hi>wilbe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
set in them to do euil.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 8, 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If there were nothing to moue
you,<note place="margin">Plaies do not onelie hinder the Gospel, but hurte the Common-weale.</note> it were great cause to
stir vp your godlie furie, and zeale
to discommend plaies vtterlie: but
their abuses stretching further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Common-wealth, are by
sufferance growen so huge, that it
is hard dealing with them as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
foes; for they are become
priuate freends.<note place="margin">Waies how to suppresse plaies.</note> They are therfore
to be delt withal by degrees. For
it is verie hard to roote out that
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our hartes, be it neuer so great
an abuse, wherof we haue concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
a good opinion.</p>
            <p>Let therefore the Magistrate but

of none but those who are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
destitute of the feare of God,
and without conscience. To plaie
on the Sabboth is but a priuiledge
of sufferance, and might with ease
be repelled, were it throughlie fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
The warrant which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
haue to forbid plaies is great,
and passed vnto them by such a
Prince, whose auctoritie is aboue
al auctories of earthlie gouernors.</p>
            <p>God hath giuen vs an expresse
commandement that wee should
not violate the Sabboth daie;<note place="margin">Exo. 20, 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> and

cal the Sabboth a delite, to consecrate

               <note place="margin">Esa. 58, 14.</note> 
               <hi>then
shalt thou delite in the Lord, and I

            </p>
            <p>Here we see how the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that this daie should be

for at our hands. But, alas, how do
we followe the order which the

abused? which of vs on that daie
is not carried whether his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which of vs hath his hart occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>O my deere brethren, let not

            <p>Pleasure their capitaine is so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique

But when ye are once within his

because he can vse you so

rather wish to be in bondage with

So that yee are warelie to shun his

            <p>It was trulie said of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
that none is hurt but of himselfe;
no man hath so dangerous a foe,

            <p>In the beginning cuerie disease

They which gouerne the state are

They are to be diligent to

when a matter is knowen of them

they shal run into the displeasure

            <p>The Magistrates hart must be as

scope, &amp; seeke not to redresse it in

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6073:49"/>
we must needs saie the Magistrate
is a cause of such misbehauior.
Sixe score yeeres before the floud,
the world did so exceede in volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes
and pleasure, as if the
Lord had left to take the charge of
men: but whilest they liued so at
pleasure &amp; ease, their arrainement
was preparing in heauen; &amp; when
their sinne was ripe, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
iudgement against those
wicked liuers; rained from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
&amp; made a general submersion
of the whole worlde. I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
think, but that the wrath
of God hanges ouer vs, and that
our arrainment is alredie drawen:
we lacke but our iudgment, which
can pronounce nothing but death
and damnation, the sinnes of al
men are so greeuous.</p>
            <p>If we would consider the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of our life, which with the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6073:50"/>
of an hande maie be cut off,
we could not be so careles of our
selues. But the pleasures of this
life so beguile vs, &amp; drawe vs from
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of our estate, that
we are vtterlie vnmindful of our
duties, and forgetful of God, and
his worde. But let vs not thinke
that God in sparing vs of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
doth giue libertie for to sinne;
as though we might do wickedlie
because we are vnpunished. Oh let
vs not delaie our amendment til
he smite, but rather with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
Niniuites aduisedlie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
his iudgements: otherwise,
when we shal saie like reprobates,

            </p>
            <p>Alas that we should so vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surablie folowe those vanities,
which God condemneth. Those
pleasures of the stage, what are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6073:50"/>
they, but the drifts of Satan, which
he vseth to blind our eies withal,
the more easilie to carie vs from
the obedience of GOD! Such
knacks from time to time he hath
set vp, and men haue willinglie fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that which they haue liked
of, and which the pleasure of the
flesh hath drawen them vnto. Yea
now adaies we see manie that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
seeke after those vaine delights,
counting no time wel spent, but
that they consume in beholding
of gaudes.</p>
            <p>And albe these pastimes were
not (as they are) to be condemned
simplie of their owne nature: yet
because they are so abused they
are abhominable. For the foole no
sooner showeth himselfe in his

straight-waie lightlie there folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
some vanitie, not onlie super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,

but beastlie and wicked.</p>
            <p>Yet are we so caried awaie with
his vnseemelie gesture, and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend

            <p>No zelous hart but must needs

            <p>Alas,<note place="margin">An admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to Magistrats.</note> that youth should become

they are vtterlie shameles, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,

            <p>It was wel said of Caluine, that
a man setled in euil, wil make but

We neede not voluntarilie seeke

For it is no meanes to acquite vs

            <p>It is maruelous to consider how

            <p>The wilines &amp; craft of the stage

And if he finde her inclining to

            <p>The nature of their Comedies

            <p>The reuerend word of God, &amp;
histories of the Bible set forth on

For that they exhibite vnder

So that their auditorie maie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

none comes awaie reformed in

            <p>The writers of our time are so

their onlie endeuor is to pleasure

than to profit them with good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample.
The notablest lier is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the best Poet; he that can
make the most notorious lie, and
disguise falshood in such sort, that
he maie passe vnperceaued, is held
the best writer. For the strangest
Comedie brings greatest delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and pleasure. Our nature is
led awaie with vanitie, which the
auctor perceauing frames himself
with nouelties and strange trifles
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6073:59"/>
to content the vaine humors of
his rude auditors, faining coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
neuer heard of; monsters and
prodigious creatures that are not:
as of the Arimaspie, of the Grips,
the Pigmeies, the Cranes, &amp; other
such notorious lies. And if they
write of histories that are knowen,
as the life of <hi>Pompeie;</hi> the martial
affaires of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
they giue them a newe face,
and turne them out like counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feites
to showe themselues on the

of him,<note place="margin">Writers of these daies.</note> who likened the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

our Historians haue now sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from them, being by practise
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6073:60"/>
become as cunning as the Tailor
to set a new vpper bodie to an old

            <p>So that yee shal find in al their

but by reason that thing which is
good is applied vnto il purpose, &amp;
mixed with euil, the good hath
changed propertie, and is become
of the nature of the bad. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
goodnes &amp; badnes, being two
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries, cannot be made to agree
together. And therefore there can
be no difference of choice, but al
must be euil: because it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
il applied, and by altering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie,
hath changed his nature.
Yet neuertheles that it keepeth his
virtue, of being good, and reduced

I do not denie, but that writers
inal their workes maie be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
so far forth as they be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and swarue not from hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and therein deserue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
But what praise maie they
deserue who set forth those works
which are vaine and naught, and
conteine in them no matter of
good example, who write of those
things, which may corrupt the life
of men, thereby making them
worse by ten to one, than they
were before they heard them?</p>
            <p>What doe they leaue behind
them? monumentes of wanton
wicked life, and doting things for
men of these latter daies. O Lord,
how do those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wanton wordes of
theirs intice vnto wicked life, and
with a poisoned baite allure men
to sinne! Their wanton speeches
do pearse our secret thoughts, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6073:61"/>
moue vs thereby vnto mischiefe,
and prouoke our members to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes.</p>
            <p>But some perhaps wil saie,<note place="margin">An Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> The

cunning heads.</p>
            <p>Cunning heads, whose wits are
neuer wel exercised, but in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of such exploits! But are those
things to be suffered and praised,<note place="margin">Answere.</note>
because they please the rich, and
content the Noble man, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
liues in ease? not so. A two

than <hi>Socrates,</hi> whome <hi>Phoebus</hi> for

Those goodlie persons, if they be
voide of virtue, maie wel be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
like faire clothes ouer a foule
wal; big bladers ful of wind, yet of
no waight. Where wealth is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
pleasure is present: pleasure
bringeth folie into estimation; and

            <p>Who writeth for reward,<note place="margin">Writers for reward.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
regardeth virtue, nor truth;
but runs vnto falshood, because he
flattereth for commoditie. Neede
and flatterie are two brothers, and

they were both scholers vnto <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stippus,</hi>
and learned both of them
to applie themselues to the time,
&amp; their matter to the disposition?
No maruel then though none can

The rich that followeth the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

what do they teach them, I praie

            <p>And as for those stagers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,<note place="margin">Disposition of plaiers for the most part.</note>
are they not commonlie
such kind of men in their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,

their talke on the stage declare the
nature of their disposition? doth
not euerie one take that part which
is proper to his kind? doth not the
Plough-mans tong walke of his
plough; the Sea-faring man of his
mast, cable, and saile; the Soldier
of his harnes, speare, and shield; &amp;
bawdie mates of bawdie matters?
Aske them, if in their laieng out
of their partes, they choose not
those partes which is most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their inclination, and that
they can best discharge? And looke
what euerie of them doth most
delight in, that he can best handle
to the contentment of others. If it
be a roisting, bawdie, and lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

himselfe in his part? &amp; by so much
it is pleasing to his disposition and
nature? If (it be his nature) to be a
bawdie plaier, and he delight in
such filthie &amp; cursed actions, shal
we not thinke him in his life to be
more disordered, and to abhor
virtue?</p>
            <p>But they perhaps wil saie,<note place="margin">An Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that
such abuses as are handled on the

are warned to beware of such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,

            <p>In deed if their auctoritie were
greater than the wordes of the

force than of the preacher, I might
easilie be persuaded to thinke, that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6073:64"/>
men by them might be called vnto
good life. But when I see the word
of truth proceeding from the hart,
and vttered by the mouth of the
reuerend preachers, to be receaued
of the most part into the eare, and
but of a fewe rooted in the hart: I
cannot by anie means beleeue that
the wordes proceeding from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
plaier, and vttered in scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sort, interlaced with filthie,
lewde, &amp; vngodlie speeches, haue
greater force to mooue men vnto

vttered by the godlie Preacher,
whose zeale is such as that of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">Exo. 32, 32</note>
who was contented to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
out of the booke of life;<note place="margin">Rom. 9, 3.</note> and of

be a better instruction to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6073:64"/>
do not plaiers, I beseech you, leaue

But which of them is so

in those pointes, which, as

of? Are they not notoriouslie
knowen to be those men in their

So that they are alwaies exercised

            <p>What shal I saie?<note place="margin">Plaiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> They are

albe there was libertie enough to

            <p>In the primatiue Church they

first that in disguised plaiers
giuen ouer to al sortes of disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutenes,
is not found so much as
a wil to do good, seing they care

Secondlie, that is not a good
meanes to correct sinne. For that
if it be secret, it ought not to be
reuealed openlie, but by such
meanes to be reformed as Christ
himselfe alloweth in his Gospel.
<hi>If,</hi>

betweene thee and him alone; if
he heare thee, thou hast wonne thy

               <note place="margin">Matth. 18, verse. 16.</note>
               <hi>take yet with thee one or two, that

               <hi>And if he wil not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to heare them, tel it vnto the
Church:</hi> (which is, to those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

which were appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

            </p>
            <p>You see then that euerie fault
being priuatelie knowen is to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6073:66"/>
kept secret, and not to be openlie
vttered to the defamation of the
offender. And that on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
if it be a matter openlie
knowen, it is to be put to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the Magistrate,
and not of the plaier, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
is as vnreuerend, and

            <p>The antiquitie of plaieng is<note place="margin">An obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6073:67"/>
which are contrarie to
the Scriptures. Those spectacles
were vsed of the Gentils to the
setting vp of idolatrie, and to the
honor of their false gods: as
<hi>Pesa</hi> and <hi>Elis.</hi> Such games were
exercised in the honor of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
worshipped on the hil <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.

games in the honor of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune.</hi>
There were also <hi>Pythij

            <p>Notwithstanding, these are
not examples vnto Christians to

allowe that for good, which was
sufferable among them. For
then one might slaie another;
one might wound another; then
should we encounter with wild

delight in shedding bloud; and
be al giltie of the death of the
